October 2023,Five Star plus experience !,"My wife and I celebrated our 40 th wedding anniversary here . Without a doubt this is the best Shangri  La I have stayed in . Over the years we have been to the Sydney.  Tokyo , Colombo , Hong Kong , Hambantota and Istanbul hotels and this is the best . The facilities are excellent , rooms very comfortable but the approach taken by the staff is the main differentiator . Their approach is that everything is feasible and they will do anything they can to make your stay memorable  . In particular Yannick the reception manager was incredible . Thank you ."
October 2023,Superb!,"My husband surprised me with celebrating our first anniversary in the Shard!  This was a lovely surprise as I never expected it! The stay was amazing and convenient as it is literary on top of London Bridge station. From the moment you enter with a welcoming drink to settling in the room… everything was absolutely amazing!  My husband and I also loved their A La carte breakfast menu and we truly enjoyed our breakfast with a superb view in the morning (we were lucky the weather was gorgeous to allow us appreciate the view).  The only tiny issue I had at our stay, is when we were out almost for over 6 hours during the day and when we got back the room wasn’t made… We called room service who efficiently sent someone to make the room and it was sorted within forty minutes.  All in…"
October 2023,Luxury location - luxury prices,"A luxurious way to spend a weekend in London, if you try to avoid looking at the price! We came here for our first anniversary and were up-sold to a corner room with an amazing view of the city. While I was hoping that they were looking to upgrade us due to the celebration (they instead charged me an extra £100 per night!) I will admit that the room was brilliant. Spacious, modern, but mainly the sweeping panoramic views to die for.  Breakfast was again expensive but high quality. You’ll be looking at £42 per person for the buffet, with an a la carte option with your typical selection of breakfast offerings. We didn’t eat for dinner while we stayed.  The location is excellent as it is situated directly above London Bridge station - you’ll be able to see most central London…"
October 2023,Best experience ,Lovely place with me of the best views. Took my girlfriend for her birthday and she enjoyed very bit of it. Food was amazing and to top it Jamila gave us such amazing service. It was a night to remember. 
October 2023,SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!,"Outstanding service from Mathias and team. Food was delicious and the views from our window booth were breathtaking! Beetroot salad for starters, short rib, five spice beef with veggie sides. This was the best anniversary dinner we have ever had, topped off by Mathias with a surprise selection of chocolates presented on a plate of liquid nitrogen- simply magic! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
October 2023,Spectacular,"We stayed for one night at this amazing hotel for a special surprise for my birthday from my husband and from the moment we stepped through the ground floor doors we were made to feel like royalty!! We were early as we had just arrived from another hotel after seeing Madonna and we were able to drop our bags and fill out all the necessary paperwork before our room was ready, we were greeted by two absolutely lovely lady receptionists who were so friendly and super efficient, they promised to text when the room was ready … which they did!!   Upon getting to our room, after an afternoon of exploring, I was completely blown away! Putting the card in the slot, up came the blinds snd my … what a view!!!! We were on floor 49 with a bath with a view and it did not disappoint at all! …"

Noodles has a fantastic taste and finally desert: chocolate mandarin mousses take me to paradise. So that’s an Amazing atmosphere and experience "
October 2023,The best afternoon tea in London,Just left the beautiful Ting restaurant where myself and my sister enjoyed a stunning afternoon tea served by the lovely Mathias. I feel this venue is actually probably better than other famous afternoon tea locations in London. We were made to feel like royalty from the moment we stepped through the door and not rushed to leave. The food was incredible and we were full to the brim!!!
October 2023,"Perfection in Sky. We had the pleasure of staying here for 2 nights, which we will remember forever. Thank you","We had the pleasure of staying here for 2 nights, from the minute you arrive through to departure absolutely everything is taken care of by an outstanding team. Nothing is too much trouble, the food in all the restaurants is very special, a special thanks to Jamila in Gong, and outstanding lady, and of course Tyrone who could not have been more helpful. This is in my opinion is the standard all 5 Star hotels in London should strive to achieve. Can’t wait to return. Thank you all."
October 2023,First class service at a first class location with brilliant staff,"A friend and I went for a celebratory birthday drink at the Sky Lounge on Saturday 28th October. It was an unforgettable experience and we were treated like royalty. José, Simona and Giorgio were incredible hosts and really made the occasion so special and a birthday I will never forget.

It felt so decadent, a truly wonderful experience with delicacies that just melted in the mouth. Jenny was impeccable and attentive along with the rest of the team that made this experience truly one to remember, and the Shard shaped chocolate with it's dramatic serve over dry ice was so much fun! Absolutely worth every penny! "
October 2023,Cloud 9,"We had the most wonderful stay at Shangri-La after our wedding. We arrived just in time to enjoy the sunsetting. Right from the start the team went out of their way to make our stay a joy, keeping check in short so we could watch London come alive with evening lights.   As you enter, the blinds rise and you are met with the most incredible view of the river and the City. The team are so sweet that they chalk a welcome greeting onto the window to help to make the stay even more memorable   We were spoiled with roses, champagne, chocolates and macaron. Everyone who helped us could not have been more charming, friendly or warm.   We enjoyed all the fantastic facilities that the hotel boasts, especially the swimming pool.   Thank you so much for an unforgettable experience. We loved…"
June 2023,Amaze ,"Amaze  Loved the food and the view and the champagne was pretty amaze too! Service was second to none, and the food was fabulous x.   Would highly recommend for a treat but a little on the expensive side for everyday m, or unless you’re totally loaded 🤣"
October 2023,Amazing brunch with the SkyLounge team,"Wow! It’s our 2nd time & we celebrated our daughter’s bday with a nice brunch.

October 2023,"A must do experience, stunning views","A must do experience. I have been up the shard twice now. It’s definitely worth the visit, stunning views over London. We visited the hotel restaurant, the drinks are very expensive so be warned! But it’s more about the priviledge of the views you get over London. Would recommend."
October 2023,Dated and tired,"The rooms are incredibly tired and dated.... it needs a total overhaul to call it a 5 star... at the moment I'd rather stay in a holiday Inn.  Rooms don't give that ""lux hotel room"" feel... more like an office... Ware on parts of the room need changing untill they are totally re-fitted... a real shame"
October 2023,"Super afternoon with family - thank you,  Yassin","Had a brilliant afternoon here today with my wife and 2 children aged 8&12. The service from Yassin was flawless.  We struggled to get pictures of ourselves with the beautiful backdrop,  but Yassin helped us by going above and beyond and recommending the best spot and also taking our picture.  Will definitely be back,  thank you!!"
October 2023,That View. That Service. But…,"For the price, it fell short in so many ways. The doors are scratched (I mean shredded) the bath rug was frayed, the bed skirt was torn, the mattress pad was not attached on three of the corners, the window had writing on it from a previous guest, the window coverings could not be operated individually (that we could find) so instead of our neighbor having a clear view into our room and them into ours, we had to close that entire wall of window shades instead of just the one that would have shielded us. There was tape on the walls left over from maybe a decoration? The metal finishing on doors/walls was severely scratched, the binoculars had a nice cheat sheet to show you what you were looking at, but that little booklet was old and frayed and dog-eared and overused. There were…"
October 2023,don’t ever miss this place if you come to London!,"Great view and the food was superB 🫶🏻🫶🏻 love everything in here!

August 2023,Possibly the Best Hotel Service in London,"The service of Shangri-La The Shard is second to none in London.  Right from the porters, concierge, guest relations officers to front desk, every staff serves you from the heart.  And it’s no lip service.  They all do their works efficiently and in a most helpful manner.   To be frank, they help me find my lost wallet with passport in it.  We would not forget how conscientious, proactive and thoughtful they were in taking care of every aspect during the situation.  Among them, we wish to particularly thank from our hearts Bassam, Iewa, Leah and Mariana, who have done everything for us - checking the driveway and entrance and the Uber driver, providing us with all useful info and speaking all the calm words before we found the wallet.  They took the matter in their hearts and…"
August 2023,Amazing,"Amazing views, atmosphere, food and service. We had the 5 course tasting menu and it was fantastic! Would definitely recommend for a special treat. Thought it was good value for money and the staff were wonderful "

August 2023,Afternoon Tea at Ting,"Absolutely wonderful service. Our server was Elvis and he helped us on choosing our tea. He was very polite and welcoming. Ambiance was good, lighting was good and we were seated near the windows overlooking the city. Other staff were nice as well. I would go back to have tea again at Ting. "
August 2023,Ting experience,Came for anniversary with family. Great service. Ana was excellent. Kids have severe food allergies. Ana and the kitchen were very thoughtful and careful. We also got a complimentary dessert for our celebration.  Good food. Pricey but worth the view

August 2023,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Truly Amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"We had a one night stay in a interconnecting city view family room (4004 & 4005) to celebrate my daughters 10th birthday.   From check in with Crystal to check out with Ian our stay was truly exceptional. I think I can happily say that Shangri la London was the best hotel we’ve ever stayed at.   Our rooms were stunning, fantastic views and well appointed. And the bathtub with a view in one of the rooms was a fantastic surprise.   My daughter was truly spoilt by the hotel for her birthday with cakes, soft toys, a balloon, card & birthday message. She said she didn’t want to go home.   The valet team were also excellent and very kindly took my electric car off to be charged so we could head straight home upon check out.   We all felt truly spoilt during our stay and felt like…"
July 2023,Breakfast with a view,"A warm welcome and breakfast with a view. Served today by Syed with utmost care and a very good service on the start of my day. Thank you. Preferred to be seated on a more quieter area. I have been to other Shangri-La restaurants, which served far better selection of food and variety. Too expensive for the limited amount of food on the buffet. "
August 2023,Gong - Saturday night,"Went to Gong for drinks and food with two friends on a Saturday night l. Excellent service, ambience and music. Mira our waitress was wonderful and so were Davide and Matteius at the bar who gave us each a free shot!"
August 2023,Calm and relaxing.,"Amazing. Greeted out the front and given directions, greeted up stairs by Viola who helped to direct me to my friends who were already here. Lovely smile and very welcoming. JoJo came and poured our champagne and he was so lovely and smiley too. All the staff were great helping with wine options and snack options. "
August 2023,Fantastic experience ,"It was my birthday and Jannette from kitchen took us to the sky lounge. The staff were so attentive and welcoming Voila, JoJo and Simone were such fantastic hosts. Thank you for such a wonderful experience "

The experience from the staff was welcoming & just made our experience so memorable!! Thank you so much. Will come again for another dining experience.
May 2023,Wonderfull experience ,"Kyriakos did an excellent job on recommending cocktails and sushi appetizers from the menu. He was on top checking on us all the time and he gave us a table with a great view. Also the bar has a great atmosphere, view and ambience. Professionalism and great customer service. Will definitely visit again!"
October 2023,Hotel stay review,"Wonderful view as all have mentioned but the hotel needs some repairs.  The faux leather doors to the hotel rooms are so worn, it looks terrible.  The water pressure in the bathroom is low so it’s takes forever to fill the tub.  The pool area is tiny and jammed with people.  The workout area is small as well.  The room sizes are wonderful though. Overall it was a wonderful stay but the hotel and clientele feel very Michael Kors vs. Dior!"
August 2023,Afternoon Tea at Ting,I had afternoon tea at Ting and Dave was phenomenal! He was attentive and went above and beyond to give the full experience. The food was delicious (and there was more than expected!) Plus the views were incredible! 
August 2023,A wonderful evening with excellent table service.,"A wonderful evening with incredible views of glorious London! The food at Ting was delicious, and the service was impeccable; Mathias, our waiter, went over and beyond to make sure our evening was a success. He was attentive, smart, professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and had a charming demeanour about him. An excellent example of high-class service. Gracias/Merci/Thank you, Mathias! "
August 2023,Great day out ,Me and my mum come  for afternoon tea and couldn’t be more pleased with our experience. Our waitress  Jenny was very nice and made sure our experience was magnificent. Thank you very much Jenny. We will be back soon 
August 2023,"Beautiful hotel but I felt that it was rather impersonal  and 'corporate'. I am all for understated luxury, but, something felt ","Great location. Wonderful building. The location on the higher floors of the Shard means that the views are spectacular, particularly those with the City aspect. Entry level room was rather 'safe' in terms of decor- you could be anywhere. Also I didn't get a feel of luxury- this is a 5 star hotel. All very understated. Great nights sleep- bed was very comfortable and lovely bed linen.   Bathroom was great and shower wonderful. Fluffy towels! Bars and restaurants offer a range of international dishes. Good service levels. Overall I was a little underwhelmed with this stay- obviously top end pricing . They need to go the extra mile for this, and I felt this wasn't achieved on this visit. "
October 2023,Afternoon Tea @Ting,"I had afternoon tea @ TING and it was a 10/10 experience for me.  First, the view- duh! The food was good and the service was great! Jenny helped me and she was a delight. Very helpful w/my tea choices and just an overall lovely lady who assisted me. It’s totally worth the price tag, especially if you’re celebrating something special. "
October 2023,Amazing pink afternoon tea!,"The most amazing pink afternoon tea experience for breast cancer awareness month! Dinil looked after us and was the best! Clearly described all the food to us, his tea recommendations were all spot on as well and he was great company and so attentive. We loved the view, were treated to almost every season the UK has to offer in one afternoon and even better that the pink afternoon tea benefits charity! Thank you Renate and all your team x"
October 2023,Great location accompanied by great service. ,We had some lovely drinks this evening served by Mathias. We didn’t have a reservation but the team found us a cosy spot anyway. Mathias was thoughtful and attentive for us. The drinks were really enjoyable and we would happily come back again.
October 2023,Consistently good,"Another fantastic few days at the Shangri La. This time, we stayed for 6 days and enjoyed - just like on past stays - great service, omnipresent views, and slept in a meticulously tidy and serviced room.   Special thanks to the sky pool staff and jenny and carlos at breakfast!"
September 2023,Highly recommended for special occasions ,"A truly memorable experience and highly recommended for special occasions. We were looked after very well by Yassin, who only started at the Ting Restaurant a few weeks ago. The food and service were excellent. The views of London from our table were magical."
September 2023,A fantastic experience,What an experience! Went for champagne afternoon tea for a birthday. The quality was amazing but the service fro Helga was second to none. Attentive knowledgeable and provided excellent recommendations. Can't wait to return 
September 2023,Great food with a skyline view ,It was a great experience our server jenny and Emilio was great food tasted amazing with view. Definitely I recommend to visit here.  If you wanna have a great view of London skyline   5 star food  5 star service  5 star ambience  
September 2023,Only the view lived up to expectations….,"My parents booked to stay to celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary. Having stayed at Shangri-las around the world, they expected a luxurious and special experience. Sadly, it failed to deliver with the exception of the view of the river (which on arrival cost an extra £50).  Despite the hotel not being that old, the room showed signs of wear and use. However, it was spotlessly clean and well designed. The view was incredible from the 44th floor and the binoculars helped!   The hotel were aware they were celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary and had left a bite size piece of cake with ‘Happy anniversary’ - this was the greatest disappointment. Having stayed at Shangri-las (and other eminent hotels) for lesser occasions, we expected some recognition in-line with its…"
August 2023,Dave is amazing!,Dave really took care of us and we felt special and well fed @ting!! So attentive he also got us some complimentary macaroons for my husband’s birthday!   Fantastic experience definitely recommend it!

August 2023,Top place to go in London,"The amazing night started with the nicest reception ever, with a instagramable decor. The staff at the entry of the hotel were super welcoming just as the security staff. When we got to the restaurant we got surprised with the spectacular view of London, specially the Tower Bridge, it looked like a painting.  The restaurant staff welcomed us with an amazing champagne. Now the food…. Simply the best that I had for a long time, for starters we had the scallops and the shrimp rolls. I don’t even have words to describe how delicious it was. Then the main courses, Salmon and the lobster bun super balanced taste and size. We also had the 5 spices beef, and for me was my favorite because the beef just melted in every single bite.   The restaurant staff was so caring with us, always…"

August 2023,"Ting Restaurant, Shangri La, The Shard - great views, amazing food and attentive staff!","As a gift I was given a Virgin Experience voucher for a 3 course meal at the Ting Restaurant at Shangri La, The Shard. We booked for Wednesday 23rd August at 6pm. You have 15 minute time slots between 530pm and 630pm. I went along with one of my friends who had never been to The Shard before and we both used it as a celebration for our birthdays. From the moment we got into the building we were greeted by a lady at the desk who said we could sit on the sofa in the Reception area, which had a beautiful cloud background with butterflies and hot air balloons and beautiful oversized flowers while we waited for our booking time as we had arrived early. This gave us a chance for some lovely photos while we waited which she offered to take of us both.  When our table was ready, she…"

The panoramic views offered from the venue are absolutely breathtaking and add to the overall serene ambiance. Each bite of the food was a testament to culinary excellence - fresh, flavorful, and elegantly presented. Special mention to Jing, whose attentive service ensured our afternoon was seamless and enjoyable. To top it all, the live music in the background was the cherry on top, enhancing the atmosphere and making our visit truly memorable. Highly recommend for those seeking a splendid afternoon experience! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

July 2023,Beautiful food,Our waiter Dave was fantastic and attentive he waited while we took photos before he served the first course. Only note was that wine ordered at the beginning came out later than expected from another server. 
July 2023,4 night stay in an iconic London landmark!!,"Room is large, has a great view of London and bathroom is stunning. The hotel itself and the public areas however, did not feel as luxurious as expected. The entrance at street level feels like an airport hotel with queues for lifts  which always seemed packed. The lobby had a similar feel and does not feel particularly welcoming or exclusive.  Staff do not seem that friendly apart from the porters. You are paying to stay in a landmark, which is a lovely experience, but it means crowds in the bars etc so you loose the feeling of coming back to a warm hospitable retreat at the end of the day. We feel there are better hotels in London in this price range. It takes more than the building to create that feeling of exclusive 5 star hospitality."
July 2023,Wife’s Birthday at TING,"We came her for my wife’s birthday and Dave provided an excellent service. From the moment we sat down to even service of the meal, he went above and beyond to enjoy we were comfortable and had an amazing time. He was also understanding in going out of his way to ensure we had a great window view, we made all the birthday extra experience. Thanks Dave and highly recommend the venue "
July 2023,Brilliant Dinner,Amazing service by Syed. He helped us with choosing our delicious food. He made the evening really pleasant and gave us a window seat when it became available with the amazing views. Once again thank you for your great service and will be seeing you very soon

July 2023,Birthday party,"We enjoyed my son’s birthday around the pool. First class everything, the building, the decor, the staff and the refreshments. The absolute no.1 venue. Thanks so much for a wonderful time shared with family and friends. "
July 2023,Amazing from start to finish!,"Last week, I was fortunate enough to celebrate a friend's birthday at the Shangri-la hotel, and all I can say is wow! From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of amazing. Not only was the service impeccable, but the drinks were fantastic and the views were breathtaking. I was pleasantly surprised to have met Kurt, the hotel manager, who clearly takes great pride in ensuring each and every guest has the absolute best experience possible. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable experience. Trust me, you won't regret it!"

August 2023,Spectacular,"We are devotees of The Savoy but my husband was very keen to try Shangri-La for his 40th birthday. It does not disappoint. Staff went out of their way to make the occasion special and there were some lovely little gestures left. It is a spectacular place with breathtaking views. The infinity pool is especially worth a visit. The only thing I would ask is that they get their billing right- as a a Circle Member, I did not want to have to highlight what we had included upon checkout. They did very promptly sort it though. Fab. Throughly recommended."
August 2023,A special and luxurious treat,"We visited Ting at The Shard for dinner and arrived right at 5:30 when it opened. We were given a window table and while the the views were spectacular (the main event, really), the service was equally superb.  Dave was our server and he was responsive, helpful and kind. He seemed to anticipate all of our needs and was always at the table right away.  He even managed to make a “grown up dinner” accessible to our 8 year old by highlighting the Top your Own Sundae option, with fruit and chocolate, which, of course, we had to get.  In short, while this was certainly a splurge, it seemed a worthwhile and luxurious way to spend a celebratory evening in London. I would highly recommend to those seeking a special treat."
July 2023,An iconic evening at an iconic hotel,"I struggle to explain with words how simply amazing this hotel and the facilities are, each time I visit it feels like the first again, discovering new views and exploring what the hotel has to offer. Having previously stayed at this hotel and multiple Shangri-La hotels and being blown away by the service, attention to detail and luxury of the hotels, I couldn’t wait to return - this time I returned for a friends birthday celebrations. On returning I instantly felt at home, with the addition of the super friendly, helpful staff being on hand. With the pool being the party location, the views were, as always, unmatched, the drinks were extraordinary and the atmosphere was unrivalled, all expertly created by the wonderful staff at the hotel. Another fantastic night hosted by the…"

She had great recommendations and was such a pleasure to my family and I. The food, cocktails and views were also amazing! The Gong is a must go!"
September 2023,Great stay with an amazing view,"Spent a night at the Shanghai-la Shard in Premier City View room for our anniversary. The hotel is impressive but lacks the grandeur of its 5 star London peers. Unsurprisingly its USP is the view, for which you pay handsomely. The service was great throughout and that really is a plus point across every staff member we encountered.   We ate lunch, dinner and breakfast in Ting (in that order). The five course tasting menu for dinner was good but nothing special. Three out of the five courses were pre-prepared and felt a bit mass produced but the fish and beef courses were excellent. Overall as the main restaurant I thought the hotel could do a lot more to make Ting more atmospheric at night, it’s too bright and lacking atmosphere, all a bit generic and felt like a classic hotel…"
September 2023,"Afternoon team at Ting, The Shard London ","Great experience today enjoying afternoon team at Ting, The Shard in London.

August 2023,Gong bar honeymoon ,"Not only is the scenery beautiful and the food delicious, but what's even better is having two excellent bartenders, KYRIAKOS and DAVIDE.

I can honestly say what a wonderful experience we had from start to Finnish, the right team do make a hotel rise or fall.

October 2023,Great experience ,"Beautiful hotel, in ultimately a bad location for West End activities as takes almost an hour in heavy traffic to get there by cab and changes of stations by subway That said the Hotel itself while showy lacks the refinement and substance of many of it's peers. The staff is solicitous but many are badly undertrained and it shows everywhere from housekeeping, to Breakfast, Tings dinner, concierge and reception. Also the Hotels charging policy is extremely irritating in many ways. One example is the Pounds 20 water in room that the housekeeping takes and replaces when half full do as to charge again.Also who charges 20 pounds for water at a 1000 pounds per night Hotel? Bottom line, if one wants the view, fine. Everything else, better choices exist."
November 2023,My husband's 28th Birthday,It has been an amazing experience dining at Ting. They made our visit extra special by accommodating my request to make it extraordinary for my husband's 28th birthday. Raul our waiter was very engaging throughout our 3-course meal. Alex the supervisor was very professional too. The food was outstanding. It reminded us so much of our asian roots and we couldn't be anymore grateful. Really love the team and the food! Highly recommended for a splendid dining experience! 
October 2023,Where to Start,"The Shangri-La London was our last stop on a fabulous 8-week trip for two Aussies seeing the sights and staying in some beautiful places in UK, Scotland & Ireland.  And the Shangri-La The Shard certainly came in tops.  I was slightly apprehensive that with the calibre of the Shangri-La it might be somewhat pretentious.  These thoughts were soon dismissed on arrival. We were greeted by Angelo at the entrance and sped directly to the 35th floor for check-in.  We stayed 5-nights in a Premier Shard Suite on the 42nd floor with of course, stunning views of London.  And the Veuve Clicquot bubbly in the suite was a welcome surprise.  Every night we enjoyed pre-dinner drinks in The Gong (which takes the views of London to an even higher level.  The Staff make the place of course, and…"
November 2023,Not a 5-star experience,"Booked for 4 people, 2 adults, 2 children, as a special occasion (birthday).  There were no beds for the kids in the room when we arrived. We had to call and request two additional beds.  Nothing in the room was catered for 4 people: 2 bath towels only, 2 sets of slippers, 2 bottles of water, etc... . A lot of items in the room/hotel are worn out or damaged. Most of the doors are extremely damaged; it doesn't seem like the staff takes any care.

We asked the concierge to call us 30mn prior to the booking, to confirm whether the request would be met. No one called us. I called the concierge 10 minutes before the reservation time…"

August 2023,"It actually worths 4 stars, the one star taken away is its price","Located in one of the most iconic sites in London, the Shard, The Shangri-la The Shard, London has always been one of the hotels on my bucket list if I ever have a chance to travel to the city.  Now that I have emigrated to the UK and before I have secured a place to rent, I would definitely jump at this opportunity, but does it live up to its hype as one of the most iconic hotels in London, and more important, has it got the wow factor to justify its lofty price even for London five star hotel’s standard?  Well, sadly, if you are expecting something as bling bling style as the iconic structure of the Shard, you would probably be disappointed, as once you have pass through the very James Bond like security bag search, the place would not be mistaken as another Shangri-la…"

July 2023,"Greta hotel, terrible booking experience.","An amazing hotel, but I booked this stay as a birthday present for my daughter and despite being clear that I wanted to pay for everything in advance, it took several messages before they managed to accommodate this. To top it all off, I also preauthorised an amount on my credit card which they have not fully refunded and are still trying to locate in order to pay me the balance back. Some of the worst, most shambolic booking service that I have ever experienced from a hotel."

The building is outstanding, the room was well appointed and with a beautiful view.   The staff we encountered was a little stand-offish but quite efficient.   One of the evenings we had dinner at Ting; the food was lovely and so was the wine we picked and the service was just top notch.   We also had a drink at the Sky Lounge which had amazing views and the staff there was less stand-offish and more friendly.   A lovely experience indeed, so won't hesitate to stay there again. "

June 2023,Unforgettable Experience at The Shard Top Bar thanks to Sarah,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  I recently had the opportunity to visit the Top Bar at The Shard, and it was nothing short of extraordinary. To start with, the place was bustling with energy and yet, we were welcomed warmly by a lady named Sarah at the entrance. Despite the bar being exceptionally busy and us not having a reservation, Sarah went out of her way to find us a spot. Her professionalism, attentiveness, and willingness to accommodate truly set the tone for our evening.  The panoramic view from the Top Bar was breathtaking - a sight that you can't find anywhere else. It was like having London's iconic skyline on a canvas, and we were lucky enough to be a part of that picture. It’s the kind of view that leaves you staring in awe and creates memories that last a lifetime.  As for the service, it…"

He made sure we understood the menu, and took fully care of us so we enjoyed the tea time with no worries at all! Love it! "
July 2023,Sky High,"The views from the room were magnificent.  The rooms were spacious and clean, with very comfortable beds.  I thought check-in was a bit weak in that it took a while to be ready, and once it was finally ready, our bags weren't in them.  The room keys malfunctioned numerous times over the course of three days (I would estimate that we went through a total of 18 different room keys.)  It was an expensive stay, but the bellinis in reception were a nice touch.  "

May 2023,Special Treat and few days in London,"Fantastic hotel, real treat to stay here. Amazing views of the river and across London.   We had two adjoining rooms with kids in one room and even they enjoyed the views!!  As one would expect fantastic service as always from Shangri-La!   Top floor restaurant was a little underwhelming, perhaps as view from room was better.   Pool beautiful but could only take a handful of people and had to book for kids to attend."

July 2023,Lovely Hotel and people but fundamental issue needs looking into,"Let me first off start by saying that The hotel attentiveness and attention to detail is unrivalled. I booked a celebration in the cloud experience which was truly delightful. The timing for the delivery of the champagne was brilliant, The message on the window and decorations all had my girlfriend very happy. Now, the stay was lovely. We had a deluxe city view which was great. (I'd say always opt for a city view) if possible. I've also stayed In a Premier city view room before. The difference being, the Premier room has and extra side window for additional lighting / views and a bit more space overall. The food at ting for the 5 course taster meal really nice. The breakfast buffet was absolutely brilliant. The spa and pool was also nice - just ensure you make a booking during…"

July 2023,Nice experience,"Syed was the best  Highly recommended place for afternoon tea; you get what you pay. But the excellent service provided by Syed highly put the place apart from other options.  When you come here, please ask for a table manage by Syed"
July 2023,Disappointing ,"Overall was disappointed. It started with our hotel arranged pick up being an hour late because of a flat tire.    I booked this hotel with virtuoso which was supposed to give us extra amenities.  I think we did get an upgrade.   The hotel was located near tower of London and London bridge station.  Near the Burroughs market.   But expect to wait a long time for Ubers as the street is one way and apparently Uber drivers avoid the hotel.   I booked 2 connecting suites for a family of 5.   The bed, and bathrooms were nice.   The carpet felt outdated even though the hotel is not that old.  This can all be overlooked but unfortunately the attitude at this so called 5 star hotel is always ""no we can't , sorry!"".   Every request was either ignored or the answer was no.   I asked…"
July 2023,Good view. Poor hotel.,"Our go to hotel in London is the Soho Hotel in, not surprisingly, Soho. It is beautiful. Great staff. Relaxed service. Beautiful and tasteful rooms.   But we wanted a change, so why not go to the Shangri-La Shard Hotel? Allegedly one of the top hotels in the world, according to Forbes last year.   I suggest they go to SoecSavers, because they can’t be looking hard.   And, at over £800 per night for our stay, the price suggests a top hotel.   The best bits? The view. The cocktail were great in Gong  bar. And……..  And nothing.   The less good bits. The hotel looks knackered. Have attached a picture of one door - it wasn’t the worst. It looked as though someone had been hammering on it. There was a chink of wallpaper out from above our bed. Room 4011 if you’re reading, Shangro-La.…"
July 2023,"Awesome rooms, amazing service too!",Ting is great! We stayed at the hotel and went for drinks to enjoy the sunset. Syed was  awesome and super kind- we were very fortunate to be seated in his section.  I could also see that he was great to all his tables. Highly recommend the  sunset in Maldives cocktail 
July 2023,Service was outstanding,I recommend the hotel for its view and facilities. The staff were outstandingly helpful especially Gabriel in guest services and Hasan.

July 2023,Extravagant & Extraordinary,"I had the (free) privilege of staying at the Shangri-La for 2 nights back in September 2022 - all thanks to a dear family member of mine.  I stayed in (if I remember correctly) one of the Superior King rooms. Lovely room with fantastic blue carpets, massive bed with the TV directly opposite, behind it was the lovely view of London. The view spread around the whole room due to it being almost all glass! Brilliant!  There is an indoor pool which unfortunately I didn't get to try out - no fault of the hotel, I just didn't have the time. I imagine it's fantastic. The gym also looked well equipped.   Breakfast also didn't disappoint! I enjoyed the Wye Smoked Salmon with a lovely black coffee.  Honestly, everything was perfect. It's a shame I didn't have a lot of time to get the full…"

May 2023,Wow service!,"Went for dinner for a special occasion and for the stunning view and we found as well amazing food and service! Mary the hostess that took us to our table was so kind and lovely! Our waitress Sara looked after us very well, recommending amazing dishes and entertaining us during the dinner and as well Emil, who served us our drinks. Last but not least, Giulia the sommelier found the perfect wine for our food! I can’t wait to be back to enjoy another great night!  I highly recommended and can’t wait to be back! The whole team make us feel welcome, they were very friendly and polite. Thank you again!"
May 2023,Fantastic experience,We stayed here on our wedding night and the staff really couldn’t do enough for us - they went above and beyond to make our stay special.

May 2023,Great service at the Gōng Bar,"Excellent service by Anbu at the Gōng bar, very nice experience. The food was tasty and the drinks of course are great too. They were accommodating in getting us and other guests a window view. A must-do experience for anyone visiting London. "
May 2023,Lovely service,"Lovely service from Anbu and Antonino, both so friendly and helpful. The views were also really good, we sat at a window seat. Also very grateful we got in a last minute reservation as they were booked out tonight. Make sure to book in advance "
May 2023,Gong Bar,"I booked the Gong lounge bar, as a last minute date night. I was very impressed, and a bit disappointed that I hadn’t been here before. Ultimately the best views of London by far. I was greeted by a lovely lady in red (Sucheta). She tried her upmost to immediately accommodate us by a window seat. Unfortunately there wasn’t any available at the time. Later on in the evening a few couples departed, and Sucheta had us upgraded to a corner aspect view of London. This was breathtaking. My wife so impressed. We ordered 2 snack dishes to nibble on, they were decent. The drinks were nice too. The waiters were all very polite, and not pushy at all. Overall this was a great experience. I will also be visiting the Oblix and Aqua Shard soon!"
April 2023,Welcoming and professional. I felt at home. Thank you.,"I was at the launch of a book, #Fab collab nearby waiting for a friend.  Roxana and Otabek at Bar 31 where very welcoming and helpful. I had a great time choosing the right wine...between a French and a Spanish. I chose the French. It had more body. "
May 2023,Experience gone well thanks to Anbu,"We came here to celebrate our friend’s birthday and Anbu Theo Mada gave us the best time! Not only he accommodated us with a window table, but he also recommended really good cocktails and offered us complimentary shots to celebrate. The setting is also amazing and the staff is remarkable. "
May 2023,Perfect special occasion dinner,We went for dinner at Ting & whilst not cheap we felt the 5 course whimsical menu was excellent value for money in combination with the setting. Lovely range of dishes using seasonal British ingredients with an oriental twist. Service was outstanding from Dave & the team - friendly & great attention to detail without being pushy. Interesting wine list including a great Chinese rose! 
June 2023,Experience ,Went to celebrate my birthday it was Amazingl celebrated my birthday  staff called ting and anaa were very helpful and nice 💯 recommended and the window table view was worth it and as food but dessert was my favourite

King, Emilio and Renate were very attentive and made sure we enjoyed our experience at Ting. The food was excellent and tea menu made it hard to choose but the staff assist in these selections. I wish I could’ve tasted all the teas."
June 2023,Mom & Daughter Outting,"Jing, Renate, and Emilio are an amazing team.  We had spectacular service along with an amazing view.  Above all the food was delicious and filling!  The seats were very comfortable as well.  Highly recommend for a great experience! "

June 2023,A nice dinner with friends x,"An exceptionally well located restaurant with lovely staff. I want to specifically thank Daue, who helped us with all our questions! The dessert was especially nice, a nice touch of spice and chocolate."
October 2022,Five Star Afternoon Tea,"Spent a wonderful relaxing afternoon with family celebrating my sister’s 60th Birthday. The afternoon tea was delicious, the staff particularly Jenny were warm, welcoming and couldn’t do enough for us. It was truly a memorable occasion.   The views from The Shard were stunning and the high tech toilets added to the sense of comfort!   5 Stars all the way! Thank you so much."
March 2023,"Nice hotel, great location. Great views of London but really overpriced.","Have wanted to stay in this hotel for ages saved it for my wife’s 40th birthday and we made a night of it booking dinner at the romantic table in the restaurant which came out an extra cost but was worth it for the views. Have to say the food wasn’t great, and we expected more, especially for the price Hotel rooms great views all over London which were spectacular, the spa is also nice on the 52nd floor but you have to book and they ask you to get changed in your room and walk past a busy restaurant in a robe which wasn’t good but overall nice but the cost really wasn’t worth it for the overall stay  We stayed in many hotels around the world, this one’s lovely, but just really overpriced We spent over £1300 for 1 night with dinner and a bottle of wine which is outrageous  Lucky…"
June 2023,Gong bar,"Went to Gong bar for drinks with a friend to celebrate a new job. Had a wonderful time there with excellent drink recommendations and chat from Jamie and Daniel! Hope to be back again soon, thanks guys!"
May 2023,Fabulous Lunch with views at Ting,Great views of London. First visit to The Shard restaurant Ting and won’t be the last.  We enjoyed a fabulous three course lunch and drinks with delightful exceptional service from Mathios. Who made our day a very memorable one.  So thank you to Mathios 
May 2023,Tea at the Shangri-la ,"We had the Afternoon Tea at the Shangri-la. The service and the views are excellent. Mathias was great, he was attentive and polite. We enjoyed their ffod with the tea, and they had a large selection of teas so that anyone would be able to find something"
May 2023,Lovely!,"Hi! I want to give a balanced honest review: I loved my stay!   The Pros:  The staff at the hotel are amazing. You can tell they are highly trained and are basically experts in hospitality. They do their best to remember any issues/orders/allergies you may have. It’s lovely to see people just shining in their jobs they way they do. They address you by name, try to be discrete. They’re excellent.  The rooms are lovely, large, spotless and of course the views (you already know). They surprise you throughout your stay with high quality snacks and chocolate. 😍 Pampered.  Breakfast buffet was amazing. High quality produce served. High quality dishes served with a lovely range.   Beautiful pool area.  A few things that can be improved on: The internet 😭 I think this might be because…"
May 2023,"Great View, Service and Food",The food was marvellous along with the service. Our server was Sara who was delightful. She was very helpful in all fields and made our night a total success. Sofija and Zoran were also extremely helpful. The fillet was wonderfully cooked
May 2023,Review of Ting ~ The Shard,I went here for the first time and was extremely delighted by three individuals but one in particular. Sara was absolutely spectacular number one with the knowledge of the menu and hospitality. Sofija & Zoran were awesome too! Special thanks to Sara. 
May 2023,Unethical behaviour tainted our experience ,"The standard of the rooms (amazing view), spa, food and service would have been such an easy 5 star review, had it not been for some frankly greedy and unethical behaviour on the part of the hotel in our final bill. On checkout, we spotted a £40 service charge for the room and 5% service charge for breakfast had been added.  Given that we had not had any room service, adding a charge essentially for cleaning the room on top of the biggest nightly room rate we have ever paid is IMO outrageous. Add on the 5% service charge for a buffet breakfast ( surely I should be the benefactor here!!!!) then I’m sure you can see how disappointed we were. We have travelled all over the world and stayed in some pretty good hotels but have never seen these sort of charges applied. We were…"
May 2023,Birthday Meal,We had a lovely meal at Ting restaurant for my boyfriends 21st birthday. I purchased this deal off of virgin experience days and I can’t say I’m disappointed! Jenny in particular was very attentive and provided a great service. Will definitely recommend!
May 2023,all about the views - nothing else makes this hotel special,"This hotel dines out on it being located within one of London's most iconic buildings - the views from our room (Premium City View Room) were breath taking and single-handedly made our stay special. Unfortunately that's where my enthusiasm for the hotel ends.   I booked a night at the hotel as a surprise for my husband to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. I notified the hotel of this special occasion prior to arrival and they did NOTHING to acknowledge this. Instead they sent me a list of very expensive add-ons I could purchase to mark the occasion. I wasn't expecting a free bottle of champagne or anything of the sort but I was expecting the receptionist to perhaps acknowledge it on arrival, a personalised note left in the room or even a small cake / confectionary to be…"
May 2023,YI Room,We used the private dining room for a business event. Tanveer and Junior could not do enough for us to ensure our event ran smoothly and to plan. Very attentive and ensured everyone’s drinks were topped up at all times. We have another event planned and hope these guys are on duty again.
December 2022,Enjoyable journey,"A place must visit. Really nice staff, environment, restaurant, dining experience. Although this was my first time visit London, it gave me home away home experience. We will definitely stay again this hotel and recommend to my friends and family"
May 2023,Delicious dinner with an incredible view!,Wonderful experience with out family of four (teens included) celebrating our trip to London with amazing views of the city!  Syed was kind and attentive.  He brought a special dessert out for our son’s birthday.  Definitely recommend! 
June 2023,Totally Incompetent Management,After a previous disaster we decided to give this Hotel a second chance ???  It’s worse we are still waiting after one hour at 3 pm to gain access to a very expensive suite and things have got worse  The Front of House Manager is incompetent and clearly lost  Never ever again a very poor reflection on a great Brand  Ian Kinga Lily
June 2023,"Breakfast At Ting, Amazing ","The Shangri La, London as always was superb. From Concierge to reception to Ting, everybody greeted us, smiled at us and spoke with us. The hotel looked lovely and smelt lovely with essence of Shangri La. We had a nice table by the window with outstanding London views and superb service throughout from Elvis who was on hand for everything we needed. The breakfast buffet was amazing with everything you could want for. The whole experience was great and looking forward o returning very soon. Thank you to everyone at Shangri La London. "
June 2023,Birthdays in the clouds,"Dave was very accommodating and attentive, the scene was otherworldly and the food delicious…couldn’t of had it better. Providing a blissful break from his A level revision we celebrated my son’s 18th birthday shared with my daughter’s 21st, with heads in the cloud it provided a serene evening from busy daily reality so all I can say is thank you…really."
May 2023,The best of London!,This is an amazing hotel. The architecture and design are amazing. Best of all — the staff are as welcoming and friendly as you could imagine. Just a great hotel!!! The service is great. The restaurants and bars are extraordinary. Can’t rate more highly.

May 2023,Best Dinner In London,Dinner was great. I had the pork and jasmine rice. Best pork ever had and the portions were perfect. The dessert options were great as well and the chocolate did not taste sugary. Super dining experience led by Syed at Ting.
May 2023,Beautiful sunset at the shard,Great food and great service! Everything was delicious and the view was phenomenal. Our waiter Dave was very welcoming and attentive. I highly recommend the shard and i have no complaints about the service. Will be coming back the next time I visit London. 
May 2023,Superb Spring of Love Afternoon Tea,"It has been a while since our last visit and this time we brought our two young sons. The Shard is a special place for my wife and I, as I proposed to her there.   We had a great table at the window and staff were amazing from the moment we walked in. The finger sandwiches were delicious and the  small deserts and pastries were small pieces of art. The views from the 35th floor never bores me and our oldest son loved watching the trains go by down at London Bridge Station. Our oldest son had fish and chips as a children’s menu and it honestly was one of the best fish and chips I tasted. The batter of the cod was nothing less than crispy perfection.   The selection of teas on offer were superb and we were encouraged to try as much of them as possible. Especially the masala tea…"
May 2023,Memorable Birthday Experience,"I celebrated my golden birthday here after my partner surprised me with reservations, and it was a truly memorable experience! We had a beautiful view of Tower Bridge. Our server Dave was especially kind and attentive."
May 2023,Great food and great service ,"We went for my husband’s birthday. Greatest experience. The food was scrumptious, the service by Syed was great. He was very attentive and kind. The ambience was very pleasant.  We will definitely visit again. "
May 2023,Delicious dinner and drinks,Dining here was incredible and Amy organised it beautifully. The whole experience was absolutely amazing from start to finish. As soon as we walked through the doors everyone was so  welcoming  and friendly. The food was spectacular and there was a variety of plant based options. The atmosphere Amy created with her interactions with everyone made  it feel so comfortable and at ease. The cocktails were delicious and the bartender was great with a super sense of humour. An overall 10/10 what a fantastic birthday experience thank you so much. 
May 2023,Ting Restaurant was amazing. Sara was a wonderful hostess,"Sara was a wonderful waitress/server. Very attentive and friendly. Sava was a great bartender, thoroughly enjoyed our drinks. The bloody orange cocktail was delicious. I would highly recommend, the Malaysian rice dish was amazing"
May 2023,World class experience,"I've been fortunate enough to stay in quite a few nice hotels and after a while you start to get a feel for what a 5* experience actually is, regardless of how many stars they claim to have. Shangri-La Shard can certainly walk the walk. (My only criticism is that the door to our room and a few others had a sort of leather covering, which is peeling, but that didn't diminish our experience once inside the room.)  So what made it so good? The views. The views. The views. Most of the walls -- as you'd expect -- are glass and we enjoyed the most spectacular sunset. On to the bathroom: good bathroom products (L'Occitane!), perfect placement of the bath for that wow factor -- panoramic views of London while you soak --  and even the toilet! It always warm and it even washes your…"
April 2023,Hues of Culture !!,"We went with my family to have some drinks, we tried the new menu that was launched today and recommandation from the bartenders Kyriakos and Dani were the best! We had an amazing night, plus the service from Anbu was making the night even more enjoyable ! Funny and unforgettable experience ! Thank you so much Gong Team !"
May 2023,Nice view but overall disappointing,Rooms below par cleanliness  Overall finish of rooms not great and starting to look tired  Told we had breakfast then upon  arrival refused which was embarrassing  Overall not the experience we were expecting and will be looking to stay elsewhere in future in our return to London 
May 2023,*PLEASE READ* Hotel amazing - but be CAREFUL with what you get charged for,"I had a fantastic stay - hotel is amazing, staff very friendly, hotel itself is high quality as you would expect for a hotel of this calibre and price. However, how this hotel handles your money is very poor - I highly recommend you are very cautious and keep a close eye on transactions. I paid the full room rate on check in of over £1700 with a debit card. First issue - they add on a 5% service charge, so the amount you are told when booking, make sure you add on 5% which they don't tell you about (I was quoted £1620 and got charged £1701). Secondly, they tried putting a pre-authorisation of £400 on top when I checked in. I disputed this, eventually they agreed not to - but they completely emptied the mini bar before we were allowed in the room...As if I am going to steal a…"
May 2023,Lovely dining experience at The Shard,"My friend and I enjoyed the excellent atmosphere, food, drinks, and service at Ting Bar & Restaurant! Many thanks to Jing, Marco, Giannis, and Syed for making our first dinner at The Shard such a lovely experience!  "
May 2023,Excellent service and food!,"Excellent food. Excellent service. We was very good raken care of by the staff. We are from Norway and this is quality food, quality staff and special Thanks you Jing Giannis and Marco for serving us. The dessert was absolutely amazing. We will come back here!"
May 2023,Food was AMAZING! Views were the cherry on top,"Food and drink were AMAZING! Views were the cherry on top. I had the rose spritz and the Vietnamese sea bass presented in a lotus leaf. It was ridiculously tasty!   We were pleasantly surprised with a window seat on a Wednesday evening. Jing, Marco, Syed, and Giannis made the visit special. Thank you for such incredible service!"
May 2023,Absolutely fantastic ,"Amazing seabass dinner and mango coconut dessert. Lovely service and great talking with Jing, Giannis, Marco. Best view in London also from the same building as the shard. Absolutely recommend this restaurant for all travelers who want to get the best experience possible."
May 2023,Anniversary night,"Well what can I say, this place certainly didn't disappoint.from the moment we pulled up in a car, to the ease of check in, the friendliness and accommodating staff to the most exquisite room I've ever stayed in. The decor around the whole establishment was fantastic, the room itself was out of this world with  stunning views. The bed was mahoosive, I thought I'd lost my wife in it when I woke up and couldn't see her. The automatic blinds are a great touch and nake you feel you're staying somewhere special. The bath in the bathroom is first class, and the views you get whilst sitting in it are stunning. The heated automatic toilet is something else. The only gripe I have about the room is that the windows on the outside of the structure needed a good clean in places as the dirt…"
May 2023,Awesome experience ... thank you,"The view was stunning... we enjoyed the 5 course menu which was exceptionnel, the service was excellent. Thank you Syed for the excellent and attentive service. We were very glad for this experience. We'd love to come back."
April 2023,Surprise for my Wife,"I booked this as a surprise for my Wife and have to say it was worth every penny. We stayed for 2 nights on level 45 overlooking St Pauls Cathedral from the bedroom. The customer service in this hotel is excellent, from the moment we checked in nothing was too much trouble. We were made to feel special and that's rare these days even in so called 5 star hotels. The room was immaculate and we were fortunate to have a bath by the window. Would highly recommend requesting this even if it costs extra. Yes this hotel is expensive but its a unique experience and one that will never be forgotten. Will we return? Definitely. One of the finest hotels in the world without doubt. "
May 2023,Amazing afternoon tea!,"Dinil, Manuel, & Mathias were wonderful & we had a fantastic time dining for an afternoon tea! The food was amazing & service was impeccable. I would highly recommend coming here for a casual afternoon or celebration with loved ones. "
May 2023,A special experience,"What a great experience the food was fantastic just the right size so could eat all three courses , the pawn main was fantastic and the staff made it feel special especially Asure who looked after us attending to all our needs topped my up the champagne!!"
May 2023,Great!,The hotel with its height offers a fantastic view of London. Great service (we were served by „Elvis“) and and excellent breakfast (good choice of everything). All employees are extremely friendly. The interior is very pleasant and the decoration with flowers is beautiful. Cool!
May 2023,A dinner to remember,"I went in this restaurant with my girlfriend on  15th of May. We started our dinner with beef tataki then followed by the black pepper beef and the Japanese A5 wagyu sirloin.   The beef tataki was a good plate to share and get our appetite going. The black pepper beef had a nice beefy flavor and was properly cooked along with the rest ingredients of the plate, furthermore the quantity of this plate will definitely make you full! About the A5 wagyu, it was my first time trying and I couldn't have guessed the palate sensation one can feel while eating this masterpiece. It felt like tiny pockets of delicious fat were bursting while chewing this extra tender meat, in a way that you wish the bite never ends! It is definitely worth its price, the experience was like no other.  Lastly,…"
May 2023,Wow,"We booked to stay for 2-nights to celebrate a birthday and experience the Shangri-La.  From the time we arrived to when we checked out we were looked after.   Our room on the 49th floor was very comfortable, had everything that you need for a stay in London.  The bathroom was huge.  The view? Oh that was amazing.  It’s completely bonkers but I have to mention the infinity pool on the 52nd floor. Yes a pool 52 floors up together with a gym and sauna. The lounge area is very nice. NB you will need to book to go to the pool.   All the staff were helpful and all went the extra mile. Example we were having breakfast, I went to help myself to some of the fantastic fruit. While I was away from my table my plate and cutlery was taken away. When I returned I had not realised that my…"
May 2023,Top of the Shard restaurant.,Jaime  was super friendly made the best cocktails.   He made sure we were having a great time. The view was fantastic from the 52nd floor.  We had the sushi rolls and edamame topped off with signature cocktails. 
May 2023,Lovely service,Lovely service from Dave. Great views and music . We had the 5 course menu and every course was lovely. Would come back again and would recommend. The cocktails were also lovely and the live band really set the scene 
May 2023,"in a word, perfection. A must try if you’re in London ☺️","Highly Recommend - 5 stars! Everything served was not only on point but the experience as a whole made it worth the visit. Excellent service, the entire team was truly incredible, the cocktails were a work of art compliments to the mixology team. Also Sarah our host for the night  - she made the experience truly special with her witty sense of humor and her cheerful personality. Incredibly knowledgeable and attentive. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a one of a kind dinner experience with one of the best views in the city! ❤️ also a very special thank you to our reservation host, we were a large group and they graciously accommodated us upon arrival-  we had a reservation but last minute we had to adjust the group size. Will definitely return the next time we are in…"
May 2023,An elevated experience worth every penny.,The absolute best black pepper beef I've ever had. There was not a single miss on the table.

The view only added to the entire experience.

May 2023,Wedding anniversary visit,"I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary at this hotel and I cannot speak highly enough of the staff and services provided. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and genuine care from the front desk team who kindly congratulated us on our special occasion. Me and my partner would wholeheartedly recommend this establishment as it's got a very good location with great views of London Landmarks. Can't fault anything. Comfortable beds and having breakfast served directly in your room was the top of our experience. ❤️❤️❤️"

May 2023,Shard London,"The hotel itself needs a bit of TLC, but was a lovely stay. We stayed in room 5007 which had great views and a super comfy bed. We enjoyed dinner at Ting with lovely views of Tower Bridge. Food was tasty and served timeously.  The pool was lovely. Gong Bar was very vibey and had an enjoyable experience there too. Breakfast at Ting was good, however took 30 min to receive our order and then mine was cold. Great coffee though which hotels often struggle with. "
May 2023,TING - THE SHARD,"I went to Ting this May and everything exceeded my expectations. There was enough food and it was very tasty. The staff was very friendly and comforting, especially Syed who accommodated all our needs. I clearly reccomend Ting for a full London experience."

May 2023,Spectacular Sky high Afternoon Tea.,"What classy and relaxing sky night Afternoon Tea!!! Spring Love themed - it really was quite magical. The staff were keen to make us feel welcome and special with the little details like a chocolate Happy Birthday label on the cake stand for my son’s 18th, to the “smoking” chocolate mini Shard on our table (visual and delicious). It was truly enjoyed after a few miles of a sunny walk along the South Bank and just what we needed before going to the theatre to see Phantom of the Opera."
May 2023,Wonderful birthday treat for me,Andrea Syed really looked after us well. We had a brilliant afternoon tea and enjoyed the wonderful views. At first we had a table at the rear but after some people had left and a front line table became available he moved us across. That was a real treat as was the whole experience.  Many thanks I will visit again

September 2022,"Great building, useless staff.","The room was beautiful, clean and quiet. Bartenders in the lounge were top notch. Aside from that, service left a lot to be desired. My wife and I were there to celebrate her birthday and our 20th anniversary.  I've been staying at 5 star hotels for 35 years and even when there's no special occasion you're greeted with chocolates, fruit, champagne or at least a welcome letter.  We got nothing. They pride themselves on making people's stay special and I may as well have been in town for a conference. Desk staff seemed as though it was their first day- no help in getting a car to the airport for example.  The biggest gaffe was when we headed to dinner one night- our driver was delayed due to the crazy traffic because of the cue for the Queen's memorial viewing. My phone was having…"

May 2023,A memorable night indeed,We chose to stay a night at the Shangri-La on a weekend stop in london from florida after spending the night at the Dorchester Hotel.   What can we say? Of course the service is beyond refined and impeccable at the Dorchester but what was a stand out to us was Amy who worked at the front desk of the Shangri-La. She welcomed us. Showed us around and went above and beyond to make it a special stay and a step above the rest!! All of the staff were great and the timing of anything we asked for was right on point. Great fun friendly atmosphere by hard working people is well noted and appreciated.   But we want to make a special mention of Amy who showed genuine personal interest from the start. One thing my husband and I have learnt in recent years is that genuine personal interest…

The service has gone slightly downhill since they opened, but it’s still much better than most places in the UK. We did have to wait 45 mins for a scone when our room wasn’t ready to check in to. But the staff took it off the bill so we honestly didn’t mind. Also had to wait 2.5 hours for room service to bring us some tea bags one night.   And the vegan food at Ting is still pretty dismal (not really sure why it never improves. Just for a comparison we went to the Savoy for afternoon tea and wow was the vegan food amazing!).

We had an absolute ball & the hotel truly did take my breath away!   My friend had previously dealt with Ellen Pormann & contacted her again regarding our stay for the three of us. Ellen ensured we had a fantastic room with everything we needed & I am so very grateful for that.   What can I say about the breakfast?! The wow factor was high & there was something for everyone. I am not a big eater but ifs safe to say my plate was well & truly cleared.   Decor in the hotel was just stunning, no expense spared and lots of guests were just standing in awe at the easter displays, very sweet.

The beds were a whole new level of comfortable, you could feel the most luxurious linen & mattress as soon as you lay down.   We were lucky enough to have a room with a freestanding bathtub, and it was such a magical feature. It goes without saying the views were breathtaking!   We went to the pool for a while in the afternoon & had a lovely chilled out session…"

Leo, Cristian, Rozario, and Andrei were so helpful. The Valets were so friendly and quick to assist.

We booked the deluxe city view room which was worth it just for the bathroom, it had a free-standing bathtub with 360 views of the city. The room was well-equipped and spotlessly clean, I would 100% recommend the in-room dining. We opted for breakfast and it made the experience even more special. The menu was great and also had lots of gluten-free options (they can switch out most ingredients to accommodate and even had gluten-free bread).

Out of the opposite corner window we could see Big Ben and The Houses of Parliament, brilliant.  Would like to thank Leah for all of her help in sorting out the birthday message written on the window and looking after us at check in. The birthday cake and card were a lovely surprise in the room.  The room itself was fantastic and the views were outstanding. Because of the time of year and looking East the sun rises were incredible and had us jumping out of bed taking photographs at 7.00am. If you stay here you must book a slot in the…"
February 2023,Thank you EglanTino!,"Had a great time at The Ting for afternoon tea, service from Eglantino was amazing! He looked after us each moment of the afternoon and the food was divine. I would definitely go back,  maybe for dinner next time. As long as Eglantino is serving me! 🙏🏼"
February 2023,Outstanding service,Amazing experience. Vincent was the perfect host. Knowledgable and friendly. Great banter. I would recommend this champagne afternoon tea experience. Thank you Vincent and compliments to the incredible chefs. 
February 2023,Excellent,"Genuinely great experience from start to finish. Staff are very professional, warm and open without being overfriendly. Very efficient.  Food was excellent, great portions, balanced flavours.  Special credit to our server Jenny for the brilliant service, really made a special day that much better"
February 2023,Wonderful experience thanks to our waiter Antonino,"the place is beyond beautiful, the view is unmatched in London. Great cocktails and top tier service, Antonino and Mira where amazing. We ordered 3 cocktails and despite the amount of people present the wait was pretty quick."
March 2022,Excellent views!,"We’ve stayed in the Shard several times and it’s always great though does seem to have lost that ‘luxury’ feel.   It feels a little like the hotel has accepted it’s given place of a ‘novelty stay’ rather than a luxurious destination hotel which is how it felt when we’ve stayed in previous years. For instance why there is now a dehumidifier in the room is beyond me…   The staff are great, food is excellent and of course the views of London are simply amazing!"
March 2022,Wonderful Stay.,"Overnight stay to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The stay was in Feb 22 and the hotel was clearly short-staffed.  A few mistakes were made, but the staff worked really hard to make things right. Fantastic views (obviously!), immaculate room/facilities and helpful staff.  The only shortfall was the breakfast - a buffet ‘bun-fight’ with cold/missing food.  In all fairness, staffing levels may have increased since our stay and the breakfast offering may have improved.  A superb venue for a birthday treat and the views from the pool will be remembered for a long time!"
February 2023,One of a kind experience,Outstanding live entertainment by The New Classics band performing all our favourite songs. Nathaniel and Dinil our hosts were very attentive to our needs and our special requirements. The afternoon tea was made up of savoury sandwiches and sweet cakes and scones. Large selection of unlimited teas and coffee. Ambience and atmosphere was 10/10 and the views of London were incomparable.

February 2023,Excellent stay - superb service,"I stayed at the Shangri-La hotel at the Shard the weekend of the 10th of February, a really awesome experience. The views are incredible (as perhaps expected) although occasionally disconcerting.  The service for me was perhaps the pinnacle. I couldn't have asked for better, from the moment we were checked in, to seeing staff around the hotel who always stopped to say hello and the very responsive team when calling. Honestly, this is a great credit to the place and I thoroughly recommend on this alone. Leah who checked me in was excellent.  I highly recommend this place as treat to stay. We were lucky enough to book the pool for when the sun was setting, watching the lights come on over London.  We had a room overlooking the South, I have to say I thought this view was…"

The staff on the day were lovely.  Looking out over London was stunning, and when the lights started to go on after sunset it was magical.   A wedding to remember for the rest of our days.   "

A couple of weeks before our arrival I booked a meal (which was part of our package for one night) at Ting, and advised it was our anniversary.

January 2023,Celebrated Chinese new year at TING in Shangri-la London,"Well I didn't celebrate the last 2 Chinese new years but I must say I'm having a really good one this year because of the food & the service of TING is top notch!  The senior Supervisor Jing she was super friendly soon as I stepped in I already felt very welcome by her ☺️ She & another staff Vanessa both are very nice & attentive not only delivering great service, they also are excellent caring towards my food allergies too! I ordered the cod it was so tasty & the dessert was delish. I guess I don't even need to mention the view is without a doubt a selling point.  But the great service is the best thing that wins me over 😉 So I'm very happy with TING & defo will come back again for afternoon tea or other dishes."

It was a truly enjoyable and memorable experience, with a fabulous view to boot. We would happily recommend! "
January 2023,Room with a view topped with pinch of service with a excellence at Ting,"Hotel room was amazing and a lovely view! Topped off by a 5 course dining menu from Ting restaurant on the 35th floor.  In particular what made the evening special (besides the fact it was a birthday) was the service we received from the head waiter Eglantino, he could not of been any nicer. Explaining each course, and checking in on us, all while showing Oltion a nee waiter the ropes, he also served us and was lovely!  Eglantino even went out of his way to move us from our table for our last course and to a table with a view of the infamous London skyline at night. He offered to take pictures of our evening and even bought out a birthday selection of macaroons and chocolates. Literally THE nicest guy at the restaurant! If you ever go to Ting for Dinner maybe find out if…"
January 2023,Wonderful ,Great service and food . Nice view over Londons Tower Bridge and Skyline . Restaurant has lovely interior. We would always come back to the TĪNG restaurant. Prices are ok for the value received. Great experience overall 
December 2022,Excellent Christmas Stay,"I treated my daughter to three nights here over Christmas. We managed to park in the street almost outside due to the Bank Holidays! We had a lovely room looking west up river towards St Paul’s. It was particularly nice because no trains were running. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, which was good, though the toaster didn’t work despite reporting it. The Sky Lounge was amazing, but it was a shame that you couldn’t visit either of the bars without pre-booking. Beware the service charge added to every drink as well as your stay. Unfortunately housekeeping forgot to service our room on Boxing Day so at 5pm we had to ask for it to be done. Overall it was a great experience and we’d love to return."
January 2023,Afternoon Tea at Ting,"Lovely food, atmosphere and a view to boot.  Elvis and Alex attended to us exceptionally well.  We had the afternoon tea set, which had a wide selection of tea with accompanying good selection of sandwiches and cakes. Definitely recommend to try it"
January 2023,"Perfect service, dining and rooms","Stayed for just over a week on business as a Jade member and received fantastic service, room and breakfast. The room was upgraded to a Seaview corner room with a beautiful angle on the City and Tower Bridge, and I was able to enjoy some fireworks for CNY! Service was perfect throughout, at check-in through to dining and check-out. The spa and swimming pool were so well designed and managed, and loved the views. Breakfast is a highlight, so many healthy options throughout and  really enjoyed the hot dishes a la carte too. The staff rotated me throughout the views each day which was a nice touch. Thank you so much!"
January 2023,amazing service,"ate here for my birthday and the service was so amazing.  the food was so delicious and i was served by two waiters, eglantino and oltion and they really made my birthday so amazing and special. will definitely be coming back to dine here again.

January 2023,Memorable Dinner at Ting,"It's our first time in London and we decided to have dinner at Ting in The Shard. The overall experience was good. Jenny, our waitress, was very friendly and thoughtful. We enjoyed the dessert and the view."
January 2023,Absolutely nice dinner with stunning view of London,A fancy restaurant with delicious food for celebrations. Had a great dinner with my parents who were new to the country. Especially a shoutout for Eglantino who provided excellent service during the meal. We enjoyed our Chinese New Year Eve dinner at TING.
January 2023,10/10 would recommend,Had a lovely anniversary at Ting. Service was amazing as well as the food and the view of London. Would recommend coming early for window seats. Thank you Emilio and Nathaniel for the amazing service.
January 2023,Graduation Tea,Had amazing food and service after my graduation at  @ShngriLaLondon. The sandwiches were very tasty and the desserts were out of this world. The Shard dessert was a sweet gift. Syed was a lovely waiter who took care of all our needs. Thank you!
January 2023,"Great food, great view, great service","Delicious food with brilliant view. We were served by Elvis, he was very helpful and welcoming and made sure we were well attended. The tea selection was amazing and we got to try many favourites and new teas. Would definitely come back! "

January 2023,Brilliant birthday meal with a view,"What a fantastic meal! Food was exceptional and service was second to none. Jing our waitress went the extra mile. It was my wife's birthday, she bought out extra treats for us and made us feel special. Highly recommend Ting restaurant."
January 2023,They will rinse you for every penny - but we did really enjoy our stay (but would not stay again),"Stayed for one night in a premier room at The Shard for my wifes 50th birthday.  Price for one night was £820.   What can I say, amazing service, room was spotless and the views were amazing, we ate in Oblix East (set menu) and the food was great.   I would have given the place 5 stars, but we felt by the end of our visit, that we were a bit stung, financially. £820 for a room, but no complimentary breakfast - we had to pay an extra £42 pp for breakfast which we turned down. We paid £60 for 4 glasses of wine (small ones 125mm) which was ridiculous. The set menu in Oblix east with a few small extras was supposed to be £70pp but we ended up us paying nearly £250 for three courses with a few more glasses of wine and some cocktails! WATCH OUT!!!!!!  When we checked in, we were also…"
January 2023,Tea at Ting is the best!,"The most exceptional tea experience! Jing provided the best service!! This was our first afternoon tea. From the tea, to sandwiches, dessert, and champagne, not a detail was missed. The stunning view from the skies looking upon London also didn’t disappoint!"
January 2023,Business Dinner,"Enjoyed a private dinner in the Yi room. The vegetarian food was superb, hats off to the chef who produced three amazing courses. Others who were present also enjoyed their non-veg choices. The service was great throughout. A most enjoyable meal topped off with great city scape views."
January 2023,"Gorgeous hotel and views, shame about the food.","Gorgeous hotel with amazing views, with a small but peaceful spa. Rooms were lovely, very comfortable bed and gorgeous views of the city. However, we dined at TING restaurant but we definitely would not return. 90% of the duck we ordered was fatty and the pancakes were all stuck together and ripping when we tried to open them. For that reason we felt the food was definitely overpriced. We had a very nice, polite waiter called Eglantino and we were very happy with his service. Just a shame about the food."
January 2023,Amazing view terrible service,"The overall experience feels let down by the outdated and unclean furniture, very uninterested team members and over all lack of a 5 star experience however prices at that level.  The view is beyond outstanding but feels like they use this to  justify the level of prices."
January 2023,Great experience,"Went for an afternoon tea, food was lovely. Service was excellent. Vince was brilliant, very patient with our questions and requests. Had a brilliant afternoon with my friends. Would definitely visit again."
January 2023,"Amazing afternoon tea, thank you Jing for excellent service",My sister and I had an amazing time at ShangriLaLondon. We got the afternoon tea with excellent service from Jing and the other waiters. I would definitely recommend it for everyone I know. And an amazing view.
January 2023,Perfect day for showing some love !,"Amazing service as always! Food and the theme was so wonderful. My third time back and they are as wonderful as ever, we had the great pleasure to have Jing as our hostess! She was absolutely wonderful and very attentive. Made a great experience even better.   Thank you Jing ! And thank you Shangri La The ShardTíng !"
January 2023,Very High Tea - stunning views and very good service,"I took my sister to High Tea at Ting for her birthday, it was fabulous! Stunning view, lovely food (the sandwiches were very tasty and fresh; the cake in the shape of the Shard was soft and light) and s fantastic selection of teas! Our waiter Elvis was very friendly and professional. Highly recommend!"
January 2023,Expect charges beyond the premium room rate !,"How many service charges can 1 hotel add ?    £35 service charge at dinner ….£35 service charge for the room & a further £70.35 charge pending on my credit card - I presume another service charge - no email, no confirmation so no idea as yet what other luxury I’m paying for!    In all, after paying such a premium price for 1 night I wouldn’t stay again.     Yes the view from the room was fantastic & the room was as good as you get - unfortunately the weekend we went the pool and spa were closed for maintenance so we didn’t get to enjoy that.    "
January 2023,5 star service,"Jenny best server hands down, beautiful service and wonderful experience for the five of us very homey vibe once in a lifetime experience due to visit again sooner rather than later thank you for everyone who helped"

January 2023,Just the right vibe!,"By far the most impressive bar in London!   After 8 years living in the city, I visited this place and was amazed by the view, the atmosphere and the insane coctails! Panos, Kyriakos and Dani gave us A level experience and brought back to our memory how London hospitality used to be pre-covid!!   Thank you very much guys! You are just the best!"
January 2023,St Paul’s and a sachet of milk,"Really amazing experience. Views out to St Paul’s incredible. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom, plenty of toiletries. A truly memorable experience.   The only thing that let it down was the absence of fresh milk. If you’re paying I’m excess of £600 for a night or luxury, it’s tainted by the inclusion of a plastic pot of long life milk."
January 2023,AMAZING,"Amazing experience! Daniel at the bar gave as an exceptional experience, which we won't forget!  Some differnet coctail tasting, nice chat about the coctails and personal care really did gave us a feeling about being appriciated. Thank you very much! "

December 2022,"Amazing service, delicious food and unforgettable memories!","The TING Restaurant helped us to create a memory we will never forget. After having an outstanding dinner with an amazing view over London we enjoyed our evening to the fullest.   But what really made this visit unforgettable, was the amazing work of Cam, Esmail, Denil and of course Mary. I asked them to help me out proposing to my girlfiend (now fiancé, yay!) and what they arranged within minutes was just incredible. Due to some lucky coincidences we were seated at the best table in the restaurant where they already prepared everything.   Both the food and the service in this restaurant were so excellent, there is no doubt we will book a table again as soon as we are back in London. Again, we want to thank the whole team for making this evening so special. ♥"

The drinks were experimental and flavorful, a true delight! Exceptional flavors all around. The service from Jing was absolutely lovely, and was a pleasure to practice our mandarin! Elvis gave us some beautiful life advice while providing attentive and all-round excellent service. Emanuele, the sommelier was extremely knowledgable and recommended the perfect wine to complement all of our different dishes.  Not to mention, the atmosphere was perfect!

Even gave us a little tour of the restaurant. So far this will have to be one of my top experiences in London. Highly recommend 😄"

She also helped us to choose teas suitable for each part of the tea service. It was an absolute delight thanks to Helga from Romania. Big thanks to Helga who gave us the best table and made sure we had a delightful afternoon right up to the end of her shift where she informed us who would help us next."

We had 5-star hotel reservations in London, Brussels, and Prague, but this hotel was the absolute best of any hotel during this trip. The hotel, itself, is gorgeous and the staff are all super friendly and helpful. The rooms are beautiful and the views are simply amazing. We arrived pretty late, as we had a daytime flight from the US to London, and upon arrival everything was ready for our check-in. We ordered room service as most restaurants nearby were already closed. Room service was prompt and good (although a bit expensive), it was very nice to have this option since we just needed to eat and go to bed. The room was a bit warm for us, but after contacting the front desk,…"

December 2022,Save your money stay elsewhere !!,"If I could, I would give a -0 review  The service here is absolutely infuriating! If you email the hotel you receive 10 different replies from 10 different staff members.  There is zero communication amongst them.  That is the start.   We then are advised it’s a 4pm check in.  Guess what - no check in at 4pm - room isn’t ready! They can’t get a hold of housekeeping either conveniently!  So we had to sit and wait with a child.  The sad part is it wasn’t just us, I noticed so many different people having the exact same conversation with the check in staff.   I felt so terrible for the check in staff as they were trying their absolute best.    When we finally got our room they lost our luggage and couldn’t find it.   Let’s just say this is the most disappointing experience I have…"

They gave us the space needed to enjoy our meal but at the same time kept an vigilant eye to see when and if we needed their attention. These to servers were polite, considerate and very friendly.

Our waiter in Ting was delightful - wish we could remember his name, think it began with a D. The singer and guitarist were excellent. The room was wonderful and the pool on 52 is something else. Even if you try and split hairs and find something to critique, there’s nothing! I could do a minute by minute account of our stay but it’s only going to reconfirm how exceptional the hotel team are. The best of the best. "

The pros first:  Gave us the room requested; friendly welcome; comfortable lounge; clean room and small issues rectified promptly and helpfully; welcome biscuits; great room service and lovely server; great pool and staff in that area; helpful guest services.  Cons:  No acknowledgement of our previous visits; given the amount paid we were disappointed that it wasn't made clear other pillows were available (poor sleep as a result) or that we would be asked to pay another £70 as tips for the housekeeping (we booked a long time ago so we were not aware of the change to a discretionary additional charge - it was not in the booking information before or after booking I have and I checked) - frankly at £744 a night the…

The food is better than I’ve expected, based on the previous reviews. There’s a minimum charge of 43 pounds which are Higher than I remembered on the website. The first lift take you to the 35th floor and the second lift ( becoming quite British after a week) take you to 52th floor. The entire elevator was quite short and smooth, although no direct view. The evening view from Gong was fantastic. I liked the most is service. The lady and the guy both went above and beyond to make sure I’m well taken care of. The reservation is for 1.5 hrs only, but they were not rushing me. It will be idea or the restaurant has the entire 52th floor. The rest room has the Japanese TOTO heater and wash…"

Even though I had no reservations, the friendly staff fit my wife and I in for afternoon tea. The view was stunning: a large window overlooking tower bridge. The food was excellent (my wife went with the vegan option and I enjoyed the traditional fare). Tea tasted delicious and staff kept it flowing.

Overall, a very relaxing once in a lifetime stop. Highly recommend"

October 2022,Amazing afternoon Tea!!,"Went to the Afternoon Tea at Ting Restaurant in Shangri-La and wasn’t expecting much. But wow! Firstly, this month’s theme was Breast Cancer Awareness and the Shangri-La did it perfectly! Not only were the decorations beautiful, but the afternoon tea had a pink theme with pink sandwiches, cakes and scones, as well as a spiced pear and white chocolate shard cake (which was both beautiful and delicious!) Everything was made perfectly, and I found myself eating foods I wouldn’t usually eat because they somehow managed to make everything taste so good!  Additionally, the service was absolutely incredible from the moment we walked through the door. A special shout-out to our amazing server Kiro who looked after us from start to finish, he didn’t rush us and constantly made sure…"
February 2022,Has become a tradition to come at least once a year.,"Stayed at the shard three times beautiful views of London! Wonderful staff, nice and helpful. The pool is amazing, although a bit chilly during the winter time but the sauna helps you warm back up! The buffet in the morning is great, lots of delicious choice. The rooms are fantastically cleaned, they go in detail such as fold your clothes or even put your makeup back in place and leave the room impeccable, with services in the morning and at night, the rooms come with complimentary water and chocolates or even deserts sometimes. I love it there and will definitely be back soon ! Cannot wait. (Ps: Don’t forget to watch the tv hidden in the mirror while taking a bath and/ or people watch with the binoculars in the room.) "

October 2022,Will be back on the basis of the service alone,"TīNG itself is known for its beautifully curated menu. The food was impeccable to say the least. I had the wagyu and it was the best meal I’ve ever had. However, the basis of this review relies solely on the service of staff like Kiro. He was such an attentive and diligent server, readily providing us with suggestions which always surpassed our expectations. Such a wonderful experience, highly recommend and will be back!"

She was on top of everything, professional, & the service was fast. There was great live music being sung during our meal also! Although, English Tea at Ting is a little pricey, I wouldn't expect anything less if you're having tea at the Shard with incredible views! It should be on your list of things to do,  while visiting London. You'll definitely have a great time!"

The rooms were excellent the staff were very friendly and helpful, As an international hotel i understand the need for different nationality of staff but we struggled to understand the person that checked us in. The main reason for choosing this hotel was the night views which were spectacular from the room. We had prepaid our hotel stay but at the end we were presented with an additional bill service bill which was not mentioned on their website at the time we booked. I usual leave my tip in the room."

October 2022,Syed made our day!,"We dined at the TING restaurant and our waiter Syed was really lovely! Through our sitting, he was a rag of sunshine and really brightened up the mood of our dinner, which was a big contrast to the first waiter we had (Vincent) that took our drinks and food order - who was pretty rude and made us start regretting our booking here.  Overall, we had a wonderful evening thanks to Syed! We would come again just to see the smile on his face! The food was lovely too."

October 2022,Afternoon Tea Experience @ the Ting’s,"Where else would I like to spend an afternoon tea experience of a lifetime but from where the afternoon tea originated itself. Plus an aerial view of the city of London hence the choice of having it only at the Shangri-La The Shard London last October 3, 2022 visit despite other best selections of venue. One of my bucket list was checked off. The sets of food served from savory sandwiches to beautifully assembled desserts were delicious & the unlimited refills of any tea selections were refreshing. The request for the smoky effect on our table was an added flair too. To top it all, the optional request for having a table by the window during the reservation was granted despite the hesitancy of the lady at the reception even when it’s available was questionable. But with the…"

I would recommend 10/10."
October 2022,Six stars!,"This is perhaps the best hotel my wife and I have ever stayed at. We just returned after a fantastic four-day stay - I ran the London Marathon and always enjoy the city. We had just stayed at a five-star, historic hotel (the Sofitel Grand) in Amsterdam and the Shangri-La was even better. The architecture is stunning. Our room, the Premier City View (which I would recommend that side for the drop-dead views of the city, Tower and Tower Bridge), was perfect. The bed, sofa, desk, artwork, electric black-out shades, carpet, gorgeous marble and granite bathroom, closets, and quiet - could not have been better. The hotel left us a bottle of champagne, cake, chocolates, and even a laminated sign with waterproof bandaids (fortunately not needed but still) and vaseline (for chafing),…"
October 2022,A good experience overall,"Syed provided really good service and the views were great.  The only let downs were the starters and mains - expected better.  The dessert was 10/10, I would definitely come back for the views and dessert"

September 2022,Excellent but be aware!,"We stayed here for 2 nights in the middle of September for our Wedding Anniversary, this was the 4th or 5th time we had stayed at this hotel.  We had a superior room on the 46th Floor overlooking Tower Bridge, this was more spacious than the standard room. Excellent views from our room, and the room was as it should be.  On the positive side, we were able to check in at 2.00pm which I had requested prior to checkin.  The stay itself was excellent, the views are unrivalled, service whilst staying was excellent, breakfast was good and the staff in the Gong Bar provided excellent service.  But on the negative side we had a couple of issues...  1) I had booked the skyline lounge for Saturday night about six weeks prior to our stay, and 5 days before our arrival I had an email to say…"
September 2022,Afternoon tea at The Shard,"We really enjoyed our Afternoon Tea at the Shard.

September 2022,Amazing breakfast while watching the sunrise,"Forget about the shard viewing platform or the London eye. I ordered the express breakfast at Ting for less than the ticket cost of either the other options. The food was fantastic. Three types of fresh pastries was served and they were delicious. The server even offered me some jam to go with them which was really good. The fruit salad was made up of a selection of fresh berries and tasted great while mixed with the yogurt. I finished my tea and to my surprise I was offered a refill at no addition cost! The view was amazing as well. I had all these food while overlooking the London   sunrise, as well as the London towers and the tower bridge. Overall a great experience and I’ll be sure to come back next time I visit London"

The hostesses Artjola and Carolina made sure we were welcomed properly in the Tingand escorted us to a table by the window. The view is divine. The supervisor Carlo greeted us and checked if everything was all right very often during the meal, he even escorted us to Gong Bar where we had reservation to make sure we had the table we reserved. Even the manager Renate came to greet us and entertain us with some smert jokes to make us feel welcomed.

August 2022,We recommend the Shard.,"HOTEL This might be one of the most modern places we’ve stayed in in a long while.  The thick plush carpets lining the hallways and continuing into your room are thicker and more plush than we’ve experienced almost anywhere (maybe the Ritz in Paris compares). We had a suite, so not sure about standard rooms, but the suite was quite spacious. The views are amazing. You’re 35+ stories up over London so you get pretty unobstructed views of the city. The cabinetry, the lights, the bathrooms the whole thing feels like a well throughout and well-built modern hotel. The finishes feel solid and not cheap, the toilets have heated seats and bidets with a large programmable panel on the wall, heated towel racks and more…everything is just a notch higher than most 5-star hotels we’ve been…"
September 2022,Best service from an excellent server,"Eglantino was an absolutely star of a server! He was attentive and professional! Best experience I’ve ever had.  Thank you so much for the excellent Service Eglantino, you were magnificent! My husband and I loved the photos you took of us and also how friendly you were!"
February 2022,Fantastic from start to finish,"We stayed as a couple for the weekend. Great room, 360 views. Dinner at Oblix was unbelievable, best steak I’ve ever eaten. Service impeccable from reception to server to manager. Had a tiny issue with the tv, somebody was knocking at our door within 5 minutes. Resolved instantly. Reception staff brilliant and genuinely friendly. Valet guys are very helpful.  The only tiny improvement i would make ( if being picky) would be that the spa/ pool be a bigger area as did feel a bit “ on top of eachother “. Would definitely stay again."
September 2022,Avoid at all costs,"Would NEVER stay here again. I was hoping that the central location would outweigh any issues with hotel but sadly not. Totally grim room. Terrible customer service, reception put the phone down on me when I asked to move rooms because of the noise. When I phoned back I was told ‘ I don’t know what your problem is’!!  The noise is horrendous, you ca best every movement in rooms each side, above and below. Avoid at all costs!!!"
September 2022,"Unique view, with a delicious cocktail menu","The view? You’ll struggle to top that in London. From the walkie-talkie to Canary Wharf, and the non-stop traffic on the river, it’s fantastic.  The drinks? full on flavour. Well made, and delicious.  The service. Very good. Even being a regular Joe, I was well looked after."

Jose has been my Event supervisor for 9 of these dinners and he has been absolutely amazing - he is always so happy to help me and my team and ensure we have everything we need. Jose briefs me and my team before each dinner and makes sure we are all on the same page and he works to my scheduled itinerary.   Jose has made organising events for myself at The Shangri-La and absolute pleasure and myself and my team will continue to return (I am there again for another dinner this evening!!) as the service is unbeatable.

September 2022,Stunning Views from Our Bed!,"We stayed in one of their amazing City View rooms. It really was the most stunning view from the wall of floor to ceiling windows. So many iconic London sites could be seen such as Tower Bridge, Tower of London, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the London Eye, etc. At night, with all of the lights, it was beautiful. We woke each morning to the sunrise over the city. I took some wonderful photos at 05:30!  The room & bathroom were amazing & had everything we needed. It was all very modern & ‘James Bond’ with a TV within the bathroom mirror, & other gadgets. The only thing that let the main room down was the relatively low spec old TV with very limited viewing options. It just didn’t fit in with the rest of the room. I’ve read that they call them designer TVs but it just wasn’t. It was so…"

August 2022,Mrs,"I’m really glad to bring friends for breakfast at Ting restaurant and be so well treated, served, attended by lovely Emilio. I have no words to thanks him. And I’m looking forward coming again with my family as soon as they come to visit Britain. I strong recommend breakfast at Ting for the variety, for the amazing view and the great atmosphere."
August 2022,Excellent service,"Very nice view from our room on the 49th floor, the room was very clean and well equipped. The most pleasant experience during our stay in the Shanghai-La hotel was the dinner on the 35th floor, which was absolutely fantastic. We’ve been served by a very nice person called Kiro who looked after us impeccably during our dinner, he even asked the sommelier to help us make the best choice in our wine serving. The best fine dining experience we ever had so far. Totally recommend to try the TING Restaurant, even though you’re just passing by through London."
August 2022,Excellent experience!!,"The food was amazing, rivalling some of the best Asian food we’ve had. Staff were amazing as well and, needless to say, the view was spectacular. Our server Dinil was exceptional and looked after our very need with speed and a cheery persona."

August 2022,Dining at Ting Restaurant,Our experience was amazing! Our server Kiro took extremely good care of us and made great personal connections. Our food and drinks were great and came out in a very timely fashion. We will definitely visit again whenever we are back in town!
August 2022,Overnight stay,"My six friends and I stayed here to celebrate our 20 years of  friendship. The reservations team, Yildiz and Zoltan had organised the rooms with fabulous views of Tower Bridge or St Paul’s Cathedral. A lovely welcoming note handwritten on the window and a bottle of champagne in each room made it extra special. The service provided by the staff from ground level to the Gong bar was excellent. A special thank you to Christos on 52 floor. Looking forward to another stay soon."
August 2022,Absolutely lovely!,"Had a fab time at the shard, Mira was lovely, really helpful even when we lost a drink she couldn’t have been any nicer about the clean up, amazing view, drinks were fab too! Well worth a trip up to see the skyline"

August 2022,Unbeatable views of London & superb service.,"Such a wonderful stay. We came for our anniversary and couldn’t have been better taken care of. Such a warm welcome and the Receptionist Marta who was amazing even sent flowers to our room.   We had drinks and food at Gong and watching the bar man make cocktails was nearly as good as the view. There were even seats by the pool to enjoy a drink.   Even if you can’t stay here I would suggest rather than going to the Shard viewing platform come here for a drink, you get much better value for money. The views are amazing wherever you look.   Our bedroom was on the corner over looking St Pauls and was stunning day and night. Watching the city light up was just lovely.   When you arrive in your room the blinds lift for a real wow effect.   As it was a special occasion I think we were…"
August 2022,Very good visit fantastic,Kiro was fantastic server. He was so lovely. They let us pray somewhere private. My friends were treated with such respect and kindness. I would come back here again and again for the service alone. Lovely visit

The hotel is quite posh and the room exquisite,  Where else would the room come with a complimentary bottle of Veuve de Clicquot Champagne?  The view from our room...simply stunning!  The amenities such as the spa with infinity pool and steam room; romantic perfection.  Dinner at Ting restaurant was excellent.  We highly recommend the Wagyu Beef dish.  Overall, an enthusiastic 5 stars!  Hope to return again."

Thank you to Jing who served us at both afternoon tea and breakfast, you came over multiple times and made sure our cups were never empty, your service was excellent. To Angelique who’s smile lit up the room as she was talking with us, to Abigail who was so friendly and joined in conversation with us. All of your service made us feel a part of the Shangri-la Family. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
July 2022,"Exceptional service, fantastic food and  stunning views!","I've stayed at The Shard several times over the past few months and was astounded by the quality of the service, food and scenic views. On all occasions, save my last stay, I had the pleasure of being checked-in and checked-out by Marta Martin, an incredible receptionist at the from desk. I mentioned to her I was a photographer and she called up at sunset to advise to come to the lobby to view the amazing scenic views. I really appreciate her personal touch. My last stay unfortunately, was not as pleasant on the service end but I am treating that as an anomaly for now.  The food at the Ting is to die for! I would suggest the Ting Burger and Chicken Cesar - combined they are simply exquisite. It is quite odd as the room service Ting Burger and Cesar Salad seemed more flavourful…"
August 2022,"Great service, lovely views and exciting  cocktails","We visited Gong to celebrate our dad's birthday. It was a great evening.  The cocktails were innovative and views were great. To top everything the service was exceptional. We were seated by Alina who was extremely kind.  Alina gave us a great table and ensured our parents had a wonderful time.   We often remember the venue and the drinks, but Alina ensured we remembered her kindness during our visit.   Highly recommend Gong's innovative and signature cocktails.   Thank you Alina, Connor, Anbu for a great evening."

August 2022,Shagri-La TING lunch experience: excellent and highly recommended!,"The two of us have joined the Shangri-La restaurant: TING, for a wonderful lunch experience.  The friendly host showed us to our table with stunning views boasting over central London. Then the star of the show: Carlos, the supervisor waiter came, which introduced himself and briefly told us what delicacies await us.  We throughly enjoyed the food, views, and overall experience; and Carlos always checked if we was happy and asking whether he can help us.  All in all, would definitely recommend coming along to TING, and recommend the “3 Course Menu” with a well varied choice selection, as well as the fantastic teas.  Excellent experience with fantastic views."
August 2022,Fantastic stay for a 70th celebration,"We had 3 rooms here for a surprise 70th celebration and had a wonderful time. The staff were all very helpful in the run up to the stay organising balloons and cakes etc. Our 3 rooms were a city view, the bigger city view and a London suite which was an upgrade for us with 2 children (thank you!!)  Theyd made so much effort with champagne, cookies, cakes, toys for the kids, birthday cake, truffles!!! They went above and beyond and let us get into 2 of the rooms 2 hours early.  Swimming slots have to be booked in advance so it doesn’t over crowd which was fine and children can swim 9-11, 3-5pm. The staff at the pool were very accommodating and always on hand to help. It’s slippy though, my daughter fell over twice   We ate at Aqua Shard next door which was fab, but chose not to…"

August 2022,Best experience,"Nathaniel and Jenny were the best. Couldn't ask for more. Treated us exceptionally well. It was a birthday treat and they helped make the day special with their friendly chat and good photography skills 😀 Furthermore,  I really appreciated Jenny using Polish phrases as a way to communicate as I was Polish and it was lovely to see someone try. You can tell Jenny goes above and beyond to make her customer feel welcome. And Nathaniel made sure we have the best memories by making sure he gets some actually good pics of the experience.  Highly recommend, the view is lovely."

The staff were so lovely and very helpful, especially Jing!  Will be returning definitely!"
August 2022,Disappointing,"Views aside, the Hotel was disappointing. The rooms are looking tired, there is a price hike on everything (which I understand to some extent but everything you touch costa money…as if the rooms weren’t expensive enough). The shower leaked, the plug socket was broken and we expected more modern tech (streaming Netflix at the least). I guess it is similar to buying luxury clothes, there’s only so much value until you’re getting the same quality but paying for the name. There was nothing special about this Hotel and I regret spending so much money on what was supposed to be an extraordinary anniversary celebration."
August 2022,Amazing service and views,"Awesome service and amazing views! Hotel service is amazing, concierge is very helpful and accommodating, they let me leave my golf clubs at the hotel for a few weeks while i travelled around europe.  The views are amazing particularly as it was my first time to London."

August 2022,Big Birthday Celebrations,"What a lovely afternoon we had celebrating 4 big birthdays.  Helga our server was absolutely brilliant and so attentive and informative. As a non tea drinker I tried 5 new teas that she recommended and I loved everyone of them, especially the Cherry green tea.   Thank you again Helga for making it such a special occasion."
August 2022,Utopia in vibrant London,We stayed with our young family in two connecting rooms on the 42nd floor. Superb view of the city. Spacious rooms and the connection through the hallway (which we could lock with an extra door) made it even more comfortable. Kids were provided with funny and entertaining set of toys. All required amenities available. Delightful pool with kids hours and off course brilliant view
August 2022,Amazing Afternoon Tea,We have just had the most amazing Afternoon Tea at Tring Restaurant The Shard. The sandwiches and cakes were out of this world. It was my husband’s birthday so it was a special occasion. Our waitress called Jenny was outstanding. From the moment we arrived she went out of her way to make us feel welcome and anything we asked for was not a problem. My son is a bit of a fussy eater and only likes egg sandwiches. Jenny made sure he had plenty and nothing was too much trouble. I can honestly say she made our experience so fantastic. She was truly exceptional and she is a real credit to Tring. The whole experience from the window seat to the food was superb and we will definitely be back. We highly recommend!! Thank you
August 2022,The Sky lounge The Shard,"The Sky Lounge in the Shard London has the most excellent staff. I dealt with a professional young member of the team Paulo, he was considerate, attentive and so helpful infact with the knowledge that it was my daughters 21st bday he informed me of a service they could offer. He organised a cake to be made informing me of the size and price in advance and checked my daughters name( unusual spelling) to make sure it was correct. His greeted us personally on the day and his staff were outstanding! Couldn’t recommend it enough, well done and thank you👍🏻"

August 2022,Shangri-La Shard,"I enjoyed every moment at the Shangri-La the Shard Landon’s Ting restaurant.  I had afternoon tea there and Helga’s service was impeccable.  To enjoy the view from the Shard, it’s worth the money to do it in a first class hotel with good food and personal service."

July 2022,"Fabulous view, even better service","We recently visited the Gong Bar at The Shard and what a great experience it was, the view it goes without saying was amazing even though I hate heights, the cocktails were lovely, but the experience was made memorable by the brilliant service we received from Satin, her personality was great, she was fun, cheeky and really knew her stuff recommending some lovely cocktails, she really made our visit special.    Hotels are suffering at the moment finding good staff, we are all too aware of the shortages in the industry and it was so good to receive such great service which is rare at the moment.  Thank you Satin !"

He made our experience very memorable! Thank you Kiro, it was a real pleasure to meet you."
August 2022,Amazing experience w/ Keller & Team 02. august 2022,"It was our first time visiting Gong bar and it did not disappoint. Sometimes when visiting  upscale places as a young couple you don‘t feel comfortable right away. However that was not the case at Gong. Keller and the other servers fulfilled every single one of our wishes before even expressing them. We ordered 7 different cocktails from both their regular menu and their summer cocktail menu. These were some of the best coktails I ever had. We also had the Prawn Tempura, Chicken Gyoza and Gong Platter. The Inside/Out Roll on the Gong Platter was AMAZING.  Thanks again!! We‘ll be back. Shoutout to Keller & the Rest of the amazing staff"
August 2022,Afternoon Tea,Wonderful view. Great service- yay Helga! Exquisite food. It's one of the best views in London.  The chef's creations are not the standard tea but worthy of a high michelin rating.  Now off to the Tate right down along the Thames!
August 2022,Luxury with a view,"I grew up in London and thought I’d seen it all. But after returning after five years away in Sydney, the Shangri-La has given me a new perspective on my home city. The service is immaculate from check-in with Sonia to check-out with a hundred exquisite details in between. I could sit and drink cocktails on the 52nd floor for hours, spotting places I’ve visited over the years as the sun goes down. Thank you."

Explaining everything and double checking on what was in the food, due to allergies. I would go back just because he wwas so friendly and welcoming. There was another waiter who tried to  hurry us up, which we found slightly unbecoming of the atmosphere and decorum of the shard. However, kiro made up for this."

I chose to stay at London’s Shangri-La for the second year in a row with it being so very convenient and an iconic place to hold a celebration, and it certainly did not disappoint. From the moment we arrived, the suite couldn’t have been more perfect. The amount of time and effort that had been put into decorating the room quite simply blew me away. From the service we received pre-arrival, to our check-in, and the various members of staff who looked after us during our break, each and every staff member went out of their way to assist us and I couldn’t fault a thing. I’ve still got goosebumps and will never forget this Birthday! Thank you to Kurt and his team for making this a Birthday…"

From the seaweed butter on bread at the beginning to the miso icecream at the end, we were pleasantly surprised and satisfied! The service was excellent and our waiter, Kiro took very good care of us the entire time. We found the speed of service was spot on and Kiro even checked with us at the beginning if we would like to take a bit of time between courses or be served straight away. The staff kindly seated us by the window since we mentioned we were celebrating a special occasion and there was a table available at the time. Of course the London views added to the experience and we took plenty of…"

Unknown to us, we were surprised with a temporary room to take a nap in. We were so delighted by the their efforts to make us comfortable. We got up in the room and had our naps. After ours naps, we were called and they let us know our suite was ready. They delivered our bags to our room and our stay truly started!

July 2022,Perfect lunch experience,"I took my parents to the TING restaurant in the Shard, which was the perfect lunch experience. If you arrive early you can already walk around the Shangi-La reception area and take in the stunning views. We must have taken 30 pictures or so before we even entered the restaurant. The atmosphere is very high end lounge style and the food is fantastic. We had the 3 course menu which offers good choice and portions, in my view. Try the Spiced Cod & Salmon Croquettes as a side - even my father, who thinks he doesn’t like fish, enjoyed them (without knowing what he was eating).

I also asked for some help as I explained we were claustrophobic and I knew in particular I would struggle with the lift. From the moment we arrived outside staff were outstanding. They were reassuring about the lift journey being patient and answering my endless questions and even held my hand as we travelled the 35 floors to reception. When we arrived at check in, I felt dizzy as my ears popped in the lift and I was still feeling anxious about the enclosed lift. Multiple staff stopped what they were doing and came to offer more reassurance and water. They understood the situation and immediately moved our room to a lower floor. When I was ready staff…"

Especially, It was lovely to serve our course by Jenny.  She show us great vibe, kindness and lovely smile. The service affects people a lot if they want to coming back again. Afternoon tea was also stunning. However, it was a bit disappointed afternoon tea course doesn’t including tea itself. Any drinks you need to order separately.

For many of the group, it was the first time visiting the shard and the hotel was wonderfully decorated as we visited just before the Queen's Jubilee. Thank you very much to Carmen Jimenez, Riley Stiger and Paul McDonald for taking time out to give us a tour and speaking with the students about their aspirations."

July 2022,It's all about the views,"We stayed two nights in an Iconic City View room as a surprise for my wife's 50th birthday.  The hotel location is perfect, above London Bridge station for easy transport links, next to Borough Market with its food stalls and many restaurants and pubs and a five minute walk from the Thames.  The hotel reception is on the 35th floor with bedrooms between floors 36 and 51 and then the gym and pool plus GONG cocktail bar on floor 52.  The good bits:- = Location. = Our Iconic City View room was amazing, you really could spend hours just watching the boats on the river, always something to see. = Using the Sky Pool before breakfast. = Excellent service including turndown each night. = Complimentary bottle of bubbly and cake for my wife's birthday.

July 2022,Amazing but unnecessary hidden charges are disrespectful,"Staying on the 49th floor with some incredible views of London and experiencing both sunrise and sunset is something we’ll remember forever. Incredible! The room was very nicely appointed and a heated toilet seat is something new for me! All in all I can’t fault the building, the restaurant, the pool or the staff.   However, management please listen to this - when you’re spending roughly £1,100 per night you do not expect to encounter hidden charges on checkout!  There’s a daily service charge for the room which I presume is for housekeeping and although breakfast was included, we were then charged a service charge on checkout.   Management - please don’t come back with a comment about them being optional. This is disrespectful behaviour, it’s £1,100 per night, if you feel it…"
July 2022,birthday brunch,"It was my first time visiting the shard and I had a great time. Service was great big thanks to Fabio, Tanveer,Simona, Noni and Jojo they made me feel welcome. Food was brilliant and everybody enjoyed! Will 100% be back again!"
July 2022,Fab afternoon tea,Have a lovely afternoon tea with my daughter. Especially love the attentive service from Jenny 😍  Enjoyed the jubilee afternoon tea. The chocolate mousse chard dessert at the end was fabulous. Definitely save room for that and the scones!!
July 2022,5 stars experience!,I had lovely time with friends at the Gong bar.   The view and the location were unique.   Cocktails were special made by Michela and served by Madalina and Mirandolina.   I want to thank them for letting us feel special and letting us have an amazing time and experience
July 2022,An incredible experience...,"Vincent and Nathaniel were our personal gourmet guides for our dining experience at Ting. The view from 35 floors up in the Shard was absolutely incredible. The service was incredibly attentive, lightly witty, and very knowledgeable. Every dish and drink was a testament to their perfection. It was not a great meal, or a great view, or amazing service. It was a truly fulfilling experience, in every aspect. I would come back for the service from Vincent and Nathaniel alone, but there was nothing I can say needed improvement. Bravo and cheers to everyone at Ting!"
July 2022,Beautiful view and world class cuisine,"Vincent and Nathaniel were amazing and the service is second to none. My brother and I came for a birthday celebration and was just perfect start to finish. A must visit when in London. The food was amazing, the view perfect."
July 2022,18th bday best birthday as of yet!!!,Absolutely amazing. Food was Divine. Our waiter mavlon was amazing!!! Came here for my 18th and enjoyed it so much. We were accommodated for very well and had a good time.  I would recommend this for everyone especially for a birthday.
July 2022,Anniversary,Me and my missis decided to spend our 5th year anniversary at the Ting Restaurant. It has a good view  on Tower bridge and atmospheric music. Both of us enjoyed the food Especially liked the Deserts 5 starts.
July 2022,Superb!!,"My daughter and I were gifted a voucher from our work colleagues for the 5 course set menu at Ting for our 60th and 30th birthday. A truly memorable experience from start to finish. The food was amazing as was the attentiveness of our waiter Marlon. When we arrived at our table we were immediately asked if we would like to sit at a window table. The sommelier ( so sorry I can’t recall her name!) was wonderful and advised us on our choice of wine suggesting alternatives still within our original budget. The views are spectacular and the food and service is first class. We will definitely come here again soon and thoroughly recommend a visit,you won’t be disappointed."
July 2022,Great,"Views are spectacular, good was great and Carlo the waiter was really helpful. Although quite expensive it is worth it for the whole experience. Even going to use the facilities is an experience as the views are just as spectacular as in the restaurant."
July 2022,Our graduation celebrations,We loved the food and the ambience. Jenny was very helpful and took care of our needs. We loved the dessert part the most as we were celebrating our graduation. The food with perfect view was all we needed for enlightening our evening.
June 2022,Afternoon Tea in the Clouds~~~~☆☆☆☆☆,"I hadn't planned to have afternoon tea on my way to the shard,but the jumbotron advertisement enticed me. The hostess was very amicable and lovely. She seated me where I could see an unobstructed view of the London/Tower Bridge. And The Tower of London! Helga offered her expertise on which Champagne to add to the afternoon tea. The Superb Jenny gave me ☆☆☆☆☆ service. She is a true scholar in the art of tea, a tea sommelier if you will! All of her suggestions were delicious! My tea would not have been such a sublime experience without her. The chefs took my taste buds on a culinary ary adventure. The diverse flavor profiles and depth of the sandwiches were MIND BLOWING.  The creme for the scones was the best I've ever had. Very creamy, and a hint of sweet. The lime blueberry…"

June 2022,Ana,"It must be so typical to say that everything was perfect, but it really was, from the bottom of my heart. From our sommelier Piotr, our waiter Emilio, to the food, wine and the view…much more than I would’ve expexted! That’s the thing with wonderful people (and places) making every experience so unique…"

June 2022,Excellent birthday stay,"Had an absolutely amazing experience! All the staff were friendly, helpful and so accommodating and attentive. Felt like a truly personal service throughout our stay. The views were jaw dropping. This may sound like hyperbole but words can't do it justice - you simply have to experience it. If you only get to go to London once and you want something to remember, this is it!"
June 2022,5 course set menu,All of the food was delicious and very well presented. Fresh flavours and not too heavy - perfect amount to leave satisfied. Marlow was our waiter and was very considerate and helpful. A great night to celebrate a special occasion.

May 2022,Amazing views,"Amazing views. Good service.  Truly lovely room.  But why spend £800 a night and then not expect the room to include breakfast? Such a weird penny pinching approach to pricing.    We loved the room, but honesty for £800 - throw in a bagel."
July 2022,Special occasion,"Family 6 meals  for hubby birthday treat.  Had three course menu for 5 adults and kid menu for a child.  It is a good value for money for the experience in shard. We was served by Helga who was really a star and very attentive, she was busy around with customers and tried her the best to ensure we be cared. Such nice hearted staff, I feel really thankful. Very thoughtful, Helga gave a sign “Happy Birthday “ card with sweets it made my hubby birthday so special at Ling restaurant. The view was outstanding with these delicate and delicious three course meals. We had a great time! Thank you very much xx"
July 2022,Is this really a Shangri-La??,Just checked in for a 6 day stay. Decoration classic Shangri-La but service was cold both at reception and at breakfast. Had to ask about my breakfast as they did not realize I’m a Diamond member. Just called them about my amenities. Again they said they have to check. Doesn’t feel like a Shangri-La at all and certainly don’t feel like a Diamond member here. Hopefully rest of stay is better.
June 2022,Good Hotel,"Review from Thailand 🇹🇭 This is my first time in Shangrila London. I’m very very exciting. I received a warm welcome from staff “Sonia” everything is good, nice view , nice room, good afternoon tea.  I will definitely return to use the service again.  See you 😊"
July 2022,Afternoon Tea at The Ting,"From the moment we walked service was on point, we was looked after by Elvis who was very nice and attentive and helpful and ensured us everything they served us was halal. Elvis has also kindly given us a Birthday treat with a nice smoke show. What made the afternoon better was that Busta Rhymes was there and happen to saw a few lines on the mic. Overall great service and food and great selection of 52 teas."
July 2022,Best ever,"Amazing stay at the shard hotel. We were so well looked after throughout our stay. Jing was super attentive during breakfast at the Ting restaurant and organised a lovely surprise (plate of macarons) for our son who was celebrating finishing his GCSE's  . Can't wait to come back again.  Very special hotel, cannot recommend enough."

June 2022,What a stay!,"I booked Shangri-la for a weekend stay for my husband’s birthday. When we arrived everyone was extremely helpful and when they found out we were already late for our brunch booking at Aqua, the reception staff made even more effort to quickly explain our benefits (booked through concierge to receive Golden Circle benefits) and send us on our way.  When we finished our brunch, the room was ready and we were informed that they upgraded us to a suite. When you enter your room at the Shangri-la, the curtains open to unveil the view of London. Staff wrote a lovely Happy Birthday note on a window in our room as well as above the bath.  When we arrived after dinner, there was a bottle of champagne, chocolates and a note from the hotel to wish my husband happy birthday again. It was a…"
June 2022,Best afternoon in London!,"We really enjoyed our afternoon tea in Ting, the view is amazing of course, however, what really is outstanding is that the service. Since the moment you arrive to the moment you leave it feels that everyone is treating you amazing! I would like to highlight the service of Giannis, Danny and Nathaniel, they were amazing!"
June 2022,Best servicr ever,"Amazing service, especially Giannis, Nathaniel and Danny!! Great food and great service! Felt super especial for everyone and the view was amazing!! Thank you so much! Will definitely come back very soon"
June 2022,Afternoon Tea at TING Restaurant and Lounge,"I enjoyed very much the afternoon tea at the TING. The hostess, Jenny was extremely friendly and helpful. The food was quite a lot, which I couldn’t finish. Highly recommend for those who are looking for a first time experience of afternoon tea."
May 2022,THE VIEW,Top-notch concierge service! We stayed in one of the corner rooms with a view of St. Paul's and west. The free-standing bathtub faced Big Ben. The pool and sauna are next to none although I have to say a 45min slot can make someone feel stressed. Only disappointment was the room service. We oredered a bottle of champagne which took 40min to arrive and then they wanted to add tray charge and service charge on top of that. That's basically a tip on tip. We mentioned it during check-out and it was removed immediately. I highly recommend to every Londoner to stay here for one night at least once in their lives! The view is a fantastic experience!
June 2022,Excellent views although the hotel is looking dated,perhaps the reason to choose the Shard are the views - you can't bet these. I stayed two nights in a room on the 46th floor. I found the room wasn't perfectly clean. There was dust on the furniture and items didn't look like they were stored after being cleaned - ie the iron with the cord hanging out the wardrobe. The doors are extremely worn - the fabric/leather overlay is ripping of the front of most doors I walked past.   The service was however consistent with the Shangri La brand
June 2022,Fantastic!  Unmissable,"Fabulous! Delicious!  Great food, ambiance, service and drinks!  Anyone who is in this side of town should come and enjoy.  Wagyu was simply divine.  And the view is amazing.  Enjoyment for many senses.  Dont hesitate - it  a hotel restaurant, you need to up the elevator, but you wont regret it!"
June 2022,Kiro was such a gracious host,"Kiro made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped in the restaurant. Attentive and kind, he made the whole experience that much more enjoyable. The food was delicious and very easy to share and try multiple dishes."
June 2022,"The Fabulous Mr Fabio Noni!! Gio Gio, Tanveer & Simona",My partner and I visited the Sky Lounge during our joint birthday weekend celebrations. Fabio and the team ensured that we had a fabulous time with a fabulous view and I would like to take the opportunity to truly thank them for what they did for my partner and I. Thank you all.
June 2022,Splendid Shard,"Certainly one of the best hotels in london, and the view is a literal standout of the best lot  Check-in was good and when i enquired about upgrade, the answer was unhelpful - “you’ve already got the best suite”. Which is obviously not true  The staff from porters, conceirge, restaurant etc. are all very good  The suite is very nice with expectedly amazing views  The pool is indoor , small and not for laps. Gym also small with the great views  Location wise, seems 30 mins from everywhere so the taxi bills piled up. And 45 min from Harrods  Almost perfect 7 day stay then something odd happened on the last evening. We found the cleaning staff slumped on our bathroom floor. She managed to get up and at our door , collapsed again. Our room was in some disarray. We called the front…"
June 2022,Birthday visit,"My gorgeous sister brought me to ting for a beautiful afternoon tea. I was totally spoiled by Jenny, with a lovely card and drink. She really went above and beyond to make me feel special. The food was amazing and the views are just stunning"
June 2022,Restaurant Ting,"Had the most amazing experience in Ting restaurant. The staff are a delight, and made us feel like royalty. The food was an experience apart, delicious, the chef was very attentive to my allergies and made sure I was safe. The sommelier suggested some delicious wine, and her knowledge is admirable. My special thank you to Nat, Carlos, Scott, Janis and Fiona that made the night memorable for us!"
June 2022,Family visit to Ting,Had a great experience at Ting. Service was impeccable. We were welcomed by Kiro and served by Ismail. A lot of care was taken to ensure we have the best experience. Their service was prompt and friendly . Food was great too! Would highly recommend for a special evening !
June 2022,High Tea with Real Class,"We loved the view, food, teas, and the wonderful hospitality. Kiro was especially helpful and accommodating, and really enriched our High Tea experience. The entire staff really made our experience incredible."
June 2022,"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing view!","I was looked after by Jenny who was so lovely and had come for a birthday breakfast buffet which was superb. A combination of your classics - toast, sausages, beans and for continental like pancakes. As well as cold foods like salmon. Basically anything you wanted, they would magic up.  I asked for a well done fried egg and I didn't have to wait for it, they bought it to me.  Which was lovely. But the best thing was the Chinese additions with gyozas etc.  I love gyozas so having that with a full English was music to my ears.  Jenny my server was attentive but not annoying, you know the difference. She knew when I wanted another plate,  she knew when to leave me to enjoy the scenery. It was a lovely experience.  A great experience and started my birthday on a wonderful note!"
June 2022,Views stunning. Watch out for hidden charges,"This was our 10 year wedding anniversary we added 5 course meal at ting and bottle of champagne to the package/booking.  The bill should have been £1116 but we ended up paying £1339.72 and despite querying this with a duty manager still find myself emailing back and forth with ting manager now to establish exactly why. So I advise watch out for hidden discretionary service charges on rooms, and in restaurant.  Check what you order as in a bottle of wine is the price you actually get charged as you won’t find out until later on check out. Check out staff don’t know either. Even the duty manager I complained to later didn’t know. Plus the wine list charges on the menu are more than are showing on the website. Can’t fault the views and the sheer luxury of staying in this peaceful…"
June 2022,Claudia,"Tanveer was our event operation supervisor and was utterly amazing, so attentive and helpful! Couldn’t recommend more. He explained everything and was always around for anything we needed utter star!   Thank you"
June 2022,Wonderful afternoon tea experience!,"Loved the tea surprise (we won’t spoil it for you). Danny our server was very hospitable. The views are fabulous, with Tower Bridge in the distance.  Short walk from London City. We understand The Shard is the tallest building in London. Thank you."
June 2022,Shangri-la,"Amazing customer service by Marlon, he was very helpful and friendly andade us feel very comfortable. Thank you for helping make our 10 year anniversary special.  The food was amazing too, I loved everybit of it.  And the recommended champagne made it even better, unfortunatelycan'trememberthe name of the lovely lady that recommended it to us, with full details.  I definitely recommend."
June 2022,Delayed Xmas Treat,"Had a much awaited lunch at Shangri La restaurant, a gift from one of our children for last Xmas. Not sure what was most fabulous…the visit to the Shard or the meal itself. From our welcome when we went into the hotel until we left we couldn’t have asked for more . The food was delicious and the service top class from all staff. Our waiter Elvis, was attentive, knowledgeable and an absolute pleasure to talk to…a real professional. Thank you Elvis…please don’t leave this building! A great all round experience."
December 2021,Excellent,"Such a joyful family time we had at the Tang restaurant! We had an amazing afternoon tea, tasty food, great atmosphere and the view was spectacular.

June 2022,Amazing service,I had a date with my girlfriend in Gong and the service was amazing.

Our sommelier Nathaniel recommended a white wine as perfect fit for our meal and pointed out the beautiful sunset to us so that we could go and enjoy the view for a couple of minutes.  We will definitely come back when we're in London again.

June 2022,It’s hard to better the Shard !,"As a lifetime Londoner I was keen to organise a special birthday  event for a group of friends to celebrate my wife’s special birthday. The shangri la Shard offered the perfect solution - a unique venue, offering outstanding hospitality for a memorable 24 hours   With the unwavering support and help of a great group lead by the dedicated and resourceful events team  (Lulu), the friendly and flexible reservations department (Kanwal) and the outstanding front of house personnel (Karen) ensured that my plans became reality.    Nothing was too much trouble and the hotel became our high level home away from home offering spacious and comfortable accommodation and caring staff  matched by unique  and sensational views of London…..Even the weather behaved!   High praise - hard to beat…"
June 2022,High tea at the Shangri-La London,"What a treat! The food was delicious, the view was spectacular, and the service was warm and hospitable.

June 2022,Worth trying,"Staff were awesome. We had a fellow called Jing who was super attentive. View is great. Food is very good. No rush on the restaurant at 35th floor and you can relax. We tried both the buffet and a la carte for breakfast. The bar on top floor was good, you will find that's where you may feel rushed as they kicked you out after an hour and half, claiming they have reservation. Ironically, there were empty takes."
June 2022,Exquisite High Tea Overlooking Majestic London!  Reservations a Must!,"One of the best High Teas offered in London!  From the welcoming tea accompanied by a dry ice presentation (which starts the culinary experience), to the exquisite views of all of London, an experience that promises to delight!  The wait staff were amazing, attentive, engaging and courteous.  We never felt rushed, it was about enjoyment and pairing of flavors, textures and smells…. The teas were paired with our selections, each one different and delicious.  Save room for dessert, you will want to taste every option!! If you are like us and not wanting to leave, take the staircase down to the Skybar lounge….. Great place to share a bottle of wine and recap on your experience!!"

Emilio and Danny surprised us with a special “happy anniversary” chocolate on our dessert, and Nathaniel finished the night off with a gift of a special drink atop a dry ice display that was amazing.

It felt in every way beautiful, remote, idyllic and approaching perfection. The views were absolutely stunning from our hotel room as well as from the restaurant and the spa. The five course dining experience at Ting's was sublime and hugely enhanced by how kind, thoughtful and attentive all the staff were. I have to give a special mention here to Kiro, who, as our food guide, put us at ease and turned our night into a culinary adventure. He was absolutely brilliant. The sommelier was also very knowledgeable. Danny was very attentive during our breakfast. And last but by no means least the concierge service at…"

May 2022,"Lovely as ever, but one hidden surprise...","Stayed once again at the Shangri-La, (2nd time in 12 months) this time we stayed in a Premier City view King room (4511) for 2 nights - As ever, lovely views, comfy bed, and wonderful bathroom (albeit our TV in the bathroom seemed to only have 6 channels working - First world problems.) The room is slightly more noisy than our previous room, we could hear the trains, I could also hear the neighbouring rooms shower - but note, I am a very light sleeper, my partner, wasn't disturbed. All staff were courteous, helpful and smiley, as they always have been. Food and drink in both Gongs and Tings were delicious. I can highly recommend the Mongolian Beef.  1 thing to note, when we booked and paid in full we were charged a service charge of roughly £68, upon check out we were charged…"
May 2022,Unforgettable afternoon tea at Ting,"The afternoon tea at the Ting restaurant is an unmissable, unforgettable, unique experience. I've been to London many times, have had good meals but the Ting is really something I had never seen or tasted. The food is remarkable, perfectly made, with strong flavours, each piece of the menu is meticulously harmonised, a big well done to the kitchen staff. Not just the food is delicious, the views, breathtaking, but the waiting staff is really the cherry on top. We were served by Esmail and Nathaniel who were so kind, so careful, attentive and courteous. I can't wait to go back!"

June 2022,"At the Shard, Shangrila","It’s a great experience in Shard Shangrila. The amazing view and great food coupled with best service of Nathaniel and Vincent would complete the first time experience of a traveler. I am in a vacation and the “shard experience” is one of the talks of the town. I am privileged to meet Nathaniel, my “kababayan” (town mate) who is from Mulanay, Quezon province in the Philippines and the wine expert of the Shard.  He and the other crew gave us a once in life time experience of the place where we saw the whole city of London. The tea which varied according to the taste of the client would be personally prepared. The “classy food” fits to the fantastic view. The services brought us to a “homey” experience despite the number of people around. Thanks to the Shard Shangrila for the…"
June 2022,Welcoming & Friendly staff,"This is a posh restaurant but you don’t feel intimidated because of the staff , from the doorman ,receptionist Maria ,Elvis our waiter & Nathaniel the Sommelier are very welcoming and friendly & will offer to take your photos & video. Afternoon tea in London are around the same price of the Ting.The only difference is that you get the good view of the Tower Bridge ,Tower of London & friendly staff. And Elvis has a way of  selling the Champagne drinks instead of just having a normal Tea in a not imposing manner.So we got the Pink. Champagnes & also a Tea.Very good sales talk.I also like the guy who make a trick to do smoke drinks , good for Instagram.I also like the Live Music. However, I rather have a bone china tea pot a  more traditional & we went on the Jubilee Celebration I…"

June 2022,Amazing experience,"My partner received this as a birthday Virgin voucher gift. We have had bad experiences with Virgin Vouchers the food is not always the best!   To say it was an amazing evening doesn’t even explain.   Vincent (our waiter) and Irene, our sommelier, ( I hope I have spelt your name correctly) were second to none in making our experience amazing. Both so friendly and knowledgeable and nothing was too much. They made my partner’s birthday extra special. Thank you both so much. I highly recommend this for the amazing food and the best service. Thank you for a great evening. We will definitely be back xx"
June 2022,Ting Restaurant. ,"Great food, great setting. Reasonably priced given the view & service. Marlon was very attentive without being too much.  Would return next time we are in London. Good experience even if you only do once.  The Malaysian fried rice is worth a try!  Kyle."
June 2022,Shout out to those who have pride in their job,"Had an amazing experience, despite being late and not the most Welcoming of receiving staff, they were outshone by both Nathaniel the Sommelier, who personally took time away from his designated role to see that we were accommodated promptly and Made to feel most Welcome.  He checked on us and spent time answering any questions as well as capturing the special moments and ensuring we were happy.  Vincent waited on us and was very friendly, relaxed and also made the difference to our experience, it's mainly due to these individuals that we will definitely return again soon.  Both are a credit to the Ting team."

September 2021,Booked for a special night out.,"Not sure why it has taken me so long to write this review!!  I wanted to stay somewhere special for my 50th birthday last year after all the hell of the previous year or so, and the Shang ri la did not disappoint.  The room and view was amazing, and the staff could not have done more to help or make me feel special, including a lovely little delivery of a birthday cake.    Three of us shared a room as a base for our night out, and I opted to sleep on what can only be described as the most comfortable z bed I’ve ever slept in.  Going to sleep to that view is incredible and quite possibly one of the best nights of sleep I’ve had.  Whilst pricey, if you have the money and want to do something special, go for it."

May 2022,Perfect,"Whilst I am passionate about the Shangri-La brand, I haven’t always been a fan of the London one. This evening’s experience was excellent - from my telephone booking with the nicest gentleman ( sorry - no name), the greeting by a warm dnd friendly host ( again apologies - no name) and  service from Fabio and Tanveer. Fabulous table on a beautiful evening with stunning views. Excellent service and delicious champagne.  Thank you all."

May 2022,"Nice view, but that's it.","Beautiful view, but we paid 1000 pounds for my wife's 40th birthday, and showed up with no welcome other than a lady on reception who basically told us ever bar/restaraunt was completely booked up and we couldn't go have a celebratory drink of champaign for my wife's 40th.  We ended up having to eat at another restaraunt off the premises on the other side of the shard.  The rooms, although only a few years old, are beat up and weathered.  Carpet felt dirty and a lot of bangs and knicks all over the faux wooden walls, etc.  Was very shocked at the room size of the 'king bed with city view' don't be fooled by the photos, the rooms are very small, and there are only 2 decent sized windows with a massive pole obstructing one of the views. The service at the pool (which closes at 7…"

May 2022,"Loved the service, libations and of course the view at the Sky Lounge, Shangri-La","Booking ahead a couple of days allowed us to get a lovely table for 4 in the Sky Lounge on the 34th floor. We were next to the window (not guaranteed) overlooking the Thames (Tower Bridge, Tower of London, HMS Belfast..and a LOT more!).   We enjoyed several of their main courses - loved the sweet and sour prawns, but all dishes had fans at our table. Our waiter - Fabio - was excellent. Attentive, prompt and a great demeanour. The drinks we ordered - 3 cocktails (thankyou Noni!) were wonderful as was the Veuve Cliquot...a personal favourite. Another round please!  Will be back, probably quite soon :).

We will definitely be back when we visit London!"
May 2022,Afternoon Tea - top notch Service,"Had a special occasion and booked a table for Three course lunch, but traded up to Afternoon Tea as looked more special. Don't regret that decision.  Staff at Ting were very attentive and made suggestions on drinks and described the food well. Elvis was looking after us very well and tried a number of drinks and tea on his suggestions.  Overall a great visit....lovely food and great service"
May 2022,Best afternoon tea EVER,Went there on my mum's birthday. The attention by Helga was exquisite and her recommendations on the teas we were having were perfect. So filling and so tasty! And what to say about the view!!! Completely worth the price!
May 2022,Amazing 5-star service,"We arranged a business dinner in the Private dining room and had a truly incredible evening.  The service was truly 5 star and the team were professional, friendly, welcoming, accommodating, warm, and meticulous.   Particular mention to Tanveer Bepari, Dian Sterling and Jackie who were amazing.  There was no request that was too small and they took care of every detail.   The service was SPECTACULAR and I cannot recommend both The Shangri-La The Shard enough but also the wonderful team in Tanveer, Dian, Jackie - THANK YOU.   We will be back!!"

May 2022,Review in shard,Amazing food just the best I have ever had Jenny was an amazing waitress!! All food was Devine and everyone was just so kind! The view was lovely even though I’m scared of hights. I have been to the other restaurant but this one was amazing -Ting-
January 2022,The best one,"We are no strangers to Shangri-La The Shard, we feel it’s our 2nd home here in London. We had quite a few memorable stays at the hotel, the recent one was to celebrate my son’s birthday party, we hired the large Ball Room of Ren, from the special requested deco to the 5 star staff services, every details were spot on, it was an unforgettable experience. Here I want to specially mention Senior Sales Manager Lulu, who has been so supportive and what a delight to work with her since we first stayed at Shangri-La London back in 2018, Lulu has been always there for us. We will be back for more stays at Shangri-La London. 非常值得再去的酒店，设施服务都是一流的。给我的家庭留下了非常好的回忆。特别是lulu, 总是能让每一次的入住像家一般的温暖。"
May 2022,Best afternoon view and the best swimming pool view.,Jenny our server was very kind and gave us outstanding service. The food was delicious Thanks Jenny. The pool and spa view is breathtaking.  The best bday celebration ever. I will definitely come back again.
April 2022,Very Poor Value - Much Better 5* Hotels in London,"Recently stayed at their London/Shard property. Very poor value for money - high prices are okay for high quality and service. Unfortunately service fell significantly short of expectations - some examples I encountered: reception staff were untrained on both check in and check out, check in at 4pm/checkout at 11am, very poor service in Ting restaurant and told we were unable to get a drink after 11pm. I would avoid this property as there are much better 5 star hotels in London at a similar price point."
May 2022,The Shard amazing food and views,"We had a great time here at the gong bar, the staff were very friendly. Mira especially was great, she was the one mainly serving us and she was lovely and we had a nice little chat.  Would highly recommend coming here for some great drinks and wonderful Sushi."
May 2022,Amazing service from Danny and Marlon,Amazing service from Danny and Marlon.  We had a lovely view of London . Shangri la knows how to do the service though I must say it was good but not great selection of food … some food was amazing and other options were less so ( agreed by all 3 of us ). But service was genuinely amazing - hence 5/5
April 2022,Amazing Sky Dinner,"We really love this breathtaking private dining experience at the Shangri-La, the view on the most iconic London’s skyline make everything dreamy!  Amazing dinner with the kindest staff ever: the lovely Jackie makes our experience so comfortable!  We really recommend the experience that is a must-to-do in London!   Can’t wait to come back and repeat it!"
April 2022,Amazing!,"We had a very wonderful dinner in a beautiful private room. Everything was just  perfect and Jackie was so kind with us. Wonderful stay, I warmly suggest this wonderful time with the best view! !!!!!!!"
April 2022,Astounding view and service,The surroundings of Ting could not be better and a “golden hour” visit is recommended. The food was very good from the 3 course set menu and our host Alex was superbly polite and attentive as was sommelier Piotr.
April 2022,Exceptional,"I wanted to say thank you to the lovely Alex for making our day spectacular. The view was beautiful, the food exciting and for us tea lovers so much choice which is very much appreciated. Everyone seemed to go above and beyond and I'm grateful for such a lovely experience, I look forward to returning soon!"
April 2022,Business lunch,"Super lunch today with exceptional service, we were looked after by Elvis, the food was exceptional as was the service. The desert was truly scrumptious! Thank you for a lovely experience. My first visit and already looking forward to the next."
April 2022,Best views in London with great staff!,"An amazing experience staying on 37th floor with fantastic views and great service. We upgraded to a Premier City view which was bigger with better views. We didn’t see the deluxe room we had originally booked so can’t really compare but the room was excellent and the views couldn’t be beaten. Where the bath is on the side window there is a view in to next door’s room but if you sit towards the back of the bath this isn’t a problem but you may want the blinds pulled at night to avoid the reflection! The heated toilet seat was amazing, must get one of those at home!  The service was great, especially the guys dealing with the luggage in the concierge team and the staff by the front doors. They recognised us coming back after only having seen us once and they were all so friendly.…"
May 2022,Must visit!,"Exceptional service by Danny at Ting! His recommendations were spot on, and the service was just wonderful. We came here for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed the view and the food. The chocolate dessert and the Fujian rice are to die for. Must visit!"
May 2022,Lunch at Ting,"Danny is brilliant , very friendly and accommodating. Amazing service from Jenny as well, view is amazing  Highly recommended. We will definitely coming back very soon. Food is great plus price is kinda okey"
May 2022,engagement,"Had a beautiful engagement in the shangri-la with a private room and 3 course meal. The viwes from the room were amazing and we had the room for about 2/2.5 hours so watched the sunset over London.  Tanveer was our host, he was very attentive and offered great service. Couldn't have wished for a more special day."

May 2022,Graduation Celebration,"Visited Shangri-la Shard after a friends MSc graduation. No tables available but we were hosted extremely well while we waited. Once seated, staff were attentive but not intrusive, catering to all our needs/requests and ensuring we had an enjoyable night that was sophisticated, surrounded by astounding views and made to feel like royalty but in a magical way that allowed us to relax and be completely ourselves. Thank you - Fabio, Tanveer, Simona & Simone. A night to remember and never forget!!!"

May 2022,Momo the great,"Amazing view from the 52nd floor, brilliant service, especially from Momo. The cocktails are top class, main top would be the Fudge Tariq, which is an incredible sweet treat. Bring your swimmys and sneak into the pool for extra fun."
April 2022,Room with a view,"We entered the Shangri La and the gentleman at the front were really welcoming and friendly. When we walked inside the staff waiting in the foyer were less so.  Checking in was easy although the person checking us in wasn’t overly friendly.  However did help us change our pool time slot.  We got to our room and the blinds were down when we opened them the view was AMAZING. Few issues found in the room.  The beds were not made up as twins beds, wet patches on the carpet and stains in the bathroom. We left feedback using the in room app. The general manager called to rectify these problems and gave us complimentary drinks to our room. Lovely touch. Although the stains in the bathroom and wet carpet were not resolved they did offer us a room change. However, the room wasn’t like…"
April 2022,Momo is the best!,"Had a great time at the GONG. Windows seating, fabulous drinks, and the best waiter: Momo 💖  Nothing else to say really. Great time, great friends and stunning views. Can’t ask for anything more really."
April 2022,Shard cocktails,Had a lovely afternoon enjoying cocktails. Momo made our afternoon very enjoyable. His knowledge of cocktails and the relative flavours to go for was a real treat. Great view & atmosphere - thoroughly relaxing and luxurious for an hour and a half.
April 2022,Wonderful stay in the clouds,"We had a perfect getaway at the Shangri-La The Shard. The location is perfect for flying in to London City Airport, so easy to get there and so much easier than the always crowded Heathrow Airport. The area is quite nice, many small local restaurants and a quick walk along the Thames over the Millenium Bridge and you stand right in front of St. Pauls Cathedral.  The room with city view does not disappoint, we loved all of it and the sunrise is memorable as well as taken a bath with that view especially in the evening.  A sumptuous breakfast buffet, you won't miss anything. Ting Restaurant, Gong Bar, the pool all worth visiting. We will return for sure."
April 2022,Fab,"Brilliant just brilliant. Lovely place, lovely people and brilliant atmosphere. We were really impressed and well looked after. We will definitely be coming back soon to take advantage of this fab place. For anyone who hasn’t tried, they should."
October 2021,Afternoon Tea @ The Shard (TING),"I recently experienced Afternoon Tea in the sky at Ting Restaurant at The Shard! Our hosts (Marco and Jenny) were incredible and so kind. Marco even showed us some tricks he had been working on when serving our tea - he definitely went above and beyond to keep us well looked after and entertained. I also appreciate the Marco and Jenny took photos of me and my friends which are such a special memory!  The menu offered a halal Afternoon Tea option too which was very inclusive and lovely!   Overall, I would highly recommend this Afternoon Tea to anyone visiting London! Definitely a unique experience!"
September 2021,Stunning views and beautiful pictures.,"Beautiful hotel with absolutely stunning views, gorgeous room and amazing experience. Loved the warm toilet seats and the amazing bathroom. Drawbacks - the bar, although stunning was not particularly comfortable, one seat and one stool, not conducive to relaxing. Quite corporate, an Instagram hotel, as my husband says, great for photos but lacks warmth and sincerity from staff. Still I would recommend it - once in a lifetime experience!"
May 2022,Loveliest 30th birthday celebration,"We had a great time at the Liquid Afternoon Tea for my 30th - our host Mira was friendly and attentive, and the food and drinks were absolutely delicious and arrived promptly. Without a doubt would recommend."

June 2021,"Small factors make a big difference, could and should have been better",Booked here for our honeymoon last year which coincided with the lifting of lockdown. Have stayed a few times previously however this stay was not as what we expected it to be. Seeing as lockdown was just being lifted it was hard to get hold of a manager as I wanted to make this stay extra special due to us arriving on our wedding day.   We saw that the general manager Kurt is on Instagram so my wife sent him a message which sadly was left on “read” without receiving any reply. The Gong bar was a similar situation as we were finding it hard to book a table for that evening for us and 2 of our friends. We received a message from the director of bars Julian Casanova to say he had made the booking however when I attempted to contact him on a number of occasions for some extra…
May 2022,Wonderful experience,"We stayed last night using a voucher purchased from the hotel for my husband’s birthday.  We arrived & given a lovely welcome from Romy who was cheerful & informative. I had made a request to the hotel for a Tower Bridge view & I’m pleased to say we had a fabulous view as asked for. The room was lovely & very well equipped.  There was cake, macaron & chocolate dipped strawberries waiting for us  …  a little later a birthday cake was bought to the room for my husband with a card courtesy of the hotel & I thought this was a lovely touch. We had a really peaceful nights sleep as it was quiet & the bed was so comfortable …. In addition there were excellent black out blinds. Breakfast this morning was spectacular definitely spoiled for choice … everything looked delicious & really…"

May 2022,Max’s 9th birthday,"My sons dream was to stay at the Shangri-La in the Shard for his birthday, so we obliged after much persuasion by him.  Hotel is lovely with fantastic views.  We stayed in room 3704 and had a perfect view of tower bridge.  The swimming pool is lovely too.  Not the biggest but very very cool.   We went to eat food one night in the Ting restaurant and we where served by a waiter called Emilio….  Emilio was brilliant.  He was very knowledgeable of the food, very friendly, attentive and made some brilliant recommendations on food!  He is a credit to the establishment!  I would recommend anyone to stay at the hotel and take full advantage of the on site amenities!  We had a very happy 9 year old during our stay"

April 2022,Arranging the celebration                           at Gong,"I tried to book the Gong Bar for my wife’s extra special birthday but could not book online as the number in our party did not match the website availability, and our time and availably was tight. I emailed the gong SSL and received a reply from Edward within a short period of time and he confirmed that they could accommodate our numbers. Great that part of the occasion dealt with professionally and timely.  I then wanted to book a celebration cake for my wife and time was running out. The website asked me to email a certain email address. Unfortunately, I did not receive a reply, so as time was tight, I emailed the same email address, but this time I copied in the email address I had booked the occasion and Edward came back to me with the information I needed, and the cake was…"
April 2022,40th birthday celebration,We booked breakfast prior to going to the top of the Shard. We had a very warm welcome from the start. We were invited to take our time to take photos and enjoy the views before being seated for our buffet breakfast. We were offered the a la carte menu but the buffet had a broader range and they made me vegetarian sausages separately as this was not part of the buffet. Jing/Jenny made our visit very special as we celebrated my sister’s 40th birthday. Thank you all so very much!
June 2021,Nice view,"I absolutely loved the view from our room , the bathroom was the cherry on top. I must say staying in the Shard was on my check list for a quite long time. However, does the room justify the £600 I paid per night, I really don’t think so."
April 2022,40th birthday weekend,What can I say except this weekend was everything we imagined and so much more. Marta and Nora on reception were absolutely amazing and couldn’t do enough for us. A real credit to the Shangri La and made our weekend truly amazing. Thank you so much for everything. We will definitely be coming back again!

Her tea recommendations were excellent!  I was a little anxious because this was my first time having afternoon tea, but she made the experience easy, informative, and just lovely over all lovely.  Her tea recommendations were spot on. The savory and sweet dishes were also excellent.  I particularly enjoyed the scones with the cream.  Together with the strawberry jam provides a delightfully sophisticated taste! Last but not least, the view of London is the best in the city! I mean often times the view is what you go for but, what was awesome was the awesome service! I recommend that if you can come, you totally should.  It does get busy about 12:30…"
April 2022,Refreshing cocktails on Easter Sunday,Loved the ambiance as well the great service. Can’t wait to go back! This guy recommended to us cocktails that match with our flavours but as well a pizza with truffle oil that was major. If you are in the area is a must to try!
April 2022,Amazing experience,"Me and my family spent a joyful night at Ting. Special thank you to Alessia and Angelique for the warm welcome, to Marco, Giannis and Kat for looking after us, to Norbert for the great cocktails. It was a pleasure for us to dine at this beautiful venue."

April 2022,Fantastic Anniversary Celebration,"We celebrated our 5 years anniversary. The team went all out and had the room beautifully decorated with messages from the hotel.  I think the best parts of the stay was the skyline views, the delicious food & excellent staff ( In particular Mr Nathaniel Morales who provided especially great service during the stay.)  Thank you Shangri-La London for looking after us."
April 2022,Good experience but..........,".........very significantly overpriced in my view. Been planning to try a night here for a while. Whilst everything is beautifully designed, the staff and service very good, the rooms nice and the views spectacular there is much, much better value to be had in London. I won't detail the good stuff as it's quite obvious, but a couple of niggles. Firstly the spa is small, and was quite noisy with children despite me deliberately booking a slot after the 'children's hours'. Secondly, literally everything has to be booked in advance - when paying upwards of £600 (room-only) in any establishment it's not unreasonable to expect to have access to most if not all facilities when you want. As a result you can't do anything spontaneous. Glad we tried it and enjoyed the experience, but…"
April 2022,A amazing place,"Had a fabulous time at the Shard today for my daughters birthday. We started at the Viewing Gallery with its fantastic views, had a cocktail from the bar and a laugh with one of the bar staff ( sorry didn’t get your name,  the guy who is studying photography and had a good knowledge of the Samsung S22 pen).  Then we went down to the Gong bar where we had a fantastic time.  The food was lovely, we had the meat bento box, chicken Satay skewers and the truffle fries it was delicious.  The atmosphere was great and the staff were very friendly.  A big shout out to Mo Mo our waiter who made us feel very welcome and went above and beyond to Make our visit special.  We timed our visit to the restaurant  so that we saw London in the daylight then halfway through our visit the sun went…"

The food was amazing, the view from our table spectacular looking over Tower Bridge and towards Canary Wharf, and our waiter, Leon, was fantastic. He was so knowledgeable about each dish and spoke in just the right detail about which ingredients were included in each dish to enhance flavour and taste even further.  It was a lovely experience having a host take the time to talk us through our food choices and how best to enjoy them.  Leon really was exceptional and looked after us so well.  As it was Easter weekend we had the Easter roast set menu. My wife chose corn fed chicken as her main and I had salmon Wellington. Both were delicious.   Highly recommend a visit to Ting and also a stay in the hotel."

April 2022,Worth every penny,"Absolutely fabulous stay from start to finish. The service here is impeccable from the moment you are greeted. Lovely complimentary prosecco on arrival, bags taken to the room promptly, greeted by staff who pass you in the corridor.   We went for the king size city view room on the 49th floor. The views are to die for. Well worth spending the extra money for the view. Spotlessly clean. Extra large bed. Nice touches like binoculars and a map of the city.  Breakfast was beautiful. Everything you could want and more (including even some asian cuisine like bao buns).  Only criticism: 1)  slightly disappointed by a few wear and tear marks in the hotel room and 2) it took 20 mins to check in, even though we arrived at 4pm (when check in should be guaranteed). But I gave this feedback…"

Amazing service from start to finish and we're so truly grateful.   The proposal was everything I had hoped for and so much more. The company I used to help decorate the room was called 'The proposers' who were equally amazing.   After the proposal in the YI room, we stayed the night.

Sadly our room was not ready, but instead they upgraded our room and checked us in straight away.   The gentleman (Josh) on reception could not do any more to help. Making sure this was a special stay just seemed par for the course. We left our bags with the concierge and made our way to the room. WOW!  What a room and the views. Be ready to be wowed.

March 2022,Excellent belated honeymoon,"We were visiting on a belated honeymoon and had a very nice stay. The service was excellent throughout - particularly from Romy who welcomed us and Marta on our departure - while we also particularly enjoyed using the amazing pool and also the breakfast buffet.   Our three course set menu dinner at Ting was good (although the vegetarian spring rolls were a bit bland) and fair value.   The only slight letdown was the cocktail bar Gong, which was overpriced and not up there with some of London’s top bars.   Overall an excellent stay and obviously the views throughout the building are epic!"

March 2022,A real treat,"The stay was for a special occasion and it really is a special place. The drinks, view and staff  in the Gong bar were fantastic. It’s a lot of money and a once in a while treat but can’t wait to come back. There were a few small minor things that surprised me , that were not quite perfect.

December 2021,Amazing room but some improvements needed,"The room, bathroom and views at this hotel are undisputedly stunning and location to London Bridge station is extremely convenient.  However as this hotel charged over £800 per night during our stay, there are definitely areas for improvement:  -Housekeeping times in the evening after 8pm for turn down service or whatever service is too late and inappropriate.  Once I was in the bath and forgot to put on the do not disturb sign, the staff rang twice and proceeded to enter the room.   This was very inappropriate and intrusive at night. Not to mention during Covid times, non-essential entry into rooms should be kept to a minimum unless necessary and turn down service is definitely unnecessary.  This happened 2-3 times during the 3 nights we stayed and was a disturbance.  There…"
March 2022,Lovely lunch!!,"I’ve always liked Thai food, this didn’t disappoint. I had the Cornish Plaice and my guest had chicken with ginger, chilli and rice, plus a gin and tonic each. Great food and views, helpful staff, had a lovely time 😊👍"

From the moment you book to leaving with your suitcases at the very end, nothing is too much trouble for the team and this really makes the experience feel special. We were luckily upgraded to a room with a bath view which was such a nice touch. The room itself is spacious, well-equipped and very comfortable with ample storage space, areas to relax and work (if needs be) and quality amenities such as toiletries, tea and coffee. All of this, you do expect for the cost per night but it is appreciated. The in-room suite pad/tablet is very helpful for any questions surrounding the hotel facilities and the area itself.   The pool and sauna is absolutely…"

Once showed to our seats we were given the ‘welcome tea’ by Harry. This was an amazing experience as once he poured the water, the whole table was covered in a flowing mist. Jing kept checking on us the whole time and as I am gluten free she took extra care in making sure I knew what was in the items served and that they were suitable for me. I had a very special day and would certainly come back. This is by far the best afternoon tea and experience in London!"

March 2022,"Brilliant Staff, really made the difference!!","The staff really made the difference!  Really welcoming and prepared staff. I really need to mention Lucrezia, the hostess at the entrance: she really was such a sweet and prepared staff member, polite and well-mannered. I forgot a shopping bag at the table and realised it when I was in the elevator so I quickly came back: but she was quicker then me! She called the hostess downstairs to warn me about this on my way down. These are little gestures that make you understand when someone in the hospitality sector is really there for you to have a great experience.  We had a pleasant experience, drinks were good but what really makes the difference is when the staff is nice and kind to you. I will deffo come back and I recommend it."
March 2022,Lovely day out,Went for afternoon tea and I could Not recommend it more. The menu is traditional but with a creative twist and you get more than you could finish.

Being vegetarian I find meals can be a hit or a miss but I had the black bean tofu and it was honestly one of the best meals I've had. My husband had the Malaysian Rice which he also enjoyed. Sabrina attended to our every need, it is also my birthday weekend so my dessert came with a happy birthday message as did chocolates at the end of our meal, I felt like they made a fuss of us which made the evening even more special. Nathaniel was our sommelier and made sure our glass was never empty and was extremely attentive. I definitely recommend Ting if you are staying in the Shard or visiting London, the views are amazing, the food delicious, the service fantastic and the views to die for."

February 2022,Party Central,"Stayed in the Sangria-La The Shard with my family for a weekend. Our room had fantastic views over The City. However, a word of warning if you plan to sleep while you are there. The walls are very thin and you can hear every word from the room next door. We had a celebration in the room next door and didn’t get much sleep at night. Good for one night for the view but in my eyes not suitable for a longer stay."
March 2022,Amazing,"Nathaniel and Marie served us on our five course dining experience and both servers were absolutely five star.

February 2022,Shard,Mira gave excellent service and made our experience at the Shard. She was attentive and professional. The cocktails were delicious and the service was fast. Highly recommend for couples as part of an evening.
February 2022,Great time!,Mira was a great host for our table and we had a lovely time. The views were stunning and the cocktails and service was too quality. Mira and the staff were extremely nice and we can’t wait to come back.
February 2022,Wonderful evening,Wonderful food. Service was on point. Nathaniel was great on wine and champagne selections   The view is one of a kind of the London bridge. #35floor  The final cheese on platter n wine a must finished.   Thank you for a memorable evening. 
February 2022,Free-Flowing Champagne brunch,"This was amazing!! Staff and food/drink was amazing and experience as a whole was great. There is a 12.5% service charge to pay when there but the service was perfect so.. I bought this as a surprise for my partner’s birthday via virgin experience, paid to upgrade to free-flowing champagne and have all confirmation emails. Clearly they didn’t upgrade the voucher details as the hotel said they were only valid for the other option of the experience (not free-flowing), even after the waiters speaking with Virgin direct to try and resolve. We ended up paying the difference (over £150) + the service charge. I’d say to book this direct with the hotel, as Virgin are a nightmare and unresponsive."
February 2022,thanks Marj,"We went to have some cocktails at Gong Shangri-La. The staff is super kind! Even though we were running quite late, we were able to stay the full 1h30mins. We especially want to thank Marj for being so kind and helpful! Because of her, we were able to get a window table! The view is amazing."

February 2022,Disappointing,"The hotel itself is different with fantastic views the room was lovely again fantastic views and the staff attentive and friendly the restaurants quality of food was good. The bar however was totally disappointing,in every other hotel I’ve stopped in if you are a resident you can turn up and have a drink within licensing hours at any time with this hotel NOT a chance you have to book in advance. So you’ve had a day round London fancy a quick drink to wind down only to be informed you have to book! Total let down I’m sure we won’t be returning."

February 2022,Night in the clouds,"Had the most amazing stay in the Shard! Such a great location with such lovely staff who would always make sure you had everything you wanted.  We would recommend the liquid afternoon tea at Gong on floor 52. The drinks, food and the views were exquisite.   The pool/ sauna  is also well worth a visit."
February 2022,WOW,"From the moment we stepped out of the car we were treated like Royalty and with the upmost respect by every single member of staff who couldn't do enough for us.   At check in we were greeted by Tyrone who gave us the warmest of welcomes and all the information we needed.    The hotel is spectacular and our room (The Iconic) had us speechless from the moment we opened the door.  The views across London and Tower bridge were absolutely breathtaking and felt almost touchable.  All the luxurious touches in the room, the Shangri-La bed and the bath with a view to name a few were extremely special to us.   The experience of the Skypool and sauna with a coffee was the perfect opportunity to unwind and made us feel so relaxed, and the staff at the Skypool and sauna waiting to hand you…"
November 2021,The views!,The Shangri-La was magical from the moment we stepped through the door. The warm welcome by Arnold on the ground floor and all the way to level 35 where Tyrone at reception welcomed us with open arms. Berta checking us in with a big smile and Ellen and Stefania showing us the hotel with such pride. The room was more than you can expect with views over all of London. All guests have to visit the pool. It’s a one of a kind experience!!! And the lady working at the pool makes you feel like a VIP guest!  We spent the evening in TING. Being welcomed by Rosita and given a beautiful table. The lovely Ketiola looking after us and Kat giving us the best wine recommendation (We still dream about the dessert wines). Spiros made the whole evening with his special attention to us as guests…

The bar, while nice, was perhaps a little expensive and we didn’t get a window seat, which was a bit of a shame (though really not the end of the world). That being said, doesn’t detract from a great visit -  would highly recommend and likely will be back!"

Every member of staff I had the pleasure of meeting was genuinely helpful and exceptionally knowledgeable and polite.  Drinks at Gong are a must! This is a vibrant and bustling bar with sweeping views of the city and dinner at Tien was exceptional. The range of wines available are extensive and the sommelier was well-informed and every one of his choices superbly complemented each dish. The service throughout the hotel was exemplary and faultless. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It truly is utter perfection!

January 2022,Treasured memories,"Booked a 2 night stay for a family celebration. There was a problem with the booking - a “system error” had let me book a room at a too low price . My booking was then cancelled . After calling to complain I did receive a call back. I compromised on the room but we were given complimentary breakfasts .  When we arrived everything was perfect : the room was beautiful - including the written message on the window !!!!  All the staff were friendly , attentive and very professional - loved being handed a towel when getting out the pool, the night turn down service was very much appreciated, midnight requests to the concierge for drink bookings, beautiful breakfast seating and welcome champagne. All 5 of our food/ drink bookings had window tables, this was  amazing - I could sit all…"
January 2022,"Fabulous views (except the view of other people’s bathrooms) but food, drink and service don’t live up to expectations","The one thing that makes this hotel fabulous is the views. The angles of vision of the London skyline are unrivalled and stunning- but aside from that, it’s decidedly mediocre.  There’s nothing that’s truly terribly, but rather lots of things that aren’t ‘right’ for a 5 star hotel, and these really do ruin the overall experience.  The reception area is quite chaotic as it has guests checking into the hotel plus non-residents going to the Sky Lounge or Ting restaurant. Not to mention lots of quite bizarre green mannequins wearing only salopettes!   Someone was pouring small ‘Welcome’ peach Bellinis but during the time we were there checking in (and weren’t actually offered one) the table had more empty, dirty glasses than full ones to take.  Check in took 20 minutes - not…"
January 2022,The best over night stay,I took my girlfriend for her birthday and we both had an outstanding time. The staff both at the Shangri-La reception and Ting were excellent and very helpful and polite. They really made an effort to make sure everything was spot on for her birthday.   The city view room was out of this world and the views were stunning. I can’t wait to come back again. Thank you guys and I appreciate everything you did for us.   AJ
January 2022,Bottomless Champagne Dinner in Sky Lounge,"This experience was amazing, I’ve been to shard a number of times but view from sky lounge was really good and lovely to enjoy it along with good bubbly and food.

January 2022,Great memory,Went with my friends for a drink on floor 52 and had the best time! We felt so welcomed and Momo went out of his way to give us a memorable night! This was a night we’ll be talking about for years to come…
January 2022,Amazing night all thanks to Momo,"Went to the shard with a few of my friends for a drink this evening and we all ended up enjoying every minute. This was all thanks to one man, Momo, who took such great care of us all night including suggesting certain cocktails that we all found to be delicious as well as just being one of the kindest and friendliest  waiters I’ve ever encountered. Can’t wait to come visit again in the future along as Momo will be there. Thank you for making our visit so special!"
January 2022,Momo was an amazing waiter,Momo made our birthday visit much more memorable and the service was impeccable. Definitely a strong asset for Gong Bar. His cocktail knowledge was on point and he made some very good recommendations based on our preferences. Will definitely come back!
January 2022,So. Where do I begin.,"I'll start from the beginning. Trying to arrange something special here is a pain in the bum. Mainly out of the fact that the people I spoke to from Shangri la where rude and obnoxious. I would like to add I don't think they were at the hotel. More of a call centre vibe. We arrived and it is incredible. Very special location and the views are incredible. Emily dealt with us. They double charged my card but assured me one had been cancelled. These things Happen. On this, we left our bags as the room wasn't ready and went shopping, only to find when coming to pay in Harrods that my card has been blocked. Partly the bank. Partly the hotel. Very embarrassing especially in Harrods.  The room. Well. It was incredible. The views are phenomenal, the room was dressed and champagne makes…"
January 2022,Fantastic visit - made perfect by the staff and their wonderful customer service,"We visited on a Sunday at the end of January for my wife’s 40th birthday! From the moment we arrived at the shard, the service was unbelievable! Noni, Fabio, Manuel, Jordan and Simone couldn’t do enough for us, took time to talk through the menu, make recommendations and answer any questions. We didn’t feel rushed and were made to feel comfortable…nothing was too much trouble and the manner of all staff we came into contact with was incredible!   They made an already amazing weekend wonderful! We had received a phone call 2 days prior to the booking and discussed the arrangements. The table was superb and several members of staff wished Katie happy birthday. All the little touches culminated in an unforgettable experience. We strongly recommend the sky lounge and can’t wait to…"

January 2022,Delightful Lunch at TING!,"My first lunch of 2022, was nothing short of delightful. When you enter a restaurant with views offered by the Shard, your expectations start from a high base. The service from both Danny/Marco, combined with the spectacular food (which not only looked great, but tasted even better) was  true hospitality at its best.  We left the restaurant with a big smile plastered on our faces!"

January 2022,Weekend stay,"Went for a birthday  weekend thought I’d paid for the top hotel in london but really disappointed from the time of arrival needs a full update ,from the time you arrive on the ground floor then at the reception its too dark and dingy with fence panels on the walls need new modern welcoming theme experience  All bedroom doors need replacing as as got trolly and suitcase scratches on the bottom half,need more toiletry types and better quality like shoe polish pads and hair brushes,the hair dryer needs to be Dyson not ibis type robes and towels very harsh needs to be soft as stayed at many 5/6 star hotels never like this needs to be Dubai style 6 star for the amount you charge .Need more ambient lighting in corridors,swimming pool should have been the whole floor as only…"

November 2021,So your thinking of booking??,"So your reading this, to see if the shard hotel is worth the expense? Let me a save you the time …. And money!!  honestly No! Lots of nicer hotels in London. I stayed 2 nights and had the 5 course taster meal included in the package (more about that later) I felt the staff were so Fake and some the personality of an oak door. No warmth with the staff at either breakfast or dinner. The room was nice, bottles tap water, for the price your paying would it be hard to supply both Still and sparkling?? No biscuit to have with your tea/ coffee, come across as abit miserable Further cost savings on shower gels etc in bathroom at £750 a night, come on, would it kill ya to put afew more in the bathroom?? Everything unbranded towel bath robes etc?? Luxury… this is not it!! Bathrobe as hard…"

January 2022,"Overall, a lovely chilled weekend.","We recently stayed at the shangri la and it was a very positive experience.  Upon arrival we were asked if help was needed with baggage and directions. It was all very pleasant and felt like people wanted to help rather than doing it because that is their job. At check in there were people arriving at the same time but staff appeared from nowhere so everybody was catered for. Check in was easy and smooth.  We stayed in a premier room with a bathtub that overlooked the city. The views from the rooms are amazing! As the restaurants were booked we ordered room service which arrived a lot quicker than we expected and was possibly the best room service meal I’ve ever had.  We had reservations that evening in the bar on the top floor. Again, amazing views. The bar had a really good…"

What an amazingly opulent place with incredible views from floor 35. Our delightful waiter Alex made us feel very special and made our shared afternoon tea at lunchtime- the only option - an amazing experience. Unlimited supplies of a huge range of hot drinks and several refills of both vegetarian and non vegetarian savouries, scones with generous amounts of jam and cream plus a beautiful selection of exquisite cakes and pastries.

January 2022,Birthday in the sky,"Stayed at the Shangri La Shard for a 30th birthday surprise. Service was great, and Sajeel from guest relations made sure the room was set up as requested, with decorations to make the stay extra special.   Recommend getting the Iconic City View room - fantastic vista over all of London’s top sights, and extremely spacious room, including a large dressing area. Considered upgrading to one of the suites, but I don’t think it was necessary - the room was fab.   Breakfast at Ting was well worth it. Again, great service and went for the full buffet. A delicious selection and had eggs to order from the waiter.   Momo at Gong made us very welcome and supplied perfect cocktails.   The Sky pool was a nice atmosphere, but the water was a little cold.   Leading up to the trip, the guest…"

She had been looking at videos on YouTube of how the shard lit up for the count down and she was looking forward to seeing this in person.

We were made to feel special with every member of staff without exception being professional,  pleasant, polite and helpful. This makes an exceptional hotel experience.  The building is lovely and iconic. Modern clean and calm. Our room on the 40th floor with a 180 degree city view was stunning. Spacious and wonderful. For facilities ensure you book to use the spa, pool and buffet breakfast and dinning at Ting. All meals were wonderful. It's expensive and any extras are also expensive but what a treat."
December 2021,Expected more,"My partner booked this as a Christmas present and tbh this hotel is not 5*  Check in and the swimming pool experience was 5* but the massage experience booked wasn’t by all means 5*  the next morning at breakfast we had been sat for half an hour before someone told us that the buffet was around the corner , by this point the buffet was nearly finished and had been packed up , we had been charged £40 for breakfast that wasn’t eaten! The table we had for breakfast was covered in crumbs and my coffee cup was covered in smears! This really wasn’t what I expected when staying at the Shard! Disappointing stay compared to the resort in Abu Dhabi"
December 2021,Surprise Proposal!,I had booked a proposal dining in the sky at the shard.. everything was run on the day by Jackie… everything went smoothly and it was a perfect evening! love sunraj and ria xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
December 2021,"5 🌟,  my a##","1. Room smelt of human facies.  2. Tried to hide the smell with horrendous perfume which made it much worse.  3. Asked to move and was told by management there is a more expensive room which they wanted me to pay 90% towards. 4. Management actually said take it or leave it. 5. The room was the ironic at £1,100 per night 😂 6. Hired professional photographers to take just pictures of my wife and I and the management asked them to leave.  7. Ordered room service.  Food was a joke , such poor quality.  8. I still tried to keep going so I tried room service again and after 45 minutes I phoned and they said they forgot my order. 9. I decided to leave at 12.30 pm but only after management insisted I pay £300 . Enough said"
December 2021,Another lovely stay at this lovely hotel.,"I have stayed at the Shangri-la previously with family but I took my friend a couple of weeks ago for our annual Christmas jolly and it was wonderful again.  All the staff were lovely,  friendly and professional too. We booked to swim in the infinity pool when is a fantastic experience. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay exceptional and magical."
December 2021,"A huge huge thank you to our host Nathaniel and hostess Ketiola. This visit was by far the best experience, ever!","Amazing food and service all round. Cannot recommend the 3 course taster menu enough. With this being a birthday gift, our experience was topped off with delicious wine and some extra treats, courtesy of our compassionate host Nathaniel! Never to be forgotten experience."
December 2021,Shangri La service - getting things right,"Creating the right atmosphere in a hotel - especially one in a tourist landmark - is a tricky thing.  Our stand out example of how to get it right was during a late lunch where menu menu items not available at that hour were made available and then via terrific advice from sommelier Danny, paired perfectly with a white wine and an extraordinary sherry.  Great to see that the hotel is not just relying on its location and views across London."
December 2021,Afternoon tea with a view,We enjoyed a champagne afternoon tea with a view! Not only a great location but also an excellent quality afternoon tea enhanced by excellent service and a surprise element of theatre. Big thanks to Danny who was very attentive and really looked after us.
December 2021,Great experience,"Was an amazing experience, Momo was great and helped us with the mocktail option. We went for our 10 anniversary and was offered with complimentary shorts. Food is decent, we have veg maki and prawn tempura. Views are breathtaking from the 52 floor."
December 2021,Service :),"Momo was great. Very friendly, attentive and professional! First time at Gong restaurant and would certainly be back! Thankyou so much for making us feel comfortable and a relaxed visit- very much appreciated"
December 2021,Nomo- Shangri la,"Momo was a brilliant host and looked after me and my friend for the evening, I would highly recommend as the service was excellent. We would definitely come back in the near or distant future. Thank you momo"
December 2021,Best hotel we have ever stayed in!,"We cannot put into words how amazing this hotel is. Blown away from the moment we arrived. Unparalleled customer service, astonishing views and the most luxurious room we have seen. All in all, an incredible stay!  Thank you also for keeping my proposal discreet and allowing me to propose in private.   10/10!"
January 2021,One of the nicest hotels I've ever seen!,"I stayed at the Shangri-La at The Shard with my fiancé as I wanted a super nice hotel stay because I was going to propose to her at ""The View From The Shard"" later that night.  Staying here was ABSOLUTELY the right choice and even though it was very expensive, I would do it again in a hear beat!  The room and the view were unbelievable and the staff (during the stay AND before) were so helpful and accommodating and wonderful!  I had tons of questions about booking dining reservations, tea, etc, and everyone was always so willing to help.  My fiancé forgot her hair dryer and the concierge said they would send someone to the store to get one for her if we needed!  I was on the fence about paying the high price to stay here but one of my good friends had been before and said DO IT,…"
December 2021,Perfect experience,"Most amazing experience, can only recommend. Very good wine and food advice. We checked into the Hotel and chose to have dinner at Ting, we will definitely be back for more good wine and food here. Ask for Carlos and Nathaniel for good advice."
December 2021,Date night,"We booked Gong bar while on a weekend break in London. Our first visit to the Shard did not disappoint, giving breath taking views of the city skyline from a perspective you cannot get anywhere else in London. Special mention to Dhillon at Gong who looked after us superbly and went out of his way to show us around the bars sky pool and other amazing facilities. He is a credit to Shangri-La. We will be back as soon as we can."
December 2021,Special Xmas visit,"Booked Ting Restaurant for our stay in London for a couple of days from Cornwall and it was the Best, made in no small effort by our great attendant Gianni. Thank you Gianni, won't forget you and hope you have a great time with your Grandad in Greece.."
December 2021,Singapore U.K. Association Christmas celebration,"SUKA Christmas lunch  Shangrila at the Shard Ren room  SUKA (Singapore UK Association) members and friends  celebrated our much anticipated post lockdown pre-Christmas at the Ren room Shangrila recently. Dressed to the hilt to blend with the posh, plush ambiance, as global foodies, we expected the best at the table. The GM, Kurt Macher and his well trained team were there to greet us. Table settings tastefully arranged , complete with classy Christmas crackers.  The Christmas buffet was meticulously selected to match the magnificent panoramic views as the backdrop to our gathering. We had starter of delicate  smoked salmon with crème fraiche , vegetarians had roasted squash with figs and walnut salad. This was  followed by succulent Norfolk turkey roasted to perfection, with all…"

December 2021,"Ren Room - Shangri-La The Shard, London","I have been to the Chinese restaurant a few times but most recently, on December 4th, 2021 was for our Christmas Lunch organised by SUKA (Singapore UK Association) @ Ren Room with their signature chandeliers and a grandiose view overlooking the London Bridge and surrounding areas.  The staff was very courteous and helpful from the doorman to the cloakroom and service staff.  What was very good to note was that all diners had to show proof of negative results of lateral flow tests.  In spite of his busy schedule, the General Manager, Mr. Kurt Macher, took time to address our party.  The table decorations were beautiful, with scrumptious food, desserts, and drinks served by friendly staff.  All in all, a beautiful lunch and an experience shared by a party of over 80.  The lift was…"
December 2021,Fab Evening Superb Food,Superb food served by equally superb staff. I’m sorry I didn’t catch ladies name but her recommendations were great especially Crepe Suzette. Great evening in difficult times. The view is WOW directly overlooking tower bridge. Felt very safe during these strange COVID times.
December 2021,Amazing night!!!,Came here to celebrate our 30s night! Panos and Tomaso made our night really special! They were both very professional and their cocktails were amazing! Also great view. Will definitely come back here.
December 2021,Another Fantastic Meal and Experience,We have staying at the Shangri-La Shard since 2014 obviously that speaks volumes we haven’t wrote a review for a while but thought it was important to acknowledge how fantastic the Ting restaurant is we would also like to say a special Thankyou to Giannis and Kat who went the extra mile to ensure our experience was not only faultless but memorable with exceptional service.
December 2021,Ting restaurant,"This was a very special night, Retirement and Birthday as a surprise from my husband  The setting is just stunning… perfect.. despite the low cloud. 🙄 Our service was excellent from Guannis an absolute sweetheart.

December 2021,Tired room and stolen valuables - terrible customer service - AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Stayed at the Shangri-La-Shard Hotel for a birthday / anniversary. I was given a special NHS discounted rate which was really appreciated and probably the only reason I was able to stay here and I was very thankful for this. I have looked forward to this trip for months, having worked for the last 18 months non stop.   Upon check in, we were greeted by an amazing friendly lady on the front desk who checked us in, she booked us a slot in the sky pool and made a reservation at Gong Bar for cocktails and food. So far so good. We changed for the pool and left our room (cakes were left in the room while we were gone) again, lovely touch. The view was incredible, food beautiful. And cocktails pricey but a nice treat.   Now for the bad, the bed headboard had rips in, see pictures. The…"
December 2021,Afternoon Tea at Ting,"The afternoon tea was a fabulous experience enhanced by great customer service from Sam and Nathaniel. Nothing was too much trouble. The food was delicious, particularly the Scones. I would definitely recommend !"

December 2021,My Visit to the Gong restaurant,I recently visited The Gong restaurant with my girlfriend and the service was incredible. In particular Dhillon made the experience very special and was excellent the whole time we stayed. He was very polite and approachable.
December 2021,What a fabulous stay,"From arrival to departure it was simply sensational in the hotel. The friendliness and how eager the people are to pamper the guests is really unbelievable.

December 2021,"Great bar, lovely views, thank you Dhillon!","Dhillon was our server and he was brilliant, very attentive and friendly and made the whole experience even better. Views, food and drink were all breathtaking, but the service was the best part. Excellent 10/10"

All the staff were so accommodating, we managed to check in early as we had lunch  reservations at Aqua Shard. Booked a great couples massage too, although they are an external company.  Worth a stay for a big celebration and the Christmas decor is beautiful"
December 2021,Bath with the views of tower bridge -4903,"Room 4903 - bathtub and room with views of tower bridge    Phenomenal hotel  Phenomenal service  From arriving in the car we were greeted with the most amazing friendly / helpful concierge staff members who collected luggage and parked the car - I wish I had individual names (I will go back and find out then update this because you guys were amazing)   From checking in we were met with Josh who looked after us the full weekend of our first stay in October then again as we arrived in December be recognised us and we felt very well looked after, id go as far to say we were treated like royalty.   Breakfast buffet is one of the best I have had in my hotel stay experiences, quality and the attention to detail is outstanding.  The service staff again were beyond offering a 5 star…"
December 2021,"Amazing stay, where the staff go above and beyond","Stayed for a night for our babymoon. We were greeted by friendly, happy and helpful staff. Our room was impeccable, with the most incredible view of London I have ever seen. Beds were perfect, incredibly comfortable and the perfect place for laying and just watching the world below. The bath was so amazing I had 3 in one night! My husband and I were blown away by the attention to detail and the way Kurt the general manager and his staff went above and beyond to make us feel special. I think the best thing about the hotel (despite the obvious views etc) is that such a high end hotel in such a serious looking building once you walk through the doors it feels so welcoming, comfortable and relaxing, a huge difference to some of the other London hotels of the same standard  which can…"
December 2021,Ting Ting merrily on high,Festive cheer greets you at the door and the experience continues the whole way. Smiles and cheery faces greet you. Had lunch in Ting it was superb.

Highly recommend! Can’t wait to go back again 😊"
December 2021,Anniversary Dinner,"My husband and I celebrated our 28th wedding Anniversary here and everyone specially Nathaniel and Michael were amazing.

December 2021,Great view and excellent staff!,I went for a cocktail with my husband and the table was at the back. But thanks to Marj and Mira 5 minutes after our arrival we had a new table at the front so we could relax and enjoy the outstanding view from the Gong restaurant along with our great cocktails! Thank you guys! You made our night magical!
December 2021,Thoroughly recommendable,"We had our Christmas Dinner at TING with Giannis as our unobtrusively attentive waiter. The entire staff was very friendly and quick, waiting times were minimal and made pleasant by the wintry Alpine decor.   The food arrived quickly and fully met our expectations with the small dishes (appetizers) exceeding them (Tuna tartare, Roasted chestnut salad).   Try to get a window table (those are in the minority) as the view and the slanted floor-to-ceiling windows of the Shard add significantly to the overall experience. Don’t miss out on the bathrooms, either."
December 2021,Dinner Lost in London,A special dinner. Good champagne and delicious plates. Great service from a great host Sabrina. The view is of course gorgeus and spectacular over Tower Bridge City of London is great with a cup of champagne  Alessandra & Andrea
December 2021,Great experience,"Ordered a few cocktails and they were very nice, wine was good and the view is absolutely incredible. Nicollo provided really good service and was very attentive, knew his sake would come back again! If you have the money while in London it has to be done."

We have been to lots of restaurants and Sam was definitely the top one. Thank you and thank you Sam he is a credit to the place. Also would recommend the pork belly"
December 2021,Perfection,"We literally couldn't believe how amazing this hotel was. we arrived pretty late and the checked in very fast. we got our nice room with nice views. room was spacey, very clean with big bathroom. the next day we had our spa and it was exceptional. pool was a bit cold but thats not a problem. all the staff were extremely helpful. we will come back"
December 2021,A must visit place in London,"Amazing service, even grater view, but above all you have to ask for Dhillon, the waiter. He will make a special evening a one to remember! You can talk about great venues as much  as you like, but great service goes a long way. Me and my fiancée’s evening so enjoyable.   10/10"
December 2021,Did NOT meet the expectations !!!,"I booked an Iconic City View room as a surprise long weekend stay at Shangri-La, The Shard, London to celebrate our first year anniversary thinking that it would be as memorable as possible - but not all the boxes were ticked.  Let me first start with the positives:  1. Obviously the view from the room is beautiful, especially during the night. If for nothing, you can just stay in your room and watch the city beneath your feet. 2. The Skypool was warm and I really enjoyed the quiet time we had at midday. At some point we had the room just for ourselves. 3. The Sauna next to the pool needs to be experienced as well - it has beautiful London views.  Now for the negatives (the bits that almost hurt me not being done/provided).  1. No personalised message card in the room or written…"
December 2021,Lovely afternoon tea,Brilliant way to spend the afternoon. Delicious savouries and sweet options. Fantastic view of London from our window table. Excellent personal service from our waitress Jing. We will definitely be back. Tower Bridge has just lit up in the dusk bringing the afternoon to a wonderful conclusion.

Their recommended us about food and cocktails and everything was amazing! I want to thank you Luis, Momo and Marj + Mada, you’re awesome guys❤️👑"
December 2021,Wonderful 5 course menu,"From the moment you walk in you know this will be a treat. The venue and view are spectacular. We chose to go for a 5 course menu.  Emilio was extremely attentive and a wonderful waiter. Please ensure you get Nathaniel's advise on what wine to have, as they recommend a fabulous malbec which capped off a brilliant birthday treat. We were very lucky and got seated at a window so the view was amazing. Food was excellent with particular highlight of the Banana and Chocolate dessert."
December 2021,Excellent ambience and service.,Great view and ambience and fantastic service from Momo who was very attentive and great at suggesting drinks!!  Will definitely return to experience more of the bespoke cocktails.   Merry Xmas everyone!!!

Special mention to Spiros, Alan, Alexandru, Vincent, Jacek and Kwok Hung Chan who helped make the occasion even more special. Great team effort from all those involved, would definitely recommend and visit again!!"
December 2021,Amazing Views,"We have just returned from two nights at The Shard celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. What an amazing place with amazing views. Staff are friendly. Food in Ting is wonderful.  It's lovely to sit in your room with the blinds up and look out across London. However, a word of warning - anyone staying in a room ending in 15, your reflection can be seen in the ""wing"" of glass that sticks out to the side, meaning those staying in a room ending in 14 can, let's just say, see a bit more than they expected too 😉."
December 2021,Cocktail with a View,"Fantastic service, we were looked after by Momo who was so accommodating and very sweet. Great cocktails - recommend the Mango & Wine!  The view of course is amazing! We had a view from our table of both the skyscrapers and London Bridge! Amazing to see the River Thames from that height too!"
December 2021,Great,"Amazing view of Tower Bridge and delicious cocktails ❤️ Momo is the best waiter, he even spoke in Russian with my patents (who don’t speak English) ! Really appreciate his service and help to make their wedding anniversary special. Thank you 🙏"
December 2021,Brilliant experience with madalina and co,Amazing experience I can’t believe they sorted us a table at the window and I got engaged without me knowing anything!!! Thank you so much everyone so brilliant making ir so special for us! We didn’t book in advance and they managed to make room for us! I would recommend booking in advance though because how brilliant this place is xx
September 2021,5* Surprise....,Fabulous surprise for our son!! He’s been desperate to visit The Shard so we decided to go all out and stay at the hotel for the weekend!! Fantastic choice... everything was 5* and all the staff we had dealings with was brilliant although I have read reviews which say otherwise!! Lovely breakfast with the best view!! We will 100% be back :-))))
December 2021,Superb!,"I booked a night at The Shard for my boss and her friend to celebrate her 60th birthday and wanted to ensure everything was right as it was a special occasion.  My boss was amazed by the staff, service and the organisation. They highly recommended drinks in Gong, afternoon tea in Ting and really appreciated how special The Shard Team made them feel.  It was a superb stay and the team were a delight to deal with."
December 2021,Wonderful Birthday Stay in Room 4410,"This hotel never fails to amaze us, we were celebrating my middle fifties birthday and we experienced a fantastic stay, from the moment you depart the taxi to the warm welcome throughout the entire hotel this place ticks boxes where others seem to fail. We had a lovely corner room with ab extremely open bath which my wife thoroughly enjoyed bathing whilst admiring the view of St Pauls and beyond. This was our second stay at the hotel and their covid protocol is in place and policed professionally. We enjoyed early evening drinks in the top floor bar and we also indulge breakfast in the ting restaurant which we had the buffet and set us up for the day. We would return in seconds and we both look forward to visiting again one day in the future. Thanks for all your surprises and…"
December 2021,Superb experience!,I think everyone should experience staying at this hotel. From check-in to checkout were very well looked after and the service was just superb! I will definitely comeback. It was worth the price. Jenny at the restaurant was very accommodating and helpful.
December 2021,Mesmerising view and service throughout,"From start to finish every single member of staff we encountered went over and above to make our stay that much more amazing. Everything from check in to the sommelier. The room was beautifully prepared with champagne and a choice of exceptional desserts on arrival and the astonishing beauty of the room and the view speak for itself. Both our dinner and breakfast were extremely impressive with everything we could have wanted in a menu, and it was enjoyed with breathtaking views of London of course.  We woke up to the most magical sunrise over London because the rooms are designed so perfectly. The staff left us as speechless as the room and the view."
June 2021,Commendation,"This review is long overdue. We were supposed to stay at Shangri-la at the Shard June 2-3,2021 but my surgery coincided with the dates so I ended up cancelling it. Before that we have originally planned to stay at the Shard November 2020 but due to COVID-19, it was rescheduled. This post is for all of the wonderful staff who painstakingly answered all my queries and accommodated my requests. I greatly appreciate the excellent customer service and I’d definitely give it a 100%. I wish we’ll be able to book and stay at your wonderful hotel in 2022 and experience such world class service. You have such great staff which is a good reflection and standard of the hotel.  Thank you Kanwal Jeet, Carmen, Kimberley x"
November 2021,Memorable and magical,"The Shangri-La occupies a beautiful and dominant space within the Shard, London. The building is iconic and the hotel is exquisite. Walking through the doors is like stepping into a world of luxury and elegance. We were lucky enough to see the Christmas decor as our stay was end of November. The staff are warm and welcoming. It’s is not a cheap option. To be so luxurious is costly, so don’t not go here looking for a bargain- quite the contrary. Expect that you will spend alot of money, and be happy with the memories that this spend makes.  We spent 7 months organising a private party split into 3 elements throughout the weekend. The events manager handled all my requests with grace and knowledge. Lucia guided me hand in hand to ensure the events went smoothly and worry-free for…"
December 2021,Beautiful hotel and excellent service,Beautiful views from the hotel room and the spa located on the 52nd floor. Excellent service by the hotel staff who were incredibly polite and helpful and a special thank you to Kimberly from the front of house team who made our stay extra special.
December 2021,Great service by Jenny! Food outstanding.,Went for a festive afternoon tea. Jenny was our waitress and she was absolutely fantastic! Made the experience even better! Great food quality with a fully plant based afternoon tea option - as a vegan this was a great touch and was delicious. Views always a winner!
December 2021,Incredible service!,I cannot fault the service! Marjorie (apologies if misspelt) was absolutely incredible! She truly gave 10/10 service and cared for everyone in the room! Thank you Gong for having us! The food and drink were out of this world too :)

All in all, it was a very delightful experience!"
December 2021,An Fabulous Experience!,Just returned from an unforgettable stay at Shangri La @ the Shard. It was our 20th Wedding anniversary ..  it had been arranged by my mum and a couple of her friends.  We rarely get to experience such luxury and the staff here went over and beyond our expectations to make this a truly memorable and wonderful experience.  We were given a magnificent deluxe city view room and greeted with ''Happy Anniversary'' balloons across the wall and another anniversary message  written across the windows with stunning city views. The huge bathroom was luxurious with heated floor and toilet seat !! Sitting by the window overlooking the city by night was a sight to enjoy indeed  We decided to dine in for all our meals and were so glad we did. Not only did it allow us to maximise our stay in…
December 2021,Lovely experience,"Nathaniel is so helpful in terms of wine selection. Danny was a nice guy who is very particular with details of our orders.

December 2021,Excellent food and service,Lovely lunch with friends. We enjoyed the food so much. Serving is just enough to fill our hungry stomach 😂.

All in all very pleased with the service and excellent  service from the team. Thank you!

December 2021,"Stellar food, service, and view","I had afternoon tea with friends at Ting for my birthday and had such a wonderful time there. The food and the tea (especially the Shangri-la blend) were exquisite, and were presented in a very dainty manner. Thanks to Sabrina's suggestion, we also managed to try their winter tea which was heavenly. The service was awesome, and everyone was very warm and welcoming especially Jordeen, Masaki, and Ismail. Despite having masks on, you just know that they were doing their job with a smile. The spectacular view of London from where we sat was the cherry on top. The whole experience definitely made my birthday extra special."
December 2021,Birthday diner,I went here for my girlfriends birthday dinner and had a spectacular night. The staff were amazing and so kind.

November 2021,"Awesome view, amazing service!","We went to Ting to celebrate our friends birthday. Everyone we have encountered greeted us warmly and we can tell that behind their masks, they were smiling too. The environment looked busy but it doesnt affect the way they attended to us. They were keen to our needs and took action in a timely manner which we appreciate much.  Spending time there with friends while together appreciating the scenic view of London was such a great experience that we want to do it again in especially because of the remarkable service that we had.  Special thanks to Jordeen, very sweet and thoughtful. We have beautiful view from our table. To Carlos for the service. Jacek for the delightful cocktails. Nathaniel and Masaki for the wine service. They even took lovely pictures of us that night. You…"

Excellent and attentive service from Jing, delicious food, wonderful hospitality with food generously replenished throughout. Perfect for couples and special occasions but also really accommodating to little ones too, going out their way to keep them busy and comfortable.

November 2021,Momo is the best,Had a great afternoon at the Gong bar at the Shard. We were looked after a shining light called Momo! Very attentive and made our birthday celebrations extra special! He kept the drinks flowing and was kind enough to take photos on our phones for us. If you go to the Gong - ask for Momo!
November 2021,Great server,Momo was really kind and friendly. He was very attentive and made sure we had a good time at the Gong bar. Not stuffy at all!  Thé Gong bar itself was very pretty with an amazing panoramic view of London and relaxed atmosphere. I would say that the whole experience at Shangri-La at the Shard was a little bit lacklustre compared to other Shangri-La locations.

November 2021,Date night,Momo was very friendly and gave us lots of good suggestions on drinks! I would recommend asking about drinks you like and he can suggest a variant of that drink. Otherwise the view was amazing and overall service was splendid.

The view was amazing and there was a Christmas theme throughout the hotel which made it that extra bit special for them. Highly recommend
December 2020,Worst Customer Service Known to Man,Absolutely disgraceful customer service. Made an error on a booking and was told there was nothing that could be done about it and that the booking was non refundable. Was told three times they would call me to discuss the situation and never had one call returned. Due to this I will never stay at this hotel when your spending £900 a night you would expect to be treated a little better. Clearly profit over loyalty is how this group role.
November 2021,Birthday,We had an amazing birthday night. Nathanial and Danny showed great hospitality and should be rewarded for their efforts. They have been very helpful from the start with great people skills! We will recommend Ting
November 2021,Amazing,The food was delicious and the service was amazing.  The desserts were a bonus- great end of our London trip.  The view was spectacular to say the least.  Definitely a must if you are visiting London… 😊 thank you
November 2021,Well worth a visit,I booked this following a recommendation from a friend for my husbands birthday (65th) We were greeted with a “happy birthday” on arrival and from that point onwards it was a fabulous experience  Plenty of food and champagne (with mock tails for me) and the facility to take home what you couldn’t eat  The staff were brilliant and couldn’t do enough for us - thank you to “Michael” for making my husbands afternoon such an experience
November 2021,The Shard afternoon tea,Very good and professional service . Polite and attentive service by Emilio. Great person to have helping us. Was considerate to what we wanted and didn’t rush us. Very clean resturant and the music was perfect

November 2021,The gong bar,We went to the gong bar as a family due to a long awaited Christmas visit since Covid and when we arrived we was welcomed by the most amazing waiter Momo who made sure we was comfortable and felt welcomed and very attentive and also very informitive on the menu and had a great Sense of humour which made us feel very comfortable to the point of which we ordered a extra bottle because of the fabulous service we highly recommend momo and we definitely will be returning again thankyou for all your help and laugher we throughly enjoyed every moment of our experience xx
November 2021,Perfect Wedding Day,"Had stayed at the hotel previously for a birthday so when we had to cancel our wedding abroad on short notice and move it to London, we picked the Shangri-La based on our previous experience.  The day exceeded our expectations and the staff did an amazing job for our wedding reception. The room was perfect, the food was excellent and above all, the staff were extremely helpful (our glass was never empty!).   Special shout out to Adrian, Tanveer and Gabi for looking after us on the day. They worked tirelessly and nothing was ever too much. Also thanks to Marta for organising the whole day, it could not have gone any better!"
November 2021,Stunning Shangri La,"What an experience… We were very kindly hosted by the Shangri-La and everything was just amazing. The views, the bar, the restaurant, the food and drink, the breakfast, and most importantly the outstanding service.  Marco and Leon looked after us during our dinner and couldn’t have offered a better service, they were particularly attentive in helping me with the menu as I’m gluten-free (coeliac) and explained every dish and how they could be modified and made me feel super comfortable with everything that I ate.  I really would very much recommend the Shangri-La if you get the opportunity to stay or to visit the bar or to visit the restaurant then you most definitely should! A very special thank you to Max who was our wonderful host."
November 2021,Ting dinner,"Amazing dinner at the Ting, we got a table with an amazing view of the Tower Bridge. The food was delicious.

We had the 3 course menu.   I decided to take my team out for a meal to celebrate a promotion and we were not disappointed !!!!!   The food was wonderful! We were looked after 3 wonderful members of team.   Thank you to Marco , Emilio and Nathanial for the most wonderful service. Thank you to team for everything that you do to go the extra mile."
November 2021,Great service from momo!,"Amazing service, great recommendations from Momo!  Lots of exciting cocktails options and some lovely food but Momo was the best part of the experience!  Strawberry daiquiri was really good and so was the negroni! We came for my husbands birthday, it was very special."
November 2021,Lovely bar at Gong,"Momo was a perfect waiter. Would return to experience his services again.  The negroni cocktails at Gong were fantastic, I loved the nibbles that we were given too. The bar wasn’t too busy either so we didn’t need to wait too long to head up to the 52nd floor for the bar."
November 2021,Ting Restaurant Wonderful,"Would recommend to anyone. Fair price, amazing views, fab food and staff were lovely. Big thumbs up to Feona for the great table and Giannis for the service. Both great people and a credit to the establishment."
November 2021,Great atmosphere.,"Cocktails and food were very nice and it has a nice atmosphere. Staff were very polite and helpful. We were served by momo and he was very nice and explained some of the drinks and food and when one of the drinks I wanted wasn't available, he suggested another drink which was great."
November 2021,Cocktails with a view,"Amazing views over london in a really chilled out space. Momo was our server and was super friendly and attentive to our table. Cocktails were amazing, friendly service! Loved the whole experience. A must in london."
November 2021,Amazing experience,Ting restaurant food was superb and Giannis was a delight all evening! We were kindly moved to a window table upon request even though they were fairly busy. Definitely will be going back! Highly recommended.
November 2021,First class from check-in to check-out,"We stayed at the Shangri-La for my 40th birthday. From the moment we arrived we were treated to first class luxury and that continued throughout our stay. Our room on the 44th floor was incredible, with a huge comfortable bed and amazing views over London, including The City.  Also the first hotel I've ever stayed in that has heated toilet seats!    Breakfast in the Ting restaurant was great, as was the meal we ate there in the evening. We enjoyed a couple of visits to the infinity pool and sauna on the 52nd floor, again with great views across the city - especially at sunset.   Free late check out to 1pm fit with our travel itinerary and we genuinely felt that nothing was too much trouble for the warm and friendly staff who catered to our every need."
November 2021,Night out,"We visited for drinks with our daughter as a treat for our trip to LONDON. Best views and top customer services. The beautiful girl in a red dress Marjorie accomodate as to thebest table ever, very nice and helpful. Madalina was our waitresses, helped us to choose the best drinks, very knowledge, she make us to have best decisions. Definitely recommend!!! BEST CUSTOMERS SERVICES EVER!!!!"
November 2021,"Great view, moments of amazing service, over priced charges underpinned by the customer not being priority…..","Valet service on arrival was excellent. Welcome from staff was genuinely warm and we were directed to the 35th floor. Another good welcome from a gentleman (cannot remember his name) but he suggested we do the check-in process and once our room was ready they would call us.   At checkin with Joshua (who was very professional and good humoured) we were given a sheet with information about the pool, bar etc.  We received a call within 30 minutes to advise our room was ready. A deluxe city view - which was amazing.   The room was spacious, well laid out. Whilst we weren’t in the room to watch TV many of the channels had no signal. The iPad with all of the room details also wasn’t working properly.    The bathroom had shower, bath, heated flooring and very hot toilet seat. Good…"
November 2021,Drink with a view & the kids,"Had a wonderful time at Gong. Me, my husband and our children 9 and 11 arrived at the entrance of the Shard and was quickly temp checked and shown to the lifts up to Gong. A lovely guy came in the lift with us as he was taking someone’s suitcases up to level 35, he made us feel welcomed and chatted to us, putting my sons mind at rest as he was worried about being so high up. He then showed us to the next lift that took you up to Gong on level 52. We were greeted by a lady that took us to our table. The view was amazing. A friendly man took our order of drinks and kindly made the children a mocktail each. He made us feel very relaxed as I was previously concerned it wasn’t the place for children but actually they went out of their way to make us feel welcomed. This all added to…"
November 2021,Second year Anniversary,"The restaurant is gorgeous the staff expecially Giannis are very helpful made sure we have everything, they are very polite,kind. I proposed to the love of my life here and it was the best dicision to choose Ting restaurant. Thank you Giannis again"

November 2021,Amazing as always,"My favorite bar in London from the first time I’ve been and it has never disappointed me.

Will be back as always."

November 2021,Unforgettable experience! Can't wait to come back!,"Where do I even start?! From the moment we walked in it was nothing short of magical. We arrived to a stunning sunset with live music in the background and the most friendly yet professional welcome by the reception team. We were checked in by Kimberley, and greeted by the Duty Manager Johan. Both are a credit to the hotel. When we got to the room we were overwhelmed by the views (of course), but also by the many little touches that have been arranged as a surprise for our stay. In the evening we visited GONG for some fantastic cocktails and great atmosphere, followed by an unforgettable dinner in TING. The table, the team, the food and the wine,...everything was perfect!! In the morning we once again visited TING for breakfast and no wish was left unfulfilled! Finally, as we…"

November 2021,"Beautiful views, great service and yummy cocktails","We had the lovely Niccolò serve us, very welcoming, took some great photos of us and even moved us to a window seat when one free'd up- bonus! Cocktails were well made and when we asked for one to be less Bourbony they accommodated this request without problems. Great evening thank you!"
November 2021,Outstanding service!,I never write these reviews although my stay in the Shangri-La- was such a stand out that it deserved to be the exception. From the booking experience through to checking out procedure the service was phenomenal. We were personally looked after by Josh who was one of the most considerate and professional front of house team that I have ever come across in 20 years of travel. His attention to our stay alone will cement our return to the property. If you get the chance to experience the London suite - you will have a bath like no other!
October 2021,Iconic hotel with amazing views,"The hotel itself is just amazing - superb, large and luxurious rooms with stunning views over London. We had a suite with a bath overlooking London - photo opportunities galore! The bed was super-comfy and the bathroom was large and luxurious. The Gong bar was an expensive experience - but I suppose I should have expected that - it’s the highest bar in Western Europe and is almost bound to carry a premium. It’s a bit further away from central London than I’d thought so we had quite a taxi bill by the end of the stay. Breakfast in the room, looking out over London, was a treat and thoroughly enjoyable. I’ve wanted to stay at this hotel for a while and it’s easy to see why it’s fully booked so far in advance. During our stay there were a few issues related to points of detail but…"
November 2021,Gong Bar! Shangri-La London,"Momo is lovely, told us about some amAzing cocktails which we thoroughly enjoyed!  Excellent service, and great fun evening, the staff made it the best, very hospitable.   Will definitely be coming back, and enjoying the beautiful views and Momos recommendations!

November 2021,Miss Anastasia,"Stunning view, wonderful selection of drinks, and caring service. The drinks and food are at the top standard. I think the rule is that everyone has 1,5 hour expected stay at the booked table. But we felt welcomed and everyone was making sure we enjoy every minute of our evening. Thank you Momo for advising the cocktails."
November 2021,Wonderful,"Fantastic evening, Momchil was an excellent host! Highly recommended. The food was wonderful and the champagne was excellently prepared and well served. The lifts were also an experience in themselves"

September 2021,Shockingly bad.  Hugely disappointing,Always wanted to stay at The Shard Shangri La.    To celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary my husband booked  a luxurious room. for one night  Babysitters organised we were so excited to celebrate such a special occasion.   After checking  in we were told that we were not able to go to the residence bar as it was full.  We didn't come to stay in a hotel and have to sit in the room all night.  To make matters worse the manager told us that we wouldn't be reimbursed due to their 24 hr cancellation policy.  After arguing for 30 minutes finally we were reimbursed.  What poor customer service and lack of compassion.  My husband had informed the hotel of our anniversary on booking and again  on our arrival.  Rather than enjoy the views with Champagne in the bar we left after arguing …
November 2021,Unforgettable experience,"We, as an organisation at London, hosted our annual conference last Thursday in Ren Room at Shangri-La, with 150 guests. It was a fantastic run. Lulu Jenks, Senior Sales, Banqueting Team Dian & Jordan, have given us great helps to ensure the event going well. We really appreciate that. The iconic landmark building, the view over the river, the facilities & services, all are the second to none! All the hotel staffs are friendly and patient. We and the guest enjoyed a great night and we certainly will host next big event in the same place again."

September 2021,Our amazing wedding day!!,"The Shangri-La is a beautiful hotel with top-in-class service.   In the middle of Covid our initial wedding venue fell through on us and we initially jokingly said 'Of all of the places to get married wouldn't it be a crazy experience if you could get married in the shard' and we are so glad we looked into it and that we were able to turn this into a reality through the Shangri-La!!  Marta at the Shangri-la really did what she could to enable us to have the most amazing day! We can only say that the rolling views are only just beaten by the service provided to us through the dedicated events team.  From our first conversations around planning, which were an absolute breeze, to the tasting (which was so dedicated and focused on us as a couple!!) and then to the wedding itself,…"
November 2021,Birthday Afternoon tea experience,"Jing was amazing and really attentive. I felt looked after and spoilt. Food was really good, had constant refills of scones and tea.

November 2021,Simply Spectacular,"Truly amazing stay for my father’s 70th Birthday celebrations with our extended family. The views and venues at this hotel speak for themselves, but it was the staff who totally made our experience extraordinary.  Across the board, the staff were exceptionally attentive to our every need, with thoughtful personalisations and taking the time to remember small details.  When something hadn’t quite gone as expected, the team were reactive and immediately helped to get us back on track.  We Would like to give special thanks to Tyrone, Roland, Francesco and the team at Ting who went out of their way to ensure my father had the time of his life!"

We were served and tended to by Nathaniel and Marie who went above and beyond to accommodate us and make sure we had the best experience. It began with them moving us to a seat with a beautiful view at the beginning of the night, to serving us complimentary treats at the end of the night. The food was divine - we recommend the Malaysian fried chicken and the chocolate and banana tart. Overall a lovely experience and we will definitely be back."
November 2021,60th Birthday Cocktails at The Shard,"I was lucky enough to be treated to cocktails at the Shangri-La Restaurant on the 35th floor, and also at the Gong Bar on the 55th. The Shangri-La is a very glamorous venue with stunning views of our beautiful capital city. We felt welcomed, and made to feel special, by excellent and attentive waiting staff. The cocktails were fabulous too! It was a memorable evening.   Thank you, Denise & Debbie 😍"
November 2021,Special Birthday treat for my wife,"I wanted to do something special for my wifes significant birthday, the room we had was amazing, Id paid extra for a room with a good view and it was certainly brilliant. The one thing I found dissapointing was the food in the Ting restaurant, the size of the portions was very small and it was very expensive for what it was and Ive had better quality food. The number of teas and coffees available in the room was insufficient just 4, we asked for some more and we had to leave the room whilst the room service remade the room but all we wanted was a couple more so we were left standing outside our room whilst they attended to it. If the food was better we would have rated the experience much higher, its a five star room and view but three star food. The views though were…"
November 2021,Birthday afternoon tea,"Fantastic celebrating with my wife. Thanks Alina, Nathan and Carlo. Best service. 5 stars 🙏🔥 Everything was well managed. We are very happy to visit it again and recommend to our friends. Thank you so much, you did a tremendous work.

Massive thankyou to Momo our waiter what a great gentleman he is, made us feel welcome even when our time was up at our table it was my boyfriends birthday and he didn’t want to disappoint us and got us a different seat so we could have and enjoy another drink. Highly recommend this experience!"
November 2021,One to avoid.,"Amazing rooms, but that's the only positive as the customer experience is simply poor.  We arrived at the hotel, and the staff were professional and friendly, so a big tick.  The room was clean, and with a great view, so that's another big tick.  But that is as good as it gets. Let me explain.  We had 10 couples staying at the hotel, as a thankyou to our team and we booked private dining in the evening.  So why is the service poor, well put simply we arrived at the hotel and tried and arranged to meet early at one of the hotels bars for drinks. Unfortunately, irrespective of you been a guest at the hotel, you need to book a table at the bar.  Unfortunately as no-one had advised us of this, we couldn't get into any of the bars. How can resident not get a casual drink in hotel. …"
November 2021,I love it.,"Best service from Mattia, Panos and Madalina, i was here in London for the first time and  was everything special. Best place in London, if you are around you mast visit this beautiful bar. Defnetely coming back in one day 🥳🥳🥳"
November 2021,"Special, v romantic dinner at Tings.",Fantastic views which was what we expected. First time here though and wasn't setting any expectations on the food or service. Both turned out to be superb. Michael made some great recommendations as we tried to navigate the menu in the end we had a mix of the a all carte and the Shangri-la experience. Pigeon starter was Our standout and the shanghai noodles mains a close second. And we had great service from Nathaniel as well with our wine and additional photography skills and direction. Brilliant evening all round and would definitely recommend.
November 2021,"Gong bar , special celebration","Visited Gong bar this time and it was absolutely amazing! Great friendly service, beautiful views of course and amazing drinks!

November 2021,Wow.. just wow! Great space for room hire for corporate event,"Since the booking coordinator to the bar manager, waiting staff, space quality, easy menu, great selection of drinks, I really recommend Bar 31 for a private event! And if you are lucky enough to have Christos as bar manager, be ready to be wowed with an amazing personalised service, with all the care.

November 2021,Amazing Hotel. Its not just about the views ! ,The Shangri-la at The Shard is a beautiful hotel that sets new standards for modern understated luxury. Located high up in the Shard all rooms have great views both by day and night. Staff are really understanding of the customer needs and requirements in every area of operations at the hotel. The bedrooms are so light and bright and very well equipped. It's the kind of Hotel that gets you out of the shower and into the tub again ! Dining and bar  facilities exceeded expectations. All of this comes at a price of course and I suspect alot of accounts are settled with Corporate money. However it is also a Hotel that is  just wonderful for the individual traveller. Located in the City but West End attractions and restaurants are easily reached by taxi or public transport. 
October 2021,Fabulous hotel,"Have stayed a couple of times at the Shangri-La an it never fails to impress.  A beautiful hotel with magnificent views, lovely friendly, professional staff and a wonderful infinity pool on the 52nd floor.

November 2021,Luxury at its best,"We booked two nights at the Shangri-La hoping for some relaxation after a busy time at home. We were not disappointed. We had a Deluxe City View room with a view towards the east and overlooking the Tower of London. We loved the moment of theatre when you enter your room and the blinds roll up and suddenly London is glittering before you. It was a delight to just sit in the very comfortable armchairs and looks at all the boats on the Thames far below. We also happened to be there on the 5th November and I delighted in sitting in my bath and watching all the fireworks displays taking place in London. However, my most memorable moment was waking up to a spectacular sunrise.   The rooms are very well appointed and extremely comfortable. We ate breakfast in the Ting restaurant which…"
November 2021,Birthday !!!!,"I had the most amazing waiter who catered to my birthday needs. On hand for any request and willing to sacrifice his time to make sure our night was enjoyable.

The restaurant itself is equipped with fine art and beautifully designed. Would definitely recommend as the experience is one to remember."
October 2021,October stay in Shangrila The Shard.,"October stay at the Shangrila Shard  My whole experience in October was amazing but one night is never enough. I didn’t have a chance to experience 52nd floor. From  check in to check out, I can’t find any fault. Our fault to not extend for another day. We requested to have an early check in and I had the room before our lunch reservation at Ting. Perfect timing. The concierge and front desk are very helpful, they even offered us an umbrella to use when we went out for shopping.   In Ting restaurant, we sat by the window even it’s busy. Kat, the sommelier, told us information about the champagne we were drinking, which we never experience in any restaurant or any hotel. All waiters and hostess are amazing and friendly, Checking and making sure our champagne are filled up. Will…"

Right off the bat, the setting and views from the restaurant set the tone for a special night.  Service from the outset was great - from the people immediately upon entering the building, to those you meet at the top of the lift, those greeting you at the restaurant, then the staff at the restaurant especially our waiter and the sommelier. I must give a huge thanks to ALEX our waiter for taking such good care of us.  He was always attentive without hovering, gave great advice on menu selections  (he was spot on with them all), arranged a special treat for my husband on his dessert.  The food itself was delicious and it was great to see meal options to suit a range of budgets…"

We were looked after by Jing, she was so professional and helpful, she always smiled and her personality was beautiful. She always checked up to see if my mum was comfortable and asked her if she was ok. Jing is a keeper a true delight!!!   Food served was catered to our dietary requirements I.e we had halal option.

Manual and Simone were two gentleman and went above and beyond. Both were fantastic and I will be recommending them both to all my friends and family. Thanks for a great night folks.
October 2021,Not as Expected,"Firstly, when we checked in we was not informed that to use the lifts, you had to swipe you door card, very annoying, the view from the room, is of course amazing, the rooms are very nice, but a bit too business like, very disappointing for the price, one would expect a complimentary welcome drink in the room, not just a couple of refilled bottles of brita water, the mini bar had plenty of drinks in it but no mention that you would be charged at a very inflated coat, the cost of a small packet of Haribo's normal cost in the shop is around £1.00, they charged £4.00, I would have also expected more than just a small bottle of shampoo, conditioner, baby wash plus body lotion, in the bathroom, they did however have spare toothbrush's and toothpaste, our daughter had paid for a…"
November 2021,An outstanding dinner experience with excellent service and show-stopping view!,"Myself, my girlfriend and two friends dined at Ting before yesterday night 03.11 and saying that we were blown away by the whole experience is a huge understatement. We were welcomed by the kindest hostess and shown to our table right on the window for a jaw-dropping view.   Our waiter Emilio was extremely attentive and made sure we were happy from the moment we sat down to the moment we left. He anticipated all our needs, made us feel welcomed and accommodated all our requests, always with a smile and never made us wait.   I would also like to profusely thank the sommelier team who attended our table, Piotr and Masaki who made our wine tasting an experience on its own.   Throughout the whole meal, we felt welcomed and pampered by the most amazing staff. And a special thank goes…"

We spent nearly our whole stay just looking out of the windows and watching the sun set, night set in and then rise in the morning. The bed was huge and one of the most comfortable I've slept in. All the staff were helpful and welcoming. The options for evening meal and breakfast were very good too. We booked and went up to the pool but didn't get in, as it was tiny and not nearly as impressive as the photos on the hotel's site but this didn't matter, as it gave us more time to look out of our windows!"
November 2021,"When you wish upon a star as dreamers do… you find yourself at the Shangri-La, London","Sometimes you’re looking forward to something that much and for such a long time, that the reality can hardly live up to your expectations. But absolutely everything at The Shangri-La at The Shard surpassed our wildest dreams.  The Shangri-La, Mr. Kurt Macher, the General Manager, and his team made this city break one to cherish for always and forever. The staff made sure our stay in the clouds turned into an experience we will never forget. Every day we were surprised by little attentions, delicious cakes and sometimes even gifts. The Shangri-La made dreams come true for us in West Europe’s tallest building.   Walking into a hotel room for the 1st time usually is somewhat exciting. Will the room be lovely… what about the view? Upon entering the room, the blinds opened to the…"

We were served by Simone Koch (Restaurant Manager) who was lovely. The sommelier recommended a lovely wine Vila Nova Alvari - only £48.

November 2021,"Afternoon Tea at the Shangri-La (The Shard, London)","I was visiting some family in the UK that I hadn’t seen since 2019, and I spent my last day in London. Because I didn’t have a lot of time, I thought booking tea for one would be an excellent way to enjoy a UK past time while taking in all of the views of London from the Shangri-La. This was not a disappointment. The staff was friendly and courteous and made an extra effort to ensure I had a nice time going so far as to give me a better table with a superior view without needing to ask. My hosts, Leon and Nathaniel, were excellent and very attentive. The tea was a delight as well  and was offered with several different dietary accommodations including gluten free and vegan.

From the moment of stepping foot through the door was literally swept away not only by the decor itself and stunning views , which are by far exemplary , but the service which simply spot on with dining options impeccable, the team here has figured out what true cuisine means.   A must have from the menu is  duck plate , cooked to perfection, definitely can be shared and please ask the Chef to cut it for you, will make everything so much easier.   Every meal should end with traditional team in the clouds… I can not get enough of this unique presentation , I am always in awe watching it , while  the London Bridge  scenery…"

August 2021,"Our wedding at The Shangri-La, The Shard","If Tripadvisor offered 10 review stars, we would have selected 10.    Our wedding at The Shangri-La, The Shard surpassed any hopes and dreams we could imagine.  From the moment we engaged with them to start planning the day to the send off we had the morning after, everything was so personal, professional and expertly executed.    We had 56 guests to the Wedding, a further 50 to the evening reception and 35 of our guests stayed overnight and everything just worked like clockwork.  The service was impeccable, the quality of the food was outstanding, we requested some additional equipment such as a larger twinkly dance floor and they sourced these with no fuss.    Lucia the Events Director was simply amazing and was on-point at every occasion leading up to and on the day.  Henry…"

October 2021,Hospitality from the heart,"Upon entering the lobby on ground floor, I was warmly greeted by Ieva, Piotr, Ellen, Vincent and Christof. Even being greeted by everyone alone made me feel like a VIP. As Ellen was on her way up as well she kindly escorted me to Ting where I was meeting my friends for dinner. Gloria took over in her graceful manner and was attentive to my needs. Marie from Ting introduced us to the menu and was patient in teaching us how to use the tablet. As my friends and I were all tired from a long week, Piotr the sommelier suggested a wonderful selection of wines which we all enjoyed thoroughly. Throughout our meal in Ting, Alan and Spiros both individually checked on all the guests as well as us but it didn't feel robotic at all. In fact, they and everyone else mentioned above…"
October 2021,Amazing anniversary celebration,"We celebrated our two years anniversary (and 11yrs relationship) at the place we got married. So nice to be back for this staycation. The team went all out and had the room beautifully decorated with rose petals, candles and messages from the hotel.  The hotel itself was all decorated in Pink to support fight against Breast cancer. I think the best part of the stay was being recognised by the staff (having been the first gay couple to get married there!) and acknowledged by others when visiting the different outlets.   Thank you Shangri-La London for looking after us."

July 2021,A beautiful relaxing couples stay!,"From start to finish our stay was just the most amazing, relaxing lovely time. We were met in the lift by a lady who happened to check us in, we had mentioned we were staying as an early anniversary treat and when we got the room they had already got a cake up there for us to celebrate! The rooms are very luxurious and roomy and the bed, well you could just stay in it forever it was sooo comfy. I love all the little perks like the tv in the bathroom mirror and the Nespresso machine but the real highlight of the room was the breakfast in the room with the views over London, just spectacular and that same view is just as good if not better at night with all the lights twinkling.  The restaurants are all of an incredibly high standard for breakfast afternoon tea and dinner. The…"

Marta is very personable and professional, and she was always quick to respond to our many questions, whether it be over email or phone. We also got to meet her a few times during the lead up to the big day, which was extremely helpful as apart from assisting with planning the event, it helped us to get to know her and the venue better. We were really impressed by how organised and dedicated Marta was, it’s obvious that she is passionate about ensuring couples have everything run smoothly on the day (not an…"

October 2021,Sleeping in the clouds,"Where to start! An outstanding hotel with a 6 star service and a night to always be remembered. We decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary by spending a night at the Shard with our 5 year old daughter. Not only does the hotel offer breath taking views of London the attention to detail is outstanding. Everything was thought of to make our stay extra special, from an incredible room, a personal welcome note on the window and a sprinkle of thoughtful in room amenities and gifts for us all. Pre arrival the staff helpt anticipate our needs and suggested pre booking the pool and restaurant to ensure we would be able to enjoy it.

October 2021,Room only,Paid a significant amount of money to be told that we can only access the swimming pool at 8am and there was no accès to the hôtel bar because all the tables are booked for the night. So what you get for a luxury hotel is a room only. All be it a room with a view. Nothing else.  A hôtel where they put their guests second. At this money you could stay anywhere else in London. I will next time

October 2021,Exceptional service,"This was our second stay at the hotel.  I didn't think I could be more impressed, but they impressed us even more this time around.  As an example of the great service, a child in our group began crying while we were at the front desk.  Kimberley, the front office supervisor, came to the rescue.  She brought some cupcakes, offered some reassuring words, and found a way to stop the tears.  Service was just so proactive and attentive throughout our stay.  All of us were so impressed."
October 2021,Perfect nights stay with 5* treatment,"We re booked the “Premier City View Room” as a late birthday stay as last years stay was cancelled due to covid.   From entering the hotels grounds we were greeted with the car valet attendants who were very polite and welcomed us to the hotel. The car valet parking is £55 for 24 hours which I don’t think is unreasonable considering you’re in London. We left the car with them and went up to the reception,on this occasion we had checked in though the app so the only thing to do was to collect the room key from the reception which made getting to the room a lot quicker. All staff wearing face masks as well with a guest temperature check on arrival.  The room itself was perfect,bottled water,mini fridge,tea and coffee making facilities,bath robes,slippers ect. I had requested a…"

October 2021,Amazing stay in the clouds,"During a weekend visit to friends in London , I visited many places of interest that truly impressed me. After gazing up at the “new to me” Skyline of this lovely city, My eyes were drawn to the famous Shard building were the  Shangri La hotel is located. I made enquiries about their afternoon tea menu and headed up to the skies for the delightful treat . What an amazing afternoon. The atmosphere was even more enhanced by a wedding that was taking place quite near us , I sipped on pink tea poured out by the waiter and watched as dry ice took over the cups and the table as he poured .  It is Breast cancer month so the “pretty in pink” colour scheme added a wonderful Enhancement to the already charming space looking over London tower bridge  and more .  Delicious pink treats were…"

October 2021,Outstanding service!,"I joined my sister on a work trip to this incredible hotel. From the moment you enter the building the impeccable service starts. The hotel itself is beautiful, clean, provides quality food, we ate in Ting for breakfast and dinner and an array of cocktails both in Gong - the highest bar on floor 52 with incredible views and in Bar 31 outside the hotel's front door- loved the relaxed vibe here.  The swimming pool also on floor 52 is the infinity pool where photo opportunities must be taken! It certainly bought guests together with each taking photos of each other and the pool staff are happy to oblige too! A lovely atmosphere here! Rooms are floor to ceiling windows of views across London's skyline, you are so high up its like watching a model railway run with matchstick people…"
October 2021,Fab u lous,"This is a really special hotel and a must for a really special occasion.  The view is to die for but in our room 4207, the outer structure of the building, did obscure to sides of the window.  We had a superior standard.  I realize this is the entry level room but for what we paid I think you could have a few more ""treats"" included, i.e a choc on the pillow at night or petals on the bed.  We did have the writing on the window and a box of birthday cake on our arrival.  The staff are lovely and really accommodating.  The room was spotless and I wanted to take the bed home it was that comfortable!   The heated toilet seat is fun too.  A lovely hotel and stay all in all."
October 2021,Amazing overall experience!,"From the very begining the experience and customer service was great! We arrived super early and was seated quickly. We asked to move to a window seat which was granted very quickly, the staff were amazing and friendly which made us feel welcome and comfortable  on the get go. The food presentation was beautiful and the flavours were rich. I am extremely happy that I chose to have my anniversary dinner at the Ting restaurant. Nathaniel, Esmail and Jack served us very well and the food was delicious. Not to forget the cute complimentary fruit and chocolates at the end which was very sweet and thoughtfull. Overall I can say that this was the best experience that I've had at a restaurant."
October 2021,Amazing experience,"Our whole experience here from start to finish was incredible. We were made very comfortable by Esmail and Nathaniel, who provided amazing service and care, moving us into a nice table near the window.

The cocktails made by Jack were delightful. The food arrived in a timely manner and tasted perfect. After we had finished eating, we were brought out complimentary fruit and chocolates for our anniversary and it was very thoughtful and sweet. We were very thankful and it rounded out our night, making it an unforgettable experience. Overall, I would say this has been one of the best experiences…"

October 2021,Disappointed,"Stayed in iconic view room for 2 nights with husband to celebrate my birthday.  The best thing was the views from the room. I wanted a bathtub by the window and was surprised this cost an extra £100 a night. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels and felt this fell short on service and food. Afternoon tea was not worth the money. Paltry selection of food compared to such places as The Gleneagles Hotel. Breakfast was terrible. Buffet was very poor selection and disappointed to see guests were not wearing masks and breathing all over  the food. We are not long back from a luxury cruise and a 5 star hotel in Greece.  Both these had buffets bit everyone wore masks and not allowed to serve themselves, wait staff helped you to the food which was much more appropriate in these times. If…"

October 2021,What a memorable stay,"Hubby and I have had the privilege to stay in some amazing hotel but this is just just out of this world.  We arrived into London early in the am due to flight changes.  Walked thro the front door and our suitcases were taken care of.  Went up to reception, did not expect to check in but we did.  At least we completed all the paperwork.  The view was simply stunning.  We have been to Oblix and Shard viewing in the past but still, this was simply breathtaking.    We went away with the promise that someone will call us when our room becomes available.  And guess what? at noon.  Just wow.  We walked around the area, had a leisurely lunch and picked up our room key.  We walked into the room, the blinds went up automatically and the view was just simply speechless.  We literally…"

October 2021,"Great view, great room, great facilities & great food","It was always a wish to experience the Shard and to be able to do so as a guest for a night in the Shangri-La was a double blessing. From dinner in the Gong, to swimming in the infinity pool, to sleeping in the enormous bed, every aspect of my stay was wonderful. The meeting room we used was spacious and well provided with technology. The breakfast and lunch were excellent - the only complaint was that there was too much food! Overall, a stay which was memorable for all the right reasons."

The views from our premier city view room were amazing!! I had previously emailed the hotel requesting a room with a bath in the window, they managed to sort this for us which I was so grateful for and they had also left a card and a piece of cake for my partner with it being his birthday. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and everyone was so friendly and very professional.  We used the valet parking which was worth every penny.  We also used the room service which was very punctual and also very professional.  The bed was super comfy and we both had an excellent nights sleep, also probably due to the amazing blinds too!  There was only one slight issue…"
October 2021,"Incredible Room, Stunning Views","We stayed at the Shangri-La at the Shard for our honeymoon and we were glad we did. We were welcomed warmly by staff and were very quickly shown to our room despite our earlier than expected check in, where the staff had already arranged the special extras I had requested. The view was simply stunning and I can honestly say that I have never spent much time in a hotel room just admiring the view. Throughout our stay, the staff were always on hand to help and actively checked if we needed anything. Every time we left our room, we returned to find it immaculately tidy only hours later. Luckily, we got a bathtub with a view which was probably one of the highlights of our entire stay.  The services on offer at the hotel were also fantastic. Ting served fantastic Asian and the…"

We had to book in advance for the swimming pool, and sadly there was a time limit of one hour. The sauna was also overlooking to London/ Thames.  We booked in advance to the Ping restaurant and had a lovely table with a view. As we are vegetarians we were quite disappointed with the menu options…the waitress also forgotten to offer us bread; however offered to the table next to us (she left the butter on the table and after the main took the butter away) :(  Breakfast were nice and the staff were very attentive."

October 2021,Absolutely Wonderful!,"We stayed at the Shangri-La at the Shard to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. It was one of the best experiences we have had.   From the moment we were checked in by the brilliant Tyrone we were made to feel special & this continued throughout our stay.   The hotel is beautiful & luxurious, however there is a mix of people & we did not feel it was too posh, just lovely & welcoming.   We had upgraded to the 180 degree room & it had views to die for. The room was luxurious & the bed very comfy.   Breakfast was delicious, beautifully presented with a good choice of food.   We ate in the Ming Restaurant on our anniversary night & were given a table overlooking Tower Bridge. The 5 course meal was superb with an oriental feel. The service again was excellent.

You're definitely in safe hands with him."

September 2021,Great tea at the Shard 'Ting',"Over two years ago we  stayed here purely for the experience of spending a memorable night at one of London's unique hotels. The Shangri-La Hotel is located in the iconic Shard, that super-tall skyscraper of some 95 floors which towers over London from the south bank of the Thames at London Bridge. The hotel occupies floors 35 to 52 of the Shard, with the main Reception on the 35th floor.  Our stay then  was, without a doubt, exceptional.  That’s why we chose the Shangri-La at the Shard again, to celebrate a milestone birthday, seeing that a trip abroad to somewhere fabulous was virtually out of the question due to the COVID situation.  We wanted a room with a city view and one that offered the ‘bath with a view’ arrangement.  We’d selected a room type on the hotel’s website,…"
June 2021,Service,"It was fantastic, the staff were amazing.  Excellent impeccable service.  The staff just couldn't do anything more to enhance the experience.  I will definitely be returning often as the tea was awesome, the scones scrumptious and the cakes were just downright delicious.  A special thanks to Leon, Nathaniel and a female waitress who were all brilliant.  Attentive and friendly and just making my day special.    Nathaniel, you asked me if there was anything you could do to improve the service?  My answer is: 'No there is nothing more that you could have done.""   Alot of other hospitality staff could learn a lot from ALL of you as EACH staff member goes above and beyond.  Keep up the good work, Shangri-La Team ! Service with a smile :)"

October 2021,Anniversary dinner,"Stayed here for 2 nights in September as part of my 50th birthday celebrations and they made it very special. The tone was set from a friendly welcome at check in and then when we went in the room we had a bottle of Champagne and birthday cake waiting for us which was a nice touch.   The views are absolutely amazing and we spent the first 30 minutes looking out the window point out all of London's amazing land marks.   Rooms are a good size , clean and well kept as you would expect and a nice turn down service at night.  You have to try the infinity pool and sauna which was up on the 51st floor ( i think ) as this only adds to the whole experience.   Breakfast had a good  buffet choice and service was quick and efficient , nothing outstanding but nice all the same.   Service in…"
October 2021,Wonderful Experience,"OK, so it's expensive... BUT the food is lovely, and the service is wonderful too.

September 2021,The best waiter! Momo deserves a raise.,We had never been to the restaurant before and therefore had no idea what to expect but I can safely say it exceeded our expectations! This was mostly due to the waiter Momo. When taking pictures Momo generously took us out to a seperate room where we had more space. He also made sure we were well attended to all evening. He was extremely efficient and very polite. The food was great and the overall vibe of the restaurant was amazing.
September 2021,Great experience thanks to Waiter,"Myself and my girlfriend visited GONG bar as a date night, the food options are smaller portions but the quality is very high. The overall experience of the night was made 100x better thanks to our waiter Momo. He went above and beyond in his service, helping to recommend drinks for us. Momo showed us the pool room and allowed my girlfriend to take some pictures in the area thanks to the beautiful decor and backdrop. Overall a great night, made even better thanks to Momo."
September 2021,Absolutely wonderful,"We stayed for one night for our 25th wedding anniversary.  Yes it is expensive, but frankly it was worth every penny.  We had an amazing room with the biggest bed I have ever slept in, a large sitting area with separate walk in closet and the most awesome of bathrooms - the bath had the best views ever!   The service was exemplary - thanks for the little anniversary cake - and everyone was trained brilliantly - in the way that only hotels in the far east seem to be able to achieve.  Clearly the staff have all undergone the rigorous training that Shangri - La have in place - the sort of service where each and every guest is made to feel like they are the most important guest that the particular member of staff as seen that day! We had drinks in the Gong bar which was well worth…"
September 2021,Lovely afternoon at Ting Restaurant,"I booked a 3 course meal at Ting Restaurant using a Virgin Experience voucher. From stepping into the foyer to leaving it was a lovely experience. Everyone was welcoming, but particularly our waiter Elvis who went out of his way to check on us and other diners. He was friendly but very polite, there when we wanted something but not intrusive. The food was good but it was the service that really made it special."
September 2021,If one is bored of London one is bored of life,"Enjoying a pretty spectacular breakfast overlooking London which in itself is pretty spectacular. From the Shangri-La The Shard, the history of the city is laid bare below you. It is thought provoking, humbling & terrifying in equal measure - a snap shot of humanity. But through the centuries.  The staff at the hotel are excellent & we were looked after with quiet & friendly efficiency at breakfast by Isaac & Danny. A superb short stay on the first theatre trip to London since Covid. The Sky Pool at the hotel a must. A very welcome return to normality? Fingers crossed. Just need to get over my vertigo!"
June 2021,Awesome,The Shangri-la at The Shard team are amazing. They always make you feel as though you are one of the family.  A great way to start your day or how ever you choose to spend it- you must do it the Shangri-La way. Thank you to the team.

Nathaniel kept us topped up on drinks and was there in a heartbeat if we needed anything. We were surprised by Happy anniversary chocolates, which made our experience even more memorable.  Compliments to the chefs who produced food like I've never had before. Going to London? Go to Ting, you won't regret it."
September 2021,Great hotel with the best possible views of London,"Stayed here for two nights in early September. Great experience on arrival with efficient valet parking and concierge service. On check-in we were upgraded to a room on the 49th floor with spectacular views over the rive towards the Walkie-Talkie and HMS Belfast. The room was well appointed including a Nespresso, binoculars and a fabulous bathroom. I was celebrating my birthday and was surprised by a cake and card which was a lovely touch. Our package also included their 'bath experience' which was divine - honestly the best smelling bath I've ever had! The buffet breakfast was good with a great selection available. The bread options were initially disappointing but I was offered sourdough toast when I asked. In summary, this is a great hotel in a great location with views to…"

September 2021,Classic racial profiling,I live in Central London and returned to this location for staycation. We have stayed here before as well Paris and Shanghai. After buying jewellery at Harrods we popped into our flat nearby to pick up more face masks . We arrived back at the hotel around 9pm and a security tried to block me ( not my husband) from approaching the lift.  He literally acted like I was coming to rob the place.He put his arm as a barrier and asked (only )me where I was going and do I have a room. We are in a suite btw. White people were greeted warmly( temp check) and proceeded to enter. My husband ( white) was not questioned ( just temp checked like all the other whites. They are trying to prevent black people from socialising at this establishment. I will seek advice from trading standards and…

September 2021,London High Life,"You take a bit of a risk when you book a hotel to celebrate a special occasion. So I’m very happy to review the Shanghai-La London as excellent on every level. Literally.  From dropping off our bags earlier than check in to regrettably having to depart to go home every member of the hotel staff was courteous, helpful and interested in us and why we were staying there.  We upgraded to a Premier City View room before arrival and it was the best decision. The views from our room were utterly mesmerising and we couldn’t stop looking at the city day and night. Some London hotels you’re pleased to only sleep in but this hotel was one where you just can’t wait to get back to look out of those windows again.  This trip was everything we hoped for and so much more. Thank you to everyone…"

Slightly odd that our bottle of water disappeared after night 1 leaving us to buy our own but this was a small gripe.   Ting restaurant is fabulous and Nathaniel was the perfect waiter.   Come to celebrate a special occasion - and ask for a window table!
September 2021,Exceptional service at Ting,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary dinner at the Shangri-La's Ting restaurant at a table with stunning views overlooking Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf in the distance.  The menu selection at Ting is a great combination of East meets West with a number of unique dishes. While everything was absolutely spot on, what we appreciated the most was the level of service.

Modern Asian splendidly curated with a premium service experience courtesy of Spiros and his hard working kitchen and floor team. Formal dining meets an informal, warm and friendly setting. Wonderfully served wine by Piotr (and his new sommelier who’s name escapes me) as always. Emilio was our server last night and did an amazing job. Brought a real personality to the evening! I was ambitious with my dinner order (for 2) but we cleared the plates. Thank you Franziska for organising. Recommend."
September 2021,Birthday Celebration for the Wife,"My wife's first birthday celebration in London and I couldn't ask for a better venue. We booked a lunch menu and although I made a mistake with the booking, I called them at 7am in the morning to confirm and they were more than happy to help.  On arrival they were able to offer us the halal hainanese chicken and rice even though it was not available on the menu. Coming from a Malay background the chicken & rice and Cha Been Hoon was spot on.   Our waitress Jenny was so friendly and helpful and although all staff were wearing masks, you could tell they always greeted us with a smile.  Just to top it off, the view of London and the live music just completed the ambience of the celebration. Thank you Ting Shangri-la"

We received the warmest welcome from Tyrone at check-in, and were delighted when he told us that we were being given a room on the highest floor and that our breakfast would be included.  He also booked the pool for us, and made our breakfast reservation.  Our room on the 50th floor was incredible.  There was so much space, we looked out over Tower Bridge on one side, and everything we could have wished for was there, from a shoe horn to a pair of binoculars, as well as all the toiletries, robes and slippers.  One minor annoyance was that we could see into our neighbour's bathroom, which meant they could see into our room as well, but the blinds did their job.    We used the pool…"

The second day we went for swimming and a big piece of mould similar to the size of a golf ball was that was stuck in the tap of the drinking water dispenser ended up in my cup . We called the person in charge and showed him and he notified his manager who then apologised.  After filling in a survey sent to us after our stay, we received an email from senior management and was reassured that our next experience would be much better and we will be well looked after when we choose to return.   We chose to return to celebrate my son 16th birthday in August. We…"
September 2021,"A dream stay, again","Just came back from London, where we again stayed in the spectacular Shangri La Hotel at the Shard, just nominated London's nº 1 Hotel by the prestigious TL magazine. Congratulations for the award, which is more than deserved. Amazing experience , amazing service,, amazing views, amazing location. But most of all, I would like to thank all the employees who interacted with us (Concierge, Reception, Guest Relations, Housekeeping, Restaurants), who delivered an excellent service and made an passionate effort to meet all our needs. Thank you from the heart, already dreaming of the next stay."
September 2021,21st Birthday to remember,We visited the shard as part of my 21st birthday celebrations. Ting was the most amazing restaurant with the service from Esmail & Nathaniel being impeccable & the food & view being lovely also. I  would most definitely recommend a visit especially if celebrating a special occasion.
September 2021,The ultimate Shangri-La Experience.,"When one thinks of Shangri-La The Shard, London, of course one instantly associates it with opulence and glamour, yet it is so much more than that as the staff ensure that it is exceptionally welcoming and has a wonderful homely feel to it.  Despite living in London, we wanted to book something to look forward to that equally didn't involve much of a journey so we thought we'd try this wonderful Hotel.  Eventually it has been a dream that came true. Of course, staying at Shangri-La The Shard, London was a natural choice for my parents’ London staycation.  Upon arrival our cases were whisked away by the charming doorman, and we were very quickly checked-in by a very knowledgeable and professional person called Tyrone. Our stunning room was located on the 40th floor and as you…"
September 2021,Jimmy Door Man :),"My husband and I stayed at the Westminster suite following our wedding and Jimmy made our stay extra welcoming and really pleasant especially the way he treated and cared for our dog . Jimmy is very attentive and always had our cars ready upon arrival and cleared the pathways so we could exit and arrive safely , extremely friendly and professional and above all loves dogs . Hopefully next time we go back to stay Jimmy is on duty so he can be the one to greet us . A great person and makes the London experience much more pleasant. Thank you for everything.  The Mckenna’s"
September 2021,Amazing service,An amazing experience. The view is amazing. Food is exceptional. The service was excellent. Thank you to Jenny for a fantastic service. What a lovely person. Made our experience even better. Will return and hope to have Jenny serve us again. Thank you
September 2021,Amazing views,"We stayed at the hotel for our mini moon and had a brilliant stay! We stayed in a premier city room with views over Tower Bridge, the Tower of London and HMS Belfast. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.  We had a slight issue with our luggage making it’s way to our room which was eventually rectified and the staff provided us with a bottle of champagne to apologise for the error.   We ordered room service late one evening and although very expensive it was delicious!   Breakfast was tasty and the views from the Ting restaurant were fab.   The staff were very attentive and made us feel well looked after. We’d definitely recommend this hotel to anyone celebrating a special occasion."
September 2021,Amazing Experience,"I booked to have dinner at the Ting restaurant as a anniversary lunch. It was the right choice, the place is amazing, the food was amazing, the staff was amazing, our waiter was very friendly and explained to us how the menu was. At the end he gave us the Mango tea with the hot water and ice, that was very beautiful! I don't he remember our waiters name, but people like him that makes an experience like this to remember and never forget!"
August 2021,Fab views but …..,"Firstly the views are fantastic and I guess this is what you are really paying for.  Having seen this hotel on the tv I realise they had a far superior service!  The rooms are nice but not wow (with the exception of the toilets which we all loved)!Most disappointing was the breakfast, it was a mediocre buffet with a very limited choice and the service was slow.  It seemed to take forever to get a cup of coffee which was served in the tiniest of cups and no refill was offered.  The cocktails in Gong were lovely."
September 2021,superb stay in southwark suite,"couldn't fault the staff (we didn't arrive in the maclaren or lambo parked outside and still felt every single person we dealt with wanted us to have a perfect stay!), view, room service, breakfast, 52nd floor sauna. room tv not being 'smart' so no netflix/disney+ streaming for our kids was the only pain. great area to stay in for london weekend break."
August 2021,Wonderful views with Wonderful staff and food,"We visited this week to celebrate my daughters birthday with afternoon tea. The food and views from the hotel are superb. Our day was made extra special thanks to Jenny who attended our table with her joyful manner and professionalism. Thank you Shangri-la ( and Jenny) for a wonderful day we will remember forever.  Best wishes, Ben & family"
September 2021,Excellent overnight stay,"Amazing room, amazing service, amazing view and just an overall great experience - at a price. This was a once in a blue moon treat for us and whilst it was eye wateringly expensive you get what you pay for. The room was great but it's all about the views (38th floor) and we were looking directly at the city with tower bridge down to the left. Waking up in the morning and opening the blinds over the city was great. The check in was slick and painless (apart form the card swiping...) and staff very attentive. All the room amenities were as you would expect from a top end hotel.  We had dumped our bags at the hotel in the morning as we had an action packed day planned in London and they appeared in our room shortly after check-in. Very slick.  Really good stay and when that blue…"
September 2021,Fantastic service from Josh,Had an amazing stay here. Food and drinks were unbelievable. The room and view was beautiful. The pool was fantastic. Massive thank you to Josh for looking after us and for making our anniversary even better.
September 2021,Hats off to Josh,"What a place! Can’t fault a single thing, food is amazing, pool is unreal, the beds are out of this world and the staff are so attentive. Special mention to Josh how pulled all the stops out the bag for us, nothing felt like to much trouble so thank you."
August 2021,Mini moon,How fabulous was our two night stay after our wedding. The staff from the beginning to the end were amazing. A special mention to Leo on concierge for helping us out with trunks as we had to dump the car with time running out. His team also retrieve the car and brought our bags later. Mention to Leon and Nathaniel who looked after us so we’ll in Ting restaurant.
May 2021,Fantastic customer service,Just returned from an overnight stay at this beautiful hotel. It was to celebrate my husband’s 40th birthday and the service we received was outstanding.  The hotel staff can not do enough for you  A massive thank you to Sonia and Tyrone who really went over and above to make our stay extra special  The hotel is stunning the breakfast was delicious and we cannot wait to return  Thank you again
August 2021,Lovely place but rooms are basic!,We enjoyed the shard and would definitely come back for the experience again either in the Thai restaurant or the bar but the hotel itself for the price is very basic even though we did have a Bath with a view and one of the more upgraded rooms you are paying for the view rather than luxury!
September 2021,This was for our honeymoon and was very disappointing!,"This trip was for our honeymoon (the hotel were aware of this). When we arrived and checked in, they did not have our reservation for dinner or the bar, although we booked this when we booked to stay overnight at the hotel. We felt the room could do with modernising considering the cost per night and we noticed things like ripped blinds & cracked tiles.   We had dinner at the Ting restaurant as they managed to book us a table and the service wasn’t great. They gave us wine glasses for champagne, we had to pour our own champagne, we ordered duck as one of our mains and most of it was fat which is not acceptable considering the price. We got our main courses separately and by the time the other course came the dinner that arrived first was cold. We then went to the bar after…"
August 2021,Appalling check in experience.,Just stayed at Brown's- 5 /5 this rates as 1/5 for an arrival experience. Waited for 40 minutes to check in - worse than easyjet or Ryanair. Need many more staff and not acceptable at £600 per night. This was a shambles - staff very amenable and charming just not enough 
August 2021,"Brillant stay, amazing views",We stayed at the Shard as a birthday treat. I mentioned it was my wives birthday and a lovely birthday cake arrived at our room with a card from Tania! I have no idea who Tania is but it was a special moment in our great stay at the Shard.
August 2021,Anniversary dinner,"Wonderful experience !! Our waitress Sabrina was amazing and her service was impeccable! She even let us move to a table with a view ! It was our 1 year anniversary and she made it very special !  The mains could have been better, but the overall experience made up for that !"
August 2021,"Amazing view, great food and attentive staff","Would definitely recommend for a romantic couple dinning experience, the view is amazing. Very calm & suave ambiance. Food was amazing  - i would recommend the Shanghai Noodles.  Alec, Nathaniel & Sabrina were great hosts! Will 100% come back."
August 2021,"Amazing spot, highly recommend.","Amazing view staff and food, I would highly recommend.  The food is exceptional. The staff are second too none Alex, Nathaniel and sabrina where amazing and very tentative. I would recommend for couples and anyone else who wants an amazing experience."
August 2021,Fantastic dining experience,"We ate in Ting restaurant. Fantastic experience, well worth it for any special celebration. Views from the restaurant are great, food was incredible. We were served by Leon - couldn’t fault the service, attentive when required but also unobtrusive. All in all, highly recommended."
August 2021,Amazing service only thanks to Emilio,"Wow where can I begin, if you ever go here ask for Emilio personally. He was amazing! Made the night feel special, he was kind and you can tell he went the extra Mile answering all our questions and attending to our every need. He knows the menu so well and the recommendation he gave me was bang on, I will be coming here again and it’s honestly only because of Emilio!"
August 2021,Birthday meal at Shang right-la hotel,"Amazing food and service, Emilio was absolutely amazing and friendly! Even went out of there way to say happy birthday and present a birthday dessert! Would 100% recommend to anybody! Would love to go again!"
August 2021,Lovely,"Ketiola was a lovely waitress, everything was perfect with our visit and Ketiola ensured this. The food was very nice and the view made it even better, highly recommend for couples. The three course meal was a nice choice with enough variation to please all."
August 2021,Wonderful Afternoon Tea Experience,"Came here for afternoon tea for my boyfriends belated birthday present. Amazing food with an amazing view! Welcome tea was a great experience and Jenny couldn’t have been more attentive - great friendly staff and a must to visit, we will definitely be back!"
July 2021,Birthday and anniversary celeb,The Shangri-la London hotel is top notch. One of the best. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. We had our breakfast at Ting restaurant and the staff named Jenny was very helpful in meeting our needs. She gave us a nice touching sweets for our Anniversary and mu girlfriend’s birthday. Highly recommended.
August 2021,Beyond all our expectations,"What an experience, from stepping into the lobby to leaving the hotel at the end of the stay it was just a magical time. We loved the staff, they were just so friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in the guests, the room went beyond our expectations, it was perfect, comfy beds, fantastic bathroom, all the amenities you need and of course the view, we spent hours just looking and using the helpfully provided binoculars.  Food was magnificent, breakfast overlooking London was something I will remember for a long time. I went with my 10 year old son and we also visited the pool, swimming overlooking the view was incredible, we loved our time there and made memories to last a lifetime, absolutely worth every penny."
August 2021,Birthday Dinner,When arrived at the Ting restaurant we were greeted by Jordeen and Feona. The staff members very welcoming. The director Alan Tang  also came over to make sure that we were enjoying our meal. The sommelier Kat and Masaki were great. Overall the meal was fantastic and on top of that the view was spectacular. I would highly recommend to choose to stay at the Shangri-La hotel.
August 2021,"Beautiful views, great sleep thanks to quiet comfortable rooms.","The rooms at this hotel are fantastic - very much worth booking for an overnight stay even if Londoners like us. The views from our room (and I believe all of them) are amazing. Fantastic view reveal as you enter the room and the blinds come up. Lovely big bathrooms, comfortable beds and blackout blinds plus quiet rooms meant we had a great sleep. Very much appreciated early check in being arranged when we unexpectedly arrived early (having left extra time due to extinction rebellion protests). Helpful acts like this mean not the case in all hotels for example I find Four Seasons not good at that and is a chargeable extra or nothing.  Plus great extras like large bottle of water on arrival, bath salts etc. I really appreciate touches like this as will always use them but not…"
August 2021,Impeccable dining at Ting,"We ate at Ting within the Shangri-La hotel at the Shard. We had chosen to dine from the very reasonably priced three course set menu from which there was ample choice. The food was exquisite. The service was impeccable, our waiter, Leon, was attentive but not intrusive. And what’s more the views of London were brilliant."
August 2021,What a wonderful service!!!,"We had the most wonderful time celebrating my friend’s job offer. Jenny was a wonderful host, able to advise us on food and drink choice, incredibly accommodating and friendly. The main courses were delicious; although the dessert was a little nondescript."
July 2021,High prices but you pay for the view,"We stayed for two nights for a family staycation in London. The hotel is a perfect spot for doing so, well located for all tourist attractions. The rooms were bright and spacious and obviously everyone comes for the views. Our arrival was a little disappointing as the hotel felt a bit like a crowded train station with long lines and delayed check-in. But after that things got better and the hotel soon became calmer, and our stay was very pleasant. The food and drinks are extremely expensive and I guess you pay for the view. If you’re looking for a place to place yourself in London and prices are not off putting then we would highly recommend"
August 2021,best afternoon tea in London!,the place was incredible and food was fantastic! Great friendly staff too! 5 star all over! I have to say its been an incredible  experience visiting this place and me and my friends enjoy the afternoon with the impeccable view! I recommend this to everyone who would visit London!
August 2021,"Excellent Stay, all about those views","We stayed at The Shangri La for night 1 of a weekend break in London and was very impressed by the building and service. The room was nice, 50th floor so a little more expensive than others. Service was good, the Spa and Sauna was excellent (best view ever from inside a Sauna). The breakfast was okay but its all about the view here. I do not want to be too hard on the hotel as there is nothing wrong with it however, for the cost, there are better value hotels or hotels with a much higher class of service depending on what you are looking for. Day 2 we stayed at The Corinthia and this was head and shoulders above the Shangri La. However I would recommend but not in a rush to return."
August 2021,25th Wedding Anniversary trip,Amazing stay for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Berta was excellent and ensured that our stay was made very memorable by her customer focus and care. Masaki and Nathaniel were excellent in the Ting bar and looked after us very well. One of the best hotels we have stayed at we will definitely return. Outstanding service 👍
August 2021,Not great value for money,"Our party of 8 stayed at the Shangri La for one night in August. Reception staff were very good, efficient and professional, our room was not ready but we could leave our bags with them and explore the city until our room was ready. The hotel phoned me to advise the room was ready which I felt was a nice touch. Our bags had been delivered to our rooms when we went into them. The rooms themselves although well appointed were disappointing for the amount we had paid for a nights stay, we felt they were practical rather than luxurious.  We paid for a 180 degree view from our room, this was a nice extra but not sure if it was worth the £150 upgrade. Our room rate included breakfast at the hotel. This unfortunately was a disappointment.  We were shown to the table and offered tea…"
August 2021,Superb service and attention to detail,"My friend and I stayed here for her birthday and retirement. Staff went out of their way to fit us in for afternoon tea. Afternoon tea was so impressive at the Ting restaurant, with the most spectacular views ever.   Breakfast was superb, as you would expect, and staff gave my friend a celebratory cake. Our room overlooked the London Eye and St Paul’s Cathedral.   Attention to detail was outstanding, and the hotel was beautifully decorated.  "
August 2021,Beautiful experience,"Beautiful surroundings, great service, and delicious food. Also wonderful views. We enjoyed our lunch at ShangriLa. The set menu choices were limited but the flavours were exquisite. Would define recommend as a special event - expensive but worth it."
August 2021,Birthday meal,"Leon and Nathaniel were truly the quality Shangri-la deserves, both were fantastic in their roles, knowledgeable, helpful, attentive and overall gave us a dining experience to remember, thank you so much, we will be back!  Connor & Laura"
August 2021,Fabulous - what a way to mark an occasion!,We dined at Ting to mark a special birthday and from the moment we stepped foot on the 35th floor to the moment we left it was magical! The views were spectacular of course and the food was divine (we chose Shangri-La specialties) and the service and hospitality was second to none. Very special. Thank you!
August 2021,Dinner at the Shangri-La hotel,"I had an absolutely amazing time dining at the Ting restaurant, and more importantly because I was served by Nathaniel. Nathaniel is a star, he made our stay worth it. Thumbs up Nath! Keep up the good service"
August 2021,Memorable visit to Ting Restaurant,"Fabulous evening at Ting restaurant. Attentive and friendly service from all members of staff and in particular Sabrina and Nathanial. Superb views from our table, relaxed atmosphere and delicious, beautifully presented food, portions were unexpectedly large. Expensive, but given the location, views, service, quality of the food and overall experience this was to be expected and would definitely recommend. One suggestion, it would have been useful to explain the tradition of sharing dishes before we had chosen what to eat."
August 2021,Afternoon tea,"My wife and I visited for afternoon tea. We were very impressed not only with the quality of food but also with the friendliness and courteousness of the wait staff. We were served by Emilio who was polite and attentive  whilst not overbearing. Would definitely visit again, most certainly one of the best afternoon teas in London!"
August 2021,"Fantastic views, brilliant staff and lovely setting",We had a lovely time and our waiter Leon was very nice and knowledgable. We messaged ahead as it was my girlfriends 30th birthday plus I planned to propose. The staff were very accommodating and happy to help with all the above. Highly recommend. Great views and lots of photo opportunities as well.
August 2021,Amazing Anniversary Stay,My Husband booked here for our wedding anniversary stay as a surprise for me and I was not disappointed. Everything from start to finish was amazing.  We arrived early due to our training getting in but was going to explore London anyway so we dropped our bags off so we wasn’t dragging them around. The staff on reception where amazing so accommodating. As this was four our anniversary they said they would get the room ready as soon as they could. About half an hour after leaving they rang to say our room was ready. Amazing service.  After exploring and site visiting we came back to the hotel to get ready. On checking in they noted again it was for our anniversary and I was given a single red rose which was a very nice gesture.  We also got given a complimentary drink whilst…
August 2021,Lunch at Ting,"Had a lovely lunch at Ting as a wedding present. The food was exceptional, the drinks quenching and we were well looked after by Jing as our host. A great afternoon treat, and of course the views across London are unrivalled!"
August 2021,Nice dinner,We had 3 course's dinner. Such a nice service and we promise to go there again.  母と娘でうかがいました。 以前食事した事を覚えてくださっていて、早々にご挨拶いただきとても嬉しかったです。 また、娘は少し前に誕生日だったのですが、そのことを聞いてデザートにお心遣いいただきました。娘もとても喜んでいました。マサキさんの素晴らしいサービスに心温まりました。また必ず行きたいです！ありがとうございました。
August 2021,Meal at Ting Restaurant,"I had a wonderful meal at Ting!! Our waiter, Esmail was extremely helpful and friendly. Highly recommend. 5/5 for food, views and service!!   Definitely a memorable dining experience that you have to try!"
August 2021,Anniversary lunch,Lovely lunch and Jenny was a lovely waitress. Food was excellent and I he views are stunning. Quick service and excellent customer service. Good prices are okay but the quality speaks for itself would definitely recommend.
August 2021,GIVE EMILIO A PROMOTION!,"His service was fast, clean and respectful. Really helped me enjoy my stay here in the Shard. Thank you Emilio! He was a really great help and very kind. I hope to see this type of service with everyone else, thank you."
August 2021,Ideal for the most special of occasions...,"Undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of London Hotels and Restaurants in the fabulous surroundings of the Shard.  Excellent service, in particular Ketiola was outstanding, amazing food and a wonderful ambiance.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  Bravo!"
September 2021,Great service and food,"We had a lovely lunch at Ting as part of our honeymoon celebrations. Jenny was very attentive, the view was great and the food fabulous! We have been before but I'd say this occasion was by far the best. Definitely make the most of the lunch deal if available. Great value."
September 2021,The perfect evening,"My fiancé and I visited for our anniversary, we were looked after by Leon & he took such great care of us. We had the most wonderful evening & we are so grateful to Leon & the team for making us feel so welcome, the food was perfect & the service was excellent."
September 2021,"Great service, great food.",We were served by the ever so charming and attentive Ketiola. She made us feel very relaxed and the service and food was grand. Would definitely return again and recommend it to our family & friends Thankyou Ting and Ketiola :)
August 2021,Gong Bar Afternoon Tea Experience,"We had my birthday celebration in Gong Bar.  The staff were fantastic, they made us feel like we were the only ones they were serving, that we were special.  We had an amazing view which our waiter knew exactly how to capture on our phones. The staff are completely professionally and impeccable in their hosting and delivery skills. Henry Bernal helped to arrange this amazing experience."
August 2021,Wonderful birthday at Shangri-la,"Spent the day at Shangri-la for my birthday. 5* service from begining to end. Amazing dishes, fabulous views and wonderful service from Jing, Simone and Nathaniel. Highly recommended and will definitely be back."
September 2021,"A perfect, five star experience","Our stay was everything we visualised and more, from start to finish.  The decor and interior at reception is second to none, and the staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly.   We were on the 43rd floor and it goes without saying the views were breathtaking. Our room was fantastic, and we loved every minute spent in it. The entire place was completely spotless top to bottom.   Dinner at Ting was fantastic, it felt really special and didn’t want it to end.   Before dinner we also had a cocktail at Gong bar on the top floor which had such a brilliant vibe. Could have spent much longer in there easily!   Breakfast was the highlight for us. Thankfully the buffet was open as normal, and I loved creating ‘a little bit of everything’ on my plate. Everything tasted fresh, pure and…"
September 2021,Rooms in the clouds,"Was expecting a whole lot more but can’t put my finger on what……. Hotel staff were all super attentive and engaging, view was beautiful from morning to night and plenty to watch as we enjoyed the bars and restaurants of Gong & Ting. Luckily we booked ahead of arrival as concierge confirmed on arrival that they had no capacity."
September 2021,Amazing Ting,"Had such an amazing experience thanks to Emilio, such a kind welcoming gentleman and smiley, and the food was amazing:)   Will deffo be coming back again in the future and maybe have more room for dessert"

August 2021,Excellent,"The food was excellent ! We tried 3 dishes and a dessert and everything was of a very high quality !  The service made by Emilio and Alex as well, we fully recommend !   The view was incredible as well.   Do not hesitate and try this restaurant !"
August 2021,Room with a view,"Have been to the Shard many times for dining, we took the opportunity this year to have our staycation in Shangri-la hotel. Check in area was busy, the reception desks are right next to the corridor, and there were people constantly passing in front or behind of you while queuing. That's the only flaw if I must say. The check in process was quick and I got a call to inform me when the room was ready. Thanks to Jade status (mid tier of GC), I received an upgrade. The room is very spacious, of course with a best view (combine the city and the Tower of London) that no other hotels in London could offer! Imagine to take bath with a glass of bubbly looking at river Thames, that's exactly what we did! We were offered room amenities, complimentary cake and fruits etc were best quality.…"
August 2021,Memorable anniversary meal,"Had a wonderful meal for our anniversary at Ting this evening. The staff were all so attentive and special thanks to Leon our waiter who went out of his way to reassure us that my husband’s dairy free meal was safe for him which made the whole experience so relaxing. And, of course, the  views we’re stunning."

August 2021,Fabulous!,"Spent a night to celebrate my 33rd birthday and it was one of the best birthday ever! Solo traveller here, by the way 😉.  I requested a bath with a view, of course. It didn’t disappoint. It was beautiful. I forgot what was my room number but I had an amazing view of london sunset. The staff were very accommodating. I ordered a cake for myself 😂 as part of the celebration. I came early morning to leave my luggage and 2 staff collected my luggage by the door on the ground floor. At 2 pm, I went upstairs at level 33, where the reception is and luckily my room was ready so I checked in early. I had to book to use the pool and sauna as well. Guests are only allowed to use the sky pool area for 45 minutes and they do it in groups. For instance, a certain number of people are allowed…"
August 2021,Great service at Ting from Emilio,"What an experience, amazing service thanks to our lovely waiter Emilio. He was so kind,friendly and gave us great recommendations- he really knows the menu well and took time to answer our questions about the food. Emilio really made us feel like we were dining in luxury. If you go here ask for Emilio!"
August 2021,Fantastic service at Shangri La Shard,"Just returned from our Silver Wedding Anniversary trip to London. Stayed at Shangri La Shard Hotel. Amazing hotel.  Fantastic views over Thames from the room. Thank you very much for the complimentary upgrade in recognition of NHS service. Wonderful meal at Ting.  Excellent service from all the superbly trained staff, particularly Roland on reception who was super helpful. A well deserved 5 star experience."
August 2021,5 * Experience,"Great service at The Shard and Shangri-La Hotel. Upon arrival the hotel meet and greet is friendly and welcoming. The check in was slow (which was not great) but upon seeing us it was efficient and again welcoming. The room we stayed in was fantastic. Obviously amazing views and just such a great hotel. The pool is also great and we ate at Ting in the evening. The service was amazing and both Emilio and Nathaniel were just the best hosts. Nathaniel’s service and gentle nature made us feel as if we were the only diners.  Emilio was so attentive and courteous, we can’t wait to come back for another stay and more fine dining. Thank you @TheShard"
August 2021,Ting shard,Emilio looked after us amazingly and we had the best experience in the shard at the ting restaurant shangrila would definitely recommend made us feel very welcome all round amazing experience will definitely be returning
August 2021,Fantastic food and wine to match,My partner and I came for our anniversary. The hotel stay was simply magical. Cocktails in Gong were fab followed by a delicious 2 course meal in Ting. We were very well looked after by Simone and Nathaniel- thanks so much all!
August 2021,Fabulous view and beautifully prepared dining.,Beautiful Asian restaurant with British menu options that has outstanding views of London from the 35th floor of the Shard. Great place for a special dinner. Service was excellent and Leon was terrific. He has a wonderful sense of humor and is delightfully hospitable.
August 2021,Meal at ting,"Emilo was our server and he was absolutely amazing, he was unbelievably catering to our dietary restrictions and made us feel so welcome. The food was sublime and Emilo  was so helpful in helping us chose the best dishes for us to try. Can’t recommend enough!!!"
August 2021,Ting Restaurant,"We celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary at the Ting restaurant and had the most wonderful time. The staff were so welcoming and friendly, made the evening very special. A huge thank you to simone and Nathaniel who waited on us and made out night fab. Thank you 😊"
August 2021,Shangri La Hotel,"I visited with my family to the GONG bar and it was a truly sensational experience, one that I look forward to again. I would like to especially thank Erangelos for his amazing care and looking after us!"
August 2021,Birthday lunch and drinks,My wife treated me to a birthday lunch at Ting restaurant. Brilliant 360 degree views of the capital. The Shard is a lovely experience and the 3 course lunch at the Ting restaurant was amazing. Thank you to Jing and Nathaniel for making our day an amazing experience   would 100% recommend a visit to this lovely restaurant. A great experience which we won't hesitate coming back again soon.
July 2021,Given up on service,"We have stayed at this hotel every year for our wedding anniversary since it opened including during August 2020 just after the first wave of the pandemic when the service was exemplary as ever.  Not this year - we had a catalogue of errors, mostly blamed on Covid restrictions.  I don’t understand how a hotel which could get it so right in 2020 when the Covid restrictions were greater can get it so wrong a year later and actually just not care.  If you want to experience exceptional service at a similarly priced hotel, then go to the Hotel Cafe Royal.  We went in July 2021 for my birthday so during the pandemic.  We were repeat customers but we won’t be returning."
August 2021,The holiday of a lifetime,"Took my three girls on a three-day staycation at the Shangri-La in July as we decided to be tourists in London for our annual holiday this year (due to Covid). We had the holiday of a lifetime! We booked a riverside Iconic Suite, had dinner at the Ting Restaurant and lots of dips in the infinity pool. While the hotel itself is amazing, it's the staff that make it super special. Thank you to Sonia and Rita (Silva) for checking us in and out and to Esmail for fantastic service at dinner. And thank you to all the staff who worked between 14 and 16th July, we felt very special and looked after. It was a really memorable holiday and worth every single penny."
August 2021,Beautiful view from the sky pool,"Had a great stay, just a couple of nights. The pool is great and the attendant even better, (Andzelika) . She checks in and helpful, passes towels to you as you get out of the pool, brilliant person. Josh checked us in at the reception, went through all bookings we needed, like sky bar, pool and breakfast. Berta, on guest relations is lovely.  Improvements could be, table service for breakfast, tea service to the table was slow, on the last morning we left without the tea arriving?  Lift up to the reception are often out of order, if both were broken what would you do?"
August 2021,Genuine review,"Booked a superior room for our 25th wedding anniversary- having previously stayed in 5* hotels I would say that the 3* that we have allocated to this hotel is generous. On arrival one lift was out of action, and had to wait 15 minutes to queue and check in not exactly 5* quality! With apology from reception staff.   The reception employee was very pleasant and informative.  However, on entering the room it was quite apparent that the upkeep of our room was not to a 5* standard - some furniture had scratches and the bidet did not work, I called the concierge twice to report the issue as advised by reception should we have any issues, but had no response so I decided to report the issue to reception, after queuing for a further 15 mins, a maintenance engineer was quickly…"
August 2021,"Gong , Ting Restaurant and stay",Emilio was fantastic and very  attentive will be back . Great time had and good and drinks also very good . The whole stay was great start to finish . Off my husbands bucket list .  Gong cocktail recommendations were very good . Room and attention and view was second to none.
July 2021,Breakfast,"Myself, my 3 children and my friend had breakfast yesterday morning, Marco was absolutely amazing he went above and beyond for us. This was definitely an experience we will never forget. Thank you so much. 100% recommend at least once in your lifetime. The views were outstanding and wow inside was just out of this world"
August 2021,Wonderful staff and hotel with captivating views!,"My best friend and I (both returning customers) stayed at this amazing and beautiful hotel on the 31st July for her 40th birthday celebrations. I cannot express the wonderful memories we had during our stay. To  all the amazing staff who were so helpful and honestly provided 100% customer satisfaction. Special mention to  Tyrone, who was incredibly and exceptionally helpful with my queries. I'm looking forward to my next family booking.  -Thank you for lastminute lovely rose and balloon arrangement."
August 2021,Perfect few days ,"Myself and my husband have just spent 2 fabulous nights here for my birthday. All of the staff are very helpful and friendly. We upgraded our room to a bath with a city view on the second night which was incredible.   The guys out front looking after the valet parking are also great! So easy to use.   Ting restaurant, gong bar are amazing and an early swim in the sky pool is a must!  We can't wait to come back. "
August 2021,Shanghai Restaurant - Ting,"Fantastic 5 course taster meal with brilliant service from Evmail and Nathaniel. Truly an excellent experience of fine dining tastes, flavours and complementary wines. Really enjoyed it, and of course the great ariel views from the 35th floor of the Shard."
August 2021,Just fantastic,What a fabulous evening.  Nathaniel our fantastic wine expert that     made our 5 course experience superb. Along with Eumail our  lovely server. The whole experience at the Shard has been breath taking. This special day was booked as a surprise by my daughter as a 60th birthday treat for me and she said she could not fault the help of the staff that made the special day for us and her all via email. Thank to very one at the Shard. X
August 2021,A Very Special Experience,"This was our 20th Wedding Anniversary and we certainly wanted a very special evening.  It was perfect!  Fantastic food, drink, ambiance and wonderful service from the staff, showing kindness throughout the night.  Add the sensational views of London to the mix!! Highly recommended!"
August 2021,Breath-taking views and delicious tea,"We had the afternoon tea, vegan selection. Amazing views, and though it was quite busy, Jenny was an amazing waitress that did her best! Would definitely recommend, expensive but worth the experience, and the food was delicious!"
August 2021,Stay at the shard,Great stay and great staff.  Myself wife and 8 year old daughter stayed at the shard recently. Great staff and a special mention to Jimmy the door man great service nothing too much trouble and a great asset. Also would like to mention Jing again great customer service. Would highly recommend staying here and also eating here. My daughter is already wanting to go back.
August 2021,Evening made special at Ting by Sabrina - thank you,I was hosted by a lady called Sabrina she was absolutely professional friendly and amazing with my 4 year old daughter she made us comfortable and represented the hotel/restaurant in a very positive and professional way  Sabrina did a walk through the menu and explained everything taking care of allergies and requirements and took care of any special needs. I wasn't so impressed with the food at ting the portions were very small I blame the chef and restaurant for misleading menu.
August 2021,Exceptional,Stayed here for 3 nights for our wedding. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the service was nothing short of exceptional. Every staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and the occasion was as memorable for us as it should be. Nothing was ever too much trouble at any hour of day. Special mention to Nathaniel and Sabrina who made our dinner at Ting on our wedding evening extra special! Room and facilities were as luxurious as you would expect - so much so we were devastated to be leaving and will certainly be back for future celebrations! Thank you to all :)   P.S. Our only possible gripe would be the booking system for use of pool and sauna. Hotel guests should be able to avail hotel facilities whenever is convenient for…
August 2021,Absolutely faultless,"We stayed here as a family of four (children aged 11 and 8) for three nights at the start of August to celebrate my birthday.  We stayed in a corner suite on the 36th floor, with the hotel arranging additional rollaway beds so the children could have their own bed.  When travelling as a family this is so important- so many hotels seem to think that squashing two children onto a double sofa bed is an appropriate bedding arrangement.  Everything has been thought of.  From the small size bathrobes and slippers, to treats for the children and allocated times for children’s swimming in the pool, my girls were treated like valued guests and not an add on.  I must also thank the hotel for the very very generous gifts that were left in the suite to celebrate my birthday.  They were very…"
August 2021,Celebrating my birthday and our wedding anniversary.,"My husband booked this as a surprise for me, and what a wonderful surprise it was!  We stayed for two nights, our room was lovely and had wonderful views from all the windows.  All the staff were very attentive to our needs, and looked after us very well.  We had cocktails on the 52nd floor, taking in the nighttime views on our first night before going out for dinner.  Lovely breakfasts both mornings.  Also booked a slot to use the pool up on the 52nd floor.  We dined in Ting on our last night, enjoyed their five course taster menu, served by Sabrina.  We also had the wine flight to go with our meal which was served by sommelier Nathaniel, he was very knowledgeable about the different types of wines we were drinking - it was a great experience!"
August 2021,Special Occasion,We stayed one night and had dinner in the Ting restaurant. We booked 4 rooms for our Golden Wedding celebration.

Definitely recommend a visit especially for a special occasion.
August 2021,Celebrating birthday of my wife with family,Fantastic restaurant and ambiance. Will refer to my friends and visit again. The food is very good. The quantity is qute filling.

August 2021,JP,"Had an amazing time taking my girlfriend up here. Leon was our server and he was a great host, our advice to him is just to speak a tiny bit louder! (Masks make it hard to hear) The food was delayed a tiny bit, but the view more then made up for the waiting time. We really enjoyed our time here. 5/5"

August 2021,Shangri-La indeed,"Really we couldn’t have wished for more. Excellent service especially from Ketiola, who did work hard for us even bringing a cushion to the back of my niece who is expecting a baby.  The views were clear and quite amazing . The cloud drinks were exotic accompanied by dry ice ice streaming over the stand. A feast for the eyes, then a real feast began delicious savouries and cakes. The scones delicate too. Thank you so much"
July 2021,Anniversary Celebration,We had a wonderful stay to celebrate our Pearl Anniversary.  Josh in Reception was most helpful and engaging and gave us some useful information.   Our room was superb with fantastic views over London Bridge and the financial district.  It was large and well equipped and we enjoyed using the binoculars.  Great views from the Infinity Pool where the staff were very attentive.  Our meal at Ting’s was delicious and Emilio looked after us well.  We particularly enjoyed our chat with the sommelier.  The hotel staff knew it was our anniversary and there were some nice touches as a result.
August 2021,Fantastic Birthday Celebration,"Remarkable Hotel - We had a lovely experience at this hotel from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left. All the staff were extremely helpful and made sure our stay was unforgettable. The room was absolutely stunning, the floor to ceiling windows made it feel like we were up in the clouds and the decorations and all the special touches made my girlfriend's birthday truly memorable. The spa was incredible with views over London, we enjoyed The Gong bar for dinner and breakfast in the morning was really nice with great variety of items to choose from. Overall an amazing experience and would love to go back. --"
August 2021,Anniversary meal,"Had our special evening meal at the Ting restaurant at the Shard. Friendly helpful staff, good food presented well with a good wine choice.

August 2021,Amazing,"My family and I stayed in the hotel 09 - 11 August. From the moment we arrived to the moment we collected our luggage to travel home the service was exemplary. Josh from reception showed us to our room and was so lovely to our 6 year old. The staff at the sky pool were so helpful and nothing was too much. Jing looked after us at breakfast and was so nice, again nothing was too much trouble and she was lovely to our little boy. Cannot fault this hotel, room immaculate and beds turned down. Thank you for an amazing stay."
August 2021,Ting - amazing lunch!,"We had an amazing lunch at Ting! We had the 3-course experience and children’s menu. Food was delicious and above all Leon who was serving us was exceptional! He was friendly, helpful and explaining every dish in detail! Thank you so much Leon!"
August 2021,Another beautiful stay,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times now, and it is just so beautiful. Maybe one of my favorite hotels anywhere in the world! This time I stayed with my mum (her second stay), and our room (Iconic city view room) was just beautiful. The views are truly incredible.   We ate at Ting on the first night and I have written them a separate review. But I did feel that the breakfast at Ting was not as good as it normally is. The menu has been significantly reduced, and now they try and charge you extra to order from the menu which is a bit cheeky. The buffet itself was pretty poor compared to what it normally is. I do feel like they were trying to cut costs and you really shouldn't feel like that in a five star hotel. The service wasn't as good as it normally is either, it was…"
August 2021,Ting Restaurant,"Went to the restaurant to celebrate my mum's birthday. We all went there with high hopes and it certainly delivered. The view was mind-blowing! The food was exceptional!!! We met a waiter called Leon, who was a fantastic host. Her catered to our every needs whilst we were there and made sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommended 👌🏾"
August 2021,Lovely relaxing lunch with spectacular views,"Light dining lunch at the Ting restaurant with our 12-year-old daughter.

August 2021,Birthday celebration,"We celebrated my husband’s birthday at the shard and so I treated him to a 5 course meal at Ting restaurant, our waiter Emilio was very polite and helpful from start to finish, couldn’t fault him and the service at all.

August 2021,Birthday visit,"Our stay was beyond amazing! The hotel.. the room... the view.,. The staff! One member of the team stood out.. Jimmy the doorman greeting us as we arrived... he arranged a taxi for us... and  recognised us the following day for a chat... nothing was too much trouble!"
August 2021,Celebrations at Ting,We celebrated our friend’s birthday today and we really enjoyed the dinner. Gloria saw us at the entrance and she made us feel extremely welcome from the beginning to the end of our Ting experience! We hope to see her again the next time we visit.
August 2021,Birthday dinner,Had a lovely birthday dinner at Tings served by Emilio. The views were amazing and the service was very nice and hospitable as well. We went to celebrate a birthday and we’re given complimentary chocolates as well
August 2021,Amazing time,"I stayed at the shard for my 1 year anniversary and they made it as special as it possibly could be.   From the second we arrived the staff were attentive and helpful. They parked our car this was at a charge of £55 for 24 hours. They took our luggage up and we checked in smoothly.   Our room was amazing fitted with a bath overlooking London. The bed had rose petals on (my boyfriend had organised this before arrival)  I can not fault the room.   The pool area was the best but about our stay. Although we was not informed that you needed to book a swimming slot. The pool and sauna area is amazing and again all the staff are attentive and super helpful. There is complimentary water, hot drinks and fruit. You have to book an hour slot for the swimming area, I would advise to do this…"
August 2021,Birthday at the shard,"Massive thanks to Jenny at Ting restaurant in the shard! Had an amazing birthday and her exemplary service made it 10 times better!!! thanks jenny!!!

August 2021,A fabulous short break in the clouds,"Such friendly staff, nothing too much trouble. Happy to give advice and help with bookings. The swimming pool was a stunning experience - hard to swim when all you want to do is admire the view. Josh checked us in and out and it was obviously so important to him that we’d had a great stay."
August 2021,Fabulous hotel,Came to the Shangri-la at the Shard for partners 50th with our 3 children and it did not disappoint on any level. We had 2 rooms with a connecting door which was well thought out and works great for a family with young kids. Yes it was expensive but we had complimentary parking and buffet breakfast which was fantastic. The rooms are lovely and the children had a Superior which was massive. Nearby Borough Market has some great places to eat too and also the produce is excellent. London Bridge station is a short walk away and there was nothing to complain about. The concierge was super helpful and the door men all so lovely and great with the children too. None of us wanted to leave!
August 2021,5 star night!,"The night was great. Food was extremely flavourful, we had the lobster benedict to start with the beef short rib and the taste was so authentic. Same for the main courses of Wagyu beef and tortellini! Highlights of the night the great service of Emilio and Nathaniel. Fantastic and spotless! Very professional, precise and they gave us a memorable experience!"
August 2021,Fantastic Afternoon Tea at Ting,Visited Ting at the Shangri-La today for Cloud Forest Afternoon Tea to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   The service was great and the food was beautiful to look at and to eat.  All staff wished us Happy Anniversary and they even gave us some chocolates as a gift at the end. Would highly recommend.
August 2021,The most helpful staff,"I lost my phone, and gentleman had found it and kindly said he would drop it to the shard after dinner. This phone had precious memories and photos of my children so I was ever so thankful.  Once I arrived at the shard Albert and Bassam  Where the most helpful reception staff. They managed  to locate my phone and even went to the restaurant to collect it for me.   They sat me down and got me a bottle of water as they could see how distressed I was.   I am most grateful for all the kindness I received. From the staff at the Shard and the gentleman who found my phone.  I would like to say a massive thank you"
August 2021,Delightful!,Everything about Ting’s restaurant is fantastic. The food was astounding and the care and service by Sabrina and Nathaniel were instrumental in us having an enjoyable time. I will come again and urge you to try as well.
July 2021,Birthday Dinner,I really loved the service I received at Ting the Shard. I was served my Nathaniel and Sabrina who both made my experience the most enjoyable. We were seated directly by the London Bridge with the best view and were offered such a lovely service. Nathaniel helped me choose my champagne which was delightful and he was such a Joy to be around. Overall it was a 10/10 experience and I will definitely be visiting regularly.
August 2021,Great hotel - Dinner at Ting was Amazing,"Stayed for one night for a birthday celebration. Outstanding place. Room 5008 has a bath overlooking St Paul’s, the Thames and Borough Market. Dinner at Ting was amazing. The service was very attentive but not intrusive; such polite, wonderful and welcoming staff. Our waitress Sabrina was very knowledgeable and attentive, the sommelier Nathaniel was incredible too. A great celebration."
August 2021,Miss,Really friendly and considerate staffs!! They are all very helpful and super lovely!! The view from the room is absolutely gorgeous!! Also very close to London bridge and borough market so fantastic location-wise too!! Definitely recommend if you’re looking for a luxurious and relaxing trip in London👍
July 2021,50th birthday surprise!,A magical time at the Shangri La!  My Fiancé was 50 and I wanted it to be special and it was. Amazing views and we felt like a Prince and Princess!  The room had magnificent views of London and was spacious. The bathroom was to die for. The swimming pool had restricted entry due to Covid but we did not have to wait either day we stayed and loved it there - very relaxing. Our meal in the TING restaurant was also superb.  The attention from the staff from being in the lift to walking around to reception was outstanding!  Valet parking was an asset.   Mr Kurt Macher should be very proud of his team!  Only one feedback point - could do with more than one USB port in the bedroom.  One word - FABULOUS!
August 2021,The Best Hotel!,"We stayed in the hotel for a week, the whole family agreed this is the best hotel we ever been to! The views are fantastic, very impressed with the service! All the stuff are very friendly and helpful. I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to Jing Nie, the wonderful lady in the Ting restaurant, she really impressed us with her professional customer service and what a lovely lady! Wonderful views and service, good food! Will definitely come back again!"
July 2021,Shangri-la at The Shard,"This visit was a birthday celebration and  was a fabulous 2 day  break. The Shangri-la is a wonderful hotel in a great location, combining elegance, style and exceptional service. Friendly and charming staff throughout the hotel but a special thanks to Josh ( who checked us in) and ionut for their care and attention."
July 2021,Great Meal,"We went to Ting restaurant for lunch, the main course was very tasty and the dessert was delicious.  The environment on the Shard was spectacular, even in the toilets there was a stunning view of the city.   In general all the staff members were very welcoming and friendly.  I will definitely come back in the near future!"
July 2021,Disappointed,"We stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel for my Birthday. But we was very disappointed as when we arrived to the Hotel requests for our room was not met. We requested a bath with a view which was not ready and we had to wait a hour for our room.  My partner paid for Champagne, chocolates, balloons and roses for our room. As we got to the room there was no champagne or chocolate. Much to my partners surprise he was very let down by this. I called reception to make them aware of this and they told me ' they was busy and be with us some point this evening'. We had a reservation at 8pm at Hutong Restaurant and we wanted to sip on the Champagne while watching the beautiful view. Which we could not do. Multiple calls to the Reception and no luck.  My partner had to go down to reception which…"
August 2021,Pleasant stay,"Stayed for two nights.  Room was very comfortable and clean, brilliant views.  All in all a very pleasant stay, hotel is situated right beside London Bridge train / tube station so is very easy to get to.  The thing I was disappointed with was the hotel seems to focus too much on non residential guests.  You have to prebook the restaurant and even the bar and it’s by no means guaranteed that you will get in.  Thankfully we got wind of this before arriving and booked everything before hand so we were ok but we heard other guests checking in and not being able to use the bar that day.  Frankly for a 5 star hotel that is unacceptable.  The sky lounge never seemed to be open, it was always either closed or holding a private event.  When you book the bar you only get 90mins then you…"
August 2021,Birthday dinner,"I had a great birthday dinner with the view of tower bridge! Food was amazing and our server, Leon, was spectacular! Nathaniel, our wine connoisseur, was very knowledgeable and had a great recommendation!"
August 2021,Incredible - Alina is amazing,"Booked afternoon tea for my family and Alina served us. She was absolutely incredible. One of the nicest, friendliest waitresses I’ve experienced and she made the trip 100x better. She is an asset to the Shangri La and I’ll defiantly be asking for her again upon my return."
August 2021,Absolutely stunning stay! best Views in London!,"We loved it, the views are simply stunning - from the restaurant, spa (pool and glazed sauna with the view is incredible). Service was superb, we felt looked after and pampered! Room was so comfortable and we had fantastic bath tub with City View. Restaurant's menu was fantastic, we had tasting menu (brilliant vegan options, shout out to the chef!) thank you Simone for hosting us at the dinner and Kat for brilliant wine journey and expertise - both super professional. We will definitelely come back!"
August 2021,Event Shangri-La London,"Event at the Shangri-La  We hosted three events at the Shangri La and they all went to extremely smoothly! We had great five star service, a great event layout and excellent food and drink.  The staff were all excellent but I have to a social shout out to Diane who made everything run like clockwork. She has a calm nature and made sure everything was always in hand"
August 2021,Lovely lunch with our young kids,"Leon and Julian made our little kids feel right at home. They made them laugh and helped them pick something they would enjoy eating. They loved counting the trains. Food was delicious, loved the dessert. Would recommend."
June 2021,Birthday Lunch at Ting Restaurant,"I booked a birthday celebration for my mum at Ting Restaurant. We were warmly welcomed and hosted by all staff with particular mentions to Alan and Alina who looked after us during our meal. The food was great, with excellent presentation and the views from the restaurant were equally stunning. Our table had panoramic views across London and we were very impressed!  We highly recommend the experience and will be coming back soon!"
August 2021,Birthday Boy at The Shangri-ma in The Shard,"The inevitable day of my birthday in the year 2021 arrived as always more quickly than I'd anticipated, but, fair to say, I did look forward to this one ... as I was to spend my afternoon as a guest in the wonderful Shangri-La Hotel halfway up the eightyish-story world-renowned Shard.  In the Neverland-inspired restaurant of this towering wonder-building, my good lady and I were being treated to afternoon tea by a very dear friend, Sabrina Aquilina, a staff member in this magical newish London attraction. And it was a day to remember.  When one alights the lift to the 'Ting' restaurant, (35 floors up) one is immediately struck, of course, by the unimaginable birds-eye views of London from the sky above it.  We must have had the very best seat in the house as we tucked in to the…"
August 2021,Excellent staff,"We arrived at the hotel and soon realised our son was in a state of anxiety about the lifts. We met Christoph on concierge initially. He was amazing. He spoke with calmness and kindness and worked with us as a family to try and ensure we got to the room. As we had another child with us, we took him up to Reception where we then met Josh. He was equally as fantastic and assisted us in every way possible.  We cannot thank these staff members enough. We feel people as compassionate, hard working and as interested in assisting guests as both of these men are, is extremely rare and the level of service and understanding they provided was outstanding.  Please pass on our thanks."
July 2021,Lunch with friends someplace new,"Lunch for five of us at Ting was a treat.  Service, led by Marco, was friendly, professional and truly without fault.  From the time we were seated, we were made to feel welcomed.  Ordered drinks and then, upon looking at the menu, decided to have three courses at £34.50.  Starters were enjoyed all around and mains were very good indeed which included lamb rump, prawn tortellini and glazed pork belly.  While indulgent, desserts were rather light in a really nice way.  Ambiance was great, enhanced by being seated at the windows overlooking the City, the Thames and Canary Wharf.  And during all of this, excellent customer service throughout.  Looking forward to booking afternoon tea in the near future.  Thanks to all the staff who ensured we had a lovely dining experience."
July 2021,Family reunion,"Lovely stay in amazingly situated hotel. Room and facilities excellent. Staff friendly and helpful. Pool staff very good. Valet and concierge service staff were superb and helpful and very interactive. Was particularly impressed with Ionut and Arnole. I did find the check in and reception process very slow and somewhat chaotic partly due to poor signage and lack of space and staff. I had anticipated that  a more interesting and greater choice of non alcoholic drinks would be available, particularly wine. But overall a very good few days which will likely be repeated."
July 2021,Very nice room 4005 premier city view,"  check in easy enough a few forms to fill in and pre authorization of the card to be paid with. room great couldn't really ask for a better room, suites arnt always the best rooms. ICR 180⁰ views. bathroom great view. nice heated toilet seat. in room service easy enough they set a table for you and bring it in to use. pricey for what you get some dishes are good value and some are not. Room service/House keeping very good. "
August 2021,The most memorable stay in my life,"My husband and I decided to stay at the Shangrila here in London to celebrate our marriage and I honestly didn’t expect anything from them. However, upon walking into the room, not only did they arrange in advance to upgrade us tmr the suit, there was a huge bouquet of flowers for us, canapés, champagne and a lovely message on the window.  They did not only do this for our room, they did it for our parents room as well- giving them the same wonderful experience we received. But wait, that was only day 1. There was even more for our second day. The experience was extraordinary. I’ve never felt so much love and care from any hotel before. They made our wedding all the more magical And all the more memorable. I can safely say that this experience was truly special for us. Thank you…"
August 2021,An incredible place!!,Had the most amazing time here celebrating our anniversary! The staff could not have been more attentive. We had the perfect views from our seat and witnessed the most beautiful rainbow. I would thoroughly recommend to everyone. Thanks Kurt and the team for an incredible experience.
August 2021,The perfect date night,"An absolutely amazing restaurant and view with staff who go out of their way to make your experience even better. Our waiter, Leon, did just this. We cannot fault the food, the service and the views. We even had an extra surprise with a Happy Birthday decoration on our dessert. We would definitely recommend to visit."
July 2021,Gong Bar,"Daria is the best!! So attentive, Proffesional, perfect product knowledge and customer service. She is a brilliant asset to the company. Love the view, amazing cocktails and atmosphere is just perfect,positive  vibes 😍"
June 2021,Great hospitality and service!,Just wanted to give a big shout out to Leon in particular who served us at the Ting Lounge one evening during our stay at the Shard. He was so attentive and accommodating - which really made our evening! 
July 2021,Stunning family staycation,"We booked 2 rooms on the family staycation package which included breakfast and a room upgrade. Our rooms we fabulous - WHAT A VIEW!!- overlooking Tower Bridge towards the city. AMAZING!! The rooms were set up as requested (king and 2 singles, adjoining). They were beautifully appointed.  We were on floor 36. The rooms were huge. Beds were extremely comfortable. The bathrooms and toiletries were sublime.  The breakfast buffet has so much choice, both British and Asian, that we never used the a-la-carte menu.  The pool had to be pre-booked but we got all the slots we requested. It has a stunning view, but isn’t huge.  Whilst the rooms and facilities are outstanding what makes the hotel is the staff. They are a real credit to the establishment. So friendly, always addressing you…"
July 2021,Afternoon tea,I visited for afternoon tea with my son to celebrate a 'special' birthday. We were looked after by Marco who was very attentive and delightful. Food was delicious and plentiful. We had a table close to the window and it was a clear day so views were spectacular. Would highly recommend .
July 2021,"Beautiful views, exceptional customer service","We stayed at the hotel with my friends for my birthday celebrations. During our stay the customer service was exceptional,the view from our rooms was so beautiful  and the staff were extremely helpful and polite. The breakfast was amazing and the quality of the food was great, we also used the sky pool and sauna with breathtaking views and nice drinks. Overall we were so welcomed and impressed and we definitely recommend Shangri-la.  Thank you once again for making it a birthday to remember!  Maria Bloufa"
July 2021,Hugh G,"Wow what can I say. I surprised my girlfriend with a stay here for our 1st year together and we were blown away.. The view from the room amazing, the restaurants amazing, staff amazing. You can't find fault with this hotel."
July 2021,Well worth it!,"This was a total London bucket list item for me and we splashed out for our wedding anniversary. First impressions weren't brilliant because of the rather disorganised, lengthy queue at reception and an unexplained wait of around 20 minutes for our room despite arriving after check-in time, but they provided a complimentary aperol spritz while we waited which set the tone for an above and beyond experience. I requested a bathroom with a view and we got this (WOW!! is all i can say about it)- along with a piece of cake and card for our anniversary delivered to the room that evening. Shangri La are known for their amazing service and they did not disappoint. The attendants at the sky pool (also WOW) were polite and helpful, and the gentleman who brought us room service was also…"
June 2021,Ting restaurant,"Emilio was brilliant, he faultlessly delivered us 5 courses and explained what ingredients was in our food. He was very knowledgable and he will definitely influence us to visit again. Thankyou Emilio."
July 2021,Perfection!,"Perfect as always. Another gorgeous room, staff that cater for your every need. Amazing. You cannot fault this hotel from the moment you arrive. The food is delicious the staff are friendly the room and views are amazing. Used the pool and gym which also have stunning views."
July 2021,"Overall, wonderful.","I was treated to a night at the Shangri-la for my birthday, everything was perfect! The bed was comfy (and huge), Ting served the loveliest food with quality ingredients, the most perfect eggs and gorgeous cocktails, the view was obviously incredible and the pool was a great way to start the next morning - 10/10 for everything above.   We were however very disappointed to find that the amount of gratuity we left for the gentleman who brought us breakfast had doubled. It wasn't a huge amount, the money isn't the problem.. it's the dishonesty from (I'm guessing) a very small percentage of staff. Unfortunately we didn't actually find out until we were home, upon checkout we trusted our bill would be accurate, lesson learned!   We would definitely stay again but would 100% take a…"
June 2021,Best birthday ever!,We had an amazing time from the start having Rita helping with the check in and all the questions we had. She also went the extra mile and delivered a cake for my boyfriend’s 30th birthday. We really appreciated it.  The infinity pool was very relaxing and the views was breathtaking. Thank you for such an amazing experience!
July 2021,The views are the selling point,"It’s definitely an experience staying in the shard but only for the views. I didn’t really find anything else that spectacular. We ate at the restaurant both for our evening meal and breakfast. Food isn’t great and there’s not much choice. Went for a swim in the pool and my goodness it was freezing!! Again, the only good thing was the views. There are nicer hotels to stay in in London but everyone must go once for the experience"
July 2021,Unforgettable experience,"We visited the Shangri-La the Shard for my 18th birthday, all the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Many thanks to Rita and Tania for surprising me with the decorations and birthday cake. I was also very impressed with the excellent and attentive service provided by Danny and Alina at the Ting restaurant. Thank you so much to all the staff for making the experience so special."
July 2021,Ting Restaurant,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Ting for a pre-show meal. The food and wine were gorgeous, a shame we couldn't stay for desert as the cheese board looked very tempting! The staff were attentive and our server Leon particularly made our visit special! The views of course were unbelievable, highly recommended !"
July 2021,Shangri la hotel,"I was served by emilio. He was lovely, amazing service. Food was first class. Amazing view. One to visit! The dessert was extremely nice and light. Perfect for after a heavy meal. But the service was top notch."
July 2021,Anniversary dinner,We had the most incredible evening at both Gong and Ting! Marco was amazing and ensured we had such a lovely anniversary with nonstop attentive service and oh my gosh the food was sublime. I would 100% recommend this to anyone for any occasion! W’ere thinking of making our visit to Ting a yearly tradition
June 2021,Wonderful Experience,We can not fault any aspect of our dinner and stay. Everything was as amazing as expected. The dinning in the sky experience was second to none made even better by our waiter Tanveer. And we were made so comfortable throughout our stay from start to finish by Josh on the front desk. We would highly recommend a visit to the Gong Bar with it’s perfect views and amazing drinks. And the room was absolutely stunning having everything we needed to enjoy our night to the full. Our experience as a whole was outstanding and we would love to return.
July 2021,Wonderful views,"Stayed here one night in June and the hotel is stunning, amazing views, immaculate room, respectful staff, unbelievable food, awesome pool and gym, and the room had everything you would expect from a five star hotel, (well almost). I was told to book for breakfast as there was high demand, which I did. On Saturday night my friend and myself decided to visit the hotel bars and found to our astonishment that we couldn’t get in, as apparently they were full. Had I been told at the time of booking my room, that I would also have to book a place in the bars, then I would have done so. In the end, I had to find a local off license and have a couple of drinks in our room. I have an iPhone 12, something that I would assume many people staying at the Shard would have, but when it came to…"
July 2021,Trip away with my daughter,"We had a wonderful holiday, all the staff we're very nice and helpful. I felt very relaxed and comfortable in the hotel with my 9 year old daughter who also loved the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the conseige and duty manager. I want to give a special mention to Jimmy the doorman who helped me out when I arrived at the hotel in my car to find it very busy and no place to park,( I was also a little stressed because the streets have been changed to a one way system but car sat navigation kept sending me the wrong Wayne!) he ran straight over and guided me to a safe place to leave my car before it could be parked properly. I will definitely be returning."
June 2021,"Mediocrity, only 50 Floors Up.","Since completing my stay I have updated this review…  Like a grown up jingling keys to distract a baby. The Shangri-La seems to want you to look out of the windows at the pretty view so as not to notice that they aren’t doing a stellar job inside.   This is my second stay at this hotel. The first stay had some small issues and we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, the second has cemented my view that this experience is sub-par.  It isn’t a single glaring issue - except maybe the lack of attention to detail. But our stay was punctuated by a progressive host of small annoyances that add up to a stay not really up to snuff when compared to other similarly priced hotels.  For many I’m sure the experience would be ‘ok’. But having stayed in many a fine hotel. The…"
July 2021,Hard to beat,"We stayed two nights in an iconic city view room and one night in a premier city view - well worth going for a room with a north facing city view for the absolutely spectacular views.  We have stayed here several times and if you’re after a fabulous hotel with a view, it’s hard to beat. Really excellent service, especially from the front desk team who were exceptionally helpful. Good breakfast - not my favourite ever hotel breakfast, it could do with better bread but there are nice options on the buffet and of course beautiful views from the restaurant.  We booked the pool for 7am each morning (you have to book ahead because of Covid rules) and started each day with a swim and sauna on the 52nd floor.  A fabulous hotel and absolutely recommended."
June 2021,Lovely summers evening,Fantastic visit to the sky lounge for drinks with friends! Such a great experience and the views! Henry in particular made our evening complete with his attention to detail and his lovely personality! Thank you!
July 2021,Top class service,"Know you're staying at a great hotel known for service when it starts at reception. Tyrone upon checking was polite and friendly and a great example of 5-star service.  As a semi regular guest, it's always nice to be recognised by staff members. Given lockdown in London was over a year and not being able to stay as often as i had, i was amazed that Jordeen from Ting restaurant recognised me and took me straight to my table i was joining. It's those little things that separate the hotel from others.  Lastly, need to make mention of Nic the chef for making my favourite fish dish ever a Hibachi rib. Had it twice in three nights :)"
July 2021,Magical weekend,"Recently stayed here with my boyfriend for a weekend and we were completely blown away upon entering the hotel and our stunning room. The views, service and food was outstanding and the staff made us feel at home. The stay was worth every penny and was completely magical. I was very lucky to have my requests honoured which included a bath with views overlooking the city, including tower bridge. A very romantic hotel which succeeds in making you feel like royalty during your stay. I would also like to say how incredibly thankful I was to receive the complimentary champagne and cake which was organised by a colleague. This was such a lovely surprise that we enjoyed whilst relaxing in our bath overlooking the city in daylight and at night! One bath a day isn’t enough when your view…"
July 2021,Birthday stay at the Sangri La Hotel,"Very professional and courteous concierge on arrival from Ionut and staff member Emily at reception. Complimentary birthday treat was sent to the room by surprise, however there were some issues with the room, meaning our experience and sleep was disturbed. This was handled with professionalism and relatively promptly with good will gesture to compensate. Thank you to the friendly staff for making the stay memorable."
July 2021,Lunch at Ting,"Very good food and even better service. Interesting, novel and well executed dishes. Catered well to our culinary requirements. Our server Marco was attentive and gave excellent advice. Great view of London from our window table."
July 2021,Anniversary dinner,"Emilio the waiter was amazing, really good customer service and fluent in different languages. The food was good and the environment perfect! We choose the set menu to try different dishes and it was really worthy, the portions are not really big but just choose a good wine and enjoy the view…,"
June 2021,Just stunning,"Just amazing! I loved every single moment there. Booked a solo staycation in July and everything was just stunning. Many thanks to Roland for giving me the best room and for being so welcoming and showing me around, to Momo at Gong bar for making sure I don’t run out of champagne and for making me feel comfortable being there on my own (checking the name of the booking and addressing to me with my name was a great touch), to Rita Silva for a smooth check out and being so smiley and friendly. The whole experience was just amazing and didn’t want to leave that place. Friendly and welcoming staff at the pool, tasty breakfast (lovely staff and very welcoming and attentive), well equipped gym for a great workout with a view. Just stunning and can’t wait to visit again! Thanks"
June 2021,Amazing Family staycation,"We loved everything about this hotel! The rooms were so clean and the views were incredible. Checking in and out was really easy and all the staff  were so friendly and helpful. Our daughters had an amazing time, loved the infinity pool and breakfast at Ting. Thanks for the recommendation Laura Winstone we will definitely stay again :)"
July 2021,Baby-Moon,"My girlfriend Laura Winstone and I stayed at Shangri-La London for our baby moon. Was so nice to relax in the spa pool and be treated like royalty throughout our stay. TING was amazing for dinner and breakfast. Such helpful pleasant staff. Thank you Julien, Jing, Alan, Gloria, in TING for your extra attentive service. You all made it one to remember. Can’t wait to return."
June 2021,5 Star,Absolutely loved everything about this hotel from cleanliness to the staff all very nice and welcoming. The bed was so comfy and the hotel was beautiful as well as the views! The doorman Jimmy was so welcoming and friendly and was nice to talk to. Would definitely come again.   Mr Fazil
June 2021,Jing is amazing,Amazing experience and so romantic for couples - our server Jing was amazing and catered to out every whim I couldn’t recommend a better place for afternoon tea!!! The food is fabulous and so is the decor/views. Definitely a must try if you get the chance to go!!!
July 2021,Excellent would go again,We booked this for our anniversary as an indulgent treat. It’s not cheap and we knew that. We could have gone to Spain for a week for the same price as two nights. But this was about spoiling ourselves. And we did. We had our car so parked in Q Parks 12 min walk away. Trying to get anywhere near the Shard in a car was hopeless. Even the taxis we used whilst there struggled. Often dropping us at the end of the road or on the other side of the station. This is due to so many bike lanes being opened and road closures. So be warned.  From arrival when they took our cases from our hands until the end. We loved it all. We’ve been in Gong a few times before for drinks. So we didn’t venture in this time. After all we had amazing views from our room.   Room….  We didn’t pay for river…
July 2021,Just surreal,"Great customer service from start to finish. The bell boys/concierge on the ground floor are just lovely - so friendly and welcoming. We had room 4304 which was a corner room- it was just wow. We had everything we needed for example iron, bottle opener , wine glasses, water, toiletries. Turn down service available, our room was clean and tidy when we came back in the evening. Everything was perfect. Just avoid the Ting restaurant  at all costs. Hutong , and Roast a million times better.  Roast in borough market does a great breakfast - 2 minutes walk away"
July 2021,Lovely dinner for Mum’s birthday,Lovely venue. Lovely service. Lovely food. My 70 year old mum had the best time  The space is beautiful and the service is first class. Pricey but absolutely worth it for a special occasion. Will return
July 2021,Mr C Fenner & S Gillespie,"We have just got back from our stay, all I can say is “wow!”  What a spectacular place, unbelievable views but most of all amazing service! The reception desk and the all staff we encountered were truly exceptional, a very special thank you to Josh for his fantastic service but most of all his friendly personality which made us feel so welcome. We will be back as a couple for sure, but hopefully returning in the next couple of weeks with family as we enjoyed our stay so much."
July 2021,Absolutely amazing service,"We visited for my 30th birthday, we had spectacular  views from our room and my husband had decorations and cake arranged also which was a lovely touch.  We had a 5 course dinner in the Ting and our waiter Emilio was absolutely amazing at catering to our needs, very helpful and attentive.  We are very impressed with all of the staff at Shangri-la hotel and will definitely stay again."
July 2021,In Heaven... ,The most perfect London view point including a truly amazing Sunset and also Sunrise! literally Out-Of-This-World.   Plus everything you would expect & more from a five star hotel of the Shangri-la fame...Personal Service and Room Quality (TV in bathroom - obviously)   
July 2021,Emilio is amazing,"I came with my partner for a nice dinner. The service, the food and the view are perfect. If you get Emilio as a server you’re lucky. He’s the best thing about the place. He’s so personable and sweet."
July 2021,Afternoon Tea at Ting,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Shangri-la and Afternoon Tea in Ting restaurant.  The hotel was beautifully decorated, atmosphere relaxed, views amazing, staff friendly and attentive, food delicious and excellently presented!  Couldn't have asked for more.  Everyone had a great afternoon, including my two daughters, one of which was celebrating her 7th birthday.  Thank you Laura Winstone for the recommendation to visit Ting at the Shangri-La for Afternoon Tea.  Thank you to all the staff for making it so special.  We will be back again!"
July 2021,Ting restaurant,"Very lovely and a good treat ,food was very good and interesting nice cuisine with the English and Asian.Survice was amazing and extremely friendly couldn’t recommend more,rather expensive so to have as just a treat."

July 2021,Wedding ceremony and reception at the Shangri-La,"My wife and I recently had our wedding ceremony and brunch reception at the Shard Shangri-La hotel. The room, the space (Ren-B room and Sky Lounge) and the views made it a perfect location for our wedding. We and all the guests enjoyed it. The whole Shangri La team and event manager made it an unforgettable experience. Everybody was very welcoming and helpful throughout including the receptionist, the porters etc, helping to set up the ceremony room the day before, as well as allowing us extra time with the guests to cut the wedding cake and enjoy the brunch reception. I highly recommend the venue and the hotel, and cannot compliment the staff at Shangri La hotel enough. We also thoroughly enjoyed the suite as well as the infinity pool and bar on level 52. Looking forward to…"
July 2021,Impeccable service 👌🏽,"It has been a wonderful experience. From the time that we entered the premises, everyone has been very warm and welcoming.   The view from our room was amazing too especially during sunset. Shoutout to Johan for the room that was assigned to us. We appreciate the personalized note/letter from Sonia (Guest relations), the decoration and ofcourse the note on the glass wall too.   We had drinks in Gong and was accomodated well by Daria. For dinner, we went to Ting and also had breakfast there the next day. Jordin was so sweet and Danny made sure that we are alright. Dinner was made more special by the attentiveness of Kat and Francesco.   Our stay was short and sweet but it has been unforgettable. Will definitely recommend and will be back again."
June 2021,Ting restaurant,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the shard and went to ting restaurant. Our server was Emilio, he was amazing 10 out of 10 service, so polite, jokey, friendly, so informative! And the restaurant as a whole was amazing! Service from everyone especially Emilio 100/10 & the food was again 100/10!!! We highly recommend this restaurant and the staff was absolutely amazing ! X"

July 2021,21st Birthday Celebrations,Our experience was superb! From checking in to checking out every staff member we met made us feel so welcome and couldn’t have done anything more for us. A special shout-out to Josh!  We will be back..!
July 2021,Dream come truw,"Our stay at Shangri La Hotel at The Shard was for my 30th birthday (celebrations delayed a year due to covid). On our original booking we requested a room with a bath tub with a view. On arrival we were told that no rooms with this feature were available. We asked the lovely Rita C to recheck for us. RIita spent about 30 minuets tapping away on the computer and ringing colleagues. She then returned to us to tell us it has been possible to find this room but there would be a short wait for room inspection. We were over joyed, so much so I actually cried! (happy tears of course)  The room was jaw droppingly beautiful. The view was of Tower Bridge and the Thames and was spectacular. And the bathroom! 😍 It was a dream come true. We also had coffee in the Ting bar and cocktails in…"
June 2021,5* luxury ,"We stayed a night in the iconic shard suite, and it was HEAVEN! Everyone was so welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. The breakfast, although pricey, was delicious and the gentleman who delivered it to our room was a ray of sunshine. The complimentary cake delivered to our room was very gratefully receive. We visited the pool on floor 52 which had amazing views and was tended to by lovely gentleman waiting poolside with a freshly laundered towel. We did not visit the bars or restaurant but on our return in the evening we were greeted with live music floating up from the Sky Lounge.  We had a truly memorable stay which we will treasure for many years to come"
July 2021,Good environment and food,The food here is so good and the view is so beautiful. People here are so nice! Really a good experience. It’s a good place for dating also. It has amazing service. Love the mixture of eastern and western food. Will definitely come here next time!
July 2021,Continental breakfast at ting,"This was is a lovely restaurant with beautiful views. The continental breakfast was delicious especially the pastries. Alinia our waitress was very kind, well-mannered and helpful. Also it was my birthday and Alinia brought some chocolates to our table for the occasion. I would definetly recommend this restaurant for any occasion.  Thank you TING restaurant for this wonderful experience!"
July 2021,10/10,"From start to finish the whole experience was excellent!! Beautiful views from the table and the service we received from Esmail was first class.

July 2021,WOW,"We stayed here and from start to finish, the whole experience was AMAZING.   I booked direct the night before and the 2 gentlemen who helped me arrange my stay were fantastic, so helpful & so clear with every detail.   We took our luggage first thing and this was taken from us at the door and we actually arrived to check in an hour early but our room was ready which was fantastic. Check in was smooth - we had actually been upgraded also which was a great surprise upon arrival. Staff were discreet with the rate I paid too as I didn’t want my partner to hear as it was all a surprise for him and then completely respected this.   The level of service is impeccable all round from checking in, to maintenance ringing our doorbell as the phone didn’t work to the pool attendants.   We…"
May 2021,Wonderful. Excellent.

June 2021,Amazing view and excellent service,"Amazing experience with a magnificent view of London.   My wife booked the restaurant for my birthday, the hospitality and food was excellent. We were looked after by a gentleman called Simone, he was polite and courteous and went out of his way to allow us to spend time in one of the special luxury party rooms to take photo’s. We have a great time and Simone made it that extra special for being so kind and going that extra mile for us."
July 2021,Best day of my life,"We booked our civil wedding at the Shard during lockdown last year, it was planned for Feb 2021 but due to lockdown it was moved to 30th June. We just got married and it feels amazing that we held this at the Shard! Molly the Director helped me book my special day and helped me plan every single detail. She was so friendly and so calmly specially during some bumps along the way. The build up the day was stressful as every wedding is but the team at Shard was ready and waiting for me day before to help me set everything up with my decor team. Cynthia helped me set my two rooms up and was so friendly. Her smile helped me stay clam and was better for me as I formed the relationship for the actual day. On the day Molly was waiting in the lobby with open arms ready to help me have my…"
July 2021,Wonderful afternoon tea,Highly recommend afternoon tea at Ting. We were fantastically well looked after by Sabrina and enjoyed every moment. Food and tea were delicious and we were offered refills without having to ask - and which we gratefully accepted. Superb view as you’d expect and adding a glass of champagne for £10 each was an easy decision. By no means a cheap afternoon out but we were so well fed and looked after that we agreed it represented great value. Will definitely be back. Thank you
July 2021,Celebratory,"Fantastic stay ar the Shangri la London. Accommodated an early check in enabling us to make full use of the pool and the sauna. Had an amazing in the very capable hands of 'Danny' at Ting's.He was professional, courteous making guests fel special. Thank you for a superb stay."
July 2021,Great room Budget service,"The room was fantastic but we were expecting 5 star care.  They got our confirmed registrtion request wrong but did offer a free breakfast in compensation.   No one showed us to our room or explained how things worked.  No directory in the room just a small ipad which took some working out. Took us ages to find a guide to the landmarks which was tucked in the bottom of the box with the binos.  Our room was turned down but no one removed our tea things until we asked.  Breakfast was very expensive but the eggs benedict had processed ham and tough muffins, eggs were just right.  Check out took ages as  a long queue, when asked why more people were not on at a busy time I was told that they were in a meeting!  Management over customers - perhaps indicative over the lack of 5 star…"
July 2021,Champagne brunch at Shangri-La,"Wonderful food, great ambience and terrific views from the Shard, excellent helpful service provided by Jordan. He was absolutely brilliant, very knowledgeable and friendly.  Would recommend this place  to anyone"

July 2021,Wow! Staff and Views,"Wow! The most amazing service and views. The staff make this hotel a complete experience .  This was a london staycation and i booked us an iconic suite. The room was huge and the views amazing. Their were a couple of maintenance issues which we informed housekeeping about, but as we were staying only One night we declined their offer to fix them immediately.   We have stayed in many 5* hotels - which all do vary in service and also between staff members BUT every member of staff at the hotel was friendly and attentive. jimmy the door man set the scene as soon as we drove up- he was super friendly and helpful.  When we left , he brought the car round and the team brought our bags from our room and into the car immediately. We were offered water for our drive and they even…"
May 2021,Natalie’s birthday!,Amazing service from Marco- he really took care of us- we wanted for nothing ! we had booked afternoon tea but changed our minds and nothing was too much trouble ! Fabulous views .. And make sure you press all the buttons on the toilet!
May 2021,"A great staycation spot, especially on weekdays","Stayed at the Shangri-la at the Shard for a staycation for 26-27th evenings.   Check-in was smooth, was greeted by the lovely Emily and Rita at the front desk. They were kind enough to give me a bathroom with a view as well, and Emily obliged when I asked to change the room to face West rather than east, so they were very accommodating all around.   Used the sky pool, gym and the breakfast facilities. Breakfast is a good spread, slightly below some of the hotels in Asia but definitely better than most in London. Congee and fried dough sticks are a good choice, as well as the HK style French toast. Sky pool offers unparalleled views, although I stayed on weekdays so may be much more crowded on weekends. Gym is quite small but the treadmills have great views.  Stayed in the…"
July 2021,Simply incredible,"Stayed here for the first night of our honeymoon and it was simply amazing.   The staff were unbelievable and were so helpful.

We were greeted by Josh who was fantastic in seeing that we had all we needed and provided us with everything we needed to know. Great service and so friendly, nothing was too much trouble.  We upgraded our room, which was absolutely beautiful!! The bathroom being my favourite!  Everything was thoroughly clean and of a high standard.  We ordered breakfast in our room as a treat and were totally overwhelmed by the service and the food, absolutely delicious. We hope to be back one day! Amazing!"
July 2021,Best customer service - especially from Jimmy,"We received the best service from all the team but especially Jimmy the doorman. He was more than attentive and took the car, bought our bags. They gave us water etc. The room service and food also spot on. Can’t fault it."

June 2021,The height of decadence in London,"Situated in the dominating building in London, The Shard and its unique design is there to impress and the Shangri-La based from floor 35 upwards matches the building in every way. Kurt and his fabulous team  make you most welcome. The rooms are superb and of course the views are the best  you can get of London. Fantastic food and service,  a truly joyous experience."
July 2021,Birthday treat like no other !,"One of our sons treated my husband and me to a night in The Shangri La to celebrate my 70 th birthday.   And what a treat it was.  From being met at ground floor and escorted up to reception on the 35th , the whole experience was one of style and generosity.  Josh introduced himself as if he couldn’t have been more delighted to meet us.  This attitude prevailed throughout our stay.  We are so used to the insincerity of ‘ Have a good day now ‘ it was astounding to come across staff who genuinely seemed pleased to see us.   Our room on the 37th floor had views out to the west and over the river towards St Paul’s Cathedral.  The bathroom was fabulous, floor to ceiling windows with a bath tub placed centrally.  The bathroom was my favourite place.    My son based in America rang to…"
July 2021,dinner,"The service was very at good and the food was delicious，The environment was very good and my girlfriend and I had a great night here.The next time I come to Shard for dinner, I'll definitely choose ting."
July 2021,Breakfast at Ting,"Breakfast at Ting was amazing! Marco, our waiter was incredibly friendly and provided a great service!   The view was stunning and it’s a great place for a celebration.  I got the poached eggs on avocado toast."
July 2021,Amazing,"Met a few friends and had some drinks, was served by the lovely MOMO who was very attentive and looked after us. Would definately return because I had such a great time. Some of the best cocktails recommended by Momo aswell."
June 2021,"Great service, recommend!","We had Momo as our waiter - we asked if we could be moved to a table near the window knowing it wasn’t guaranteed but he sorted this out for us and was very attentive and quick with our drinks, he even gave us a shot for my girlfriends birthday and made the evening even more special. 10/10 would recommend"
June 2021,"Incredible experience, one we’ll never forget!","We had an incredible stay at the hotel for one night. From the get go Josh who checked us in and looked after us during our stay was friendly, warm and incredibly accommodating, he is a real credit to the hotel. The valet service was amazing, again so accommodating and friendly. We had an impeccable room with a view overlooking the city. The best way to spend our anniversary for sure. Thank you for making it incredible Shangri La! We’ll be back soon."
May 2021,Absolutely outstanding! An experience we will always remember.,"WOW! - I’m not sure I can even find the words worthy enough to describe our time at this hotel.   My partner and I recently stayed here for two nights to celebrate my 40th birthday and his 50th birthday.   From the moment we arrived and handed our car keys to the valet, the service was exceptional, the hotel was outstanding with the best views over London we have ever seen. Our room was immaculately clean, spacious, with an incredible bathroom and floor to ceiling windows overlooking the River Thames and Tower Bridge. This was a once in a lifetime experience (an absolute dream) and we enjoyed every moment. The food, the drink, the pool, the sauna, the views, the staff were all just exceptional.  The staff were the most attentive, professional, welcoming, positive team we have…"
June 2021,Hotel Perfection,"An absolutely fantastic wedding anniversary experience.  Having booked for one night, as part of a 3 day city break, we were far from disappointed. The Shangri-La clearly specialises in the ultimate customer experience (concierge, reception (a french lady called Kimberley - who is a credit and joy to speak with, who the following day recalled and positively commented about our trip and onward destination discussed the day before), 52nd floor bar which is a must, and restaurant).  Our premier room on the 50th floor had stunning city views, exceptionally comfortable and equally luxurious (inc. complimentary binoculars to see the city). It’s also the little touches that add to the experience - my wife receiving a beautiful white rose on checking in at reception, anniversary wishes,…"
May 2021,Date dinner,We had an amazing view with a window seat. Really great service. Jenny took good care of us. The food was also amazing as well as the drinks. Great presentation. The curry Laxa was great and I really recommend it. We will definitely come back.
June 2021,The loveliest birthday!,"I had a wonderful experience this weekend at the Shard. It was my birthday, and from the moment I arrived up until I left, the evening was nothing but amazing. We got a window seat which meant that we had the best view all night (the view is great regardless of where you sit by the way). The person that made my birthday extra special with his amazing service was Jordan. He went above and beyond to ensure that we were comfortable and well looked after, and this was before he knew it was my birthday. When my husband eventually told him, he went the extra mile and I got a lovely birthday dessert. I’d come back purely to experience his friendly service again, which we definitely will. When Jordan recommends something from the menu, definitely take it as you won’t be disappointed!…"
June 2021,AMAZING! THANK YOU!,I cannot explain how lovely our evening was! Marco was very attentive to our needs. Thank you so much!!! The food was absolutely delicious and the view was stunning. We throughly enjoyed ourselves. Thanks again
,Ting - Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at Ting Restaurant was fantastic. Jing made us both extremely welcome and set us at ease. When the staff are this attentive it always makes for a great experience. The food was fabulous. I couldn't find fault in taste or presentation. May only be a once in my lifetime thing, but worth every penny. Oh, did I forget to mention the views....."
