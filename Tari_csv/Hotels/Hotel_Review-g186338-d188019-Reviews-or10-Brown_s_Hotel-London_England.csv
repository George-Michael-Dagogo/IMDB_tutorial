November 2023,History meets luxury ,"Spend 5 minutes with Ivan the porter while Ivan the porter gets your taxi. He provided a quick whirlwind tour of the hotel and the historical significance. He is well informed, proud and delightful! 10/10"
October 2023,Afternoon Tea and Drinks at the bar afterwards ,"Wonderful afternoon tea with a good friend. The service was exceptional, sandwiches, sweets, teas just amazing. We also went for couple of drinks to the bar,which was amazing too. I highly recommend Brown's Hotel London. "
October 2023,Perfect stay,"Our stay at the Brown's was just perfect. The room was super clean, and really pretty. The staff, needless to say, incredibly polite and always there to help. The doormen especially bring the experience to another level, as they are an extension of the concierge, with stories and advices. The Donovan's bar is really happening during pre dinner time, with great drinks and delicious bar food. And the staff at the bar is also very professional and friendly. Final comment for the reception. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of the lady who checked us in. There was a little problem with the room assigned to us. She took charge, never made us feel worried or uncomfortable, and she swapped us, very quickly, to a room that was just perfect. This hotel is one of those places that…"
October 2023,Treat yourself and stay at Brown's,"Brown's is hands down the best hotel in London and I've stayed with all of the well known ones over the years, and have travelled extensively in my business career.  What sets it apart is the brilliant team, from front of house to cleaning. Donovan's bar is a great spot, the breakfast is one of the best anywhere, and the ambience of the hotel exudes class and style as you might expect from a Rocco Forte Hotel.  The Friends membership benefits make a difference too - they'll do their best to provide early and late checkin's/checkouts and they really value regular travelers. "
September 2023,What a treat!,What  treat!  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels.  Brown's is right up there in the 5 star category.  We had a lovely room with suburb service.  The hotel staff are all excellent and very helpful.  The breakfast buffet was extensive -  what a great way to start your day!  It is close to the green street underground and easy walking distance to most everything.  Don't wait for a special occasion - stay there now!!  We will be back - hopefully soon. 
October 2023,Three Nights at Brown's Hotel,"The rooms are wonderfully appointed and comfortable, the spa is not to be missed and we felt well cared for and attended to by all of the staff.  The bar experience is pure entertainment and the cocktails are inventive and unique."
July 2023,Brilliant ,"Brilliant, can’t fault Browns at all, everything was perfect, staff good and attentive, everyone made us feel welcome and we shall be back again one day hopefully quite soon as we enjoyed our experience.  "
October 2023,A sense of luxury and elegance,"We had a great time and the food is delicious, the staff (Maria M) was also great, there is also a pianist playing music that transports you to the Victorian  era, also the oldest hotel in London, such a beautiful place to visit. "
October 2023,Wonderful stay,"We stayed 9 nights, recently, at Brown's. Our suite was beautiful and very comfortable, beds were great. Everyone on the staff was extremely nice and very helpful. The concierges and doormen, especially so. This is a feature we greatly appreciate at all of the Rocco Forte hotels... the staff are always wonderful!"
September 2023,Highly Recommended for a Luxurious Weekend in London,"Loved the thoughtfulness put in preparing the room for bed time. The room, amenities and especially the service made the entire experience memorable for me and my wife. The spa treatment by Fouzia was great. Breakfast, afternoon tea and room service was topnotch. Highly recommended!"
September 2023,Classic English Luxury,"Stunning hotel in Mayfair with large suites that feel like home. Incredible staff who are kind, friendly and warm. Fabulous design, between the rooms and the common spaces. This hotel is cozy yet spacious. I loved everything!"
September 2023,"When in London, BROWNS HOTEL IT MUST BE. Hands down. ","Everything about Browns is a superlative description. As soon as you arrive, the staff is at its finest. Helpful. Accommodating. Extends their assistance beyond their task. The hotel is clean. Concierge Gerard and his team are very knowledgeable of our needs and about explaining the ins and outs of London. The TEA was exquisite. I can’t imaging myself searching for other hotels. The rooms are squeaky clean which is very important to me. The bathroom smells freshly cleaned. No odor at all. The sheets smell like they had just been washed. Yes, clean. The pillows are comfortable. Housekeeping is very responsive. I called for coffee at 9am and in 10 minutes, voila. Unlike other hotels where you wait until you’ve forgotten that you had ordered it an hour ago. Everyday in the…"
September 2023,London Weekend,"Always a great experience to be at Brown’s in the centre of Mayfair. A very nice hotel with a very unique atmosphere. The staff regardless of which area reception, restaurant and bar or room service are all very friendly and helpful and always ready to respond to the customer’s request. The whole ambiance is simply very beautiful and radiates a cosy and pleasant atmosphere. In any case, also on the next visit to London at Brown’s."
August 2023,Our favourite place to stay in London,"My husband and I have been staying at Browns for some ten years now whenever we’re in London for a few nights.  It’s always a treat and the service lives up to that intention.  We’ve stayed in a variety of rooms from the Superior Room through to the Junior Suites and they are just so well appointed, comfortable and spacious given the age of the building.  Our favourite thing about staying is not only the jolly greeting you get every time you enter the hotel (the doormen are so friendly and helpful) but also its the drinks at the Donovan bar. Taking a drink there feels very civilised which is a weird compliment but the design of the place lends it a very sophisticated atmosphere - subdued lighting, some cozy booths and a well made cocktail always starts off an evening out on the…"
May 2023,"Classic elegance, stylish, top service in wonderful location!","My stay at Browns was one of the best experiences lately in my life!  Classic elegant decor, silence in the rooms, discreet service that guesses what you need in the best location possible. The tea at Browns is one of my favorites in London! "
September 2023,Home away from home!,"First but certainly not last time we will stay at Brown’s. Nothing short of perfect. From check-in to check-out we were made to feel like we belonged. The entire staff made a point of knowing us, our preferences and our needs. Just to name a few, John at the door, Richard and Gerard at the Concierge Desk, everyone at Reception, Charlie’s Front of House staff, Rocco in The Drawing Room for tea, and everyone at Donovan Bar. (Please all forgive me for leaving anyone out, because I would run out of space naming you all) As far as hotel itself, charming to say the least. And location in Mayfair can’t be beat. Of particular service note, I had a very bad case of sciatica that required constant icing. The overnight staff took amazing care of me, and Richard at Concierge desk found me…"
September 2023,A superb experience!,"We absolutely loved our three night stay. This is one of the most classical London hotels. It manages to balance history with updated design and service levels. Personnel is extremely professional and service minded. They all adress you by your surname and welcomes you ""home"" every time you arrive back at the hotel. And it does feel like your home away from home.  Afternoon Tea at Brown´s is a classic and breakfast in Charlies restaurant is a venue to be enjoyed for at least an hour. The restaurant is so nicely decorated and the food and service impeccable.   The location is one of London´s finest right in the middle of Mayfair close to some of the best restaurants and shopping the city has to offer. Their chauffeur driven Bentley service is an extra plus, particularly if you…"
September 2023,A lovely anniversary,It was our wedding anniversary and we decided to return to Browns having had such a nice stay before. We hoped for a similar experience but if anything this time was even better. I have mobility issues and despite what everyone says some places aren’t accessible friendly but I couldn’t fault the staff at Browns. We  had drinks in the cocktail bar and ate at Charlie’s. Again a superb meal. It’s a true delight to see things done properly and they were but with such kindness and friendliness ! The staff were excellent. We’d recommend the experience wholeheartedly. Truly memorable and worth every penny 
September 2023,Our London Home,"We spend a decent amount of time in London and have experimented with a broad range of hotels. With Brown’s, we have finally found our London home. Gracious, elegant, friendly, sophisticated, highly professional, lovely, and responsive to every request, Brown’s provides the environment that both relaxes and energizes. "
December 2022,Mummy and daughter spa day.,"For my daughters 9th birthday (December 2022) I made a booking for the Mummy & Daughter spa. One of the reasons I chose this particular spa is because of my daughters age. Most spas will not do treatments on children of this age.   The day started badly due to train strikes, so therefore we were a little late. When we arrived I filled the required consent forms and we were taken through to our treatment room. Both the ladies Olga and Fouzia were wonderful. After our mad rush due to the trains I was worried we would miss our booking and was completely stressed. But the ladies put me at ease. We had chosen our treatments, nails and a massage each in a joint treatment room. At the end of the treatment the ladies bought my daughter a cake with a candle on for her birthday and sang…"
February 2023,Truly a 5 star experience. ,"I stayed there with my wife and 1.5yr old son. We had a lovely time here. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. They were so kind to my son as he ran around the hotel saying hi to the staff. They even gave him this little wooden monkey toy in our room. It's in an excellent location, near the tubes but walking distance to Picadilly circus. When we go to London again we would be hard pressed to stay anywhere else but here."
February 2023,A welcome like no other!,The customer service at Browns was exemplary. When you stay at Brown’s you are made to feel as if it is your home. It was a privilege to be a guest. Staff went above an beyond to accommodate an extra family member and our grateful thanks go to the team. Browns isn’t cheap but it is so worth it.
February 2023,Birthday Afternoon Tea ,"My son and daughter-in-law went at the end of February to have afternoon tea at The Drawing Room, Browns Hotel as a Birthday treat I wanted flowers for my daughter-in-law as a Birthday surprise. The hotel staff were fantastic in assisting. Their in house florist made up a beautiful bouquet and photos were sent to me of the flowers on the table.  I had excellent and prompt email contact with staff at The Drawing Room, liaising about cost, flower type and payment arrangements. They could not have done more.  The feedback from my son and daughter-in-law regarding their special afternoon was totally positive - a really delicious tea, they were treated extremely well and made to feel special. We would recommend The Drawing Room as a lovely place to have tea. "
February 2023,Luxury & Personal,We checked into the Brown's Hotel for 1 night for a long-awaited staycation in London. Upon entering we were welcomed by the lovely doormen who then brought us to reception where Hasiya checked us in and gave us a beautiful tour of the facilities and even brought us up to our room. It was beyond elegant and luxurious with a handwritten letter which made the experience feel more authentic. A big thank you to Irene from guest experiences who arranged romantic amenities for our arrival (my fiance was definitely surprised).  Bianca from the Drawing room and Dimitri from Charlie's gave us wonderful service. The only negative was we didn't stay long enough! 
February 2023,Genuine hospitality at the heart of London,"Brown's Hotel is unlike any lavish hotels yet we were welcomed by such great hospitality & approachable staff from the doorman, Ivan to Ashiya who checked us in. Loved the interior and cleanliness of the room. The hotel is very accessible to different shops and restaurants, but we chose to have dinner in the hotel's restaurant, Charlie's. I remember the hostess Marina & waiters Rebecca and Luigi have attended to us very well. The crab starter is a must try & the steak perfectly cooked! Also loved the breakfast food and service from the same restaurant. Overall an excellent experience staying in London's first hotel!"
February 2023,Brown’s Hotel is second to none in London,"A stay at Brown’s makes London truly special and it all starts with the team who treat all like family. From Daniel at the front door and Giví once inside, the Brown’s team at reception, Charlie’s, Donovan’s and everything in-between sets them and your experience apart in every way. Highly recommended!"
February 2023,Birthday spa treatments ,"Booked spa treatments (softening facials and funky fingers) for my twin 13yr old daughters as a surprise treat. Beautiful environment, warm and friendly welcome. Hanna took the initial booking, very easy to do. She was very kind and professional over the phone. Aroure and Natalie did the treatments and made my girls feel so special, they loved every minute. Many thanks to everyone for a fabulous morning not to forget the doormen who greeted us and showed us the way down to the spa. "
February 2023,Spa experience,"Irene Forte facial treatment was on my schedule, and I was excited from the moment I walked into the spa reception. When offering me a cup of tea, the beautiful lady requested that I fill out the simple form. After that, a therapist led me to a treatment room where, after the frantic noise of the streets, you feel incredibly warm and tranquil, and this is where the spa's magic starts. I had a memorable facial treatment thanks to the setting up therapist, Aurora. I appreciate your kindness and your welcome, Hanna, as well."
February 2023,Wonderful stay at the Browns Hotel,"We spent a few days -for a visit at Chris de Burghs concert- at this lovely (and oldest) hotel in London. Starting with a warm welcome at the airport, an unexpected upgrade room with a wonderful view and the lovliest people around us during the days. We enjoyed a relaxing spa treatment, had a delicious meal and stayed for a drink at Donovans Bar. It was a great pleasure to be with you and we will never forget all of the amazing english roses on Valentine´s Day!"
February 2023,Overdelivers for 5-star hotel in central London. Top hospitality team.,"February 9-14, 2023.  Entire Brown's staff was welcoming, accessible, responsive and reliable! Such a great hospitality team is seemingly rare these days.  Suite was absolutely beautiful, cleaned and prepped impeccably daily.  Mattress and linens most comfortable.  Charlie's is a good as any restaurant in Mayfair. Spacious and comfortable.  Access to shopping and transportation is excellent -yet so walkable to best areas and sites in London.  Evenings at Brown's are comfortably elegant; quiet local streets in central London.  Have stayed at 5-star London hotels since 1986. Brown's was tops! Overall: overdelivers for 5-star hotel in central London.  "
June 2023,Absolute perfection,"I've stayed in many hotels offering superb service, with outstanding attention to detail. None of them - and I mean none - are up to Brown's standard. Staff can't do enough for you. Pleasant, courteous and utterly professional at all times. Breakfast superb, bar a solid win. The room was marvellous, and that bed was the comfiest that my wife and I have ever slept in. If I could have stayed on, I'd be there still. Utterly flawless stay. "
July 2023,Unbelievable team and service at a historical hotel,"Staying here made me nostalgic for what hotels used to feel like when everyone knew your name and made you feel extremely welcomed as if you were guests of their own home.  Givi was wonderful and everyone was so eager to assist—Natasha from housekeeping quickly helped me with my bags when she saw me in the lift.   Their attention to detail and incredible service would make me pick them over Claridge’s or any of the larger hotels in London.   Truly have not stayed anywhere with better service in recent memory.   Thank you for the wonderful stay! And also, obsessed with their pillows and sheets! Also something very romantic about staying in the oldest hotel in London! "
July 2023,Wonderful Spa,"The spa was such a lovely and relaxing experience, I highly recommend to anyone! My therapist Hannah was so sweet and took care to go over my needs beforehand, as well as leaving me with a helpful list of products and info afterwards. The spa receptionist Erica was great as well and created a calm environment. The massage was just what I needed after traveling and the facial left me so refreshed but was gentle enough not to irritate my skin. Will definitely return next time I’m in London!"
June 2023,Sun Bronzing ,Hannah was welcoming and very efficient.  She did a lovely job in my spray tan and was very helpful during the entire process.  She made this treatment more relaxing especially as this was my first time!    She is a lovely person 
April 2023,Home!,"We were at Brown's in April this year for 8 nights. We were traveling with our 5 year old son and booked a junior suite. Brown's is perfect for families. It's home! every day on our return from excursions around town, my son excitedly used to say ""We're home"". He felt at home! The entire team at brown's made sure we were taken care of. Location is in the heart of Mayfair and as good as it can be for London. A special mention of Ivan and John at Brown's who  went out of their way to make our stay special and developed a bond with our family. We will definitely be back"
June 2023,Unmatched service and comfort at Brown's,"We spent last weekend at Brown's Hotel celebrating our 45th Wedding Anniversary. From the greeting on our arrival until our departure on the Sunday we could not have been looked after any better. The staff were all friendly,  kind and considerate and prepared to go ""that extra mile"". Our suite was spacious, comfortable and cozily unfussy and the breakfasts tip top. It is seldom that you cannot find anything that could have been just a little bit better -  but that was our experience during our stay at Brown's. The Hotel is wonderfully positioned in the West End allowing us to walk to the various shows and exhibitions we went to."
May 2023,This is the place to stay if you want to avoid crowds,"Excellent hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Hotel had a boutique feel to it as there are not crowds of people. The staff addressed us by name every time we came and went. The concierge service was outstanding, checking on our lost luggage and also changing a lunch reservation for us.  We booked through AE platinum and received a couple of upgrades. Breakfast was delicious and it was ordering off the menu instead of a buffet. We enjoyed the breakfast.  We will stay at the Browns again next time in London. This was our 2nd stay there."
May 2023,"A fabulous, quaint hotel ","What a fabulous, quaint hotel. We went with my 16 month old son, and they made everything seamless. The restaurant was super sweet to him even though he made a mess. Housekeeping was wonderful cleaning up after us and providing lots of water. Concierge made booking shows, and restaurants very easy. Bellman Gigi, Simeon, Jorge and John were always so welcoming. Every time we came back to the hotel. They helped us secure and load a taxi big enough for all of our luggage.   Highly recommend and can’t wait to be back!"
May 2023,Feeling at home in Mayfair,The hotel feels like coming home. Everybody was trying its best.  The atmosphere is like living in a nice town house in the hard of Mayfair. One of my best hotel experiences I had in my life.  Thank you very much.  Christian 
April 2023,Amazing Facials in Spa,Over the last year we have been coming to this spa every 2 months or so for facial treatments. Every time the service and quality of the facial is 10 out of 10. Last time we went we had Aurora and Fuzia (sorry if spellings are wrong!) and they were both amazing! Ruta as well is also incredible when we have had her. We will definitely keep coming back as everything is perfect. 
May 2023,An amazing historic hotel.,It is an excellent hotel. Elegant with a lovely atmosphere. The service is impeccable and all the staff made us feel at home away from home. The afternoon tea is highly recommended. Finally the location of Browns is amazing. Right in the heart of the city. Highly recommended.
May 2023,One of the best!,"We travel often and to nice hotels and this was one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had. They listened to our request for a quiet room; went out of their way to find restaurants, etc for us; were very pleasant with every interaction, etc. Plus, the location is terrific and the hotel is a beautiful boutique. "
May 2023,Absolutely Incredible,As expected of Browns our experience was superb. Givi and Simeon looked after my Fiancé and I very well and made us feel very welcome as did the rest of the staff during our stay. Our room was wonderful and perfectly presented. We ordered room service as we checked in which arrived promptly as we were heading out for an appointment. We had the Sunday lunch the following day at Charlie's which was absolutely fantastic. We love staying at Browns. The fact you feel like you are at home whilst you are there is something I can't say for other establishments. We very much look forward to our return later this year.  
April 2023,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel with our two kids under 5 years old and had a great experience.  They went above and beyond for our two young children.  The hotel is situated in a great location in Mayfair within walking distance to multiple sights, restaurants, and shops. "
April 2023,Amazing stay,"Had 2 amazing days with my son. From Check in to departure everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. From the Moment we entered we felt like Family coming Home eventhough we Never stayed there before. The Room was amazing and the bed the most comfortable ever. Huge Thank you to Irene from Guest Relation , the lovely Restaurant Hostess which Name i forgot, Neil the Doormen and the 3 amazing Staff members who looked After us in the bar and even treated us with a Tea Gift to take Home as a memory.  Definately worth a visit and we will be back for sure "
April 2023,Best Hotel in London,"This hotel is super! An high standard of service, very nice and friendly staff. The rooms are very clean and the bathroom is perfect. We had Connected rooms with 2 adults and 3 children. The hotel is located in the centre of London. The hotel has really the best breakfast included. You can choose what you want. The restaurant is also great. We are comming back, much better than The Ritz. "
April 2023,"Phenomenal experience, can't wait to return!","Our experience with the Brown's Hotel was beyond expectation. Ahead of our arrival in London, Gerard, Richard, Lee, and Andreea in the concierge department helped us to book our tours and dining reservations, providing helpful suggestions, which was much appreciated (first time in London with my kids). Then, from the moment we arrived at the hotel until checkout, our experience at the hotel was excellent. The staff was friendly, helpful, attentive and went out of their way to ensure that we had a great stay. We have a large family with a range of ages and each of them received special attention from the hotel; age appropriate toys in the room, child size robes and slippers, even a tabletop nightlight similar to those we had at home (they loved all of it). We spent Easter in…"
April 2023,The best hotel in London!!!,"It is just perfect hotel !!! Best location, very  beautiful interior design, excellent service, very friendly, very professional employees 🙏 !Tasty breakfast !!! Afternoon tee was just gorgeous!!!   Thank you so much for such a warm welcome and for a great time in London!! "
April 2023,A magical week at Browns,"From the moment we walked in the door of Browns, it was magical.  The entire staff was so professional and accommodating.  We have stayed at Browns in the past but the updates they have completed have made it even more wonderful.  We traveled with our family, grandkids 15, 12 and 10 and their parents.  Everyone was delighted with the service and accommodations.  The hotel is also located in the best location...close to everything that a tourist might want to see.  Highly recommend!!!"
April 2023,Our favourite hotel in London!,"We stayed at the Brown's for the second time over the London Marathon weekend and just like our first visit, it was truly amazing and special!   The location, the staff and service provided is nothing like any other.   Every special request we had prior to our arrival was promptly dealt with by Irene and Charles from Guest Relations.   Upon our arrival we were able to check-in early and due to taking part at the marathon we were also able to check out late which made a world of a difference to us on the day.   The food in both at Charlie's and Bar Donovan was amazing and we cannot wait for our next visit.   The Brown's is truly the best hotel in London and we couldn't recommend it enough!   Thank you for your whole team for looking after us so well and making us feel like we are…"
April 2022,A special hotel,"We have stayed in several other Rocco Forte hotels which have all been good but Brown’s is a cut above. We were visiting for an anniversary and birthday celebration and the staff could not have given us a better welcome; this was equally true in Donovan’s bar and Charlie’s restaurant. We had a slight issue with our room and this was resolved quickly and generously with an upgrade to a lovely suite. From the bed linen to the decor, everything was top quality and carefully thought out. We found breakfast service a little slow in the restaurant but room service was terrific and arrived promptly. Whilst such excellence comes at a cost it is worth it for a different level of hotel service."
April 2022,First Class Friendly Service,We only stayed at the hotel for one night but we have never received such amazing service than we did at the Brown's Hotel.  From the moment we stepped through the door the service was amazing. We were made to feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble.  Even on the day we were leaving they made us feel special right to the moment we walked back out through the door. The rooms are comfortable and clean and all amenities you could think of. Would highly recommend this hotel for your next stay in London.
April 2022,Afternoon Tea,"What a luxurious afternoon tea! The staff are attentive and generous (i.e. extra portions without needing to ask) and there is a wide selection of tea. The sandwiches were scrumptious, the scones light and fluffy, and the sweet pastries were dainty and delicious. It's well worth the price."
April 2022,Brown’s Afternoon Tea Never Fails to Amaze!,"Brown’s is our go to place for our tea adventure in London. For the second time, we had Yonka as our server m…affable, friendly and full of information about Browns!  The good is truly unique and delicious…a one of a kind experience when in London!"
April 2022,Celebration of birthday,"Excellent hotel, courteous and welcoming staff. Despite its high price, it is worth the effort and stay in it 😊 It makes the London experience more pleasant. Front desk staff are helpful and so the concierge staff"
April 2022,Wedding Choice of Hotel,"Chose as a different hotel for our base for our Annabelles wedding celebration , little upset with the room as it was poky and I had paid for an upgrade but the staff!!!! Throughput the hotel they are simply magnificent from Donovan's to the other bar in the other side and special mentions to John on the door and the wonderful Ivan"
April 2022,"Beautiful, Warm and Engaging","The location of Browns is incredible. Close to Green, Hyde and St James’ Parks as well as an amazing amount of shopping and sites. Location aside though, the hotel is beautiful in every way. It’s warm, it’s uniquely British but most importantly the staff are wonderful and very caring to the comforts and enjoyment of guests."
September 2023,Superb Sunday lunch,"We returned once again to the lovely Browns Hotel.  This time for lunch in Charlie’s. What a splendid lunch it was too! The food was outstanding, as was the service.  The ambience was calm and relaxed, but professional, as you would expect from Browns. One of the best Sunday lunches we have ever had, if not the best - thank you! If I was to comment on one tiny thing, the cauliflower cheese was too strong tasting for me personally."
July 2023,Facials always 10/10,"Every time I come here I am treated like a VIP even though that’s the last thing I am! I try to come every few months as a special treat and will definitely be coming again soon. Aurora always gives the most amazing facials during which I often fall asleep which, although  embarrassing, shows how relaxing they are and my skin looks noticeably amazing afterwards! Can’t wait to come back!"
September 2023,So nice I stayed twice! (In one vacation!),"My husband and I stayed at Browns for 5 nights on his business trip. We absolutely LOVED the hotel. The rooms, the decor, the restaurant as well as the bars were all superb! At the end of his business trip we thought we would try another hotel for a few nights before leaving for Paris. I checked out  of Browns and literally came RIGHT BACK ! The other hotel was supposed to be a 5 star establishment but it was so small and dusty/ dirty, the staff was also cold and not welcoming. I took one look at the room and called Browns right away and said “I’m coming back right now! “ the front desk at the Browns immediately helped me to check back in and even kept my old room for me! so yep, it was so nice that I stayed twice during my whole time in London ! To me what made the Browns stand…"
August 2023,Afternoon tea experience,"Every aspect of our stay was outstanding.  Specifically, the restaurant staff was welcoming and friendly.  The dining room is one of the prettiest dining rooms we have visited.    The concierge staff gave  excellent advice that helped us maximize our short stay. They arranged our itinerary perfectly. At the time of check-in, the front desk staff gave us thorough orientation to the hotel. Donovan's Bar was the perfect venue to meet a London friend for a drink.  We look forward to staying at Browns when we return "
April 2022,Superb stay at Browns hotel,"Wonderful drawing room. Selection of teas great. Recommend Cornish tea. Sandwiches delicious, scones great and strawberry jam so so good. Battenberg cake really. Wonderful server Yonka was a delight.   A really good experience for a special birthday treat."
April 2022,Love London,"Wonderful stay at Browns hotel, London. Was upgraded to a deluxe room and served a complimentary glass of champagne on arrival.

April 2022,"Brown's Hotel,  Dining Room, and Donovan's Bar",A fantastic hotel in the center of London. Spent a weekend with my wife at this boutique hotel with the best of service!

August 2023,To celebrate a special birthday,"We loved our stay at Browns, everything absolutely fabulous.  The location is unbeatable for Mayfair and the West End and we particularly enjoyed the intermate feel the hotel had.   Every thing about our stay exceeded our expectations.  "
August 2023,The spa is excellent ,"My daughter and I used the spa for a treat together, we had a massage and a manicure. Erica and Aurora were professional and lovely. They adapted the massages to suit was was needed and cared for us. They really made the whole experience special for us."
August 2023,Return to Brown's,"Umpteenth stay. High expectations, entirely met. Excellent all round - reservation process, room, staff, cleanliness, functionality, Britishness. Reasonably priced for quality offered. All staff helpful, particularly reception, concierge, doormen."
January 2023,Superb special occasion afternoon tea,"We went for Afternoon Tea, a return visit, and this was just as good as the previous ones.  We were treated so well, the service and charm were impeccable and the food amazing, such generous portions too.  It's the perfect place for a special occasion and we look forward to an excuse to return again!"
August 2023,A Perfect English Experience,"We had four magnificent nights at Brown's in a excellent accessible suite that we needed.  Other activities  included:  Cocktails at Donovan Bar including time in the 'Naughty Corner' featuring photo's by Terence Donovan. Fortunately, for us, a new cocktail menu 'Evoke' had just been released so we enjoyed cocktails with names like 'Adrenaline', 'Martini Roots', 'Big Smoke' and more all were excellent.  Breakfast's and Dinner at Charlie's was a great experience. We were surrounded by photos and ceiling decor inspired by Rudyard Kipling's 'Jungle Book'.  The location was excellent close to major tourist attractions whilst being quiet compared to tourist areas a few blocks away.  We also took advantage of the House Limousine on a couple of occasions - a really special experience. …"
August 2023,In the mood for Afternoon Tea,"Went with some friends to experience Brown's Afternoon Tea. The space and ambiance is inviting and comfortable, a classy experience. Customer service was very attentive, specially our hostess Maria who made sure everything was perfect, giving us background on the inspiration behind the menu, suggestions on tea's and parings, as well as sharing wisdom on the hotel's history and some of its most illustrious guests of the past. Great experience, truly recommend."
December 2022,Splendid accommodation in Mayfair,"This is a phenomenal hotel, located in the heart of Mayfair. My family stayed here for 6 nights while celebrating Christmas as well as my wife’s birthday in London. The hotel was also in festive spirits as they offered us mulled wine upon arrival before shuttling us up to room 501, a deluxe suite where a bottle of Moët and pastries was waiting…quite thoughtful. The room was quite spacious as there was a large living room with a dining table and a separate bedroom which was huge. There was also a nice walk in closet along with a lovely bathroom that featured 2 separate showers as well as a separate bathtub.   We had breakfast every morning at Charlie’s and the selections were quite good. We also had dinner at Charlie’s twice and the food was fantastic. Donovan bar is quite nice…"
December 2022,Maybe the finest hotel I've ever stayed in.,"Brown's Hotel is the ultimate in elegance, service and convenience.  The service is the finest I've ever encountered, the Michelin-starred restaurant is superb, and the rooms are supremely comfortable.  We will go again and again."
December 2022,Christmas at Browns,"We had a wonderful trip, returning to the hotel 37 years after we were married ( our wedding reception had been there 37 years ago). The staff are superb. The hotel has been wonderfully redone while retaining a classic English elegance.  We had Christmas lunch at Charlie’s and drinks at Donovan’s. Both well done. The bartenders at Donovan’s know what they are doing. And of course afternoon tea continues to be a classic. For a relaxing, elegant few days in London I would highly recommend Browns."
December 2022,Fabulous,"After spending fifteen days in a  remote and rural area of Africa with my adult daughter, I felt we needed a bit of pampering in a cozy environment. Brown's was perfect. The staff was friendly, welcoming and met our needs. Our room was very well appointed and maintained. Thank you Brown's for a terrific stay. We will return."
December 2022,"Very good, but could have been better","We very much enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Brown Hotel.   Charlie's restaurant was fabulous, great food, ambience and service.  I would have given the hotel 5 stars but for 2 incidents at the beginning of our stay.  Upon arrival, we were told our room wasn't ready but it would be a priority for housekeeping.  After waiting 30 minutes, I went to the room to find that service hadn't begun.  I then approached the front desk who reported that housekeeping didn't know when the room would be available.  Meanwhile several other people had checked in and received their room keys.  After an hour of waiting in the lobby I approached the manager, who to his credit was in the lobby area.  He immediately found a room for us. After getting our room, I asked the concierge to make a…"
December 2022,Another perfect day at Browns,"Always my first choice, when I go to London with or without my family, it just gets better Exceptional service without any fuss. From the minute you walk through the door, you just know you’re in the right place. London has many five star hotels, only one Browns"
December 2022,You feel like a VIP,"This hotel in my opinion is the best in London, the building is beautiful, the location excellent,  the staff at this hotel really make it a wonderful experience and helped to make our 49th wedding anniversary very special. Afternoon tea is wonderful, warm and cosy with excellent food.  Breakfast was a great start to the day, we definitely will be returning."
December 2022,Consistently Excellent,"What’s really, particularly lovely about Brown’s is seeing the same friendly faces in the front of house and the special touches by the back of house team.  Where else do they replace your toothpaste when you’re getting near the end of the tube or put a bookmark in your bedside novel?  It’s a special hotel to stay in - particularly to enjoy London’s Christmas scene.  It remains our residence in London.  Thank you and happy Christmas to John and his wonderful team."
December 2022,simply the best!,"It is always a full blast to stay at Brown’s hotel. The location and history of the building lead to a very unique character. Nevertheless the staff tops it all. Lee and his fantastic concierge team are ready to welcome you at any time. We had an absolute brilliant start as being welcomed by the one and only doorman John! Special thanks as well to Givi, Ivan, Matt and George who all looked after us so kindly. As well a great thank you to Monika from reception team! Marina from Charlies, Karol from the tea room and Federico and Daniel from The Donovan Bar. The entire team is fantastic and made us feel so comfortable and welcomed at anytime and trust me even as a first time guest you will exactly experience the same. Another absolute highlight are all food and beverage outlets at…"
December 2022,Townhouse Tea,"A charming Townhouse feel to this hotel. Cosy, wood panelled, welcoming. Afternoon tea with a pianist. Plenty of sandwiches with prompt service to replenish. Save room for cakes from the stand and the trolley. Complimentary glass of champagne and mulled wine. Great, festive atmosphere. "
May 2022,A piece of heaven,"I was happy to have such a relaxing and nourishing olive oil treatment and massage from Anastasia and Olga. They were so professional and attentive. They even shared some skin care tips and gave me advice. I totally enjoyed this small break from a busy world. I will definitely come back. Thank you, ladies!"
February 2022,A Time Travel Experience of Afternoon Tea,"This is not the American Disney experience of afternoon tea. The real deal with quiet dignity and satisfying scrumptious sandwiches and sweets. The cozy nooks and crannies where mismatched overstuffed chair and low tables adds to the unique experience of an afternoon tea..Variety of teas to choose from, traditional tea sandwiches and an assortment of desserts."
May 2022,lovely stay at the Brown’s London,"My family experienced another lovely stay at the Brown’s. I want to highlight the warm welcome and excellent support by Mr Givi and Mr Ivan, perfect organization of transfers and dinners by the concierge team, the whole staff always paying great attention to their guest needs and requests. Always a pleasure to be back and feeling at home."
May 2022,The very best afternoon tea experience!,"My husband and I were visiting London from Denmark and the afternoon tea at the Brown’s Hotel made our 4-day stay so special and unforgettable. The hotel was a beautiful jewel of the city and the interior and ambiance were so elegant, the food and tea were delicate and most delicious and the service was superb. I enjoyed friendly talking with a kind staff, Bianca. We have been to a number of afternoon/high tea places in different countries, but we were so happy that we had the very best and UK’s traditional afternoon tea experience at the Brown’s in London!"
May 2022,Lovely hotel in excellent location,"Lovely hotel, our room was comfortable, bathroom was updated, however overall room could use an uplift. Location made up for it!  Turn down service, daily room service was excellent!  Downside was (it is a personal preference) the mattress.  Firm mattress, which feels like laying on top of the bed instead in bed. Every bone in my body was hurting, (for reference I am 112 lbs/50 kgs). Housekeeping tried to help with a topper, however a mattress like this is unfortunately not possible to change, it should be exchanged. If you share the bed with another person, every movement can be felt, there was literally no sleep possible, we stayed 5 nights.  We loved the restaurant, reception, concierge and doorman (Civi) was absolutely excellent, so was Barbara at the reception."
May 2022,"“Brown’s,” Brown’s,” “Brown’s”","If you ask a well travelled, well connected—-and well heeled—-American where he tends to stay in London, the answer will invariably be, “Brown’s”—-and he’s right. The hotel is beautifully appointed, the rooms spacious and comfortable, the service flawless—-friendly, even jovial, thoughtful and attentive and caring without being in the least intrusive. I’m a convert. Still there are niggling doubts . The bathrooms are disappointing: The water pressure, particularly at the sinks, is simply inadequate, and the lighting above the sinks hopeless— even with the addition of an illuminated shaving mirror. I went on from London to a modest country hotel in Devon which, while incomparably simpler than.  Brown’s, had bathrooms more user friendly. And then there was this: At checkout I was…"
April 2022,A home from home in Mayfair,"We spent 5 nights at Browns in April 2022. While it is certainly on the pricier end of the spectrum of central London hotels, it absolutely exemplifies my personal definition of a 5 Star hotel.   To me, it's a feeling. Of course all of the basics expectations must be met, but then, additionally, all of those little things you don't think about - a smile and hello from every single staff member, comfortable chairs in the bedroom, excellent lighting for reading, well stocked mini bar, well stocked bookcases , a ""Welcome Home"" from the doorman, and perhaps a hundred other touches I didn't notice, but all added to the experience.  The location is perfect - we walked to Shaftesbury Ave to the theatre,  to Churchill's War Rooms and Westminster Abbey, and to any number of restaurants…"
May 2022,Exceptional hotel with amazing staff,"We spent our honeymoon at Brown's and everything was just perfect.  The staff is fantastic, they organized flowers, champagne and a handwritten welcome note.  We had stayed at Brown's before and staff members remembered our names. Everyone tries to make you feel really comfortable.  (When I got back from my morning run, the doorman was welcoming me with a bottle of water. It's just a small gesture but one that makes all the difference.) All the staff without exception are wonderful and set the experience at Brown's apart but Francesca, the guest experience executive went over and beyond to make our honeymoon exceptional. Dinner at Charlie's, the hotel restaurant, was delightful.  We highly recommend this Mayfair jewel and hope to be back in October."
May 2022,Extremely nice stuff!,Just wanted to leave this message here and say how much we enjoyed our stay! Super nice and helpful stuff! Big thanks to Givi and Ivan for always willing to help and being very professional. Will be definitely coming back!
May 2022,Wonderful staff. Wonderful stay. (Especially if you’re 6 foot 5 !),"Stayed for 5 nights. I think this is the best hotel I have recently stayed in while visiting London (others have been The Stafford, Dukes,  the Wellesley, the Sofitel…and The Connaught (although that was during lockdown to be fair). Wonderful front desk staff who were very accommodating a early 1pm check-in so that we could shower before a 2pm meeting.  The bed had a footboard attached to it and (as I am 6 foot 5) meant that it would be too small for me.. but with an hour a technician has unscrewed the footboard so I had unlimited leg room. Wonderful and something I have never seen before ! Super friendly door staff who make you feel like you are coming “home”. The bar stays open until 1am at the weekends. We will definitely be staying again !!"
November 2022,Mr. Paul the waiter service the Afternoon Tea,"Paul the waiter was amazing, he treated us so lovely. Please ask for him when you go he will make your evening amazing. The afternoon tea was incredible and the service was 10/10 with constant smiles from the whole team. "
November 2022,What a wonderful hotel!!,"I have stayed with my family at this amazing hotel for three nights and it was just wonderful. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. The service was incredibly great from arrival to the seasonal amenities, from the dooman to the bar staff.  We loved our rooms with a useful connecting door. Everything was well maintained and clean."
November 2022,Best Teatime in London,"I had the best teatime ever! My friend and I enjoyed the fresh selections of sandwiches and desserts!  Look for Paul, who served us, he was so sweet and professional which made our experience unforgettable! Definitely coming back again! Great food, amazing location! Such a beautiful English tradition hotel in the middle of most beautiful area in London "
October 2022,First Class Afternoon Tea,"  I have been meaning to write for a while to say a thank you to Yonka and her team (I cannot recall the lovely male manager’s name, which is remiss of me) who looked after us all so well at a 30th birthday afternoon tea that we had with you on on the 1st October this year. As always they were delightful and our children were so well looked after.  We look forward to seeing everyone soon for our annual Christmas afternoon tea. A wonderful team and the afternoon tea was not only delicious but also plentiful    "
March 2023,6 Star Service!,"I would give this hotel 6 stars if I could. My husband and I came here for a work trip (3 days) but stayed for a week and had the best hotel experience to date. We usually stay at 4 or 5-star hotels but the biggest difference we felt with this hotel was the service and the people. The building itself is beautiful and they have the most divine scent when you walk through the lobby! The breakfast was incredible. The eggs benedict and crab omelette were superb! We did the afternoon tea as well and the little sandwiches were so tasty, tea was the perfect temperature and you can tell they have a pastry chef making all the desserts. It was my husband's birthday while we were there and I forgot to mention anything to the staff until 10 PM that night, so we went out for a drink when we…"
March 2023,People at Brown's makes you feel at home,"Recently I stayed at Brown's hotel for 1 night with my friend whom I haven't seen since C-19 started. It was our reunion after nearly 3 years. The moment I walked in I felt like I am at home and every single employee was my family who is loving and caring. I was welcomed by doorman Ivan who's warm smile was the first amazing moment which will stay in my memory. At the front desk I was greeted by Gianluca who provided efficient check in and ensured that if I need anything he is there to help me. With Gianluca we had a lovely and easy going chat. Before going to my room I met Alex from reception team who kindly offered help bringing my bag to the room, he greeted me with warmth and very friendly smile. Later my friend finally made it to the hotel and we went for dinner in…"
March 2023,A luxurious experience that felt like Home!,"I recently visited Brown’s with my partner and I must say there’s no better place we could have spent our anniversary. The service was impeccable, all the staff were so attentive and friendly and the environment of the hotel was so warm that felt like home! Special thanks to Simeon and Givi for the warm welcome and particularly to Charles and Irene from guest relations who took such great care of us and truly personalized our experience with the thoughtful amenities and little touches in the room! The Brown’s Suite that we stayed at was Amazing! We also dined at Charlie’s restaurant where the food was to die for !!! and Luigi our waiter was very professional. The Donovan bar was also a must go! Our experience was truly luxurious from start to finish. There’s no place like…"
March 2023,Great massage,"wonderful experience in browns hotel especially for the spa, i went to get a 1 hour massage, of which aurora did a great job, excellent professionalism of which for me Is unique in london, to be redone well done AURORA"
March 2023,Guest Review,Excellent customer service from booking to departure. All the staff are very attentive and make you feel welcomed and looked after. A special mention to Charles who delivered on every level and is an asset to the hotel. We have stayed at many of London's five star hotels but always come back to Brown's Hotel and will be back soon!
March 2023,friendly luxury.,"welcomed with such warmth the moment we took our first step inside. A very genuine warmth from each member of staff that has stayed with me since I've left. I can't wait to return. Staying at Brown's is utter luxury, friendly doormen welcoming you back after each trip into the city like you are being welcomed into their home. They can't care for you enough and it all felt very natural. the doorstaff are true gentlemen. the rooms and service are  10/10, comfy beds and perfect added extras. Make sure you have a drink in the opulent bar and afternoon tea in the drawing room by the fire. See you soon Browns and your wonderful friendly staff."
March 2023,Warm and friendly with,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Brown's Hotel. I felt welcomed and well taken care of. My stay started with a very warm and friendly welcome by John and Givi. At the reception desk, I was greeted by Mamadu. Theodora was ever so lovely and offered to show me up to the wonderful room they chose for me. We enjoyed our dinner at Charlie's; the food was absolutely delicious (the sea bass and clamps were to die for). My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome from Paul, Lucian, and the waiter who served us.  We also stopped by the Donovan Bar as well, and for an unusually busy day, the team was very efficient. Martina was very helpful and gave great recommendations on what cocktails to try (and they did not disappoint at all). Daniele and Federico were very…"
March 2023,"Beyond exceptional, personal touch, perfect for family!","I don’t often write reviews, but sometimes you come across a place that is so exceptional you just have to let the world know. The Brown’s Hotel, and frankly all Rocco Forte hotels are beyond exceptional at baseline. Bring your family, and you will experience a whole other level. The amenities for children are wonderful and fun. It’s not often you go to even a luxury hotel that not only makes you feel special, but like they want you to be there. From the front door men, reception, the concierge, in-room dining, the restaurants, and housekeeping, everyone does their job well and has the most welcoming, classy, yet down-to-earth way of interacting with guests. The design of the hotel is both traditional, and cheerfully contemporary. We love the beautiful design vignettes around…"
February 2023,Memorable stay!,"We had a wonderful one-night stay in a cosy suite on the fifth floor. Many thoughtful little touches for our child and handwritten wishes made the day extra memorable. The same night, I also sampled Charles' dishes and cosmoline, both outstanding! We had breakfast delivered to our room the following morning, which is how a perfect day should begin. We are grateful to Brown's staff for this special experience. Irene, Barbora, Gianluca, and porter Givi received special recognition."
October 2022,Best afternoon tea in London!,"By far the best afternoon tea experience we had in London! The tea sommelier is excellent, the shrimp salad sandwich was delicious, and the pastries and scones were great. The service was far more attentive than anywhere else we have had tea. "
October 2022,Wonderful Time at Brown's Hotel London,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Brown’s Hotel last week – we cannot stop smiling!    From the warm welcome we received from the Brown’s driver (Dragon) to the Bellmen (Daniel was amazing – as were the rest of the kind bellmen), to the reception and concierge professionals friendly and supportive assistance, Charlie’s restaurant hostess, wait staff, and manager who made our meals memorable (and delicious) , the housekeeping staff who always kept our rooms beautiful (the fresh flowers were an unexpected and lovely touch – thank you!), to the Brown’s Spa personnel who helped me relax on our much needed vacation, to finally the bartenders in Donavan’s bar who made us laugh and end each night happy and excited about the next day’s adventures.  I had spent many…"
September 2022,Walking Girls' Lunch Treat,"The restaurant in Brown's Hotel, Charlie's, is as fabulous as ever.  Beautifully decorated, sumptuous seating with plenty of space between tables, it was an absolute delight to return with 5 guests.  Having been given one of the tables with the semi-circular banquette seating on one side with beautiful cushions, felt like a treat in itself rather than having a conventional table and chairs. The menu was so alluring that we couldn't resist having 3 courses rather than the usual 2 when dining together. Four out of 6 of us were delighted to find calves liver and bacon on the menu, which was delicious.  However, I remember one guest enjoying a delicious Salmon En Croute as the special that day which would also have got my vote, being a lover of pastry.  As usual, the service was…"
October 2022,A very English experience,We dined at Charlie’s at the hotel. What a lovely experience starting with the pre dinner cocktails which were much enjoyed. The quiet ambiance of the restaurant was echoed by the excellent and attentive staff and the food was of a  very high standard and presentation  (although I thought my steak tartare was a tad lacking in seasoning and a bit wet). We will certainly return.
October 2022,Old school charm meets modern quality,Super friendly and professional especially Charles from guest relations. Made our trip special with personal touches agreed in advance. Wonderful room service team and food; champagne on ice placed when requested; huge comfy super king in our suite; etc etc etc. For a classic treat with modern touches; choose Browns!
September 2022,The Best Ever,"Our first visit here, and hopefully not our last. Wow, and double wow. Every single aspect of our stay here was perfect, from the moment we arrived and the fabulous staff who made us feel welcome, to the gorgeous room (way bigger than we expected) and then fabulous drinks in the bar and a 5 star dinner at Charlies. Even the breakfast room service (an extra treat for us) was fabulous. Couldn't fault a thing - the most special hotel we have encountered."
March 2023,Feeling pampered and treated as royal ,It was a magical stay. We even got an upgrade to a junior suite. The attention to details throughout the hotel is beautiful. Most of the staff works there for many years and as returning guests we feel very well taken care of. Breakfast is always a highlight too 
September 2022,Afternoon tea at Brown's,"Second time over the years that we've had tea at Brown's. Simply fantastic. The setting is beautiful and relaxing. The food was excellent as was the service. The only drawback was that the dresscode was not followed by some. (No jeans or shorts, please!)"
September 2022,Great Service!,We had a great stay at Browns recently. I would like specifically to thank Givi and his team who were very helpful! They received a very large delivery at the hotel on our behalf and then helped load it in to our car. He really went above and beyond!
September 2022,Rocco Fortes Brown’s Hotel - Luxury Hospitality at its Best,"Simply Brilliant. The staff is impeccable, courteous, welcoming and accommodating. Lovely rooms, comfortable beds, unbeatable location. The staff all knew our names and quickly fulfilled any requests. The concierge was our constant go to for dinner reservations - all excellent restaurants - and London experiences. The porters and doorman professional and helpful. The staff at Charlie’s Restaurant inviting. Definitely do the high tea- an experience not to be missed. We will definitely come back. The Brown’s lives up to and exceeds it’s already prestigious reputation."
September 2022,excelent luxury hotel,"excelent service of all the staff and very profesional, allso delicious dishes at the restaurant and bar. the hotel rooms are exquisite . location is perfect for shopping expercience or just a walk arround."
September 2022,Wonderful!,"We celebrated our anniversary with a gorgeous afternoon tea.  Absolutely wonderful!  Service by Archie who was so lovely and made us feel welcome and well looked after. A beautiful gentle voice and happy smile. The sandwiches were delicious and fresh!  I’ve since got home and made a salmon and capers sandwich!  Cakes were amazing and plentiful ( couldn’t eat it all!)  A beautiful setting too. We were initially sat on a low chair but requested higher more upright chairs which was kindly sorted. Archie was lovely as our main waiter and all staff were polite and friendly. A lovely treat, thank you 😊"
August 2022,Anniversary Stay at Brown's Hotel,"My wife and I recently spent 3 nights at Brown's Hotel in London to celebrate our wedding anniversary. When we arrived at the hotel we were warmly greeted by the reception staff and informed in honor of our Anniversary our room had been upgraded to a Junior Suite. Upon entering our suite we discovered a bottle of Monet & Chandon Imperial  champagne with truffles to welcome us .Our room was most comfortable, including double vanity sinks in the bath and both a shower and tub. My wife especially enjoyed the Trene Forte hair products which were provided. On our second night, and to our surprise. the Housekeeping staff decorated our entire suite with beautiful rose petals for our anniversary. We had reservations and dined at Charlie's, the hotel's Michelin star rated  restaurant.…"
September 2022,"The perfect tea time: elegant, comfortable, and delicious!",An amazing visit for afternoon tea at one of the oldest hotels in London. A complimentary glass of champagne. Our waiter was so informative of what tea we would enjoy Anything not consumed was boxed for us to take home  The resident pianist Toby played perfectly for the clientele it was an overwhelming afternoon  Thank you 😊
August 2022,A lovely overnight stay,"The atmosphere was wonderful. It was both very fancy and very comfortable at the same time. The setting was intimate. We liked that the doorman greeted us, and we enjoyed the live piano during the tea. The service was great.   The tea selection was absolutely amazing. Each of us got to choose individually a tea to have during the savory part and then a second tea to have during the sweet part.   Each guest chooses individually between the two menu options – traditional afternoon tea or plant based (vegan) afternoon tea. That worked out very well for us. Two in the group chose the traditional afternoon tea, and two of us, who are vegetarians, chose the plant-based afternoon tea.  The sandwiches were excellent. The meat eaters loved the coronation chicken ones, in particular. The…"
August 2022,Best ever Afternoon Tea!,We had the most wonderful time at Browns hotel this week. Beautiful suite so stylish and comfortable.  Staff real friendly and helpful.  Meal in browns restaurant was very good. I loved the grilled prawn starter and they had pistachio ice cream on the menu a lovely surprise and ending to a meal.  Amazing choice on breakfast menu and it was delicious.  A visit to Donovan’s bar really worth it recommend honey bear cocktail.
August 2022,Weekend at Brown’s,"We have just had the best Afternoon Tea ever! Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and efficient staff. We were asked more than once if we would like more of the gorgeous sandwiches, scones and cakes. At the end, we were presented with another pot of tea. Cannot recommend Brown's enough."
July 2022,Amazing experience,"My wife and I had a 3 night stay at the Brown’s hotel. It was wonderful. We had a great time, everyone from the doorman to the front desk were courteous, helpful and pleasant. The room was wonderful, the bed was comfortable and the living area was very nice. The hotel was located in a safe area and walking distance to many sights. Would love the opportunity to stay there again."
July 2022,Birthday Tea,"I have had an amazing time at the Brown’s hotel, it’s a gorgeous place and the staff are lovely and so accommodating, they always stop to have a chat! I will absolutely come again next time I am visiting."
July 2022,Great traditional hotel,"My brother and I had an incredible experience for afternoon tea at the Brown’s Hotel in London. Our server, Rocco, was funny, charming and very knowledgeable of the menu and hotel. He made sure all our requests were met, having personally read our reservation notes. The live piano music was such a nice backdrop and the food is delicious and just keeps coming! Thanks, Rocco, for a wonderful afternoon!"
July 2022,Afternoon Tea,I can’t say enough about how wonderful this hotel is. Truly a five-star experience With personalized service. The location is perfect for exploring London. Close to shopping and the Palace. Irene at Reception and concierge Dave head were friendly helpful and truly interested in making your stay terrific
July 2022,Fantastic service at superb hotel,"We've just had a wonderful Afternoon Tea at Brown's. It was so lovely stepping into the elegant, airy Victorian Drawing Room out of the intense heat. Paul, our principal waiter, immediately set the tone for us - he was such fun. The food was absolutely delicious. After the sandwich selection (we loved the coronation chicken in particular and our daughter said that the Vegetarian selection was the best selection she'd ever had), came the most delectable scones ever. They were sooo good, along with the yummy strawberry jam (which can be purchased). These were followed by delicious cakes, then more cakes - so it was good we hadn't asked for more sandwiches! The little grape tarts, the  Baked Alaska tarts and the little cream buns were divine. The Victoria sponge was also gorgeous.…"
July 2022,Mrs,"Brilliant hotel with wonderful staff and a unique and special team.  We could not be more impressed with Browns.  What makes it so special is the incredible team and service culture.   The rooms are also superb and Charlie’s restaurant excellent.  We loved the Sunday night Jazz. And,  just to mention the wonderful Browns team again!!"
July 2022,Golden wedding,"Excellent visit to Browns spa with 3 friends, we all had different treatments which we would highly recommend. Beautiful products and surroundings , polite friendly staff, all very relaxing and enjoyable with a visit to the Donovan bar before hitting Charlie’s restaurant for supper ."
September 2022,Week- end Birthday celebration,"A splendidly elegant and vibrant hotel, with very assured, attentive and friendly staff. Sunday lunch was as traditional as you wished, but with plenty of choices, food and service excellent.  Donovan's bar served first rate cocktails with enthusiastic and informative service, against a background of lively well-chosen music. There was a pleasing buzz about the place and the bar itself was extremely well designed and inviting. Our room was elegant, spacious and spotless. The only minor negative was a slow Sunday breakfast, but the range and quality of the food more than offset that. Very good black coffee."
September 2022,There’s no other hotel like Brown’s,"The service was impeccable. Donovan’s the bar had a great “clubby” feel. The food at Charlie’s is among the best London. The hotel is also located in the heart of some of the best shopping in London so what’s not to love?  Would highly recommend staying at Brown’s for the history, the ambience, its location and the service."
August 2022,A Lovely Place to spend time in London,"Brown's was top notch from start when we were greeted by the friendliest folks, to a great cozy room, to the AMAZING Donovan Bar (do not miss this!) to our (too soon) exit.  What a wonderful stay - we will absolutely be back to experience Afternoon Tea!  Highly recommend!"
April 2023,Fantastic all around,Amazing all around.   Wonderful staff everywhere.   Restaurants and bar are incredible.  Location is a 10. Rooms super quiet and comfortable.   Beds are incredible.    Housekeeping amazing.    Its 5 plus stars across the board.  I cant think of one thing that’s not perfect
March 2023,Amazing Experience ," After my recent good fortune to have stayed at Browns at the recommendation of a friend , with my elderly mother and teenage son, for a few days I feel compelled to tell the entire world what a fantastic experience it was. We can not say enough about the amazingly professional and kind staff. Lee Boulton, Head Concierge handled more than one possibly stressful situation that arose during our travels with expertise and grace.  Sensing exactly what each of us needed at every turn and delivering. Thank you to everyone there for making our trip so wonderful!!"
April 2023,amazing,"had an amazing stay at browns hotel, it’s in a great central area and all of the staff were very friendly and helpful especially Charles at reception, the food and restaurant were lovely and the hotel room was spotless. can’t wait to come back again !!"
April 2023,Outstanding,"My daughter & I did the “mummy & me” spa and afternoon tea package - it was superb.  The hotel is gorgeous and the service impeccable.  Traditional in style and so much to see and enjoy.    The spa is very calming and relaxing - gorgeous scented candles and oils and lovely ambiance.  Appears to be quite a small spa and I think we were the only guests there for our session.  Olga and Saba (I may have her name spelled wrong sorry!) were outstanding.  It was a lovely experience especially for my 11 year old daughter.  The package included afternoon tea in the drawing room which was fantastic - terrific service, lovely pianist and just such a lovely room.  The tea was divine with lots of choice and more of everything offered.  The children’s tea has some lovely touches.  There is a…"
April 2023,Excellent British’s vibed hotel,"""I recently stayed at Browns hotel and I have to say, it was an amazing experience! From the moment I arrived, the staff was welcoming and friendly, making me feel right at home. The facilities were excellent with beautiful decor and all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay. The suite was Paul Smith, clean, , highly designed and luxurious, with a comfortable bed that made it difficult to leave in the morning. I also appreciated the location, which was convenient for exploring the city. Overall, I can't recommend Browns enough. It's truly a five-star hotel that exceeded all my expectations"
April 2023,Wonderful to be back at our London home away from home,Stayed for one night to celebrate my birthday. As always everything was perfect from being welcomed by the doormen when we arrived to  our departure the next day. Our room was  beautiful and dinner at Charlie’s was delicious.  Brown’s is definately our favorite hotel and we cannot wait to to return. 
April 2023,What an amazing place!,"I have rarely stayed in a hotel where I was that blown away by the staff. Absolutely fantastic, every single one that I have met was so friendly, so helpful, so customer-focused, was breathing hospitality constantly.  Plus: The hotel itself. You can feel the history just by walking through it. Something new to explore everywhere, the fantastic decor and interior design, the charming and lovely bedrooms, the delicious food at the Charlie's restaurant, the amazing drinks at the Donovan bar, ... I could continue endlessly.   Last but not least: Perfectly located, just some steps off Picadilly Circus, a few minutes walk to Soho and Chinatown, perfect base to explore London.  Apparently I had to turn nearly 40 years of age to visit London the first time, but it will definitely not…"
March 2023,Fantastic— comfortable and quiet!,Thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at the Browns hotel in London. It was a lovely hotel on a quiet street but in the heart of Mayfair. Fantastic location. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was lovely and wait staff awesome. Rooms were comfortable and we slept so well. One of the quietest hotel rooms I’ve ever stayed in. Would happily stay here again or recommend to friends. 
March 2023,An exceptional hotel,An exceptional hotel with a wonderful staff who exceeded our high expectations at every turn.  Nothing was overlooked during our entire stay.  Browns Hotel is an oasis in the heart of Central London.  
March 2023,"The most beautiful hotel in London, with such authentic and gorgeous design. This felt like the most luxurious experience of my ","       My evening started with dinner at Charlie's restaurant, where I was served by the lovely and professional staff Manuel, Luigi, and Alex. It was delicious food, and it was amazing to have so many options for a vegetarian such as myself. In restaurants, the staff gave amazing service and made me and my friend feel like VIPs.         The Donovan bar has such a unique and beautiful design. Here I was served by Federico, and Martina was absolutely amazing and friendly. I can't believe Drink Meniu was an actual book. This is amazing. I try the most magical cocktail, Flower Power. Can't believe the cocktail colour changed in front of my eyes.   This cocktail was refreshing and delicious.          A hotel with a luxury interior felt like a private museum. In the hotel, very…"
August 2023,The most luxurious home hotel in london,"The only hotel in London that feels like your home - exceptional on every level with exemplary service and hospitality which starts with the amazing doormen Gilt, Niel and Ivai and continues all the way through  Discreet, classy and beyond luxury "
August 2023,Massages,Amazing experience at spa. Really good massage. Whole family has been so far for various treatments and they have been amazing. Professional and helpful staff with a good consultation before. I personally had Fouzia who gave clear advice for my personal needs and focused on areas where I had greatest discomfort. Will come again!
July 2023,Family vacation with a 4 year old,"Brown’s might be one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at for traveling with toddlers/young kids. We stayed there for a week in early July and had a wonderful time. I got in touch with the hotel concierge by email prior to arrival and they helped me arrange transportation and book restaurants for our stay. The guest services representative also helped me arrange a great surprise for my husband’s birthday.   When we arrived, I was amazed by the small details that made our stay so relaxing - a set of kids toiletries, kids slippers and a bath robe in exact size my daughter wears, fresh flowers in the room, a fresh fruit basket and packages delivered to the room (and not simply left at front desk), just to name a few. Then there was a beautifully decorated ceiling in reception desk…"
July 2023,Great Spa,"The spa center is welcoming and comfortable. They use very good organic oils and do nut rush the treatment. My massage therapist Fouzia was great, applied the right pressure and technique to solve my lower back problem! "
July 2023,Exquisite Spa Experience,"I have been coming the Browns Spa for 10 years and it has never disappointed. From the greetings, to the tea, to the treatment and the exit, the entire experience and customer care is first rate in London. Very cozy, not touristy, quintessential English. Highly recommend for road warriors and just simply relaxation. Eric G."
July 2023,The Spa,Took my daughter for a special 10th birthday treat at the spa. Aurora was amazing. Made my daughter feel so special. Definitely recommend this spa. Thank you Aurora for making this a special day. We will be back soon
July 2023,100% recommendation,"Everything was perfect. The service, the room, the breakfast and especially the cocktails in the Donovan Bar. The staff were very attentive and always helpful and friendly. The room was stylishly decorated, very clean and very comfortable. We were absolutely satisfied with our stay and can recommend the hotel one hundred percent."
June 2023,Ultimate British Experience,"We loved Browns Hotel.  The Hotel completely redecorated  all the public rooms recently and they are  stunning.  The vibe is traditional, elegant and yet very comfortable and inviting.  The staff is very friendly and well trained.  They can not do enough for you and are most polite and kind.  We ate at Donovans 2 times (the bar and informal dining room). The food was excellent.  Our accommodation was upgraded to The Browns Suite which was the size of a small apartment with 2 bathrooms.  Staying at Browns is the ultimate British experience with a true sense of place."
July 2023,Lovely hotel ,An elegant hotel in a great location. The room is well appointed and the service excellent.  I tebd to hace trouble sleeping while traveling but was comfortable and slept well here.  Lots of nice touches.
June 2023,Surprised this is rated 5 star,"Very disappointing experience after staying in many other London 5 star hotels (Claridge's, Cannaught, Mandarin Oriental, all of the Firmdale hotels, etc). This is simply not in the same category. The lobby is tiny but very lovely and the restaurants downstairs are nice. But the rooms are a bit shabby and old feeling, like staying in a grandmother's house. We booked through Platinum Amex and the hotel refused to acknowledge our contracted Amex benefits, causing a headache for us. Would not recommend if you are looking for London's finest. "
December 2022,Nearly a five rating,"Couldn’t fault much at all. My only criticism would be that our room had low ceilings, and so didn’t feel quite as premium as we would have liked. However, we asked for a quiet room, and we certainly got that. And the bed was supremely comfortable. The staff were all very nice, although the chap on reception could have been warmer. "
November 2022,Fantastic,Myself and my family stayed at Browns hotel on the 26th and 27th of November I know you pay for your stay but from the doormen to the cleaners everybody makes you feel like royalty we are far from being a rich family and this was a treat long saved for now we start saving again thank to Barbara on the reception desk but to everyone of the staff thank and see you all soon
November 2022,Best location ever !!!,"Hotel very well located, fantastic hospitality.  Clean, cozy, good food :) , nice and very polite people  in room service.  Piano sound  in the bar which makes the atmosphere very romantic this Christmas season!  Home away home :)   Really recommend and really enjoy staying in mayfair!"
November 2022,Xmas at Browns,Staying at Browns at this time of year you feel as if you are starring in a Hallmark Xmas movie- wholly in a good way! the hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are their usual charming selves - Xmas elves one might say
November 2022,Fabulous!,"Just absolutely service by all members of the Browns staff. They make you feel like you are visiting family. Definitely come back, the Christmas tree was just put up overnight and is magical. Definitely worth a visit "
November 2022,Faultless stay,"A perfect weekend stay at Brown’s to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The hotel is beautiful, and the staff went out of their way to ensure every aspect of the weekend went without a hitch. And if you haven’t experienced the roast beef Sunday lunch, you need to book now!"
November 2022,Another perfect stay.,"From the moment we arrived, all the way through to our departure, every member of the team was friendly, helpful and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. It is our favourite London hotel and location cannot be bettered, right in the heart of Mayfair and St James."
November 2022,Best afternoon tea,"The best afternoon tea in London. Jonka explained us what tea we should drink and told us more about the history of the Browns Hotel. She was lovely and we had a good time. It was our fourth time here, but the first time we were here since Jonka works here. She made the experience even better."
November 2022,The experience is top notch,"I was visiting my daughter living in London, a girls weekend and selected Browns from Amex not knowing all of the history about the hotel.  If you’re a history buff, you’ll love this hotel even more. From the moment I checked in, I felt the uniqueness of Brown’s. The decor, the art, the food and special drinks at Donavan’s - all special. The reception team was very welcoming and informative. The ever friendly Tottenheim fan John - the fabulous doorman. One of the highlights is the best tea experience ever! Better than lanesborough or sketch! #yonka is a gem and we had the most wonderful unique experience with her guidance in pairing of teas with the most amazing sandwiches, pastries and gateaux - simply the best. You have to save room for extra scone for the strawberry jam is…"
November 2022,Rescued from the rain,"I arrived at Brown's hotel on the morning of Sunday 6 November looking decidedly less than five stars: my umbrella had broken and I was soaked. Still, I dared to go to the reception of the Charlie's restaurant to ask whether it would be possible to have breakfast there. I had warm memories of the Afternoon Tea at Brown's years before, that drew me in.  The lovely lady at Charlie's reception said: ""We do not normally do that, but I cannot turn you away!"" They took my coat and hat and small suitcase, I went to the ladies room where I was able to dry my hair with a towel.  I was then seated at a table. The breakfast I ordered was as lovely as the service.  I felt so well taken care of. Even impeccable service can sometimes feel cold, but the service at Brown's had a wonderfully…"
September 2022,Sunday Afternoon Tea ( 60th birthday ),Myself and 7 others were at this hotel for afternoon tea on 4/9/22 @ 2pm right from the lady ( Bianca ) who handled our booking who was so helpful and polite to the waiter who served us who has a unique way of serving champagne with the glass high in the air  this gentleman was just born to be a waiter very polite and helpful also very attentive but not over the top which made for a very relaxing afternoon. The afternoon tea we had was just superb and off the scale and i have got to say myself and all of my guests have been very lucky in life to have eaten across the world at many venues but we all agreed this was the best afternoon tea experience we have ever had . All of the staff we met that day are a credit to your brand. Kind regards  Robert Edmead
August 2022,The BEST family hotel in London.,"We stayed here for a family treat and it was exceptional. A home away from home! My stepdaughter Bea who is 4 years old absolutely loved it and we did not want to leave! From the warm welcome to the special amenities for children, everything was perfect."
August 2022,A fine lunch.,"An impromptu visit for lunch in Charlie’s with my son James  was made a memorably enjoyable occasion by the warm welcome and faultless service we received. From Kitchen to Front-of-House each member of staff could run a master-class on how their job should be done. How reassuring for any visitor to know that pure, relaxed pleasure awaits when you step over the threshold of Brown's Hotel and then enter Charlie's under the direction of the Master; the inimitable and charismatic Jesus Adorno."
August 2022,what a joy to be back at Browns for another fabulous night's stay,"It always feels like coming home - the welcome is second to none from the moment you drive up outside to the moment you drive away.   The perfect evening started by checking into one of the stunning suites, quickly followed by martinis and Ruinart in the Donovan Bar (brilliant cocktails and such friendly service) and ended (after supper with friends) with more of the same back in the bar before a superbly comfortable night's sleep. Impossible to have a bad night's sleep - the  beds and bedlinen are heavenly.  Delicious cooked breakfast the next morning delicious as always.  All in all a huge huge treat - we look forward to returning soon."
July 2022,Always great to be there!,"Another wonderful stay at the lovely Brown’s! I stayed there a couple of days last month and I everything was great. This time I had the chance to meet Givi who was so helpful before my departure, I wanted to thank him so much. Hope to come back soon!"
August 2022,Browns afternoon tea continues to be one of the best in London. And Yonka creates a memorable and joyful experience!,"Brown’s continues to serve one of the best afternoon tea services in London. And Yonka makes the experience that much more memorable and joyful. With her extensive knowledge of all the available teas at Brown’s, and her warm and caring personality, she made our family gathering that much more special. Thank you Yonka and all the wonderful staff at the Brown’s Drawing Room!"
August 2022,40 th Stay and Birthday celebrations,"I just want to say a massive thank you, for all your help and support in making my wife's 40th the best.  Everyone from start to finish couldn't have been more helpful and catered to all of our needs.  We will 100 % be looking to stay again shortly.  A special mention goes to Paul in the restaurant as he was so great with our boys when they arrived on Sunday.  Thank you again.  Many Thanks  Adam Upton"
August 2022,Excellent lunch at Browns,"Travelled from the Midlands for lunch at Browns ,3 cousins and a friend .We were warmly greeted by the doorman and on entering the restaurant we were complimented on our smart outfits. Our lunch was excellent,the crab starter was delicious,good choice of menu and the service was superb. We had a lovely time ,our first visit to Browns,can’t recommend it enough and will certainly return in the autumn . Thank you to everyone at Browns !!"
July 2022,Amazing location,"The browns hotel is in a perfect location for tourists as it is close to many attractions. A quick walk gets you to the Thames, across the street has the best shopping in London, down a little bit you’ll stumble upon the changing of the guard ceremony at St. James Palace. The staff is very friendly and eager to help in any way that they can. The hotel is very clean, with a lovely bar and restaurant on site. I cannot wait for my next visit to London just to stay at the Brown’s hotel!"
July 2022,Home from Home,"This hotel really is our home from home. This visit was booked so we could attend the theatre and see Sister Act. We received a very warm welcome from the doorman John as he welcomed us back to the hotel. It is lovely that you are remembered and greeted so warmly. At checkin we were allocated a room at the back of the hotel with a courtyard view. We always ask to have a street view room so we’re disappointed. Very quickly this was acknowledged and a new room was allocated. After a quick freshen up we headed for afternoon tea. We have enjoyed afternoon tea here before, but new cakes and such a varied array of teas makes this an joyous adventure all over again. The service is second to none and so much food to enjoy. John arranged a taxi for us in readiness for the theatre so we…"
April 2022,Fabulous!,"Just come back from a fabulous tea in The Drawing Room.  Exceptionally friendly and welcoming staff, lovely tea, but oh my word, those cakes!!  Totally wow!  My congratulations to Chef Reece.  A wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  Thank you very much."
March 2022,Wonderful experience,"My friend and I stayed at Browns as a special treat in prep for her wedding. All the staff without exception were wonderful; genuinely caring, professional, couldn’t do enough for us from the moment we arrived & were greeted at the door to the moment we left. The afternoon tea was a delight and everyone seemed to go out of their way to ensure we were well looked after. I would definitely recommend Browns as a special place to stay in London."
March 2022,A quirky hotel with charm,The hotel is made up of several older houses joined together and is the oldest hotel in London. The hotel has a certain uniqueness about it which gives it a non corporate feel. The staff were outstanding in their service and were very helpful. The only down side was we were near some outside vents that were a bit noisy.
March 2022,Afternoon Tea,"Lovely afternoon tea with the family. Delicious sandwiches and cakes, wide selection of teas and drinks. We enjoyed the beautiful settings and were well looked after by Bianca. Our favourite were the scones!!"
March 2022,A memorable family experience at Brown’s hotel,"We stayed at Brown’s with our 10 and 11 year old children for Spring Break. To say our stay was memorable would be an understatement. We loved this property. It was beautiful, rooms were comfortable, and it’s in a great location.  Our one bedroom suite was spacious. We had two rollaways set up in the living room for the kids and there was still plenty of room to relax and enjoy the space. The kids beds were personalized and came with a stuffed animal and book. We had amenities for the adults and the kids upon arrival.  We had breakfast in Charlie’s and the food was excellent. My husband and I had drinks in Donovan’s Bar at night and, wow, what a menu. The drinks did not disappoint.  But the staff set our experience apart. In particular, Dennis, the guest experience manager, went…"
February 2022,Beautiful hotel and best service in London,"We are so glad we selected Brown’s hotel to stay in for our family’s first visit to London since 2019. From the wonderful check in experience to drinks at the Donovan bar, Brown’s really takes customer service seriously. Our concierge Chris was next level amazing - he worked to get us the best reservations and organized the coolest hands on experience for our artistic tween daughter. Chris helped make our time in London the best part of our trip and Brown’s was a wonderful oasis in London."
March 2022,Lovely family feel.,"Staying at Browns is like staying with friends. The staff, food, accommodation are all lovely. Browns is the best of British, if you want service with a smile look no further. We have been three times in the last six months and we can’t wait until our next visit."
March 2022,Romantic stay,"The team at Brown's Hotel make u8s feel very special on out stay. From check in done by Andrea and Alex to check out. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne during our check in the Front desk team was very pleasant and accommodating. Our room was amaizing, very comfortable and we did received some tasty chocolates and other amenities. On our return from dinner at Charlie's restaurant we were welcomed with some rose petals spread on our bed and in the bathroom which was really nice surprise. The dinner was so delicious ang looked like a painting on the plate. Luigi and Gianluca were delightful during service, so easy to talk to. We did visit Donovan Bar for after dinner drinks. Once again we were welcomed very warmly by Martina. The team at the bar Alessandro and Daniele were…"
March 2022,"Wonderful Hotel, Staff & Best Location","I brought my Mum for her 90th Birthday and just wow! We had the best week end. My Mum felt very special, the staff all greeted her by name. The little extra thoughtful touches from the staff, the comfy rooms, the decor and the feel of the hotel made my Mum's Birthday one to remember. Thank you to Browns for a memorable week end. We would definitely recommend and return."
February 2022,London Weekend,"This was our second visit to Browns in the last 6mths and they welcomed us back like family. We had a touching card in our room (I know it’s probably standard but it was very nice) welcoming us to our Home from Home! Could not fault the service or rooms in fact our suite didn’t have his & hers wash basins but his & hers bathrooms!! Would highly recommend Browns for those special occasions, expensive but you get what you pay for!"
June 2022,Summer exhibition visit,Great suite lots of room and two bathrooms. Lovely breakfasts with a large choice. Only criticism constant modern jazz whilst eating. It is not everyone’s taste and why do we need music in restaurants.
July 2022,Great service,"The location of the hotel is prime, and the service is very good. All the staff are warm and caring. Special kudos to Jorge, Ivaz, and the guy who dropped off a special delivery from pharmacy for us in the morning (sorry I don’t remember your name ) ! !"
June 2022,Top Service at Lovely Boutique Hotel,We cannot praise the service and staff at Browns enough.  From top to bottom an amazing experience that made us feel welcome and catered to seamlessly....From the front desk staff to the concierge to the bellman to the waitstaff--INCREDIBLE service!    Perfect location convenient to everything and nice size rooms as well.
June 2022,50th Birthday Celebrations,We booked Brown’s Hotel for my wife’s special birthday celebrations. From the moment I initially made contact the service was excellent. I contacted Guest Relations prior to our arrival to arrange a couple of little surprises and Francesca looked after us admirably. Our check in with Luca was friendly and efficient and the concierge team arranged our restaurant reservations with great efficiency. John and the team were always on hand to arrange taxis and the hotels location is just superb. What an excellent hotel. What great staff. All went to plan and we cannot wait to return. Thank you to everyone at Browns. We will be back
July 2022,London Visit,"Fantastic service from Fidel, Irene and all the staff as usual!  Unfortunately the weather was inclement so the location was very convenient. Charlie’s was also great for in house dining! Looking forward to returning and enjoying the hospitality at Brown’s Hotel again."
June 2022,Excellent and well located hotel,I was there with my family and had a lot of attention for my grandchild with toys in room.Staff are very friendly and always ready to help for anything. I will return to this hotel on my next trip to London.
June 2022,Excellent Hotel,"We were very well taken care of from the moment we arrived at the hotel.  During our stay we always had a lot of attention from the entire team, always ready to help: Ivan, the porters and especially Lee and Fidel.  Congratulations to all of you.  We will certainly return to the excellent Browns Hotel where we felt at home."
May 2022,Fantastic Hotel,"This hotel is a stand out place to stay in London, highly recommend when in the area. Staff are friendly and go the extra mile for your needs. The beds are the best I have stayed in, so much so I have stripped the beds to find out the brand of mattress!!"
June 2022,Pregnancy massage,"I had a massage at The Spa at Brown’s Hotel last week, when I was 36 weeks’ pregnant and feeling very big and full of aches. My therapist Anastasia was amazing, she made me feel immediately relaxed and comfortable and she came across as gentle yet confident and knowledgeable. She targeted perfectly all the places I needed to release tension and the pressure was perfect. I unreservedly recommend Anastasia and would be happy to visit her again at The Spa. Also the manager, Ruta, is welcoming and proactive in ensuring guests are happy and looked after."
May 2022,A new place for a wonderful meal at Brown’s!,"On May 19, 2022 Brown’s opened The Supper Club serving drinks, snacks, light meals, and desserts.  I went there with friends on May 27 to try it out, and I was not disappointed.  But then again I am never disappointed at Brown’s.  Everything my friends and I ate and drank was delicious.  I would especially recommend the bread and butter pudding for dessert.  My special thanks to the wonderful staff including Karol, Simone, and the incomparable Yonka.  My friends and I will definitely return to The Supper Club."
February 2023,Very professional and friendly staff,"I visited this weekend as a treat for my daughters 14th birthday.  I had a slight hiccup with the original booking time which was my fault. The receptionist was very accommodating and managed to fit us in for a later time. I am very grateful for that.  I had a facial and my daughter a facial and massage, which she really enjoyed. An explanation was given on the products used and how to maintain a skin care regime, which was helpful to my teenage daughter. They also surprised her with a small cake with a little candle in it. This was a nice touch and made her feel extra special.  I really want to thank Federica and Fouzia who carried out our treatment, they were both very friendly and made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  All in all a lovely experience, will definitely be…"
February 2023,A must visit hotel in London,"As soon as we arrived were greeted by the amazing door and valet team. The staff were so incredibly kind and welcoming, from every at front desk and the concierges Givi and Simeon. The room was spectacularly put together for my birthday with my favourite flower being imported from abroad!  The food at Donovan's rivals any bar food I've ever had and the service at Charlie's was truly attentive without being overbearing. Thank you to the cleaning staff too, who did a wonderful turn down service for us which included rose petals all over the room - such an amazing touch. We will definitely be back to enjoy one of the best hotel experiences ever."
February 2023,Outstanding service,"We went for dinner in Charlie's Restaurant and we were very well looked after by Manuel, who was very attentive. We were warmly welcomed by Paul and, of course, the prominent and beloved Jesus. Gianluca made sure we had everything we need. We wish to thank them all very much for a beautiful evening and also to Alessandro, the sommelier. If you look for a quiet evening and delicious food, ambiance an friendly staff, Charlie's has all of them. Thank you!"
February 2023,Brilliant spa experience ,"I went to spa for a scrub and a massage. All I can say is that everything was very professional and friendly in the same time. I think this is the main characteristic which describes Brown's Hotel. Hanna was the one who welcomed me and described my treatments with a bright smile. Federica was my therapist and she was truly brilliant, her hands were magic and the friendly manner she approaches makes you feel more relaxed and comfortable. I would highly recommend it. Thank you both for a fresh start to the day! :)"
January 2023,Great hotel,"Everyone working there is trying their best to be cordial, inviting, friendly, and professional.  A shout out to the best two bartenders at the barFederico and Alessandro who were lively, friendly, and enthusiastic at their job behind the bar.  Also the front desk day manager Mr. Castelli who is respectful and extremely helpful.  The rooms are newly renovated, clean and attractive.  It's a cozy hotel with a beautiful service attitude.  I must say though:  the teatime menu (scones, cakes, and sandwiches) can really truly use an improvement.  The teatime and tea room (which is very attractive) is extremely popular.  I have a feeling it's due to its ambiance and not so much the quality of the tea time offerings.  The bread was dry, the scones- uh not so great also dry and…"
January 2023,BEWARE - Theft during stay !!!!!!!!!!! Put every single valuable item in your safe or else..,"I am very disappointed in Browns and the fact that I need to write this review. After staying at Browns during the festive period, I returned home to the US and when I went to take my US dollars out of the side zipper of my cosmetic bag, I discovered it was missing! I had placed it in the bag at the beginning of our stay knowing I would not be using USD. This was my worst mistake, trusting hotel staff and no placing the cash in the safe. However, I have stayed at many 5 star hotels in the past and never thought it would be something to worry about in such an expensive place. Unfortunately, there was not a point during our stay when I noticed it missing and it was not until we returned home when I immediately alerted the hotel security team. While they did tell me that they…"
January 2023,Best hotel in the world,"Fantastic hotel.  Wonderful location.  Excellent restaurant.  But, it is the service and the people who make Brown's the finest hotel in the world.  A special shout-out to the concierge folks -- particularly, Lee and Richard -- who are wonderful, and possibly clairvoyant."
January 2023,Perfect Stay at our new go to London Hotel,"Traveling as a couple with two adult daughters. We have never stayed at Brown's prior to this trip but have stayed at other Rocco Forte properties.   Brown's was not our go to in London but thought to give it a try this trip.   Great decision.  The doorman greeted us and helped us and our luggage out of the cab.  Our checkin was seamless and hostess most gracious and informative.  Both rooms were upgraded at check in with our American Express program and  we received two beautifully  appointed, absolutely quiet junior suites facing Albermarle street.   The hostess escorted us to our room and reviewed the features with us.  The concierge found us a late lunch and made the call to get us in.  He provided maps and we went on our separate errands.   The Donovan bartenders were a…"
December 2022,Impromptu visit to the Donovan Bar,"Had the pleasure to visit the fabulous Donovan Bar at Brown’s Hotel. It was an impromptu visit and the bar was already buzzing when we arrived early evening, but the staff was so welcoming and found us a table in no time. The atmosphere is cosy, and the surroundings luxurious and classy, but the stars of the show were obviously the wonderful cocktails 🍸😍 My friend and I didn’t know what to choose from the wide selection, thankfully the staff were so helpful and spot on with their suggestions! I will definitely come back and strongly recommend, for a cheeky cocktail with a friend before dinner (they also have an amazing restaurant Charlie’s) or a romantic date to impress!"
January 2023,Londons number 1 hotel and our home from home,"We have just returned from an amazing 2 night stay at Browns Hotel.  The hotel is situated in the heart of Mayfair surrounded by high end shops and restaurants and within walking distance of many of Londons top attractions. However, staying in this hotel surrounded by its history and so many amenities, there is no need to step outside the door if you do not want too. On arrival we were greeted at the door with “welcome home” and that is how we were made to feel during our whole stay - at home. We dined at Charlie’s restaurant and welcomed in the New Year in The Donovan Bar. All the staff from the door staff reception staff, bar staff, waiting staff, housekeeping and managers are second to none. We have been fortunate to stay in many 5 star hotels throughout the world, but we…"
May 2022,An amazing Boutique Hotel,"One of the best boutique hotels I have stayed at. Great staff, great location and if you have a little child that you are traveling with you are in good hands  The hotel has a great location close to regent street, Hyde park, Piccadilly  Food is great Overall the hotel chain is amazing"
May 2022,Stunning Stay in an beautiful hotel ,"We've stayed in the Brown's Hotel during our city trip and had a wonderful time. The service was absolutely fantastic, the staff is so friendly, helpful to make everyone feeling home!  I only can recommend this stunning Hotel to everybody who is looking for a great high quality experience!  You really can feel that this hotel is a family owned and operated hotel! "
April 2022,Amazing stay at a fabulous hotel!,"My husband and I recently stayed at Brown's Hotel for the first time.  It was a trip to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.  The entire experience was terrific.  The staff were extremely courteous and helpful.  The room we stayed in was beautiful, clean and comfortable.  The location is wonderful - walking distance to many shops, sights, restaurants and pubs.  The bar at the hotel makes unique, delicious cocktails.  I have stayed in London many times and this was definitely a highlight. We will absolutely return to this hotel in the future."
April 2022,Exceptional ,"Our discovery of Brown’s Hotel was just after they reopened post 2020 lockdown and since then there have been a total 7 visits, with more booked! Every single one of those visits has been exceptional, which tells you something about the typicality of a Brown’s experience. Consistency of service isn’t easy to achieve but Brown’s achieves this really rather effortlessly.   Staff are incredibly personable, welcoming you as an old friend. This warmth runs though the entire hotel, from the doormen, to restaurant staff, to the front desk. Nothing is too much trouble and every request delivered with a smile and genuine care.   Post visit questionnaires are always problematic to complete, as there is nothing which can be improved, yet there is still a willingness to improve. This tells…"
April 2022,High Tea,This is our third visit to the Brown’s for High Tea. Yonka made this experience exquisite! She guided us through the most extensive choice of teas. Absolutely the best experience yet! Thank you Yonka!
April 2022,Simply Exceptional,From the moment they pick up the phone to take your reservation to the moment you check out the experience is exceptional!  The service we received from the staff was outstanding.  We look forward to returning very soon.
April 2022,Stylish and comfortable.,"Stylish without bling.  Great service without being intrusive.  Friendly and welcoming.  Good location for Mayfair and beyond, but away from the noise.  We felt comfortable and  well-looked after during our stay.     I can recommend the restaurant and cocktail bar as well."
April 2022,Excellent service and food,"I was invited for afternoon tea today. It was amazing experience. I was served by Bianca, Karol and Artur. They took care of us and made this day special by their friendly attitude. Sandwiches and desserts were excellent. We also enjoyed pleasing piano music."
April 2022,Excellent hotel and restaurant,"We wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary in style and could not have chosen a better place to do it. All the staff, from the doorman to reception and restaurant, were so friendly and attentive and went out of their way to make sure that our celebration was special. Our room was upgraded and a card and cake were delivered to our room. Our dinner in Charlie's was delicious and the restaurant staff were first class. We loved the ambience and decor of the whole hotel, particularly the bar and restaurant. We look forward to returning very soon."
April 2022,Is brown’s hotel good?,"The answer of the title is yes, in this hotel the final of “The Jungle Book” was finished there and lots of other historic things happened there. And lots of other things to find out, the people there are kind, the rooms are excellent, and it’s the first hotel of London."
February 2022,Our Second home,"Amazing suites, exceptional, professional, caring and kind staff. This has been our second visit in few months as a family and everything was great and very well looked after. An experience of a life time. Thank you and goodbye till we meet again soon!"
February 2022,Amazing! Best hotel in London,"From start to finish the service was impeccable. The suite was stunning with every luxury you would expect. My two young children were made incredibly welcome and special touches were added just for them. None of us actually wanted to leave. The best staff, the best service, the best hotel and all in the best location."
February 2022,Best hotel in London,"Great doormen, great rooms, great bar, great service. I first went to Browns for Sunday afternoon tea in the 1980s and without losing any of its original charm it is now, in my opinion, the best hotel in London but keep it secret."
February 2022,Cocktails,"Fabulous cocktails as always In the 'bar' you are still required to stay at your table and they come to you, which if you're just drinking is not always the best However we love the cocktails and the bar area We are yet to try the food but on our next visit we will do"
February 2022,"Completely Overwhelmed , From Start To Finish.","Thank you doesn't really seem adequate. The team at Browns Hotel truly made my Mums birthday weekend. I understand that you have special guests all of the time, especially with it being Valentine's weekend, however they really did go above and beyond to make every single thing perfect.   From start to finish, Olga in the Spa gave my mum a wonderful massage and made her feel comfortable and relaxed. The concierge team were always on hand to help and Francesca honestly did do everything in her power to make this trip memorable.   My mum was taken away by how wonderful everything was, honestly.   This is some of the best service I have ever witnessed and received. The team at Browns hotel do the Rocco Forte Hotel brand proud, it was a complete pleasure and we will be back one day…"
February 2022,Afternoon tea,Afternoon tea was great. The food quality was really good and the service was excellent. We were hungry earlier than expected and they accommodated us despite being 2 hours early for our reservation. Yonka served us and taught us all about the teas we were drinking and the history of afternoon tea. She gave great recommendations and she was really funny. She made it a memorable experience
January 2022,Beyond compare,"This really has to be one of the very best hotels we have ever stayed in. It was impossible to find fault, no matter how small, with any aspects of our stay. The rooms are superb, the hotel position could not be bettered, the restaurants and bars are top class but most of all, our thanks go to the staff for making our stay so enjoyable. Their commitment to providing the very best in service is so obvious and nothing appears to be too much trouble for them. Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff - what more could you ask for?"
February 2022,Excellent service,"We came for dinner yesterday and we were impressed by Charlie's Restaurant's staff. They made our evening by taking care of us and smiling all the time.  On our arrival, Silvia greeted us with a bright smile. Luigi and Chloe made sure everything is perfect. It is obvious they all have great customer skills and knowledge about the menu. We want to thank them again for the excellent service they provided and for making us feel so special.  We recommended Charlie's to our friends 🙂."
January 2022,Weekend treat with family,"Fantastic and seamless service from start to finish - Brown's always know the meaning of five stars. The pre-stay service, check-in, support throughout and dining experience was exceptional on every level."
January 2022,Family trip,Amazing beautiful and friendly five star hotel in top location! We stayed there with my teenage sons and it was perfect for them going out. The concierge was super helpful and the doorman so nice!  Thanks we will be back for sure. Carolin
March 2022,First choice without doubt!,"I return here most weeks for work because of the extremely friendly, professional and courteous staff. The accommodation and facilities never disappoint. Dennis the general manager is just brilliant, nothing is ever too much trouble, and it’s always lovely to see John’s smiling face to greet you at the front door!"
February 2022,Wonderfully attentive service in a beautiful setting,"My stay started with a  lovely welcome by the front desk and the staff who took care of every detail. While I’m staying at the hotel for a  vacation in April, I found myself there after my son who is studying abroad ended up in the hospital with tonsillitis. To say they made us feel at home would be an understatement! Dennis - the wonderful guest experience manager sent up bath salts, fruit and chocolate covered strawberries to welcome my son out of the hospital. Chris, the amazing concierge arranged for a humidifier and great reservations once we could head out and the Rado and the room service staff brought tea around the clock!  We cannot wait to head back in April and look forward to another fabulous stay."
February 2022,Quintessential London,"What a wondrous experience Brown’s is. Situated in the heart of Mayfair, it was a perfect location for my 3-day visit of the capitol. I absolutely loved the hotel’s décor being a mix of both traditional and contemporary. The room was very spacious and cosy. The Donovan Bar was so very London with an amazing buzz and energy coupled with a perfect service.  But for me, probably the best part of my stay was the Staff. From the Reception staff to the breakfast Team, to the front Doormen to the waitresses at Donovan’s. The attention they gave to make my stay personalized and special was wonderful. With just the right balance between professionalism and personal attention, I think Sir Forte can be proud of his Team.  Thank-you all again for making my stay memorable. I WILL be back!"
February 2022,Off the chart amazing!!!,"Simply superb!! What more can I say? Saturday night and packed to the rafters yet still our service was sublime. Maria our hostess was quite Simply AMAZING, she was a great host but still had time to have a bit of banter with us. Truly one of the best waitresses we have ever met. Then the food, OMG, it was incredible. I would recommend to the highest degree "
February 2022,Wonderful stay!,We cannot recommend Brown’s highly enough for anybody wanting a special hotel stay. Attention to detail was second to none and we truly felt special on our birthday/anniversary visit. Thank-you  again.
February 2022,Wonderful Stay - As Always,Had another great few days in London at Brown's. Always to be treasured. Impeccable service and a fantastic restaurant. The staff are warm and genuine and go out of their way to help without being intrusive. One of a kind......
February 2022,"good hotel, god location. good service",This is a good hotel with a very good and dedicated staff to make you enjoy your stay. very important during these days. Food and beverage quality are good too. maybe some improvement could come from the kitchen. breakfast is very good but dinner dishes may improve a little. service is great. cleaning of the rooms too.  the hotel has a very good location for all kind o purpose (work or visiting).
February 2022,"Fourth stay, probably the last","Brown’s is a hotel in a beautiful old building. We have stayed here 4 times now  and it has some wonderful friendly staff and does, on the whole, make it feel like you are in a home away from home. Dennis was especially wonderful during our last stay. However, for a 5* Hotel it has shortcomings and falls below others in this price range. Occasional bad experiences are expected, but Brown’s doesn’t seem to listen to this feedback and use it to improve. Sadly it is unlikely we will be coming back again. Many of the rooms are very tired and while cosy and well designed, are in need of renovation. Their age is showing, especially in places such as the stained bathroom floors and general wear and tear to the furniture. Other oddities are the choice of a cheap kettle, basic Nescafe…"
February 2022,Amazing place to stay,"The stay was amazing. Big rooms, lots of common space, delicious afternoon tea.  Personal was very polite and helpful, especially Givi our consierge  was great! Located just in the center, close to bond street."
February 2022,An excellent hotel with wonderful people,"We spent four wonderful nights at Brown’s and we can only recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for an exceptional experience. The whole team was amazing, but our special thanks go to Francesca at the reception desk and Lee at the conciergerie for their kind help and hospitality. We are looking forward to our next stay."
December 2021,Excellence & finest hospitality,"Upon a pre-Christmas visit to London December 2021, I had the pleasure of partaking Christmas Afternoon Tea at Browns and was waited on by Yonka, an excellent example of the utmost welcoming professionalism & an exquisite asset of Browns who made me feel completely at ease, satisfied every whim & made extraordinary memories of a perfect winter’s afternoon respite at Browns."
January 2022,A birthday stay,"My parents booked a trip for us to stay at The Browns hotel for my birthday. From start to finish the stay was superb. I was lucky enough to liaise with Dennis, the Guest Experience Manager who was fantastic and did so much to make our stay special.  From the moment we arrived none of the staff could do more to help, everyone was friendly, helpful and always smiling. Even when the shift changeover happened we were greeted by name with a smile. We had dinner in Charles and it was amazing, food was to a very high standard and again the staff were fantastic. I was actually sad to leave and we loved it so much we will be going back in September to celebrate my Mum's birthday."
January 2022,Mr John Ball,"We recently spent a wonderful stay at Browns Hotel and dined at Charlies Restaurant, where the food was amazing. We were treated like royalty from the moment of our arrival at Browns and throughout our stay.  The staff were super professional whilst at the same time exuding warmth and kindness. They even surprised us with a handwritten card, cake and bottle of champagne to our room when they found out we were celebrating a birthday. One of the factors that made us pick Browns was that we were able to bring our two small dogs who were made to feel equally welcome! Fabulous standard throughout including lots of thoughtful touches in the room and everything fresh and clean. Fabulous!"
January 2022,"Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful people",The hotel is beautiful and everyone that works there is beyond friendly and extremely professional. Can't wait to stay there again!!! Breakfast was delicious and delivered super fast!  The bar in the lobby Donovans had a great atmosphere and delicious drinks.
January 2022,Brown's as excellent as ever !,"A big thank you for the team at Browns for providing exemplary service and hospitality as ever. We stayed for one night as part of my wife's birthday celebrations. They anticipated everything and ensured we were taken excellent care of. We have been fortunate enough to stay at the majority of London's top hotels, however it is Brown's to whom we return again and again. "
December 2021,Lovely place,"A lovely place all decorated for Christmas.Staff was lovely with the exception of one person in the dining room...appeared to seem to turn up his nose when I inquired if they served hamburgers and french fries..we arrived after a long day of travel and my 2 teen aged daughters wanted a lite lunch...we had been on the train, in the rain as well and were bundled up in jeans, caps, scarves and not dressed fine for lunch it must have seemed to him..my Husband did not appreciate the sneer so of course, we left and went out up the street to a corner pub and had delicious fish, chips, burgers and fries. The following morning, we went in for breakfast and the breakfast staff could not have been nicer. Our room was lovely, very squeaky floors, but a lovely suite, very nice sized…"
December 2021,A Fine Experience,"We were booked in by friends, intending to spend three days, (2 nights), together, unfortunately our stay and associated plans were curtailed as a result of the corona-virus. For the brief time that we stayed at Browns Hotel, we enjoyed absolutely first class service from arrival to departure and all points in between. The facility was excellent, the staff were friendly and professional and the food and beverages were well above average and good value. "
January 2022,The very best service,"We had an amazing stay at Brown's, which could have not been the case, considering we were travelling with two very young children - 22 months and 4 months! - and were perhaps being a little over ambitious. Luckily the incredibly warm and professional people working at Brown's saved the day!   Everyone was amazing, but special thanks goes to Theodora for enchanting our daughter, allowing her to walk her round exploring the hotel, and to Dominic who did the same at breakfast meaning we had a little free time to eat our breakfast! Thanks also to Lee for booking us an amazing restaurant on short notice and organising the science museum for a rainy saturday."
January 2022,"Great experience, great location, great stay","Highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for an impeccable, high quality, high standard of service hotel located in central London. The location is absolutely top notch with easy and rapid access to many of central London's best sites and attractions"
December 2021,Family Christmas,"Recently returned from a family Christmas and our first stop was Brown's Hotel in London. I have traveled extensively and normally stay in upscale hotels and this was the best ever! The hotel itself is beautiful, very British, and the restaurant and bar are wonderful. Great location in Mayfair with fine shopping and restaurants in walking distance. What made this hotel so outstanding was the staff. From the moment we arrived, and there were 9 of us, they treated us like royalty! The next morning they knew my grandkids, 16-20yrs, by their first names as well as ours. Truly, I have never had a hotel staff so fabulous! Our rooms were fabulous, we had upgraded for additional space, and my bathroom was great with plenty of space for me and a 16 yr. old teenage girl! I really could go…"
December 2021,Easy Luxury,One of the world's great hotels.  It was so easy to live luxuriously for a few days!  All of the staff; from the lady that cleaned our room to the hotel manager were attentive and friendly; sometimes too much so!
December 2021,Browns Visit 22.12.21,We had a magical trip to Browns and loved every moment of it. The food at Charlies was exceptional and the staff were delightful from arriving to departure. Thanks for a really wonderful memory. We will be back again soon I hope. 
December 2021,The finest hotel in the world,"A truly exceptional place.  The rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and extremely comfortable.  Charlie's (the hotel restaurant) is delicious.  For more importantly though, the staff makes the hotel.  I have never been treated with such kindness and courtesy (and I have traveled extensively for many years).  Each member of the staff -- clerical, housekeeping, food service, and concierge -- was individually excellent.  In combination, they were incomparable.  (Special mention should be made of Lee, Chris, David, and Marco in the concierge office.)  I truly believe this may well be the finest hotel in the world."
December 2021,Fabulous stay!,"We chose this hotel on a whim as Miss Marple (Agatha Christie) stayed here and, we had tea at Brown’s on our honeymoon 31 years ago.  Our stay was wonderful from check-in to check-out.  Everyone was kind, attentive, and considerate.  Our meals at the restaurant and our tea with our children and their partners were delicious and remarkable.  The beds are luxurious and the bathroom is simultaneously modern and classic.  Brown’s is a gem."
December 2021,Amazing hotel and staff,The room was beautiful and the staff very friendly and willing to help with anything. The doorman was always friendly and even advised when it was going to rain.  Breakfast was beautifully cooked and brought to our room. And the beds were just heaven.
December 2021,Classic London charm with touches of modern luxury,The perfect hotel for pre Christmas getaway. Perfect location and the hotel charm really makes your stay. Rooms don’t get any more generous and staff are always welcoming and helpful. Shout out to the Donovan bar staff who always stayed open late for my wife and I. Room was so quiet and comfortable while it felt as if you 
December 2021,Perfect afternoon tea,We had a delicious afternoon today and were looked after beautifully by the lovely staff. We didn't catch their names except for Bianca! The sandwiches were so tasty (and refilled quite a few times) and my husband was delighted with his plant based menu.  The hotel looked stunning with all the Christmas decorations. A really fabulous experience!
December 2021,Best High Tea in London,"While there are many high teas to choose from in London the only one worth going to is one presented by Yonka. Throughout the experience Yonka was excited to share her vast knowledge and expertise with us, which we especially appreciated since this was our first high tea. In addition to the excellent service provided by Yonka the Browns Hotel provided a variety of quality teas and unlimited food. This high tea experience was the absolute highlight of our trip to London."
December 2021,The best hotel in London,"Everything from the doormen, the Conciarge, to the staff in Charlie’s breakfast bar. They’re all incredible. They remember your names and your Childress names. They remember what breakfast you like. The rooms are a great size and the location is perfect for shopping and restaurants. We’ve stayed their 3 times now and will continue to stay there when we visit London. Thank you browns for making our trips special."
December 2021,Afternoon Tea - perfection,Had the most wonderful time at Browns for Christmas afternoon tea. Family friendly and just first class service and food was amazing. Great value and Yonka couldn’t do enough for us. Superb in every way and my favourite afternoon tea. Covid secure. So festive with live entertainment. Thank you to everyone at Browns for making today so special ♥️ and especially Yonka.
October 2021,Consistently outstanding ,"Another superb stay.   This was our fifth stay over the last year, and it’s always consistently outstanding.   As a small, intimate hotel, the public areas are full of various nooks to explore, each with their own distinctive style. It’s incredibly serene and has all the hallmarks of a five star luxury hotel but with the personality of something independently owned, almost akin to The Endsleigh in rural Devon. In winter, roaring fires give the place a country house feel: a chic; sophisticated and polished country house though!  The staff are exemplary, in all areas. Personable and warm, they all take a genuine interest in you, and your stay. Some noticeable differences compared to our last stay: Charlie’s has become significantly more busy, an extension to their small bar…"
October 2021,Consistently excellent,"We had our third stay of the year at Brown's Hotel in October and as per the other two times, the experience was exceptional.   I always find it telling when you return to a hotel for subsequent visits to see if it was as good as last time, or just a one-off. Well Brown's is a consistently wonderful experience.  From the hand written note waiting in our room welcoming us back, to the service in The Drawing Room, it was all flawless.   A special thank you to Dennis for making Brown's our home from home. Can't wait to return again."
November 2021,Mostly a lovely bar and experience,"My partner and I visited the bar for drinks and snacks. Beautiful interior, very stylish and great atmosphere. Lovely drinks. Food was ok with limited vegetarian options. My one criticism is that the staff kept speaking directly to my partner (male); “can I get you anything else Sir” etc, entirely ignoring me (female). I found this bizarre and extremely old fashioned. This is 2021 and frankly embarrassing. Other than this, a lovely venue."
November 2021,Excellent afternoon tea experience,"Everything was splendid and Yonka really made the experience a lifetime memorable event. She was just outstanding, extremely knowledgeable, and very very helpful. Many thanks for the most delightful afternoon!"
November 2021,Brilliant stay,"Brilliant stay for a birthday celebration, we drank and ate all weekend. Food in Charlie’s was delicious, cocktails in Donovan’s were very moreish and Afternoon tea was scrumptious 😀 all the staff were friendly and helpful😀"
November 2021,Exquisite   and delicious afternoon tea with exceptional service from Yonka              ,We had exquisite afternoon tea with delicious sandwiches and cakes. To complete the lovely experience we had superb service from Yonka who described in detail the ingredients and the teas on offer. A special thank you to Yonka who is so helpful and personable.
November 2021,The oldest hotel in London?,"Browns is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Service 8s exceptional from the moment you walk in. Check in is polite   professional and polished.  We stayed in 201 a exemplary suite. Superb nights sleep, huge bathroom  fabulous lounge space. All our hearts desired.  Brown's we'll be back! "
November 2021,"Afternoon Tea, Drawing Room","Excellent afternoon tea - service was superb with polite, knowledgeable staff. Food lived up to expectations, with the pianist providing a classy ambience. Thanks especially to Bianca & Yonka for making the afternoon so memorable."
October 2021,Bucket Trip Hotel,A lovely hotel in a lovely part of London. Everyone was attentive and nice. Standard room was enough (for an English room) though we got upgraded during the stay and that was fabulous.   Highly recommend 
October 2021,Excellent!  We will be back!,"Superb on every level!  The interiors are stunning and cleanliness and presentation impeccable.  By far the best thing though is the staff - each and everyone of them were warm, friendly and obliging - going the extra mile wherever possible.  We even had a chauffeur driven car for our evening dinner out which was a lovely unexpected treat.  We visited all the various dining and bar areas and we had the same great care throughout.  We couldn’t speak more highly of the team at this lovely hotel.  Thank you to all the staff for a memorable and special stay."
October 2021,Browns is elite,"Very good service, great food, very accomodating, doorman was excellent. It was everything we expected, wanted and so much more. Will stay there again and explore the other Rocco Forte hotels around the world."
October 2021,noise level of the room,The noise level of the room looking on the street was so noisy and you can hear all talk at night of the street even so I was on the fourth floor. You need to replace the window of the room or add another glass to prevent the noise.
October 2021,Afternoon tea in the Drawing Room at Brown's Hotel,"We spent a wonderful afternoon in the beautiful,  relaxed drawing room at Brown's Hotel - the occasion was my sister's birthday.  Our host, Yonka, was friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the flavours and origins of the ingredients of our food. The range of teas on offer is vast, and Yonka recommended varieties for us to try. She was generous with her time and very patient - a demanding job carried out effortlessly. The sandwiches and cakes were delicate, delicious and a pleasure to look at. We are so grateful to her and the other staff members, including the brilliant pianist providing memorable but familiar tunes, for making the afternoon so special."
October 2021,Bday in London!,"Amazing stay at the Brown's hotel! Early check-in available ( 9am) , Bday cake upon arrival and room upgrade! We had the best time ever in this beautiful hotel in the heart of London! I strongly recommend!"
September 2021,Our New London Residence.,"Stayed for a special birthday weekend for my wife. Overall a wonderful stay. Brown’s represents an exclusive, but low key Mayfair residence, where you were made to feel like old friends coming to stay. Nothing was too much trouble. You could spot the telltale Polizzi design in elegant touches to the interior & art works. Little extras such as fresh fruit in the room, beautifully plush slippers & a choice of turn down time make all the difference. A particular highlight was The Donovan Bar with it’s original, spectacular cocktails.  We were given a complementary upgrade to one of the suites, which was spectacular.  We can’t wait to book again."
October 2021,Brown's,"Fabulous high end hotel.  Rooms and public spaces very well done, super elegant.  The hotel is well located for all London activities and business. Will certainly return, especially if someone else is paying!"
December 2021,Excellent festive afternoon tea and service,Had festive afternoon tea for 6 of us on Saturday evening. Food was excellent and plentiful with boxes to take away what we couldn’t manage to consume. Zoltan our waiter was fantastic he made it very relaxing and added to the festive atmosphere. We were very impressed and well looked after. Would definitely return.
December 2021,The most perfect hotel in London,"Everything about this hotel is amazing.  The staff go above and beyond to make your stay absolutely perfect.  I stay every year during Christmas time and I would never pick another hotel.   The location is ideal right in the heart of Mayfair, all the shops within walking distance or a short walk to a park."
December 2021,Last year’s Christmas present from family but only just taken,"We have had afternoon tea at numerous hotels in London and elsewhere over the years but Brown’s always comes top of the list even though some have come close. I rang to book a few weeks ago and requested a particular table by a fireplace and had a 2.30 pm place. At the time I spoke to a lady called Bianca who was very helpful. When we arrived today we were greeted by her again and she remembered talking to me. Once again she was superb, very professional but also easy to talk to. All the other staff we encountered were also excellent. Fabulous visit, thanks very much."
December 2021,The right way to tea!,"What a fabulous treat!  We went for a late afternoon tea   The food was amazing. Our waitress was wonderful. She explained all the teas and recommended a few. Her name was Yonka. She even persuaded me to try something other than my usual Earl Grey.  The rest of the staff was also very welcoming and everyone went out of their way to make the experience special. And for entertain we thoroughly enjoyed the pianist Ian Gomes. He stepped over to our table for a chat and played our requests. All in all, it was a perfect way to spend our last evening in London. Do go, you won’t be disappointed."
November 2021,Mr and Mrs L,We had our 10 year wedding anniversary here and spent 2 nights being totally spoilt. Fantastic location and amazing service . Cocktails were incredible and the atmosphere was fun and relaxed!  Definitely somewhere to come again
November 2021,Lovely to be cosseted,"The rooms were comfortable and welcoming. All the staff were polite,welcoming and friends. The atmosphere was warm and friendly. Charlie’s restaurant was buzzy and the food was good. Jesus Adorno was a marvellous host. "
October 2021,Great sleep,"Stayed here for one night and it was very comfortable and the sleep quality very good. All the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and courteous. My only ""complaint"" was that the bath was very slippery and there wasn't a mat to put in the bath to stop accidents - but that aside the room was very nice and comfortable, there was even a walk-in wardrobe."
October 2021,Wonderful High Tea,"We had a traditional and wonderful High tea at Brown’s Hotel thanks to Bianca and Karol.   they have been very helpful, smiling and professional.  They made one of my dream come true and I will cherish this moment for a long time. The food was delicious and we appreciated to have some more sandwiches . the place has not changed since the 80s and that’s what I wanted to feel. Thank you"
October 2021,A touch of class,"As a special treat (25th wedding anniversary) we visited Browns for afternoon tea. Yonka was our main waitress and she was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. To be honest all the front of house staff we meet were just lovely.   We started with rose champagne which was so good followed by a huge selection of wonderful tea's, a good selection of finger sandwich (the prawns ones were to die for) and delightful cream tea followed by cake we left a few pounds heavier than when we arrived. The live piano playing, quiet atmosphere made this a very special and memorable occasion.  I can't recommend Browns highly enough."
October 2021,Lovely afternoon,Visited today as a birthday gift. Attended the spa which was first class Followed by afternoon tea. Was so nice that you could have extra sandwiches as I don’t really have a sweet tooth. Staff were all so lovely and we were served mainly by Yonka who was so informative and attentive. Lovely ambiance very relaxing afternoon. Came away with a lovely box of cakes would highly recommend
November 2021,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel provides excellent customer service in a very central London position. The rooms are wonderful, spacious and beautifully decorated and furnished. Afternoon tea was delicious and dinner and breakfast in Charlie's was very enjoyable. I would definitely go back."
November 2021,Afternoon tea is amazing,"Afternoon tea at Browns is a wonderful experience. The food is delicious and the teas (25 to choose from!)  are incredible. Expertly guided by Yonka, we were delighted with everything we had to eat and drink. It was a relaxing experience, made even more enjoyable by the pianist."
November 2021,Fabulous,"Stayed for one night in an executive room. Started off with Sunday lunch in Charlies, where the surroundings, staff and food were all excellent. The staff at check in were superb and the room was lovely and comfortable. A traditional full English Breakfast set us up for the day. This was only topped off by the fact this was a delayed competition prize i won via Town and Country House Magazine in 2020, so all free! "
November 2021,Amazing experience,Yonka and her colleagues made our day! Took my daughter as a treat  to give her a real afternoon tea experience and Browns didn't disappoint. The sandwiches and cakes were amazing and the 26 varietie of tea is impressive. Thank you to all the staff at Browns.
September 2021,Concierge Extraordinaire,"Staying at Brown's hotel feels like coming home. The team of Concierge's; David, Leigh, Marco created an experience to remember. The teams suggestions, reservations, information and expert guides were at the highest level. One warm sunny day I was already in Hyde Park and they called to suggest a picnic hamper and delivered it to the edge of Hyde Park. The ability to secure reservations at the top restaurants, find a Royal Horticulturist to visit Kew Gardens and Savill gardens at Windsor made a memorable impression. The newest and oldest museum shows and small esoteric Handel to Hendrix museum were fantastic as well as a visit to Buckingham Palace gardens. The night manager Antonello, the front desk Francesca, everyone was so kind and helpful and fun. The experience they curate…"
October 2021,Rude Unfriendly staff . Poor service. Save ur money,My family visited for the overpriced afternoon tea. 50 per head without alcohol. The orange juice was one of the worst I’ve had and had chunks of oranges inside which I nearly choked on. When I informed of this I was told ‘ it’s a freshly squeezed orange juice and it’s like that’ like I’ve never had an orange juice before 🤣 just accept the feedback the juice was crap and try improve it. We were made to cramp up on a tiny table despite there being other tables available and we did ask to move as other tables were available  however the staff was most unhelpful and arrogant and refused to accommodate. When the bill was presented despite us handing 2 prepaid vouchers for champagne we were charged for the same. When we pointed this out the arrogant staff pulling a face went and…
October 2021,Service not that great!,My friend and I attended for afternoon tea but unfortunately the service was not that great. The hostess was friendly but the fuss given was a little too over the top. She then asked my friend what Champagne she would like but forgot to ask me. My friends champagne was served and I was left with an empty glass. I then had to ask another member of staff for my Champagne. Its no big deal but when your paying £150 for a few scones and stale sandwiches then am afraid it is. Our table was then left uncleared at the end and my box of cakes were then taken to another table its the small things that matter. Im afraid to say I was disapointed. I have had a few nice afternoon teas in london with professional switched in service but on this occassion at Browns Hotel was a big …
September 2021,Afternoon Tea - Amazing,"I treated my sister to a belated Birthday afternoon tea and wanted something traditional with great service.  They did not let us down.  Ive forgotten the ladies name and the waiters but they were all out standing nothering too much trouble, made sure we had a great afternoon and even organised a cake for my sister and the piano playing happy Birthday.    Then when we asked at reception about the Graham Bell room the wonderful young man showed us the room and told us the history of the hotel.   if you want a great place for a wonderful trear then forget the Ritz and come here"
September 2021,Afternoon Tea,"A belated birthday trip for afternoon tea in the Drawing Room. The service was fantastic, very friendly, sandwiches delicious, cakes and scones so tasty. A great way to celebrate a special occasion. The interior is lovely with a pianist playing, the ambience was wonderful."
September 2021,"Wow, a true 5 star experience","We stayed at Browns for one night to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and it was brilliant from start to end. We were made to feel welcome and special from the moment we arrived. Nothing was too much trouble, the little finishing touches were great. The doormen and concierge were always available to help and always have a smile. Our room was big, bright, sumptuously comfortable with a huge bed and was very quiet considering you're in Central London. Dinner at Charlie's was delicious, Paul was such a good host and is an asset to Browns. The extra touches given to us to help us celebrate our anniversary were thoughtful and very much appreciated.  The pianist was fantastic too. Safe to say, we will be back - well done Browns!"
August 2021,Afternoon Tea at the Drawing Room,"Gorgeous setting steeped in history.  The afternoon tea was probably a 4/5 but the prawn sandwich and carrot cake were 6/5, yummy! Best of all, ALL the staff were super knowledgable, friendly, accommodating and all round professional. Special shout out to Bianca.  Would highly recommend."
September 2021,Great Location At A Historic Stylish Hotel,"We’ve stayed at other Rocco Forte hotels. The company chooses fabulous historic buildings and then does an amazing job in designing the interiors with unique style. Browns is a wonderful hotel and appeals to all the senses:  Food and drink - wonderful bar which was just renovated at the Donovan bar Delicious breakfast in a spectacularly decorated room (imagine Jungle book upscale) Charlie’s  Room- we requested quiet and it was beautifully appointed with extremely comfortable bed, lovely bedding and very quiet  The hotel had a subtle scent which was very pleasant. As far as service goes - the hotel manager was very professional and charming Check in was easy Concierges are some of the best in London. They arranged all the Covid tests and fantastic dinner recommendations as well…"
September 2021,Amazing time in this stylish hotel!,"We’ve absolutely loved staying in the hotel! It’s beautiful, super stylish, clean and the staff very friendly and accommodating, from the reception to the restaurant and door man Givi- very friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend to anyone!"
September 2021,Best of British,"From the moment you are greeted, everything about Brown’s is the Best of British. Sophisticated, elegant and refined. I cannot speak highly enough about the service. Calm, friendly and efficient. Rooms are beautiful, food delicious and in my view, the best location in London."
July 2021,Afternoon Tea @ Browns,"It’s reputation as the original and best is well deserved!  Beautiful setting, lovely staff and more top quality sandwiches, cakes and tea than you can finish.  Took my wife for her birthday and she was very happy!  Well worth a trip this summer as tables that normally need to be booked months in advance are readily available.  Top tip: don’t eat anything for lunch and fo in hungry!"
July 2021,Excellent service and exceptional style,An unexpected gem. Impromptu visit on a swelteringly hot day in London. A smiling welcome set the tone. The service was exemplary and the quality of the drinks and food matched. We wIll be returning again.
July 2021,"Best staff,  exemplary service!","I have traveled all over Europe and the United States and it’s not easy to find outstanding service from every aspect of a hotel.  Browns delivers on all fronts!  Clearly it starts at the top with the manager Dennis and trickles down to every single employee from the room service server to housekeeping to the front doorman. All are kind, helpful and willing to go the extra mile.   In addition to the fabulous employees, the location of the hotel is also fabulous! So many amazing shops on Bond Street and, a few doors down is the delicious Isabel restaurant.  Piccadilly and Soho are just a quick walk away.    Browns hotel delivers in spades! It’s a five star hotel all the way around! We will definitely be back."
July 2021,Mrs Julie Byrne,"Fortunate enough to attend Wimbledon. Spent 2 nights.  Could not fault hotel. Staff very friendly, helpful, and professional.  There was a lovely  atmosphere within the hotel. The attention to detail with arrival welcome drink, fresh strawberries in room and even water and travel sweets in our car on departure was very thoughtful. Location of hotel is excellent for visiting London.  Highly  recommend hotel and we shall revisit again soon.  So lovely to have some normality again."
July 2021,Fantastic hotel and location,"Just outstanding. The hotel, location and staff were all perfect. We had come off the back of 2 failed attempts to get away to celebrate a wedding anniversary due to Covid restrictions. So London.  The hotel is old school grandeur. Nothing is too much trouble. Sedate but the job is done. In short we loved it. Will be back. ps. the restaurant is very good. "
July 2021,The most amazing hotel!,"This was honestly the best hotel experience we’ve ever had.   Our wedding needed to be postponed so we decided to stay here instead to treat ourselves on the day. The Guest Experience Manager, Dennis, was amazing at making sure our day was still special and went above and beyond for us with his impeccable service and generosity.   We stayed in the Signature Suite and what am incredible suite it was (pictured)! We’d also highly recommend booking in a spa treatment and a table at the on site restaurant and bar as they were all lovely additions to our stay.   Very much looking to return here very soon!"
June 2021,Wonderful Night at Brown`s,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were treated to exceptional service. Every single person made us feel special and more importantly for me made my 11 year old feel special. The room was ready for us after our breakfast and what a room, gifts for our son and strawberry's for my wife and I.  We used room service for an afternoon snack and had drinks in the bar before having dinner in the hotel restaurant, all was lovely and again exceptional service.  The final treat was when we got our car bought round by the doorman and inside the car were sweets and bottles of water for the trip home. Probably one of the best nights i have ever had in a hotel and one i plan to repeat soon."
June 2021,Perfect afternoon tea in our favourite Brown's Hotel,"On the 7.6.21 I had a friend visiting me in London for just 3 hours and I tried to arrange an unforgettable time, she will look back for many months to come.   I have been to Brown's several times for afternoon tea before it was always a great experience. I was so glad to managed to book up for afternoon tea, I must say  congratulations  you have the best staff Yonka looked after us and my friend is a first class cabin crew she was so impressed with Yonkas knowledge of teas and she even explained about the famous bar in the Browns Hotel she was outstanding. The conversation was flawless and very interesting. The Quality of the sandwiches breathtaking the cakes super delicious we had an amazing time and I was so glad I found the perfect place for my friend to visit in this short…"
June 2021,Anniversary celebration ,"Visited Browns for a 25th anniversary celebration on the 26th of June 2021. I'll start by saying we have stayed at quite a few 5* hotels, but Browns comes out on top easily. From the moment we arrived, every single staff member made us feel welcomed. We were fortunate to be offered an upgrade to a junior suite, and treated to wine and a celebration cake on top of other exemplary touches throughout our stay. I can not thank all the staff enough for their courtesy and help throughout our stay, the quality of the hotel,  the rooms, and to the history of the establishment. We look forward to return as soon as possible."
June 2021,"Exquisite comfort, food and service ","We were lucky enough to win a stay at two Rocco Forte hotels, one being Brown's. We had planned a visit to the Alice exhibition at the V&A so it was a perfect opportunity to combine the two. What a great experience. A week prior to our  visit Dennis contacted us to anticipate our stay, and from that moment the staff at Brown's could not do enough for us. We met Dennis upon arrival, and he'd remembered what we had planned, which made us feel really valued. He had organised some kind gifts for my daughter and we were upgraded to a suite. When we returned after a busy day out he was interested in what we had done.  Everywhere was totally spotless. The decor and furnishings were beautiful and comfortable and the bathroom spacious. The hotel is steeped in history. And the breakfast!…"
August 2021,Baby friendly great visit,"We stayed with our 1 year old son and we were all made to feel most welcome! Whilst the chauffeured Bentley isn't available at the moment, the hotel is really well placed for parks and shopping. We were upgraded to a junior suite and the hotel provided a baby bath, cot, toys, baby products and much more. He loved it and we felt at home. We were also made welcome in the restaurant for our meals and the staff went out of their way to ensure our son was happy. Recommended for a luxury baby friendly holiday. Thank you to the hotel team!"
August 2021,Wonderful,"From the moment we arrived we were made welcome by the doorman, luggage taken straight to our beautiful, comfortable Junior suite.   The large room had every amenity and so quiet.  The front of house staff were exceptional.  They went out of their way to make our stay special.  It was an amazing experience.  Breakfast was perfect and the ambiance of the room made it relaxing with fresh flowers abundant throughout.  We cannot fault Brown's hotel."
August 2021,A five star home from home,"Many hotels claim to offer a home from home. Browns is the real thing - warm, personal and friendly from first contact to departure -   five star service and facilities as expected at this price, but without the aloofness which sometimes goes with. Room was generously sized, pleasantly decorated and very comfortable, with a huge bathroom. As an older woman travelling alone I was neither patronised nor made to feel out of place in the lively bar.  Lovely treatment in the small but perfectly formed spa.  Delicious food and an excellent choice of wine by the glass in Charlies restaurant. Special shout out to Joao in reservations, to Concierge Chris for dining out suggestions  and to the bar manager on Friday evening for their attentive service. I will definitely be back."
August 2021,Afternoon Tea,I went for an afternoon tea at Browns with friends. I have had afternoon tea here many times before this recent visit did not disappoint. Staff are very attentive without being obtrusive. Finger sandwiches are beautiful & fresh with a lovely range of fillings. We were offered additional sandwiches & couldn’t refuse! Scones were light & delicious with the jam & clotted cream. There was a really nice selection of cakes with two standouts- a vanilla & almond choux bun & a chocolate cherry tart. I wish I’d got the names of the staff that served us as they were both so lovely & helpful- nothing was too much trouble. Oh & you can try as many teas as you like to accompany your afternoon tea! Another wonderful experience at Browns to be repeated.
August 2021,Amazing experience,"We had an amazing experience with Angela M, she is such a lovely person and made our evening a pleasurable time. Totally recommend this place.  We loved the puddings and the atmosphere. Great place to eat and drink"
August 2021,Faultless,Faultless ! Every member of staff was exceptional and the service outstanding . The room had great power shower and separate bath . Perfect location in Mayfair . I will definitely be returning with hope of being able to use the spa facilities .
August 2021,"A wonderful experience of customer service which goes the extra mile, and staff who enabled us to have a wonderful stay","We were made to feel special from the moment we arrived at Brown’s Hotel, from the glass of champagne, to an upgraded room, to the concierge service arranging cars from the station and back from the show we saw. Nothing but as too much, impeccable service on every level. We felt cared for the entire time of our stay"
August 2021,"Tranquility, luxury, fine fare and personal service","An overnight stay to celebrate a ""big"" birthday. Could not have been a better memory! Made welcome from the moment of arrival to our departure. Upgrade room to a suite - decor discerning and calming. From afternoon tea, dinner in Charlies to a sumptious breakfast - absolutely first class cuisine and look forward to going back to Charlies. Can't recommend highly enough"
August 2021,Beautiful hotel with attentive service without being to ostentatious.,"Stayed at Browns for three nights and didn’t disappoint. A luxury hotel in the middle of Mayfair and it had everything you would expect from a hotel of this standing.  A special thank you to George, the doorman, who every morning was there to greet us and ensure we had everything in hand for the day.  We happen to bump into Stuart Johnson the managing director of the hotel in the lift who was friendly and welcome and interested in our experience of the hotel ."
July 2021,Midweek break,"A wonderful 5 star experience. It’s a beautiful hotel staffed by an excellent team who looked after us so well. Delicious breakfast, and wonderful cocktails in Donovan’s bar. We’ll definitely be back."
September 2021,Just so fantastic to be back in this special hotel for a night's stay,"What a treat - familiar friendly faces from the moment I pulled up outside and it was soo good to be back in this lovely special place.  THE most comfortable beds we have ever slept in, service wonderful as ever, ditto the welcome, and a delicious cooked breakfast the next morning completed a truly wonderful stay after far too long thanks to the pandemic...  SO good to be back thank you"
September 2021,Weekend at the Brown’s,"Well deserved 5 stars for a top class experience. Professional Team, flawless organisation, Michelin starred cooked. Strongly recommended for a stay in London for any possible reason. Special thanks to Dennis to organise a tailored super experience."
September 2021,Birthday weekend trip,"It was our daughter’s 6th birthday and we wanted to spend a weekend in London and celebrate and make her feel extra special. From making the booking the entire team, Dennis(head of guest experience) Francesca (reception), Cassandra (reservations)were fantastic. They would respond to my every email with full details. On arrival, the valet was ready to take our car, the luggage was taken to our room, we were greeted by the team and GM- such a honour given to my daughter. We were also upgraded to the beautiful deluxe room with all the amenities that made both my children 6yr old and ten month old baby so very happy. This hotel is perfect for those with children as every detail for children is so well thought of- with children’s play activities, bath facilities, alby the monkey…"
September 2021,True Hospitality Professionals,"Absolutely tremendous weekend at Browns.  This hotel is blessed with superb hospitality professionals - the epitome of excellence and friendliness.  It’s a great location, the bedrooms and public rooms are lovely and it’s a size of hotel that means it has a very personal feel to it.    Couldn’t recommend it highly enough and plan to return before Christmas."
August 2021,"A marvellous, luxurious hotel.","Browns’s hotel is  situated in the heart of Mayfair. From the moment you meet the door man, your stay will be steered by the excellent staff. Everyone wants to make your stay the best it could be, the service is friendly but very professional.   Our room overlooking Albemarle street & the Royal Arcade was spacious with an extremely comfortable king size bed and a large ensuite bathroom. The road was quiet there was very little noise during the night & in the early morning.   Breakfast was wonderful., we did not order from the set menus but asked for specific items. It was beautifully cooked & served. Service in the restaurant was also superb being extremely attentive . We enjoyed a simple lunch in the bar, the salmon tartlets were to die for, a thin pastry case with small tubes…"
August 2021,Favourite Place in London for Afternoon Tea,"I'm an American but after 14 years here a Londoner now, too.  Brown's is my favourite place for afternoon tea.  Have been with friends, my children, and guests visiting from overseas.  Always a lovely experience.  It is not ostentatious yet very indulgent.  Yonka served us last week and made our special occasion even more special.  All the staff are both professional and warm.  The chairs and sofas are super comfy.  We felt a treat but also at home.  The decor is quirky, elegant and cozy.  A pianist provides music and in winter they've got fires roaring.  We were able to try different teas: some go better with the savoury sandwiches, then something lighter for the desserts. We liked the Ceylon tea the best. The vegan sandwiches and cakes were as delectable as the rest -- …"
August 2021,"Indulgent and amazing hotel, just the perfect stay","From the moment We stepped  into the hotel we were overwhelmed by the welcoming and courteous staff, I don’t think they could be any better ! We were offered champagne, and escorted to our beautiful, room, on the second floor, I wasn’t the most expensive room but it was perfect and didn’t reflect in anyway how we were treated by any member of staff. Our room was immaculate, couldn’t fault it in any way, large king size bed sitting area, desk, large wardrobe, slippers and robes, also a safe for those valuables you might want to leave behind while you shop or eat out, But I have to say you will want to eat here the food in the main restaurant was wonderful, and I love good food. I had the most perfect Dover sole, many thanks to the chef !! We had a very busy itinerary over our…"
August 2021,Absolutely fantastic hotel and staff,"First time staying here  and what a fantastic time we had. Our junior suite was so lovely and spacious with a great bathroom. It felt like returning home everytime we came back into the hotel. All the staff were fantastic, and made us feel special, especially Chris (concierge) who sorted some tourist attraction tickets out for us, Matt (doorman), and Dennis (guest experience). Dinner and breakfast in Charlie's were great and we also enjoyed our cocktails in Donovan's bar. Can't wait to return."
August 2021,Simply the best,Just completed another great stay at Browns. I love this place. Beautiful hotel in a perfect  location in the centre of Mayfair but in a quiet street of Piccadilly.  Service here is as good as it gets. Run by a team of well trained and very friendly staff who know their job & do it extremely well without any unnecessary fuss or pomp ( sometimes encountered in top brands). A true five star experience
August 2021,Anniversary Weekend,From the moment we arrived the warm welcome from the Staff was amazing. Our luggage was immediately  taken to our beautiful Junior Suite. A lovely personal anniversary welcome card and bottle of Champagne with a lovely cake were awaiting us. The room was immaculate and exceeded our expectations. We arrived back in the room in the evening to find the bed and bathroom covered in beautiful Red Rose Petals. Afternoon Tea was a wonderful experience  that we highly recommend and thoroughly enjoyed. Outstanding Staff Exceptional attention to detail and very highly recommended. We will most definitely be returning.
June 2021,Afternoon Tea,"We loved our afternoon tea at Browns today. Yonka, a most informative, lovely lady made the whole experience extremely memorable. Describing herself as a ‘Tea Sommelier’, she introduced us to teas from her extensive tea library, that complimented each part of our journey through the Chef’s exquisite sandwiches, scones, preserves and cakes."
June 2021,50th Birthday celebration,"My husband and I recently had a stay at Browns Hotel to celebrate my 50th birthday. I have to commend the hotel as their attention to detail was just superb, their care and kindness in the way we were treated was beyond any expectation we had had, we left feeling truly thought of and totally satisfied that my special weekend was really taken into consideration. I shall from now on consider Browns Hotel  as my first point of call for any other celebratory events. The welcoming and personal touch that we had bestowed upon us from every member of staff throughout our stay was really appreciated and very touching. A special thank you to George and Francesca for taking care such good of us as soon as we arrived from then on our stay just got better and better. Mr and Mrs Ferguson"
June 2021,Superb from the moment you walk in...,"A wonderful place to stay, a luxury hotel with truly wonderful staff, great food and that something extra - an authentic desire to give you a fabulous visit and to create great memories. I have stayed here on four occasions over the past couple of years and it has just got better and better. My first choice when stashing up in town."
May 2021,Relaxing Afternoon,"Lovely afternoon/evening spent with friends. The food was good. Our waitress Miriam was attentive and knowledgeable about the wine. Would recommend to friends. Looking forward to our next visit. We was able to sit outside as it was the weather was good,"
May 2021,Beyond outstanding ,"This has firmly become our home away from home. It’s, quite simply, the best hotel in London. What makes Brown’s so exemplary? The understated, yet sophisticated decor; the sublime food and experimental cocktails. But, it’s the staff which elevate this beyond any other hotel in the UK. On the back of lockdown you’d excuse a slip in standards. Not here. Service is personable, friendly and warm. Each member of staff shines, making your stay beyond perfect. A special mention to Abigail in Charlie’s who is quite simply an outstanding restaurant manager. Her personable, yet professional, manner makes her stand out, I can’t think of anyone else who has made me feel so special, anywhere. And, Dennis who oversees multiple stays, ensuring we are looked after. His dedication to provide…"
May 2021,Exceptional level of service,"From the moment we arrived the service was nothing short of exceptional. The team at Brown’s made us feel so welcome through our stay. George Hiley-Jones was the very example of what others should aspire to be and do in the luxury hospitality industry.  We were very kindly upgraded to a junior suite which was fantastic. Asked for a late checkout and ""yes"" came back immediately, none of this ""tap tap tap"" on  the computer to see if they could accommodate. They even serviced the room for us during the day of our late checkout to make sure we had everything we needed.  One of my favourite things was getting my shoes shined overnight, and finding them the next morning outside the door in their own leather bound box. Details matter.  We had lunch each day of our stay at the hotel and…"
June 2021,Great return,"I just spent last weekend at Brown’s - first time since lockdown and it was so nice to go back to all the familiar faces, the unbeatable service, nothing was too much trouble, the exquisite food, the superb atmosphere in the bar, and even the weather was good! This is such a great hotel, a perfect mix of extreme luxury with a relaxed atmosphere. It was a perfect break and Stuart Johnson, John McLean, Alex Wilson and all their teams are the consummate hosts and work very hard for all their guests."
May 2021,"Great Service, Food and Staff.",My wife and I stayed at Browns to celebrate my wife's important birthday. The hotel was fantastic at giving us plenty of memories to cherish  A really upmarket hotel but in no way snobbish.  I managed to get a 3 nights for the price of 2 deal. Expensive but worth every penny.  I cannot recommend highly enough everything about this hotel. Staff food and service were fantastic.
May 2021,The best hotel in London.,"From our first greeting upon arrival through to departure, our two nights spent at Browns were absolutely wonderful. All the team made us feel so welcome. The hotel has a real home from home feel and our children were treated to some lovely surprises. We will certainly be re- visiting again. The best location and hotel in London. Thank you Browns."
April 2021,So good to be back!,"The lockdown has been hard for so many people and the thought of a break away has kept us going for months. Brown’s hotel has always been our chosen hotel when we visit London and we could not wait to go back. It lived up to our expectations and exceeded them! As always we were greeted at the door, luggage taken care of and a glass of champagne during a swift check in. Everyone was following the government social distancing guidelines and wearing face masks however they still made us feel at ease and relaxed throughout our visit. Every member of staff took time to speak to us, check we had everything we needed and seemed genuinely pleased to be welcoming guests back to the hotel. I can not imagine how hard the last year has been for the staff and thank them all from the bottom…"
October 2020,Fantastic experience from start to finish,Wow what can we say ! We had the pleasure of staying at this hotel over the weekend with our son.  We were greeted at the door by John and made to feel so welcome.  We had let them know that it was his birthday and so when we arrived they had placed a cake in our room for him along with a play station for his use.  The service throughout the hotel was impeccable and the staff really could not do enough to help.  The staff member who kindly served us both mornings was amazing and she even arranged a takeaway cup with tea for my tea obsessed husband to enjoy.  She really was outstanding.  Theodora on reception was very helpful and managed to secure us a table at a rooftop restaurant for dinner - no mean feat on a Saturday evening.  If you ever get the chance please do try Browns…
October 2020,Fantastic stay at Browns,"We had a really lovely weekend at Browns. We stayed two nights to celebrate my wife’s birthday. From check in with champagne, to check out all was very well done. We had a complementary celebration gift delivered to our room in the form of a bottle of champagne and birthday cake which we were both very pleased to receive. I would recommend dining at the restaurant as it was a great meal with perfect service and a delightful room. The thing that sets Browns apart from the other 5-star luxury hotels is the staff. You get the full 5-star service but in a more friendly and human way. Looking forward to our next visit"
October 2020,Amazing stay at Browns!,"Browns was absolutely gorgeous, with impeccable service and in a prime location in Mayfair, really can't fault it. We enjoyed a delicious meal in Charlie's restaurant and received a double upgrade to a very spacious Junior Suite!"
October 2020,Outstanding Service,"I stayed at Brown’s last week for a business and leisure trip - I had delays to my transport getting into London which made me late for meetings and when I arrived at Brown’s they took care of everything  I was met at the door by Luca who whisked me to reception to check in where I was also offered a glass of fizz! Just what I needed!  I wanted some food before I headed out to meetings, Luca arranged for me to go to the bar and took my order before I went to the room. By the time I came back to the bar my food was waiting....now that is service!! The bar team looked after me incredibly well, especially Martina!  Housekeeping were brilliant the rooms are so spacious and full of character. Breakfast was simply divine and the service was warm and friendly.   The rooms, the decor,…"
October 2020,Out of this World - Best in London!!!,"The moment we stepped out of the taxi and in to this hotel we were treated like royalty!   We were met by John at the door who showed us to reception, we were checked-in by Luca who was warm, friendly and gave us all the information we needed. We were made to feel very special with a glass of champagne before we went to our room!  The room was perfect, a lovely street view, beautiful deign and we were given some brilliant treats to enjoy in the room. The room was spotlessly clean, we had evening service on both nights and on the first night a beautiful romantic touch of rose petals was left - simply stunning  The restaurant was outstanding, Abigail looked after us throughout the evening, her team were faultless. The food was divine, some of the best food I think we have had all…"
October 2020,Fabulous Suite & Experience ,"We are fortunate enough to have stayed in a most 5* hotels in London but Browns made us feel like celebrities with their welcome hospitality and expert customer service.   The Donovan Bar made both cocktails on request as well as listed specials which were delicious. Frederico looked after us and made the experience one to spend the evening sipping his concoctions.   Our suite was divine. Spotless but not clinical in these current times and a proper home from home in the heart of Mayfair.  Alex was super friendly remembering our name and sorting out our every request and John on the door was a delight and a credit to them.  Breakfast was equally special and relaxing, all in all a superb experience that I would highly recommended. Thank you Browns for looking after us so well and…"
October 2020,Mrs Linda Howell and daughter Emilie,The moment we stepped into Browns we experienced warmth and friendliness. From the welcome drink to being shown around the hotel and on to our suite. Nothing was too much trouble. I was very impressed at the care for my daughter 7 months pregnant...checking that the food cooking was suitable for her. Thank you Browns for a memorable stay  Linda Howell
September 2020,Par Excellence!!,"This year I celebrated my 60th birthday and like so many others my plans had been completely annihilated by Covid19.   Therefore my partner John arranged for me to celebrate the big day at Browns Hotel.  I'm not sure where to start but I can safely say I had the most memorable stay.  First, hassle free arrival! Car taken care of luggage swept away, beautiful flowers in our room, birthday wishes from everyone on the day, birthday cake at breakfast and then champagne and chocolate cake later in the day.  The entire team could not have done more to make us feel welcome and at home.  Then of course there was the most delicious Sunday roast the day of our arrival (the best Sunday roast I have ever had).  Breakfast is an indulgence at Browns. fresh pancakes or the full monty whatever…"
October 2020,A wonderful London adventure,"Bags packed, glad rags on, ready for birthday trip to Brown’s. A brief drive into London and we arrived, dropped the keys with George, who greeted us at the door. The room was actually a suite and upon arriving at door 419, we were greeted with a broad, beautiful, well furnished entrance room and a bedroom with a huge bed and a bathroom well stocked with anything we may need. An oasis before taking a walk up and down New Bond Street even with a face mask on.   Donovan’s Bar beckoned for cocktail (try the Spicy 50) and meeting our friends there before Charlie’s, Browns restaurant, which we had booked a few weeks earlier (lucky we had, it was busy). The service was very attentive without being overbearing but the food was the reason we were there and we were not let down. A glass…"
January 2020,Exquisite ,"A beautiful hotel, stylishly appointed with discreet, efficient and friendly service. Situated in the heart of Mayfair with shopping, theatre and restaurants all within easy walking distance. The hotel’s Donovan bar is fun and lively and a great place to meet friends and enjoy their delicious cocktails. Highly recommended."
January 2020,A very special birthday,I  arrived at Brown's feeling quite stressed and within  minutes could  feel  myself relaxing The  lunch was excellent The service was  everything you could want The afternoon tea was  brilliant The treatment in the spa very  very  relaxing The Suite was lovely
January 2020,Exemplary Customer Service,"I found out last minute that a friend of mine was staying at the Brown's over their birthday. So in the middle of the night I reached out to see if they could organize a last minute in-room birthday celebration.  Despite the inappropriate hour for the request, Dennis and his team happily went to work orchestrating a beautiful birthday surprise, complete with themed balloons, a hand written card, pastries, and champagne to mark the occasion. It was truly better than what I could have pieced together. My friend was surprised and elated by the gesture, and more so impressed that Dennis and his team were able to pull it off at zero hour.   This hotel absolutely has earned their five star merit! I will continue to highly recommend to anyone traveling to London."
January 2020,Facial treatment at The Spa at Brown’s Hotel,"I booked myself for a Irene Forte 60 minutes facial. What a wonderful experience - my therapist Karmini has fantastic hands. I arrived at the spa after a busy stressful day, tired and with my mind still working 1000 thoughts per minute. 10 minutes into the facial, I felt so relaxed, and with my mind only focusing on Karmini’s hands and techniques. As the facial progressed, I found myself dozing off into a deep, soothing sleep.  The products smell amazing, and the facial massage was done so rhythmical, so soothing, that it completely made me forget about the stress and worries of work. My skin was cleansed, exfoliated, massaged and moisturised, and it had a healthy glow at the end of the treatment.  If you wish to visit this spa for a treatment, do ask for Karmini! "
December 2019,Incredible Experience,"With previous experience staying at Rocco Forte's Hotel de Russie in Rome, the Brown's Hotel did not disappoint. The rooms were spacious and the staff were nothing but friendly. The concierge helped my family and I to acquire tickets to shows that we thought were sold out for that week, which was much appreciated. The hotel itself is quaint, which makes it all the more lovely. The bar downstairs, Donovan's, is also a great place to have a drink before dinner or to just enjoy a cappuccino. When we return to London for another trip, we will definitely be staying at Brown's again."
January 2020,Excellent dinner.,"Many thanks for another amazing evening at Browns.  The food was delicious and the service efficient and friendly without being intrusive.  None of that gastly ""Everything to your liking sir?"".    Well done Browns."
January 2020,The incredible afternoon tea at Browns,"A wonderful lady called Yonka served us the most incredible afternoon tea at Brown’s Hotel on Friday the 18th of January. The staff were incredibly welcoming and the attention to detail that you receive  on the various teas on offer is astounding! The Michelin star chef’s selection of sandwiches and treats were first class. Home-made strawberry jam served with the fluffiest scones, the new Tea Tox Selection of healthy treats is also fantastic. The most amazing vegetable curry treat with onion bhaji set on top is delicious. The most amazing humous and beetroot treat was sensational as was a wonderful take on a ploughman’s  sandwich mixed with a Waldorf salad.  All sublime. My weakness was the carrot cake which I have rarely tasted better. The best thing about the afternoon tea…"
January 2020,One Night Grand,"Once again Brown’s never fails to please. Still one of my favourite hotels in the world. Always beautiful and elegant. Rooms are always immaculate, staff ever helpful and food a delight. It really is the best location in central London. This trip we went to the theatre but sometimes I would stay there as so close to all the top stores with the best shopping. Missed John the door man this time. My son is 16 now and probably too old for the gold chocolate coins anyhow!! Thanks for the upgrade Brown’s! "
December 2019,Amazing luxury : Unforgettable experience,"I spent a few days in London with my aunt and stayed at Brown's hotel. I completely felt in love with this hotel, everything was amazing: beautiful room, wonderful setting and atmosphere, the staff were friendly, helpful and courteous. It was so welcome from the time we arrived to the time we left. It was my first trip to London and it could't have gone better thanks to Brown's Hotel and Rocco Forte Company! If you want to make your trip to London unforgettable this is the place where you have to go!   See you soon"
December 2019,Outstanding Brown’s!,"We spent 3 days in London staying at the Brown’s. We had a remarkable dinner at Charlie’s and we enjoyed an unforgettable British afternoon Tea in The Drawing Room at Brown’s. Above all our expectations is the staff: discrete, kind, welcoming, professional. Our daughter was entertained with an adorable treasure hunt, lovely books and gadgets. She really enjoyed moving around with confidence under the discrete surveillance of the staff. Every detail in the hotel is very well thought of. There is nothing that I can think of that was not top level, including service and cleaning. Indeed, we truly appreciated the elegant and magic atmosphere at Brown’s! We definitely look forward to visiting again!!"
October 2020,A fabulous escape ,"What better way to escape the rain than an overnight stay at our London residence. Warmly welcomed by George, we were delighted to return and were soon sipping champagne in our stylish yet homely suite and looking forward to friends joining us for dinner at Charlie’s.  Brown’s have adapted quietly and elegantly to the Covid19 regulations. Staff were wearing see-through masks so the personal connection wasn’t lost, a touch free sanitiser dispenser was brought to our table in Donovan’s bar, contact details were taken and QR codes for menus provided seamlessly and with no interference in our enjoyment of the atmosphere or interruption to our conversation.  After pre dinner drinks in a buzzing Donovan’s, we moved to Charlie’s where Jean-Luca and Tito looked after us brilliantly and…"
December 2020,Never lets you down,"It isn't the cheapest hotel in London but it's certainly the best and you do really feel the benefit of paying a bit more. I have stayed several times, and across the Rocco Forte range, and the standards never slip even this time during the COVID pandemic. I travelled with my eldest daughter (15) for the weekend and we were both made to feel incredibly welcome and the small touches (which I won't embarrass everyone with here) just make you feel fantastic. Breakfast was excellent and just the right side of old-fashioned! I cannot recommend Browns enough for a special stay and to treat yourself to real, unfussy luxury. Special mention has to go to Dennis who was brilliant and really personifies everything that Browns is about. We'll almost certainly be back in 2021."
December 2020,Beyond Five Star,"Brown’s is intoxicating, meaning you want to return and return. This is something we did, and will continue to do. The welcome back was simply outstanding, genuine smiles abound from every member of staff. It’s the staff that make this place special, remembering you from previous visits and going out of their way to make your stay memorable. None of this is stuffy or fawning, it’s really quite effortless. All of the staff are worth their weight in gold. Dennis was an absolute star, looking after us from the moment we checked in, to the moment we left. It would be a struggle to find anyone offering service like this, in any hotel in London, he’s totally exemplary in every respect. Abigail, in Charlie’s, is also fantastic. She runs a very special restaurant and has a great knack…"
October 2020,Oasis in the heart of the West End,"After a long day touring the sights and shops in the plushest parts of the West End, we popped in to Brown’s Hotel to take some well-earned refreshment. There we discovered an amazing and chic oasis - also known as the Donovan Bar.  We were tempted by the friendly staff into sampling their superb cocktails, the Archie I chose being the best whisky cocktail I have ever sampled. Service was excellent and atmosphere was better still. I thoroughly recommend taking time-out from a serious shopping trip there."
November 2020,E Stanworth,2 day break over Friday and Saturday with my teenage daughter.  Enjoyed the location which is central to all the great shops.  Room 216 was comfortable and a good size (junior suite) but no view. Reception staff and doorman deserve a particular mention for friendly and helpful behaviour.  Browns was better than my last couple of stays at The Langham.
October 2020,Fantastic Stay!,"This is our first time to stay in this wonderful hotel, from the time we checked in until we checked out all the staff are amazing! We had an afternoon tea as well in the Drawing room which I highly reccommend if anyone wants to experience this exquisite experience. Our room was spacious clean and comfy , my daughter even had her own bed with Alby on it with the princess activity pack , and her own cute slippers she was so elated. From Dennis who was always welcoming and I can assure all will always have a smile on his face behind the mask, to the lady who assists us at breakfast in Charlies, the gentleman who explained every detail during our afternoon tea, our warmfelt thank you for making our stay a memorable one. We will come back to stay again or even have lunch or dinner…"
October 2020,5 Stars are not enough,"We have just returned from another memorable stay at this amazing hotel. During these difficult times we had to postpone my 50th birthday celebrations which, we were due to celebrate at Browns in March. Six months on, Browns made this special birthday one I will never forget. The staff were so attentive, always had time to stop and talk and wanted to make our time at Browns special. All government guidelines on Covid-19 were adhered to however this did not take anything away from making our stay comfortable and amazing. During these unprecedented times, managing to operate within the guidelines and still give the customer that special feeling, may seem impossible, but Browns have managed it and in our opinion exceeded it! I can not thank the management and staff enough for…"
October 2020,One night of luxury,"The staff were friendly and courteous, and I enjoyed every minute of my 24 hours there. I would highly recommend it, and am already looking forward to my next trip. It is five star in every sense of the word."
September 2020,Excellent service - hope to return,"I was lucky enough to come and enjoy cocktails in the bar at Browns whilst catching up with a girlfriend. From walking through the door the service was impeccable, the staff were extremely welcoming, friendly and attentive. The decor is beautiful and a lovely and vibrant atmosphere without being too loud. Cocktails were delicious and a great variety and choice. I can’t wait to return."
November 2019,Browns Hotel,Wonderful stay - five stars for food and hospitality. The hotel was clean and safe. London is quiet and so was the hotel. This made it so much fun - streets were empty galleries easy to get into. A perfect break.
October 2020,Fantastic Stay,"What can I say but WOW, this hotel is just amazing: the decor, the staff, the room. Cleaning in this hotel is impeccable, attention to detail everywhere, so clean, I felt very safe staying there during this COVID outbreak, cleaning staff knocked to see if there anything you needed or could get if you ran out of toiletries, the housekeeping staff were truly wonderful and looked after our every need  The room was amazing with attention to detail to provide a clean and beautiful room stay in and the Irene Forte toiletries are amazing and smell lovely, staff made you feel important and greeted everyone with a smile.  Afternoon tea was enjoyed on the first day, the food was scrumptious, and the service was elegant, warm and friendly. Karol and David were amazing!  The front desk…"
October 2020,Beautiful hotel stay,"Spacious rooms with a soft, relaxing colour scheme in this very historic, elegant Georgian townhouses of which 11 makes up the Brown's Hotel (previously two hotels, St George's, Albemarle Street, and Brown's, Dover Street, they kept expanding then became one as they backed on to each other) with upscale marble/limestone bathrooms, and luxurious chaise longues.  I absolutely loved my staycation at Browns Hotel, Mayfair.  It is the oldest hotel in London, being the first hotel in London,and I think it is also the prettiest 😍   It's like walking into a beautiful English garden with the large florals and wisteria flowing down the walls.   Located in the heart of Mayfair it has welcomed royalty (Queen Victoria, and Queen Elizabeth as a princess), politicians (Roosevelt), writers…"
October 2020,"Beautiful surroundings, outstanding service","I visited the Drawing Room at Brown’s recently for Afternoon Tea with a small group of colleagues. The wood-panelled room is as charming as ever and the traditional afternoon tea is immaculately done - starched linen table cloth and napkins, delicate china and a delicious array of finger sandwiches and pastries as well as scones of course. The waiters are only too happy to bring you more of the food if you would like as well as a fresh pot of tea. And all accompanied by a live pianist. A real oasis of calm and grace in these troubled times. Special thanks to our terrific head waiter Karol and to the super friendly and helpful receptionist Luca. Can’t wait to go back!"
September 2020,Browns in St James’,Chose this hotel as very centrally situated and close to New Bond Street for shopping and the Ritz for dinner. Super welcome by George and then at the desk by TeO. Marco was very good also as was the pleasant Sicilian waitress in Donovan’s bar. We had asked for a quiet room and that was what we were given. Everything was there in the room and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Very good turndown service. Bumped into Sir Rocco Forte and he said hello.  All in all one of the best London hotels that we have visited. Will go again.
September 2020,Afternoon tea,Wow just wow!!!. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we felt special. So let's get down to our tea. A great selection of finger sandwiches. They even did cucumber and coconut butter sandwiches for me as I can't eat cheese. Every one of the sandwiches so tasty. As for the selection of cakes and scones mouth watering. You must have their home made strawberry jam. More of a taste of fruit than sugar. We both liked our tea I had the Cornish and TOH had the Browns afternoon blend. They even made TOH a little chocolate mouse cake for a birthday treat. Not sure of our waiter and waitress names were but thanks very much. I just hope the photo's do the food justice.
March 2020,Luxury & Service,"From the moment the doorman opened our taxi door we were treated as if we were the most important people in the world. Stunning building, beautifully decorated and well appointed. We were given an upgraded room upon check-in so had the most fabulous suite which was stunning as was the bathroom and the comfort of the bed was off the charts. Browns is part of the Rocco Forte hotel group and you can NEVER go wrong with them. For us a slice of decadent luxury is needed to refuel the soul and the Browns hotel did just that. Thank you"
May 2019,Everything is Perfect! ,"It's such a lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Mayfair. The vibe was great, the staffs were friendly helpful, the room was spacious and super comfy. Overall, the hotel quality was superb! We'll definitely come back when we visit London again and will recommend this to our relatives and friends. Keep up the good work!  I still remember every detail in our deluxe room. "
April 2020,Everything was superb ,"Stayed at the Brown's Hotel a few years back. Loved it. One of the oldest hotels in London, the service is very good. The location is super convenient and the service is super comfortable, just across the street from old Bond street. Good breakfast, I don't remember how much, very touristy, don’t know whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, The only downside is that the hotel rooms."
May 2019,Just outstanding ,"The hotel is very  historic, quiet and elegant The location is great for London visits and getting in and out of the city. We were truly amazed by the impeccable service there. Very spacious and stylish rooms. Would recommend for sure! "
December 2019,Wonderful sTaff,Staff were amazing with my little trip to visit this hotel a number of weeks ago. the attention to detail was outstanding! Made me feel very special.  Nothing was too much and i will be returning again in the near future.
March 2020,got here just in time!,I stayed at Brown's for the few days before London and the rest of the world shut down. They could not have been nicer. Staff was helpful and proactive with the needs of someone who had to leave very quickly.
May 2021,25th anniversary ,"Our first visit to Browns and only booked last minute due to cancelling Savoy due to bars and restaurants being closed in the week. On reflection this was a blessing as the hotel and staff were amazing. We were treated like royalty with nothing too much trouble. From arriving and met by John we were checked in by Dennis who had upgraded our room to a suite so we could celebrate our 25th anniversary in style. From then on things just got better and better, we would like to say a massive thank you to all the staff for really looking after us and making our two nights stay a real pleasure. We enjoyed a lovely, well presented room service, a delicious evening meal in Charlie’s restaurant and drinks in Donovan’s bar where all the staff were incredible.  We will definitely return as…"
May 2021,Fabulous London hotel,"We stayed at Brown's Hotel for three nights to celebrate our daughter's graduation.  The hotel went above and beyond at every opportunity to ensure a fabulous stay for ourselves and our guests. Chris at concierge managed to secure us a much coveted table at Spring Restaurant. Alex and George at the front desk were kind and welcoming, even finding us a quiet room after a stormy night made the roadside rooms a little noisy. We had afternoon tea in the beautiful drawing room and were taken care of by the tea sommelier, who opened up a whole world of tasting opportunities. The cocktails in the bar were legendary and when the girls had sampled all of them, the barman invented a few new ones. And the wonderful team of doormen always had a brolly on hand and a smile to welcome us back.…"
April 2021,London’s best hotel!,"Having stayed in over 50 London hotels, this has been my best experience.  Many top hotels have similar facilities and amenities but few can rival Browns as an oasis of tradition, calm and outstanding service.  The cocktail bar Donovan’s (voted one of the worlds best) is a real treat and very popular, so be sure to reserve a place! Charlie’s restaurant is an utter delight, refurbished but still evidencing all the traditional attraction. The food is outstanding both in terms of variety and quality. A great wine list compliments the menu and unlike many other hotels I’ve stayed in in London the pricing is not absurd.  Wonderfully airy rooms in the heart of London with a spa and world class service will ensure we return to the hotel in which Kipling penned The Jungle Book What sets…"
May 2021,Calm and discreet yet warm and welcoming,Super stay at Browns. Everyone so focussed on our comfort and satisfaction.  Such a cosy and relaxing place - but yet just steps from the hustle and bustle of the west end or Mayfair’s fine shopping streets.   A real treat. 
May 2021,A Magnificent Evening with Friends,"From the moment John opened the car door and welcomed us back to the hotel, we relaxed into the warm and friendly atmosphere knowing we were going to be looked after.  We had brought friends for drinks in The Donovan Bar and dinner at Charlie's and Mr Mclean and his team were on point as usual.  There is a seemingly effortless elegance to the service throughout the hotel and it is a pleasure to be looked after by them.  The atmosphere in the Donovan bar was buzzing and we loved the Breakfast Martinis.  Our friends enjoyed the cocktail list which has something new to tempt us every time we go. They also enjoyed our old favourite, the Spicy 50.  We moved through to Charlie's seamlessly and were welcomed by Abigail and Gian Luca who made sure we had everything we wanted.  The…"
December 2020,Afternoon Tea,"I have decided that I don’t get afternoon tea and need to stick to my guns and not do it again.  Browns is one of my favourite hotels and it is absolutely beautiful at Christmas.  The service is discreet and you are made feel special.  The food was fine, although the sandwiches we bland with a laser beam of filling; I struggled to differentiate what the fillings were!  The scones were beautiful and the cakes fine but if I’m being honest a bit disappointing.  My last AT was at Lucknam Park and it was the same, so I’ve come to the conclusion it’s me not Browns.  On another note always a lovely time at Donovan’s Bar!"
February 2021,Outstanding service,"Staying in London on business, supporting the supermarket sector. We stayed overnight and had a very warm welcome on arrival from George, who looked after us during our stay. The room was amazing, the bed was extremely comfortable and we would highly recommend the hotel and George.  George has a very promising career ahead of him.  Thanks again, we will be back."
January 2020,Business Meeting - Tea,"Beautiful Brown's Hotel was perfect for high tea in London. Gracious service,  scones with clotted cream was fantastic.  The tea selection was excellent. Make sure to have a reservation before going and enjoy the time there!"
December 2020,Simply excellent with flawless staff,"A one night stay.  It's really impossible to find fault with Brown's:  - great location just off Piccadilly  - has a long history and tradition but has a very special atmosphere - luxurious and intimate feel, not at all stuffy - well appointed and quiet room, despite overlooking Dover Street.  Well sized bathroom; great shower and bath  - original cocktail menu and good quality breakfast   But what makes this hotel is the staff.  Every member we came across - doorman, bar staff, reception, room service etc - was excellent; attentive, friendly, went the extra mile etc.  Impeccable.  And excellent COVID protocols without ruining the feel of the experience; it felt very safe.  A remarkably good hotel."
December 2020,Effortless luxury in the heart of Mayfair,"This beautiful hotel is located in the heart of Mayfair so is perfectly placed for shopping, restaurants and any other Central London activities.   The room was generous in size, spotlessly clean and the bathroom and wardrobe rather large. All of the staff were very courteous and attentive, and the bar is definitely worth stopping by for a drink or two. We felt particularly safe with the hotel's protocols in this time of pandemic and look forward to returning to stay again.  If you are looking for seamless customer service in a stylish and special but not stuffy hotel this is the place to stay!"
February 2020,Best in town," Quite simply the best hotel in London. Outstandingly high levels of service, excellent accommodation and first-class facilities, including bar, lounge and restaurant. All at one of the best locations, within easy walking distance of shops, attractions, restaurants, etc. "
March 2020,"Feeling at home, in a royal way","Definitely a palace, but with something more: a soul, a mix of history and living myth, expressed in so many perfect ways. Service at the highest level, efficient, warm, elegant, never invasive, on a boutique spirit. The place  offers English traditional patterns, and incredible comfort. The high tea is an exquisite stolen moment, delicate and rare. This hotel is a rare gift, an authentic jewel."
February 2020,Not Amazing Treatment by staff,"I made the mistake of visiting this hotel with a one year old in a buggy. As we went to enter the hotel I was asked by the Doorman if I was after ""take out ""   . Inside the hotel the mannerism of staff  led one to quickly conclude that they didn't really want the patronage of a guest with a buggy .  Its unfortunate to feel quite unwelcome. I have been  to this hotel previously wearing business attire and had quite a different reaction. Not a hotel I would recommend - I want to be treated well all the time especially on a day off and in Grand Parent mode."
March 2020,Afternoon Tea.,"A very enjoyable couple of hours in the Drawing Room where we were served an endless stream of unique cakes, interesting sandwiches, cream and jam scones, with a choice of teas from all over the World. As fast as a pot was emptied, another one appeared. Excellent service from welcoming and friendly staff."
February 2020,Amazing Hotel,"I stayed here in February for 1 night together with my boyfriend.Check-in was great, the room was lovely and everyone who is working there is helpful and professional. It was very much appreciated the amenities received in the room. Dinner and as well the breakfast was great, the restaurant staff was amazing  and really helpful.  I will definitely go back!"
February 2020,Concierge and Front Door team,"Everything amazing, food, service, concierge team, specially David and Givi and Ivan from the front door  The bar with special drinks and old bottles of whisky, breakfast healthy and tasty, the afternoon tea and the restaurant very good "
February 2020,Amazing service,"I recently had the pleasure to visit Brown’s for a cocktail with a friend. We were welcomed at the entrance and guided to the cocktail bar. Everyone was very professional, especially Denis. Thanks to him our experience at Brown’s was something that we still talk about."
February 2020,Exceptional from the moment you arrive,"Browns is my home away from home every month. The team at Browns are  focused on making sure every guest feels special starting  from the gents at the doors, to the front desk/concierge, or the restaurants and bar. I could list so manny names but the truth is, everyone delivers excellence. When you travel almost every week, it’s the little things that make you feel at home. Cannot recommend this hotel enough!"
February 2020,Afternoon tea,"I was with my brother, dad and friend MarTinka on Afternoon tea at 3 PM. It was great! Tasty sandwiches and cakes, tea, and lovely staff. Especially David cared about us All the time. Pianist made a good atmosphere too. We really enjoyed it."
February 2020,Great Time,We spent lovely time in your hotel. Afternoon tea was great and food very delicious. Waiter David made excellent customer service. Musician played very well as well. Thank you very much. See you next time! :) 
February 2020,ANOTHER OUTSTANDING STAY!,"Browns at its all time best!  Wonderful welcome from George Hiley-Jones who’d prepared everything in advance of our stay. Our early arrival enabled us to partake of a superb Afternoon Tea in the Drawing Room. Here, Yonka spoilt us and guided us through the menu. Of particular mention is the delightful selection of sandwiches, savoury treats and tartlets. Nothing ordinary here! George and Dennis even brought flowers to my mother’s room; the very same colour of flowers she’d admired the year before in the lobby. A lovely touch which was greatly appreciated.   Breakfast and all our meals were simply stunning; whether that be Charlie’s, the Donovan Bar or The Drawing Room.   It’s the location, understated elegance and the quintessentially British ‘feel’ of this marvellous 5 Star…"
March 2019,No better luxury hotel in all of London,"We loved our room, the doormen, the high tea and the Rolls Royce they provide to lucky, or in our case well liked guests to check out local attractions and restaurants. Browns is truly one of the Europe's finest hotels. Tip the doorman and he just might reserve the Bentley for you but you better be nice when you do. We took it twice in 10 days."
February 2020,Home sweet home !,"Brown's will always be Brown's.  Each time I am coming to London I am staying at Brown's. I have been coming to London for decades and 15 years ago, I stayed at Brown's for the first time. Since then, I never left it for another Hotel.  Years after years they are changing, evolving ... always for the best, succeeding in staying the safest and cosiest places I know. In the heart of Mayfair, in the quiet and beautiful Albemarle street, Brown's is my home far from my home.  Service can't be better, discretion and comfort as well !  Brown's is my preferred location in Europe with Hotel de Russie, in Roma !"
December 2019,Wonderful hotel,"I had the occasion to visit Brown’s Hotel during my visit to London. Such a wonderful discovery!  Since you walk the main entrance you can breathing the style and the elegance of this place. Everything has been cured with details: just marvelous!   We decided to have a cocktail to the bar, simply stunning! A chic atmosphere with a really friendly and professional staff.  On my way out I met Dennis, the guest relations, who gave us the occasion to visit the whole hotel including few rooms. He was really welcoming and friendly. I felt very welcomed even if I wasn’t staying there.   Thank you for the visit and next time for sure we will book Brown’s Hotel."
January 2020,Excellent!,"I’m a world traveler and I can say that this is one of the best hotel I have been as service, and overall quality! The staff is professional and really friendly and I will stay there again in London for sure!"
December 2019,Christmas 2019,"A little overdue i admit but still worth writing.  Mr Johnson and his whole front of house and back of house F&B and concierge staff were unbelievable.  Big thank you to Dennis Guest Relations.  I never do Christmas in a hotel - now i may never want to do it at home!  It wasn't an easy time fro our family but we went ahead with our stay anyway.  Everyone from the adults my children and grand children loved it.  Everyone whatever age was made to feel special.  Browns is a great hotel one of if not London's best. But i was nervous with 14 for lunch in Charlie's on Christmas day and how the little ones would be treated.  Every detail the rooms, the food the service and the bar were amazing.  They say you get what you pay for - at Browns you get a lot more and definitely a very fine…"
October 2019,Afternoon Tea at Browns on my 72nd Birthday,I decided that it is time for an Afternoon Tea with a dear friend at one of London's top hotels. I chose Browns which is the oldest of all notable London Hotels. We were welcomed by Alex Wilson who had set up everything perfectly for us. David was the waiter who looked after us throughout our visit. His timing was perfect and made us feel quite relaxed. Being my 72nd birthday Zultan took some excellent photos of my blowing out the cake candle and in doing so caught the moment perfectly and he even had Happy Birthday played for me on the piano. All this made a happy atmosphere for us and the other nearby guests.  The food and service was out of this world and the overall ambience certainly made it a day to remember. To cap it all I was kindly presented with a special edition of…
January 2020,Great stay!,"The room was very nice with a lovely view. The staff was extremely attentive and we were looked after very well, especially Luca and Teo. With also great management like Ben and George. Simply outstanding. The food in Charlies was delicious and the service was simply outstanding. Would definitely return."
January 2020,Daughters Birthday Afternoon Tea,"For my daughters birthday we went to this lovely Hotel for Afternoon tea. Given a lovely corner table . Waitress was extremely informative and explained everything about the tea.The whole experience was amazing, Food exceptional. Sandwiches really fresh and tasty ,we were offered as many as we wanted, scones  delicious  and really warm and fresh. Cakes exemplary, my daughter loved them so much they gave her a box to take home. We also had pieces of cake afterwards and my daughter had a birthday cake. The waitress who served us made our experience very memorable  she was very attentive and an asset to the hotel. Would definitely return for another celebration. One of the best afternoon teas in London."
January 2020,Afternoon to tea to celebrate important family event,Our afternoon tea was a fabulous and memorable experience with fantastic service from our lovely waitress Yonka who made it all very special.  The setting in the Drawing Room is welcoming and relaxing and the food was delicious.  Thoroughly recommended.
December 2019,Fabulous hotel in the heart of Mayfair! ,We stayed at this hotel over a weekend.   The first thing that struck me was the interior of the hotel. The reception was painted with the most amazing patterns and colours. It made the hotel seem very luxurious as soon as we entered. After we checked in their was stolen mince pies and mulled wine which was delicious.   Mayfair at this time of the year is beautiful as all the shops are very Christmassy.  Our room was very spacious and had a lovely bathroom and plenty of storage.  The breakfast was amazing as well and I had an omelette which was very tasty.
December 2019,Very welcoming. Attentive staff,"Very comfortable bedroom. Impressed with the attentive staff and no request too much trouble. Excellent location and central for shopping etc. We have stayed in a few of the ""better"" hotels in London but Browns overall is top of the list."
November 2019,like at home,"the position is fantastic, you can go everywhere in few minutes the reception is warm, with a chimney, like at home the bar and the restaurant were very cool all people in reception and the waiters were very kind"
September 2019,Beyond excellence ,"A huge thank you to Dennis and the team at Browns for creating a truly unforgettable stay for my wife and I on our wedding night. They all went above and beyond in both preparation and execution, the room was beyond fabulous and the addition of a few special extras for our big day were absolutely exceptional. We’d love to do it all over again and look forward to our return visit!   Furthermore, it was a real pleasure and a surprise to go back and visit Browns again recently, and Dennis and the team came through 10/10 again! Outstanding.   I honestly could not recommend this team enough. "
December 2019,Amazing Spa,I booked the the littles ones spa treatment for my daughters birthday. Her and best friend had an amazing time due to services. I have never come across such great staff and very professional. Definitely will be going back
December 2019,Extremely poor nights sleep,"Booked a double room, to find 2 single beds pushed together! This does not constitute as a double bed. We called down to have the room made up to a double bed, which they said they would do. On returning after our evening out, the room had NOT been made up but felt it was too late to call down again. My husband fell out of bed during the night.  We complained in the morning about the room and were offered a 10% discount, which we found quite insulting when the room charged was £705.00 per night. This was our first stay and definitely our last.  On the plus side, the door staff were so welcoming and friendly."
October 2019,English Tearoom,"My husband and I enjoyed an afternoon tea here. The food and champagne were delicious and there was an amazing range of teas to choose from. The staff were attentive and helpful, and also discreet. The surroundings are elegant and peaceful, away from the bustle of the city. An added enjoyment was a pianist playing quietly in the background. Absolutely recommended for a special treat."
November 2019,Very Great location in London,"The Brown‘s Hotel is a very great location in London. Fine service, wonderful food and drinks and absolutely friendly. Many thanks to Sophie Bayly Jones, Claus Banczyk and Antonio from the best breakfast in town. Door men and Concierge absolutely friendly. The Brown’s Hotel is the best hotel in class. Thank‘s Sir Rocco Forte and team."
December 2019,Fantastic stay!,"WE just had the most incredible stay at Brown's hotel in London.  Very well located and the service is second to none. It was my husband's 50th Birthday, and the hotel concierge, Dennis, helped me organize a cake (with photos of my husband on it!) and balloons for the room, when we arrived! Just all around fabulous stay, beautiful old hotel that felt like home, and incredible staff who greeted us by name, each day when we had breakfast at Charlie's or just opened the door as we left or returned. I highly recommend and will stay here again!"
November 2019,Overall a pleasant stay,"The hotel is for sure one of the best in London. I do not particularly like the rather narrow, albeit pleasantly retro entrance from Albemarle Street as I do not find the Reception particularly comfortable and easy to access given the (three) steps you have to walk down to reach it. The fact that you have noone to help you with your luggage makes the check-in even more uncomfortable. Maybe we were not particularly lucky or... welcome - although we are a very decent couple travelling very frequently and staying in 5+ star hotels all the times, so I believe we are used to comfort and I can guarantee that we are always welcome. Never mind. Rooms and floor service (turn-down, floor management etc.) impeccable: 10/10. Decor of room, floor corridors as well as bar and dining areas…"
January 2020,Debbie,Staying at Browns is like “coming home”. Staff are superb. Attention to detail everywhere. Welcoming. Comfortable. Food excellent. Fabulous location. Love it. When in London I don’t stay anywhere else. Highly recommend.

The service, impeccable and friendly, the concierge knowledgeable and exceedingly helpful,  the room very comfortable and quiet and the breakfast outstanding. What more is there to say?  We will from now on, always stay at Brown's when we visit London."
December 2019,"Great location,    very nice  staff,   ROOM  very  tired !!","Nice  location,   very  nice  staff.    We  had an  upgraded  room.   It  was  tired.   The  furniture  had  numerous  nicks,    drapes  were  awful.     Bathroom  old   but   ok.    NOT  a  5  star  Hotel anymore.  So many other Hotels in London.   Browns  is  living on its  past  rep."
January 2020,“AMAZING STAY AT BROWNS HOTEL”(LONDON),"I recently visited the Browns hotel London for a special occasion and I must say it was one of the best hotels I have stayed in. We were checked in by Claus who did an exceptional room tour for us. Everything was excellent; the food,grounds,ambiance and friendly staff. Brilliant Jamie who gave us the hotel tour, Lovely Brenda who arranged coffee for us. Alex Front office manager made our stay more memorable.The in room service breakfast in the morning was a perfect start of the day and delicious!! Definitely will recommend to visit the property, I will be back!"
December 2019,Sunday Roast @ Charlie's!,"Carved out an afternoon to spend's at the gorgeous Brown Hotel.  Travelled to London for a theater and shopping trip with 2 girlfriends. We had the Sunday afternoon Roast (3pm seating) @ Charlie's and we were enchanted and absolutely loved the décor! The nod to Kipling with the luscious Wallpapers, Fabrics and China to the Christmas Tree and garlands---a true feast for the eyes.   We spent the lovely afternoon over Pate, Sunday roast per Silver trolley cart, gorgeous desserts,  cocktails and wine.  We ended our time at the sumptuous Donovan's bar prior to leaving for the evening theatre.  The service was spot on from the Outstanding staff~~everyone was so polite, engaging and made our day so, so very special!"
December 2019,"Brown's, the best hotel in London.","Brown's is simply the best hotel offer in London. As a Rocco Forte branded hotel, the attitude, approach and culture of the staff, truly reflects the ethos of this most magnificent brand. Nothing is too much travel, from arrival, to departure. Seamless excellence. We will be back! "
December 2019,Mini moon over New Year 2019,"Picked up in a Bentley and whisked to the heart of Mayfair, welcomed with smiles and champagne. This glimpse into another World was all we could have wished. While it cost the same as a summer break, the style and elegance were bucket list delights. The restaurant, Charlie’s was superb. Both dinner and breakfast, excellent. The location just off New Bond Street made for great access to shops, sights and an easy stroll back from the nights festivities. One to try, but bring your big wallet!"
December 2019,Best hotel in London: The Team at Browns are A CUT ABOVE everyone else.,"My wife and I spent a wonderful 6 nights at Browns this December. We got married at the hotel in 2010 and have been staying there for our anniversary ever since. The hotel itself is stunning. Traditional & Contemporary design, very luxurious yet retains a really nice family atmosphere and warmth due to the amazing staff that work at the hotel. From the front door team all the way through to the house keeping team and everyone in between - the service is absolutely incredible. Warm, friendly, humorous, helpful - they set the tone for this fabulous hotel and make this a cut above all the other luxury hotels in London. Thank you to Alex and the entire team at Browns for another memorable stay. See you next year. Steve & Fiona"
December 2019,Drinks,Popped in here for a drink after shopping at Tiffany’s. Absolutely thrilled that they are dog friendly. I enjoyed a fine glass of red Merlot. My dog Benji was offered some water too. Fabulous Christmas decorations.  Friendly staff. 
December 2019,Memorable High Tea,"Many thanks to Yonka, Zoltan and David for going the extra mile.  Their fine service and wonderful food made for a very special experience. Will make high tea at Browns a must -do whenever I visit London."
December 2019,Mac Family Lo don Visit,Great location slightly pricey compared to other standard hotels but the service was great and rooms are of a high standard.  Door men and Concierge are best in class.  Will stay here again if any offers are shared by Browns Hotel.  
December 2019,Another fan of Afternoon Tea at Brown's,"Wife and I enjoyed the Tea on her birthday.  Yonka was a pure pleasure, with an able assist from Aisha (sp?).  The pianist was wonderful and the food, of course, perfect.  We went for a 12:30 sitting on a Wednesday and nearly had the place to ourselves.  Only ate there, so cannot comment on the hotel itself."
November 2019,Noisy and poor service,"poor service, incredibly noisy during the nights because there is a nightclub just opposite.empty breakfast-buffet, very slooooow service. the hotel lives of it's location i guess! definetly not worth the money."
November 2019,Big hotel with boutique hotel charm and service!!,"My wife and I spent 3 nights at Brown's in November and we loved it!!! Location was great. The vibe in the hotel was awesome and different in each restaurant and room in the hotel. The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful especially the concierges that helped us while we were there. From opening doors to you to remembering your name each time you returned to the property, Brown's makes you really feel like you are at home. Our room was massive!! It was so nice, clean and everything else that you would want in a hotel room. The bathroom was large and the shower even had a whole door so the bathroom did not get soaked every time you showered!!! The breakfast buffet was perfect and the food was all very good. The bar off the lobby was so cool and the drink menu is off the hook.…"
November 2019,The Perfect Afternoon Tea,"Recently enjoyed afternoon tea with Yonka as our server.  She was knowledgeable about the tea menu and provided us with details about each item on the delicious menu.  Atmosphere, as always, was perfect. "
December 2019,Pre Christmas afternoon tea,"A thoroughly enjoyable place to while away a couple of hours on a Monday afternoon, Brown’s has been a favourite of ours for several years.  Today, we were served attentively by the lovely Yonka, who was efficient and very friendly, explaining with great enthusiasm each of the elements of our afternoon tea. We’ll be back at some point in the near future!"
December 2019,Mr Emanuele Esposito,"I had an amazing time in the tea room, a very warm welcome from Askay and Csilla than following the great opening table with the knowledge of Lorenzo about the teas and Yonka about the sandwiches and sweets and thanks to Zoltan very kind person and  a big thanks to David for looking after us in a pretty much way! I would raccomand to the whole world ! Thanks guys"
December 2019,Tea for Two,We had heard quite a bit about having tea at Brown’s Hotel while visiting London but think it was a bit over rated.  I’m sure it’s a great place to take granny but doesn’t have an environment that anyone under 60 would find fun.
December 2019,The most charming Hotel in London!,"I spent 2 days in London last week, in this beautiful, authentic English-style luxury hotel, located in the heart of the city. The hotel is a little gem, with a wonderful atmosphere, amazing personnel, beautiful decors and ambiance. The room bed was probably one of the most comfortable I have ever experienced in my entire life, and also breakfast was superb. I strongly recommend Browns' Hotel to anyone wishing to make the best out of his/her stay in this amazing city! Antonio Ciaffaglione."
December 2019,"VERY cosy, classy, clean hotel. Pleasant warm smiley staff, great food","Beautiful elegantly decorated hotel. Me and husband received warm welcome at the reception with mulled wine and mince pies. Our room was extremely cosy and spotlessly clean with the most comfortable mattresse I have ever slept on. Beautiful dinner and breakfast, attentive, pleasant staff.  I couldn't find a flaw (and I'm fussy :-) )"
October 2019,Business trip,I had the chance to experience a stay at Brown's hotel for business purpose and I can say that it is an Excellent hotel. The staff/concierge is very professional. The hotel has a very good location. I highly recommend this hotel.
October 2019,Excellent Service & Perfect Location,"Another very enjoyable stay at Browns.  This is our favourite hotel in London and perfectly located for shopping, art galleries and theatre.  The staff are extremely pleasant and helpful.  We love the stylish interiors and rooms with spacious bathrooms and the food including breakfast in the beautifully decorated restaurant is always excellent."
October 2019,"A beautiful, classy hotel, very good cocktail bar and restaurant","We dined there one evening. Excellent attentive service, very attractive Donovan cocktail bar and stylish restaurant. All three courses for dinner were excellent, the wine list is very good and fairly priced. A good choice for afternoon tea or any time. To be recommended if you like quality!"
October 2019,Best in London,"Feels like home in Mayfair, exceptional cozy boutique hotel. Super chic, great comfortable beds, fantastic service. My second stay and will definitely be back. Friendly staff, perfect service, amazing bar and restaurants off the lobby. Close enough to stores yet far enough away to feel residential. All around wonderful hotel. "
October 2019,Think Marriott - only better,"The service is impeccable, the hotel staff help wherever they can. The Hotel is clean, tidy and feels like home.  The room has everything you need (and more) and is so comfortable - I imagined Olga standing in there and thinking - ""what have we missed?"". The food was lovely, well thought out again and the position of the hotel is second to none. Will we go back? - Big yes to that"
October 2019,A very nice stay,"I have been coming to London since the mid sixties with my parents and now for over 35 years with my wife and kids and i don’t know how we could miss this gem?  The service has been above excellence in particular the concierge headed by David and his excellent team who take it personal interest in everything and will try till they are successful to get our request completed. (Lee you have been wonderful thank you).  Housekeeping, room service at times quite shocking with their very quick response and attention.   Donavan Bar is a fun place with attentive service.  Our six days stay has been not only comfortable but how can you complain about the location?  My wife and I want to thank the management for their hard work to run such a fine establishment and their attention to…"
October 2019,Great classic London Hotel,"A classic beautiful Mayfair Hotel. Excellent service and a very friendly staff. We stayed in a one bed room suite that was very nicely decorated, We had lunch at the bar - great food and a great venue for business meetings. We sure had an afternoon tea which is one of the best in London. "
October 2019,❤❤❤,cad is féidir liom a rá faoin óstán iontach seo? Mothaím go raibh mé i mo chroí le linn mo chuairte. Is é an bricfeasta bruite vegetarian ach delicious agus an fhoireann chomh deas agus gairmiúil. Bhí dúil mhór agam i mo sheomra! go raibh maith agat!
October 2019,Disappointing tea ,"Have been to Browns for afternoon tea many times in fact it’s one of our favourites. Today was very disappointing. Desultory service. Four tiny scones and small cakes for 3 Had to ask for more. One would have expected them to ask. Less than at the competition The only time there was attentive service was when they asked if we wanted more champagne- at a price of course.  Sad to be honest, we love the ambience and will go back in the hope this was a one off"
August 2019,Afternoon tea was divine ,"This would have to be one of my top afternoon tea’s. Tearoom had a smart but informal feel about it even though it was obviously a 5 star establishment  Front of house staff, two gentlemen were extremely attentive and accommodating. Mini open bagels were a nice change on the usual sandwiches, the fillings your tradition but with a twist. Patisserie’s were delicious, flavour and texture combinations amazing.   "
November 2019,Best service,"Lovely hotel with greate service and lovely rooms. I did not try the spa or the gym. love the outpacking service included and the hotel car.  God beds, nice location, greate food, I have nothing bad to say about this FAB hotel. I will come back for sure.  "
October 2019,My new home in London,"London was my final stop on a trip that took me through New York, Geneva and Paris. Many years ago I had the good fortune of being invited for tea at Brown's by an English friend. After never quite getting the timing right, I finally returned to Brown's for High Tea and, as a special indulgence, to stay. From my arrival, through to the spa, my beautifully appointed room, High Tea, drinks in the Bar and breakfast in the room the following morning...my stay was superb. The staff was extremely attentive...using my name and providing me with an experience that has spoiled me for other mere hotels. A few highlights from my stay...(1) the best reflexology I have had outside of Bangkok Thailand...I wish it had lasted forever; (2) a High Tea and tea tasting curated by staff of the tea…"
October 2019,„One of these days“,"During my stay in London I spend a wonderful evening at the Donavan Bar. The drinks are amazing, I had a little bit trouble to choose - each cocktail is unique and has its own story. At the end I went with „Sparkling side of the moon“ an homage to Pink Floyd and it was just fabulous. Later in the evening I got a wonderful tour from the Duty Manager Claus B. He showed me different rooms and suites and explained all the history. „Thank you very much again, for the effort.“ It was just perfect!"
November 2019,Breakfast,"Good place for a quick business breakfast. Nice buffet spread, good service and nice hot order options. Able to get a quiet corner for a business conversation. Poached eggs with avacado toast was great"
November 2019,spot of tea !,Zoltan and Lorenzo took great care and it was a special first memory for traditional afternoon tea ! It was beyond delightful in every way service and taste superb ! It was a great way to start our London tour!
November 2019,Fabulous,"Just spent 4 days with family in  3 rooms, including one suite. Friendly & helpful staff, great location, fabulous bar. Amenities & minibar were nice. Lots of complimentary water. The decor of the first floor blew me away - Whimsical & beautiful! Most of all, the restaurant, Charlie’s, was just superb! Absolutely wonderful experience!"
November 2019,Afternoon tea,"My wife and I had a wonderful afternoon tea experience at Brown’s Hotel in London. We have had tea in many places all over the world, and today’s was one of, if not the best afternoon tea we’ve ever had. The Brown Hotel is a lovely historic building which made this experience so elegant. The staff were extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. Yonka and Zoltan made a very dynamic duo. They really knew the menu, and helped us decide which teas to try. The food was absolutely fantastic as well. We did not feel rushed, in fact we were encouraged by Yonka and Zoltan to take our time and savor our experience, which we indeed did. In fact, we loved everything so much that we made a reservation for December when we return to London with our family. If you’re looking to do afternoon…"
October 2019,Lunch in Charlie's,Gorgeous food and an amazing afternoon. The staff where amazing and so helpful relating to food intolerances.  I have had afternoon tea here before but first time for lunch it was a outstanding highly recommended by me. 
September 2019,Fabulous dinner at Charlie's,I was treated to dinner in Adam Byatt's restaurant Charlie's.  I eat out a lot and would put myself as difficult to please.  The experience was excellent - we had drinks in in the bar first a chilled club like environment before moving into Charlie's for dinner.  I had the monkfish which was beautifully cooked and full of flavour.  We asked the sommelier to reccomend the wine and he suggested a Gewurztraminer which was excellent.  Would certainly go again for a special night out. Perfect location near Picadilly too. 
October 2019,Finest Hotel in the world.  True 5 Stars.,"The Brown's experience is so personal, you often forget you are in a hotel.  There is not a square inch of this hotel that seems out of place.  The quality follows you around from element to element.  The reception is charming, personal and efficient, Rooms are almost always ready upon check in (ours has been and we fly overnight from New York).  The beds are outragousely comfortable.  You rarely see other guests there.  The restaurant and bar are so popular are often crowded but never did we have to wait for a table.  A dream experience.  We were brought fruit to our room everyday.  Brenda, the hotel operator would send us a pot of coffee every morning by request.  The doormen knew all the goings-on around town and we give us advice where to go and where to avoid(There were…"
November 2019,Afternoon tea on high level!,"This is a nice charming hotel in the center of London, very English from the beginning to the end - and we loved it!   Excellent service, nice atmosphere, lovely sandwiches, cakes and scones and not to forget - their strawberry jam. Homemade - delicious.   We were served by Yonka and David the 25th of November. They both made sure we had everything we needed and you would think this is a snobby hotel? You are so wrong. All stuff were very friendly and everyone we spoke with made sure we got the best service.  Congratulations to the Hotel Manager - you have hire some really nice and loyal people. Good job!"
November 2019,Lunch at Charlie’s Saturday 30th Nov.,"What a great restaurant in the hotel. They did us proud with the quality of food and wine. The service was exceptional. I thought the Terrine of partridge & pear was superb. The fillet of beef succulent. I would like to thank Stuart , John and the whole team for there efforts."
November 2019,Afternoon tea with my daughter,"We visited Browns for afternoon tea after a shopping day in London. The team was great and attentive from start to finish. Thank you Karol,Csilla and David, we will be back when we are in London again."
June 2019,outdated decor in room.,"The best shower pressure in any hotel room we have ever stayed in.  The decor in the room was very outdated,and the step down from the bathroom to the hall and from the hall to the bedroom was quite dangerous. Misstepped several times. Wonderful location and staff were very accommodating. BUT the HIGHLIGHT of our trip to the Brown Hotel was meeting SIMONE, a summer intern. He attended our every need; he was kind and friendly. He attends an elite school for hotel management and will one day be in charge of a very fine hotel. HE WAS THE BEST!!!!!!!! Thank you, Simone!"
November 2019,Browns london,The best Home away from home. Best small hotel with impeccable service and attention to all your needs. Right in the heart of Mayfair so location perfect. Afternoon tea should not be missed but book ahead. 
November 2019,Beautiful and luxurious property,"Our stay at the Brown's Hotel exceeded our expectations. The property is absolutely gorgeous and we were so impressed with how spacious the rooms were. The front desk and concierge staff were delightful. The bar was stunning and a great place to grab a drink. We sadly had to leave early due to some flight changes, otherwise we'd have loved to try the tea room as well as breakfast, as both looked incredible when we were checking in. We also didn't get to take advantage of the great location, but it really is ideally located."
November 2019,Fabulous Lunch,"My friend and I have visited Charlie's restaurant twice now and have been so impressed by the decor, comfort, staff and food.  The food was delicious on both occasions and we were never rushed.  The girl that served us the first time (Ludmila), was so lovely and nothing was too much.  She recognized us the second time we went and came straight over to welcome us.  All the staff, including the doormen, are so attentive and happy, they really make you feel at home. This place has now become our favourite and we will be going back to stay at the hotel and also have afternoon tea which I've heard is the best. What a fantastic place.....I really can't wait to go back!!"
November 2019,Afternoon Tea,"We were lucky enough to be invited for the afternoon tea by our dear friend. We could not have enjoyed ourselves more, the food was delicious and the restaurant stylish yet relaxed and warm. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Special thanks to Zoltan for his generosity and kindness. Looking forward to coming back!"
October 2019,Brown's Hotel is the best!,"We come to London a lot, and always stay at Browns.  They treat us with warmth and kindness the moment we arrive to the time we leave.  Everyone greets us and helps with any requests with such care.  We will be back again next month.  "
November 2019,Mrs Drew,"Had a fabulous meal at Charlie's restaurant last night. Very good space offering privacy between tables, lovely decor and ambience. Not too large a menu to choose from, excellent wine selection. The terrine and English rose veal both delicious, sadly no space to try the puddings... next time ."
March 2019,Best afternoon tea in London!,"I had read in various sources that afternoon tea (please do NOT call it high tea since that is something else entirely!) at Brown's is the best in London.  I decided to try it out in March of 2019 and I was not disappoint.  The selection of sandwiches, pastries, scones, and teas was superb.  The tearoom made me feel that I was in an exclusive English club.  As for the service, it could not have been better.  My special thanks to Yonka, Karol, and the other staff for making tea at Brown's so memorable and enjoyable.  I will add that i was accompanied by my godson who is dairy intolerant.  With advance notice the chef went out of his way to prepare a tea that my godson could enjoy.  I've since returned to Brown's twice more and look forward to my fourth afternoon tea later this…"
July 2019,"Elegant hotel, great service & best Martini! ","I celebrated my birthday with my husband, son and a friend.  Andrea in the bar was perfect, gracious hostess, and very pleasant.  Atmosphere was elevated by the live music in the bar.  Restaurant was buzzing, great service by Flávio, who was very knowledgeable and made some great food suggestions and Justina, who was lovely and very welcoming with genuine smile.   Highly recommend!  "
June 2019,Beautiful Brown’s,"My husband and I stayed at the Brown’s Hotel for 2 glorious nights. Upon arrival the room was not ready, but we were shown to the bar and were served tea. We were eventually upgraded to a gorgeous suite. No argument here. The staff were extremely professional.  We enjoyed the fantastic afternoon tea and Yonka made our experience extra special for us with amazing service e including taking photos for us.  The Brown’s will be our next hub in London. Thank you "
June 2019,Best High Tea Ever!,Fantastic birthday celebration High Tea at Browns Hotel! This is at least my 4th visit and by far the best. Thanks to Yonka and Zoltan for taking such good care of us!! This even beats seeing Pierce Brosnan having tea 20+ years ago!
June 2019,Tea at Brown’s Hotel London,"My family and I just had afternoon tea at the Brown’s Hotel London. Yonka and Zoltan were our hosts. They were amazing and enhanced the already marvelous experience with charm and elegant consideration. Our family included children and they were tended to like special guests, with Peruvian Hot Chocolate and endless macaroons. The adults were treated to a glass of fine champagne. We all enjoyed dining on the savory sandwiches which were refined yet filling. The sweets were delicate and delicious. The fresh Strawberry Jam, “perfectly balanced,” as Yonka described, was a favorite. Zoltan gave us a taste of the strawberry macaroon, a day early, designed for Wimbledon week. Afternoon Tea at the Brown’s was highlight of our trip to London."
November 2018,Almost perfect,"Must say Brown's hotel it is a very nice place with a lovely atmosphere and outstanding service. The restaurant is amazing , as well as the English tea room. Loved them.   In room dining very nice, must say the manager is a complete incompetent and unprofessional person. I think my five years old son would manage situations better than him.  For the rest I have to say I had a wonderful experience"
June 2019,Very enjoyable break,"My wife and I stayed at Brown’s for our wedding anniversary and we ate at Beck at Brown’s. My father had recommended it as he used to always stay when in London on business.   We found the staff very welcoming and the room was superb (they did upgrade us though). The dinner in Beck was really good, although rather pricey, the quality of the food was absolutely top class. We met some friends for dinner who are Italian, one of whom is a really good chef, and they were also really impressed.   Overall we had a fabulous experience and would highly recommend this place. I can see why my Dad liked it so much. My wife and I wouldn’t normally stay somewhere quite so high end but on this occasion it was well worth it. I’m not a person who gives reviews normally but thought this was worth…"
June 2019,"Just like home, but better","Our family had a wonderful holiday at the Brown's Hotel in London. The location in Mayfair was perfect. The staff was professional and knowledgeable.   The hotel atmosphere and design of the rooms were divine. The attention to detail was appreciated. The concierge David Young went above and beyond for us. He was so patient and attentive while we were changing plans during the day due to weather and some traffic. He did everything he could to help us pack in as much to our day as possible, keeping us on time and on track from the spa to last minute tickets to a show on our last night!   The staff at the restaurant for our daily breakfast were all friendly and attentive as well.  Made us feel like royalty!  Dominic and Alexi remembered our favorite orders and took excellent care…"
June 2019,Best Hotel Ever?,"Probably! This hotel easily earns every one of its 5 stars.  First time in London with children, ages 10-15, & everything was perfect.  Luxurious but not stuffy. Attentive but not fussy. Outstanding complimentary breakfast. Entire hotel staff was incredibly friendly & helpful. Concierges Paul, Peter, & David were exceptional. Luggage porters Givi & Matt took care of everything at departure & made sure we didn’t forget anything."
June 2019,Superb room and service ,"I had an exceptional stay at Brown’s for a short 3 day trip.  The room is very nice with a comfortable bed, desk, and plug points everywhere convenient and a large bathroom with separate tub and shower.  The highlight for Browns however is the service at the hotel with everyone very helpful.  Would definitely stay again and the location in Mayfair can’t be beat for business, shopping or dining  "
July 2019,Bar and hotel viewing experience ,"My friends and I had the opportunity to experience one of the most famous hotel bar in London where quality of food, drinks and service was extremely satisfying.  Whilst enjoying our drinks, we were overwhelmed to meet Dennis, the guest relation manager at the hotel. He was super friendly and gave us the opportunity to have a viewing of this amazing hotel in the heart of London.   Happy to come back again and hopefully meet once again Dennis for another amazing experience of the hotel.  "
August 2019,Traditional afternoon tea for two,"I arrived early at 2.45pm and was shown to our table, my friend Sarah arrived at 3pm. We ordered the traditional afternoon tea, neither wanting the egg sandwich, they replaced mine with avocado and hers with a humours combo. Sarah ordered the Brown's hotel special own blend of tea to start, and I'm not a tea drinker, so I had a hot chocolate     Then the tray arrived with finger sandwiches of smoked salmon and lemon butter onion bread, sliced cucumber and cream cheese white bread, prawn cocktail with paprika on potato bun, sliced parma ham and cream cheese with fresh herbs. We took a while to eat these, laced with conversation on life in general  Once these were devoured, the stand was replace with cake stand with freshly baked plain and sultana scones - served with homemade…"
August 2019,"Lovely hotel, great service","I stayed at Brown’s during the week with my husband and two teenage children.  The hotel is beautiful and has a lovely homely feel that some five star hotels lack.  The service is amazing, as is always the case at Rocco Forte Hotels.  We had afternoon tea which was lovely.  We wanted to show the children around Mayfair and Brown’s is ideally located for this.  The bedrooms were light and modern.  Children are welcomed at the hotel.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a family trip."
August 2019,Excellent Stay,"I have stayed at the Browns Hotel in London many times with constant service each time. The staff is pleasant and very helpful, the food in the restaurant is great and rooms are always nice and clean. Their location in Mayfair has you steps away or a short cab away from London's best shopping. Will stay there again!"
October 2019,Business Trip,Excellent Hotel with a rich History and well trained staff.  Excellent Mayfair location as well. I enjoyed especially the Dining room and Donovan's bar were a lively but well heeled crowd was every evening. 
September 2019,Fantastic Browns Hotel in London,"Great location makes for ease of movement around London Great accessibility to a vast array of wonderful shops, shows, galleries, museums and restaurants Great staff, made our stay a memorable one Great service"
September 2019,"Marvelous, marvelous marvelous stay.","I am addicted to Rocco Forte Hotels.  This was my 12th stay at one of their hotels, though the first time in London. I had a slightly more superior room and it was delightful - so comfortable and restful. All the staff treat you in a personalised manner and this is welcome.  The concierges are all very helpful.  I enjoyed tea in the Tearoom with my family and we had a lovely time. I wish I could always stay at a Rocco Forte hotel wherever I go!  My addiciton continues."
September 2019,Exceptional,"I visited The English Tearoom for afternoon tea following a recommendation from a friend. Boy am I glad I did!   The food was just divine (the salmon sandwich paired with the sparkling rose is a must). The atmosphere is absolutely charming, especially with the added treat of live piano throughout the afternoon. Customer service is outstanding. I was served by Yonka throughout the afternoon, whose knowledge of tea and charming hospitality was the icing on the cake (excuse the pun).  Thank you to the staff of Browns who allowed me to enjoy a leisurely afternoon tea. The perfect place to while away the hours, and indeed the best afternoon tea I've had in the UK. "
October 2019,The best of many,"Having stayed in various hotels thoroughout London, I find Brown's a perfect balance of excellent and discreet service, friendly and superb quality interior both in the rooms and in all social areas, as well as a perfect location for exclusive stores and restaurants.

Absolutely delightful Afternoon Tea for myself and two daughters-in-law. Perfect service, and a big thank you to the wonderful Yonka! Great memories,"
August 2019,Fabulous stay with my family,I had the pleasure of staying at Brown’s with my baby boy and husband. I was a bit worried that staying in such an establishment with a baby was going to be awkward but I was soon proved wrong! The staff was very kids friendly from the receptionist who plaid with him while I waited for my invoice to the great doorman who gave him chocolate coins . The kids amenities were also a very lovely touch and my son loves his Albie cuddly toy! Thanks to everyone for making this trip a great family experience
September 2019,Great Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I had classic afternoon tea at Brown’s Hotel London. This is our first trip to London, and trying the traditional afternoon tea is one of our best experiences. At well-designed English tea room, we enjoyed the delicious food and tea. Yonka and Zoltan provided pleasant services and made our experience even more wonderful. I recommend this place for a traditional English afternoon tea."
August 2019,Top Rate Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea at Brown's Hotel is not to be missed.  The food is exceptional, especially the Prawn Cocktail and Coronation Chicken and they have an amazing Sparking Tea.  Yonka, Karol and Zoltan provided a first rate and very friendly service and I cannot speak highly enough of them.  10/10"
August 2019,Wow -Browns Hotel Did It Again,"I attended a private event yesterday hosted by Browns Hotel, and the staff could not be any more attentive, there was nothing to much for them. The day ran smoothly and the team was very organised in getting everything done.  The service as always was five star and attention to detail was amazing. From the flower decorations to the table set up, everything was a WOW when you walked in. Jamie, Alex, Kasia, Mahmet, Reggie and Tariq was fantastic and a  true definition of Team work. I will be telling all my friends and clients Browns is the place to be."
August 2019,"Wow, David!",Months later I found David’s business card in my wallet and it reminded me of what a wonderful time we had at Brown’s hotel having high tea. We can’t wait to go back and thank you David for such a memorable experience.
May 2019,Afternoon Tea,Afternoon tea at Browns the whole experience was fantastic.  We were welcomed from the time we entered to the time we left. Our hostess Yonka was exceptional in her knowledge of the menu and the teas in particular. She made you feel very relaxed in how she informed you of what you were eating and where the teas were from. I would recommend Browns for afternoon tea to anyone. I would come back again.
July 2019,Afternoon tea,Really nice experience to enjoy afternoon tea at Brown’s hotel close to Piccadilly Circus. Mr Lorenzo took very good care of us. It was live music and beautiful interior. Strongly recommended! We were two adults and two children.
July 2019,High Tea with Yonka & Zoltan and Drinks with Luca & Roberta,"My wife and I have been in London for about a week having gone to some terrific places such as the cocktail bar at the Duke's hotel and other similar experiences. As good as those were, enjoying high tea and being cared for by Yonka and Zoltan was a truly unparalleled experience that we are certain to repeat during next time's visit.   Yonka & Zoltan were truly passionate about taking care of us and they shared a tremendous amount of knowledge regarding the teas' histories, the pastries, and all the delights. What sets them apart was not just their knowledge and excellent service, but their true love of hospitality. Thank you Yonka & Zoltan!  After spending a little over 2 hours at the tea, we shared with Yonka how much we had enjoyed the Duke's hotel and she explained how the…"
July 2019,"Lovely Service, Charming Atmosphere ","The afternoon tea itself was overpowering, lacked direction and left us very full but with patisseries and cakes that were nice but not to die for.... this pricey afternoon tea haunt has a lovely ambiance and that does make up for its lacklustre food"
July 2019,First Class,Stayed here with my husband over a long weekend. Beautiful hotel. Service and staff first class. Food delicious. Made to feel very special 😊. Nothing too much trouble. We stayed in a suite which was spacious and comfortable. Attention to detail fantastic 🙂
May 2019,Fabulous in every way,I’ve never felt the need to give a review before but this experience was too good not to share. The most perfect stay. Staff absolutely impeccable and attuned to every possible need. Best beds in London. Couldn’t fault in any way. Can’t wait to come back. 
July 2019,"If you don’t have friend’s with a townhouse in Mayfair, stay at Brown’s","Our first stay at Brown’s exceeded our expectations ( we normally stay at The Rosewood )  Yes Brown’s is a beautiful property, yes Brown’s is perfectly placed in Mayfair, yes Brown’s serves well made cocktails, delicious food and perfect scones but the team are the jewel in the crown at Brown’s.  Each interaction was perfect, we were very well looked after with just the right amount of warmth, chat & all delivered with plenty of smiles.  Keep up the good work, we shall be back! "
August 2019,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Browns Hotel for last 3 days of a 14 day trip, and it was the perfect ending.  The staff made us feel at home.  They were wonderful with the kids.   The tea room experience was a highlight of the whole trip.    Breakfast each morning was wonderful, made so mostly by an incredible attentive and welcoming staff.  Thank you.  Hope to be back."
August 2019,GREAT HOTEL,"I just quickly came in to have a look around for a potential booking for my best friends wedding anniversary. The lobby hostess Luisa Caratsch showed me around the common area and evan a special room called the « bell room », where she explained me that the first phonecall was made. I was so impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge towards the hotel. I’m totally going to recommend « The Brown’s »!!!!!!!!"
August 2019,"Exemplary service, the finest food and the best of experiences.","It was my first time in the UK and last day of my work trip and wanted to enjoy the finest of British culture and hospitality before I left.   From the moment I arrived staff were attentive and assisted me with storing my luggage while I waited for the rest of my party.  We enjoyed immensely the traditional high tea and the food was exquisite. The waiter was very knowledgeable regarding the tea selection and was very accommodating to our needs and wants.  The food, tea and service was fit for a king or queen, no wonder Brown's is the preferred for HRH.   Having left and arrived to the airport I had the unfortunate realisation I had possibly left my passport at the hotel.   I rang immediately and the duty manager not only found my passport quickly but also worked with me to help…"
August 2019,Top service! Best hotel in town!,"from arrival (what a warm welcome through the doorman!!) to check in, concierge service our room, breakfast and departure everything was on top level! the location could not be any better at all - right in the middle of mayfair. the brown’s hotel is so unique and special and takes you right back in time to traditional british values. can’t wait to come back! A special thank you to Klaus :-)"
July 2019,Amazing Experience,"We had a lovely weekend at Brown's Hotel. The unbeatable location, a very warm welcome, a real attentive service, great breakfast and a geourgous room made our stay perfect in all respects. I can really recommend this hotel and will stay here the next time we come to London for sure."
June 2019,English Tea Room,"The host was very gracious and welcoming, having come in from the rain. We had an amazing sitting and the service from Yonka and Lorenzo was exceptional. The whole experience was better that we had expected.  Particularly notable was their attention to our food allergy concerns."
August 2019,Lovely drink at the Browns,"My business partner visited me in London and choose the browns hotel. Is 6 years that I live in London and I never been there before and as been a lovely surprise. Dennis at the front desk helped me to get up to my business partner room and organised for our client and us a wonderful table at the bar. Rooms are quite big considering London standards and also really quite. Drinks at the bar where absolutely perfect, my extra dry martini was perfectly done and the service was perfect. By the end of the evening Dennis also helped me to pay all the bills and arrange taxi for my clients and myself.   Absolutely an outstanding customer service!!!"
September 2019,wonderful experience,"A wonderful hotel in a great location. Our suite was everything we could hope for. We were here for our honeymoon, and were definately treated as such. The staff is exceptional. Greatly looking forward to returning."
September 2019,Brown's High Tea,"We attended Brown's Hotel for their High Tea as we always do when in London. The standard of the tea was as high as ever and Lorenzo, our waiter, was attentive and charming. He is a credit to the Hotel. We recommend this as a must-do when visiting London."
September 2019,Fantastic small (medium) luxury hotel,Located in an area with some of the best restaurants shops and business facilities while at the same time is unique in the services rendered. It’s breakfast is memorable while it’s Donovan bar is the best place to end your day. 
September 2019,Best Afternoon Tea in London and most charming hotel. Superb service,"I absolutely love this place. The service, atmosphere and style is perfect. Always a charm visiting, and to the fingertips professional but with personality. Thanks to Lorenzo for perfect service.  Also nice to go over to stylish Donovan Bar after the Afternoon Tea for excellent drinks."
September 2019,Special celebration in Brown's Hotel,"All aspects of our stay were perfect - the room, dining in the restaurant now overseen by Adam Byatt, breakfast and service throughout.  A memorable 5-star experience for a special occasion.  And for those not visiting Brown's for a good while, the new restaurant layout/refurbishment and, more recently, the combined reception/concierge areas work so much better than before."
April 2019,Average customer service,Overall an average experience. Got bumped to a junior suite but the room was dark and was denied changing rooms although I requested a downgrade if I can get some light in the room. The manager at the desk was rude and so was the gate keeper condescending. The saving grace is the Donovan bar where they have excellent staff. They should have kept up with the history of the hotel as many staff didn't know what the hotel stood for and it took them a while to print me something on the history of the hotel. Mixed signals overall hence the review. Make sure your card doesn't decline by mistake. They will devour you with their looks.
August 2019,Afternoon Tea Abounds!,"I can’t even begin to express how wonderful our afternoon was! Manager Alexander Wilson happened to greet us as we entered, and he made the experience all the better with superb attention to detail! The staff was fantastic in service and supply of the amazing sandwiches and fabulous desserts! Alexander remembered our names and checked back in with us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. He gave us a fabulous tour of the property, and answered all of my many questions. I will recommend to any who asks (and those who don’t!) to have tea and stay at the exquisite Brown’s Hotel! Bravo to all of the staff! Thank you for being a highlight of my time in London! Will be back for sure!"
August 2019,Afternoon Tea Delight,"We had another enjoyable experience at Browns having afternoon tea for 3 persons. We were seated early and welcomed by Yonka and David, who were both pleasant and professional. Yonka had extensive knowledge on the tea and helped us make excellent choices. The customer service was exceptional and the quality and choice of teas and food superb. The surroundings are elegant and sophisticated and there is a very quaint atmosphere, unlike the vast restaurant areas in other hotels this gives a very comfortable feeling of being in a private dining room. We enjoy the pianist as a background to the event and we will definitely return. Winston Churchill used to frequent Browns and I believe is reputed to have said “ there are 5 star hotels in London and then, there is Browns..”."
September 2019,Perfect Hotel,"Classic grand deluxe hotel service in London’s best location, east to walk to shops, galleries and restaurants. Professional management has raised the bar in service quality, great bar with famous bartender, traditional English restaurant with freshest ingredients. Luncheon silver trolley. Feels like a townhouse with multiple entrances, beautiful stairs to walk up and down as an alternative to the lifts. Great concierge team to make things happen."
June 2019,Afternoon Tea,"We had a fabulous experience at afternoon tea when visiting London. Yonka went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great time, from helping us find the right champagne to excellent service. The tea was traditional but with innovative details, and it was an overall lovely and relaxing experience with great atmosphere."
June 2019,Magnificent Browns,"Browns Hotel is ideally located . It is a brilliantly run hotel where all departments of staff are helpful polite and seem proud to be working there , you get the personalized treatment, don’t look further you won’t find better anywhere. My favorite city hotel in the world still after 43 years of business and holiday travel "
June 2019,English tea at Brown's Hotel,"Can't think of a better experience than the one Yonka and Zoltan provided for my friend and I as we had afternoon tea. The food was gorgeous and delivered with care, the live piano music created a calm atmosphere, and the service was personal but not over-bearing. Before we went, we wondered what we would do for two hours at tea, but the leisurely yet attentive pace of service and the beauty of the environment lent itself to conversation and enjoyment."
June 2019,Fabulous Hotel,This is a top rate hotel in a lovely part of London. The staff are incredibly kind and helpful and the accommodations are first rate! The restaurant is wonderful and the bar for late night drinks or afternoon tea is terrific.  
June 2019,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"My friend and I returned to Brown's on the 08/06/2019 for Afternoon Tea. We had really wonderful experience (as usual), Yonka and Karol were attentive and highly professional. Brown's is a must do! And, I will be back!"
June 2019,"Great Location, Wonderful Service","The Brown's Hotel is in the perfect location in London and has so many unique benefits.  The House Bentley car was such a fun touch and we loved our dinner at Beck's.    The kid's amenities were some of the best I've seen-- personalized sheets, books, stuffed animals, bath products and even a child umbrella in the closet.  My daughter was definitely in heaven!"
June 2019,Making memories.. superb,"I brought my 11 Grand daughter for afternoon tea at the English Tea room as part of her weekend away in London. What a wonderful experience firstly by being greeted so warmly as we exited our cab at the door by your amazing commisionair to the superb service, delicious sandwiches and cakes and pastries and finally to the birthday acknowledgement for Gracie's birthday with a little cake,candle and happy birthday sung.  Thank you Brown's Hotel you are the most wonderful of hotels,with an amazing team."
May 2019,Exceptional in every eay,"Brown’s is what a great hotel should be. Excellent Mayfair location, surrounded by good restaurants & art galleries, and a short walk to most theaters. Excellent rooms, dining room, bar & fitness center & the Concierges are the very best. Wouldn’t think of staying anywhere else — ever!"
May 2019,Classic hotel with great location,"The hotel is very conveniently located, walking distance to many good restaurants and shopping. A short taxi ride to some great museums. The restaurant was excellent. We had a very nice afternoon tea and the bar was warm and welcoming. The concierge was very helpful with suggestions and restaurant reservations. A perk was the Bentley car service that drove us to nearby restaurants."
May 2019,Brown’s Charming British Tea,"Come here for a relaxing cup of tea with delicious sandwiches, scones, and pastries. It’s a charmingly old-fashioned place, with friendly service and a good but quiet pianist. We especially enjoyed talking to Yonka (who makes her own special tea with rosebuds) about the history of the hotel, and Lorenzo."
May 2019,Special celebration - wonderful afternoon tea,"This was a long awaited reunion for me and a dear American friend. We have kept in touch but not met for 35 years so it was a very special day. My husband and I wanted to give her a true London experience so Browns was the obvious choice. It has long been our favourite afternoon tea restaurant and they did not disappoint. The food was delicious with divine sandwiches and exquisite cakes. The menu has just been changed and the flavours are delivered with real thought and finesse.   The tea menu is extensive and Browns give you the opportunity to taste a few. Our 'tea sommelier' Yonka was fantastic. She kept us well fed and watered and was determined to make sure we had a great time. Service was wonderful, discreet, attentive and friendly. Yonka and Zoltan between them made the…"
February 2019,Quintessentially English,"I have been several times over the past year for drinks and to dine and every time the service is suoerb, staff wonderful, drinks and food lovely. The new bar is stunning but the one steadfastly unchanging aspect of this hotel is the service from the staff. As you might expect from a hotel of this calibre service is faultless. Once I forgot to bring my reading glasses and within minutes was presented with a pair (new) from a member of the bar staff. Frankly, this hotel is a home from home, welcoming and friendly. If you are in London at all then pop in if only to have a drink at their bar. Just off Piccadilly, hidden gem."
May 2019,Thank you Browns,"I appreciated all the quaint aspects of my stay, and whilst this is my first time in the last 10 years of staying in a hotel other than the Berkeley, Connaught or Claridges, I don’t feel that I lost out.   Thank you all for the kind attention that I received.  👍  "
April 2019,Best afternoon tea ever,"Our experience at Browns hotel tea room was simply wonderful. The food was delicious as well as the tea selection. We managed to get the best table, the one by the window and also the best waitress, Yonka. Her services was exceptional which made the whole experience even better. The atmosphere was cosy, ideal for a chilly afternoon and the piano music in the background, the cheery on cake!  Already looking forward to our next visit. Thank you Browns hotel for such a lovely afternoon."
April 2019,A bit like a B&B which is trying hard,"The restaurant and lounge etc. are really nicely done.  I had wanted to stay here for ages.  I was very sadly disappointed by the room - small, a bit run down and not that comfortable - all looked very much like a slightly tired B&B.  This is a shame since I've stayed in a few other Rocco Forte hotels and they've been good."
April 2019,A truly stunning experience ,"We have just floated home from a truly exceptional stay at Brown’s. The moment we arrived, John McLean and his team welcomed us to a beautiful home from home and it felt that helping me to celebrate my birthday was their only focus. Our suite was generous, beautifully decorated and very well equipped. The service was personal, attentive, friendly and discreet. From the extensive delicious cocktail list in Mr Calabrese’s bar to the exquisite food at Beck’s, no detail is too small and nothing is too much trouble. The atmosphere throughout was warm and welcoming and the seemingly effortless way that we were made to feel special made for a truly stunning experience. I cannot thank John and his team enough. We will definitely be back. "
March 2019,"Immaculate hotel, best nights sleep",What a great hotel! The Location in Mayfair is perfect for serious shoppers as a stones throw from Bond Street.  Staff are welcoming and delightful and nothing was to much trouble. It was my sons birthday and on our return we had a bottle of champagne and birthday cake placed in our room. These little touches just add to and enhance the experience.  The hotel itself is maintained to the highest level throughout and the beds are amazing. We have stayed there a couple of time now and will definitely be returning in the future.
April 2019,BEST customer service!,"Best customer service in London! I called to set up birthday gift for a friend staying there, and they went beyond my expectations and completely hassle free! And it was complimentary on their behalf! It’s a must stay! :) George-Hiley Jones made this possible!"
March 2019,Browns - Mayfair,We recently visited Browns for two nights to celebrate my sons birthday. Fabulous location and beautiful hotel. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and even provided a birthday cake and bottle of champagne to help us celebrate. Can’t wait to return
April 2019,The Fabulous Brown’s Hotel,"High Tea in the tea room was outstanding. The ambiance, champagne, sandwiches, scones and attention to detail are unsurpassed. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. I asked if I could see the Kipling Suite and they took me there! It was beautiful and amazing. I love the Brown’s Hotel! Stay there if you can."
February 2019,The ultimate afternoon tea,"We visited Browns for afternoon tea, as always it was excellent, great service sandwiches were fresh, salted beef and pickle were my favourite. The scones were perfect and the rest of the cakes amazing, service was excellent."
February 2019,"Absolutely FIRST CLASS stay in Brown's Hotel, London","From start to finish our trip to Brown's Hotel was first class! The staff were very attentive upon arrival and check in and we were allocated beautiful rooms overlooking Albemarle Steeet. Having stayed in Brown's several times before I can truly say it is even better than ever. George was on the desk and looked after us so well; ensuring our afternoon tea was ready once we were all checked in. I cannot stress how helpful everyone was from the gentlemen at the door, Lara on reception to the restaurant staff throughout our stay. Our breakfasts were superb with a generous array of fresh fruit, and cooked foods on offer. The recent refurbishment of the hotel restaurant is very welcome making it even more bright and airy than before. Service and presentation were top notch.  This…"
February 2019,Best way to celebrate a birthday,I was in London for work and my cousin came across for my birthday. I’ve been to Browns hotel before and was impressed with their service and tea time do I thought we would try it again so she could experience. Did not disappoint at all. Staff was lovely they even brought out a small piece of cake and played happy birthday. The piano player was wonderful too. I was so impressed that I will be back for sure!
February 2019,London Living Wage,On my recent stay at Browns Hotel London I was shocked to find out that Room Attendants are not even paid London Living Wage ( approx £10 per hour). I question the ethics of Rocco . Don’t they have a moral obligation to make sure that their hard working staff are rewarded justly for their hard work and dedication?? It is shameful that companies like Rocco who charge their customers through the nose for their stay at the hotel don’t even pay a decent wage to their staff . I would appreciate a reply from the management on this issue .
January 2019,Welcome to London afternoon tea ,"We booked a traditional afternoon tea on Sunday 27th January, for a group of four, as a welcome to London for our friend who had just gotten married and moved to London from up north.  We were greeted by Cilla, who was so warm and friendly. Without even asking, she checked whether the kitchen had been able to source halal meat that day, and on finding that they hadn't she ensured that there were plenty of seafood options available to three of our four guests.  We had mentioned that it was our friend's birthday a few days prior to attending, and she was kind enough to arrange a cake and candles to be brought out for her during our tea.  David and Lorenzo looked after us impeccably for the rest of our tea, always topping up our teas without us even asking and on hand to answer any…"
February 2019,Fabulous lunch,"Had a delightful lunch here yesterday. A glass of Ferrari in the bar to start . Our starters of scallops were cooked just right and flavoursome,  the chateau Brion med-rare cooked to perfection for the main course the flavours were amazing . A chilled bottle of Greco del tuffo perfect . Followed by a selection of cheeses. The service was very attentive. I look forward to my next visit !"
December 2018,English,"Wonderful!!! Real 5-star.   Best Breakfast, made to order with amazing environment.   Very ‘English’.  Great service, wonderful, comfortable room.  Location in Mayfair is as good as it gets.   Spoil yourself and enjoy."
August 2018,One of the BEST Hotels in the world! A Bliss!,"As a former stewardess I have been travelling around the world for many years. BROWN'S is one of the most outstanding Hotels I have ever stayed! It's discreet luxury, very chic. The place to be if you stay in London!  When you are an ""habitué""  they will call you by your name and you feel immediately at home. JOHN, the doorman gave me such a warm welcome!  The staff is especially attentive and professional. They spoiled me so much!  -DAVID, the head Concierge and his team choose an excellent italian restaurant and assisted me to organize my stay.  - Don't miss a healing Thai massage by KARMINI!  - The accomodation is so comfortable, you don't want lo leave this cosy bed with Frette linen. Walk-in shower. Excellent housekeeping. All products are ecofriendly. They are conscious to…"
October 2018,A unique and historical London hotel,"The positives: - The location of Brown's Hotel is hard to beat. Within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Fortnum & Masons, Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street. - It's located on a quiet one way street despite being in the centre of busy London. - The staff are wonderful and willing to readily help with anything. - It has a rich history (first hotel in London) with old world charm and sophistication. - The high tea is amazing  Some unavoidable negatives: - Due to the location, it is quite expensive. - As it is in fact several old houses put together to form the hotel, the layout of the hallways and rooms can be a little strange. - Depending on the room, it could be a little dark and tight for space.  Overall, I thought Brown's was a very nice hotel and appreciated the…"
September 2018,Work Week At Brown's Hotel,"My business partner and I stayed in two separate rooms at this hotel during fashion week. The rooms were OK. The hallways and the rooms felt a bit small and claustrophobic. Our travel agent booked our rooms and we had a great deal with an upgrade included so I was all set to be OK with it. But it was the service in general was off -- nothing was terrible but some of the staff interactions felt a bit hostile and overly snobbish. For instance, we needed to buy a basic business item and I asked the staff if they could help us find out where to do so. The concierge just said 'no.'  For a five star hotel I expected they would have at least made a few in-house calls or inquiries or at least pretended to consider their options but the answer was just a curt 'no.' (And a manger…"
March 2019,A destination in itself,"Brown's is simply an exceptional place to stay. The staff are professional but friendly and remember your name. The food in Buck's as well as Donovan's Bar is great, whether you're there for breakfast or afternoon tea, or even a late night drink (having said this, the bar does get very busy on a Saturday night so the lounge is a quieter alternative). While the rooms are compact (which is typically for the area and vintage of the building; see similar places such as St Ermins') they are by no means 'poky' and are very well designed and comfortable. To top it off, the location cannot be beaten - right on the doorstep of Piccadilly and in the heart of the best shopping in London."
March 2019,To meet our son on mother’s day,Beautiful substantial room and bathroom.  Colourful plant oriented wallpaper in public area. Great breakfast. Nice bar where the nuts with truffles say it all in a delicious way. The service was quick and attentive although actually getting things took time as staff were always paying attention to someone.   
July 2018,great hih tea,"Spending a week-end with friends in London and as it was their first time, I thought a British High-Tea would be appropriate as it remains a great tradition. So what would be better than this hotel which displays the English style and luxury at its best to have it.  We had a wonderful time and even if we were not hotel guests but booked separately, the service has been fantastic, subtile, classy, smiling and flawless!  My friends and I were delighted by the experience as not only the service was flawless, the food was great and it is an understatement! The price is matching the quality so no issues there and I really recommend to enjoy the tasting experience in a relaxing environment and far away from the stress of the city…  I highly recommend the place, worth visiting and…"
March 2019,Brown’s Hotel - in a class of it’s own,"I had a fantastic trip to Brown’s Hotel a few weeks ago. From the minute we arrived we were made to feel at home, from the doorman to Laura on reception to John McLean, the Hotel Manager, everyone was so welcoming and friendly. What struck me the most was how welcoming all the staff were to my 4 year old son. He got given an Alby toy and book (both still firm favourites) and even though he loves chatting to people endlessly, everyone always had time for him.   The afternoon tea was wonderful (especially with a glass of champagne!) and the breakfast was one of the best I’ve ever had.   Our room was beautiful and all the small details were exquisite.   A truly fabulous hotel."
March 2019,What a fantastic dining experience!,"I went to Brown's last week with a friend I wanted to impress. Well, I truly succeeded! We had a fantastic experience: everything was superb-location, menu, the atmosphere and above all the staff! The dishes were classy, innovative and with a touch of exotic. The flagship dish of Heinz Beck (Fagottelli), his signature dish never changed in 15 years, was superb, an explosion of flavors. The Staff who attended us was extremely professional, smiling and really really knowledgeable. Nothing was left unexplained or left to chance! Especially the two Italian guys who were assigned to our table, named Stefano and Niccolo' were so helpful, warm and made us feel pampered. Wonderful detailing was another key aspect that amazed me. A special thank to the head sommelier and staff manager,…"
March 2019,Great hotel,"I just returned from spending 8 days at Brown's Hotel in London.  This was my first time and, I can assure everyone who reads this, that it will not be my last. The staff is the most welcoming and accommodating of any hotel I have stayed at in London.  From the doorman, receptionist, bellman, restaurant staff and bar staff there was an obvious air of professionalism mixed with friendliness and care.  I stayed in a junior suite that faced Albermarle street.  No street noise. Very comfortable and large.  Large bathrooms. Quiet and luxurious.  The restaurant was fabulous.  Excellent food from breakfast through to evening dinner.  The hostesses were very kind and the staff in the restaurant were spectacularly kind and friendly.  Talk to Angelo, the sommelier, if you want to meet the…"
November 2018,Quick coffee meeting,Browns is a hidden gem in the heart of Mayfair. Rooms are a good size and the service is excellent. I would 100% stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for somewhere boutique to stay in London.
October 2018,Brief stay,Quick coffee meeting - the staff were able to accommodate a table for two. The team are lovely here and we really felt welcomed as well as able to conduct our business. I’ve been here for a drink in the evening too which is quite a lively atmosphere and worth coming in.
November 2018,Constant Disappointment,"Wonderful 2 night stay. The staff were magnificent, nothing was a bother! The bar & restaurant were superb. Understated elegance! A little pricey but worth the money. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Fruit & water we’re a lovely touch."
September 2018,Best location and service,I have now been staying at  Browns Hotel quite often and what I have noticed over my last three stays is there is never any shower gel in sight but shampoo in the bottles labelled Shower Gel. I am sure this is not mis labelling at the manufacturers but this is done at the hotel. You call this a five star hotel?? Really?? What does the management think we are?? Frankly I think Browns Hotel needs to buck up its ideas and provide its guests the service they pay for.
November 2018,Excellent supper,"The hotel is a pearl nested in the best location in town: Mayfair. Although it’s a busy neighborhood, the hotel is in a very quiet street.  All employees are very friendly, highly qualified and really strive to make one feel at home. The bar opens until late and has a wide variety of drinks."
November 2018,"Divine dinner, wine and magical G and T","As always, Browns didn’t disappoint. First class, relaxing manicure, followed by an excellent supper. The service was fantastic and staff friendly and helpful. Wonderful, buzzy atmosphere in the bar and the food was sensational. Thank you!"
November 2018,Tea for two,Went with 5 friends as a spoiling treat for dinner on Friday night. Food was as high a quality as you would expect and service impeccable and personable. Also highly recommend a Flower Power gin and tonic which changes colour in front of you!
November 2018,Always Absolutely Amazing,"My wife and I have been coming to Browns for over 20 years (we had one of our first dates there). In an age which everything seems to change, and not always for the better, it is reassuring that afternoon tea at Browns is still exceptional. Superb, unhurried service, comfortable and a lovely atmosphere make it the perfect place to spend a chilly afternoon. Already looking forward to our next visit. Thank you Browns, and keep up the good work."
October 2018,Best Hotel in London,"If we could give Brown's 100 stars we would. We just returned from our second visit to London and our second time staying at the hotel. To say that this is a luxury property is spot on. The service is outstanding, and the staff is so friendly and welcoming. The property is so beautiful and boasts so much history and a perfect location. We were able to walk to so many locations.   David, the Head Concierge, is extraordinary. He assisted us with dinner reservations nightly, tips for planning activities during the day, and even helped me with hair appointments at a local salon.   The rooms are gorgeous and large for a European hotel. We love the Donovan Bar for drinks at night (best bar nuts and drink menu ever). We have stayed in many hotels all over the world and Brown's is hands…"
October 2018,An Amazing Experience,"We stayed at Brown's over the weekend and it is definitely the best hotel we have stayed in in London. Set between two of the nicest shopping streets in Mayfair, it is better located than many other nearby hotels which we have stayed in previously. The rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated and very clean with extremely comfortable beds. All the staff we encountered went out of their way to make us feel welcome, especially the doormen and porters who greeted us by name each morning. The concierge team were also all excellent, they were full of great recommendations for bars and restaurants (they managed to get us a table at Hide, the best new restaurant in London) as well as assisting us with transport when we left. Besides being helpful and knowledgeable, they were all very…"
March 2019,Mr B,"An outstanding, luxurious and perfect evening in the heart of London. A fantastic large room was presented with exquisite fixtures and fittings, plus extras such as self making pop corn machine, large tv, dress down service and the rest!   Becks restaurant has the most amazing tasting food and the bar within the hotel make the best cocktails! This was by far the best stay I’ve had in London but it does come at a price!!   A free taxi would give you a ride within 2 miles of the hotel in a luxury car.   The staff were fantastic and very attentive to us and all other customers. Very up market service and you are made to feel like royalty!"
March 2019,Wow!!!,"Brown‘s Hotel is maybe one of the best hotels (if not THE Best hotel) I‘ve stayed at in London!  Everyone was so nice and genuinely friendly!  From door staff to reception/Concierge to bar and restaurant staff!   In other hotels I often feel like being „just another guest“ at Brown‘s on the other hand I felt like coming home!   The supervisor (I believe she was) at the Donovan bar was great to talk to! While chatting, we actually realised her brother lives just in the same area where I was born and grew up! What a coincidence, especially in a huge city like London!   A great thanks as well to Victoria (I believe her name was) at Guest relations! She really made my stay, as she told me of things to do and see in London I did not know of.  All in all it was a great stay and I can…"
March 2019,Relaxed luxury,"We met with old and new friends for a weekend in London. It was our first time at Browns but hopefully not out last. The welcome was warm, the champagne cold and the bed amazing. Breakfast was the best I’ve had for years. Can’t wait for an excuse to go back."
February 2019,Doing London Right!,"We spent 5 days in London last week visiting with our daughter who is studying abroad. I had not stayed at Brown's for many years, but wanted that old school, afternoon tea, elegant feeling, so we returned. The hotel has been completely renovated, has all the latest amenities, but still the old world charm, and the service is amazing. We literally became friends with the whole staff, starting with the front desk manager, Alex. We will definitely return on our next trip. If you haven't been, start with the afternoon tea!"
September 2018,Mary K,"My family organised a cream tea for a 70th Birthday surprise for my sister. We had great difficulty for finding a venue big enough for everyone until we came across Browns Hotel. Everything about the booking, which was mainly by email, was easy and when telephoning with questions the Staff were so helpful and pleasant. When arriving at Browns we were greated with a brilliant welcome and showed to our room, nothing was too much trouble. Upon the arrival of the afternoon tea the food, which was lovely, kept coming and the Staff were so pleasant and attentive were there for our every need but without being intrusive. Once finished, we left, very full but very happy with our experience. I would like to thank the Staff for their service, kindness and help in making this special day…"
September 2018,CEO CCG,Kudos to Givi the luggage porter at Browns hotel London. My colleague and I were there on business. I thought I had my act together leaving hotel. Givi asked me if I had my passport. Nooooo. Years of travel and it was at the bottom of my luggage. As I was rooting through the bag he noticed I’d left my new jacket. Whew. Thank you Givi and Browns...great hotel and staffed the way only the British do!
September 2018,Lovely Hotel with a couple of niggles,"Stayed at Browns for the first time after my partner booked a four night break . The hotel is the oldest in London and we found it very welcoming , however there were a few areas which could be improved . We had booked an executive room which was very disappointing- the view was a wall a few feet from the window which made the room very dark and depressing . It was so dull that we paid for an upgrade to a deluxe room which was lovely and bright although perhaps needed some updating eg lamp shades loose , lamps not working , skirting scuffed . We had asked for tea & coffee facilities to be provided but this had not been supplied so we had to ask again - a little niggle but annoying . This tray was not maintained throughout our stay ie cups not washed , tea bags and milk  not…"
August 2018,THE BEST HOTEL,"This Hotel is perfection in all respects. On our trip we stayed in the finest hotels in the United Kingdom....the Brown was our last before returning to the U.S. On arrival they upgraded us to an amazing suite as a present from them for our anniversary. This oldest hotel in London has the most modern amenities and, by far, the best service anywhere. I think someone might have gotten fired if we had to even open a door for ourselves. Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff, excellent location and great food. We hated to leave there. We will be at Browns on any trip we make to London in the future."
September 2018,The true British Experience ,"What a wonderful luxury hotel ! Even before we arrived the reservation was amazing. We mentioned we will probably go to a show and the Lady who took our reservation sent us a few links with the most recent shows in London and offer her assistance to book the tickets for us.  When we arrived the doorman welcome us so well, we didn't even had to think of our luggages that he already took us to the reception desk where the receptionist did our check in. We were met by the french General Manager who remembered us from our previous stay and welcome us back. The amenities in our room were lovely and we even had a bag of snacks ready with a handwritten card wishing us a good day out... A day of Shopping which my husband wasn't excited about. till we found in the bag the address of a…"
August 2018,I will be back very soon,"What an amazing Hotel ,  the staff are so friendly and attentive ,  no request is to difficult and really do put their best foot forward.  The rooms were larger than expected as we all know most hotels in London do have a big space problem, and the bed was incredibly comfy to sleep in.  I do not usually put comments up on trip adviser but for exceptional service I think it is important to say well done when things are done right.  Will definitely choose here again for my next special occasion."
August 2018,12 days and nights at Brown's hotel in Mayfair London.,"We have often stayed in London… But have never received service, food and all-round hospitality that we received at Brown's.  All concierges were exceptional but I must make special mention of David Young who went out of his way to make our holiday exceptional. There was no task too difficult,  no question that was not answered to our satisfaction. The reception desk, the restaurant staff all the amenities were first-rate. When next we visit London our first stop will be Brown's hotel in Mayfair.  We could not help but mention to our friends in Australia about Brown's, I am not exaggerating when I say London was made very special we felt like we were coming home each evening and even though all services were professional we felt like we were among family.  Bruce Sherlock Sydney…"
January 2019,Newly refurbished restaurant is lovely...,"Though it's been open for a bit, I just got back to London and had lunch in the restaurant.  It's a beautiful room with great wall paper and overall design.  The linen and the glassware are superb.  Lunch itself was pleasant and tasty and completely reasonable price wise.  The wine list is exceptionally impressive.  Separately - I've been to Brown for tea and it's one of the best in London.  everything from sandwiches to sweets and fruit.  Can't go wrong."
January 2019,Excellent stay this time at Brown’s,"After having had some issues last time we stayed at this property we decided to have another go. This time everything was perfect. We received a very nice welcome from Janine Mallia, front of house manager, and an excellent upgrade. Concierge did an excellent job booking restaurants, theatre etc for us. All in all we were very pleased. The only potential issue is that the breakfast room can sometimes be very full since many guests from outside come to the hotel for breakfast and business discussions. Luckily I am an early bird so I did have a nice table each morning before the crowds arrived. I also enjoyed the fitness room and my wife was very well taken care of in the Spa."
January 2019,Amazing service in a beautiful hotel!,"My partner and I were upgraded into a classic suite and it was gorgeous - imagine watching TV from your tub!  But what is more, the service was impeccable and the team were insanely kind!  They knew we were there to celebrate our birthdays and they went above and beyond to treat us and make our stay extra special and just amazing!  Thank you Brown's team... and mostly, thank you to Janine, the Hotel Manager, who was just incredibly attentive, caring, thoughtful and overall fabulous!"
January 2019,Favorite Part of Our Trip!,"My sister and I had the best time doing the afternoon tea at Brown’s Hotel. The food was of amazing quality and the decor was perfect. Our server Yonka made the experience incredible. Aside from being a pleasure to talk to, her knowledge of the afternoon tea was extremely impressive. We wish she could have sat down and joined us! We’re definitely bringing our grandma back from the US to visit the Brown’s Hotel and meet Yonka!"
September 2018,Very Well Located,"An older hotel with some physical shortcomings, Brown’s seems to cater mostly to upper-class British clients who have been coming for years, if not generations.  The staff are well-trained, warm, and helpful. Practically hundreds of restaurants and high-end shops are within a 5-10 minute walk, as are major tourist draws like Piccadilly Circus, Regent St., Green Park, Hyde Park, the Burlington Arcade, others.  Notable deficiencies were a lack of coffee-making facilities, poorly-designed bathroom (constrained by the old structure), and really poor, overpriced breakfast at Beck’s, which serves as their coffee shop."
August 2018,Home Away from home!,"Brown’s Hotel is just right.  Not too large, not too small.  The rooms are large and decorated with lovely little pops of colour, the bathrooms are spacious and the restaurant and bar are both AMAZING.  Great location, right next to all of the high end shops on Old Bond and New Bond Streets, not far from Soho or Green Park, and an easy walk to Westminster to check off any touristy sites on your list.  I travel a LOT, so staff and service is of the utmost importance.  Brown’s has nailed both.  Everyone is spot on from the cdoorman (who celebrates his birthday today!), to the front desk staff who always have smiles, to the servers in the restaurant and in the Donovan Bar who are attentive, yet not overbearing.  When I checked in on Saturday, my room wasn’t yet ready, so I went to…"
August 2018,JOHN VLASSOPOLOS,"The Browns hotel is perfectly located in Mayfair London in close proximity to all the museums and great restaurants, theatre district and main street shopping of Bond and Oxford St , with all high end boutique stores including Selfridges The rooms were excellent and the concierge and staff at Browns hotel The in house Italian restaurant was of exceptionally high quality and standard and highly recommended."
August 2018,Perfectly lovely,"My new favorite spot in London. I have nothing even remotely negative to say. The room was beautiful and spotless, the staff attentive, and the services exceptional. The location could not be beat. Walking distance everywhere."
January 2019,Best Tea in London,"The experience of afternoon tea in at Brown's is undoubtedly the best in London.  Highlight of our New Year's trip, and that's saying a lot.  Atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  Service is friendly and impeccable.  Quality of food and selection of teas top notch.  Recommend the Gold."
December 2018,Perfect for a night in London during the Christmas Season!,"We stayed the weekend just before Christmas and had a lovely stay with a very warm and friendly welcome from both the doorman and the receptionist when we checked-in.  There had been a mix-up with our booking, which had been made via a third party.  The e'mail stated breakfast was included in the room rate, but this wasn't the case.  This has happened on a previous occasion at another hotel when using this particular hotel booking website, resulting in a rather lengthy phone call to sort it out.  In this instance however the receptionist immediately offered complimentary breakfast with no fuss, to save us the hassle of trying to sort it out, which was very much appreciated. The bedroom was large, light and airy and the bathroom was huge for a central London hotel.    The hotel…"
December 2018,Graciousness beyond the norm.....,"We chose Brown's because of its reputation for being family friendly, and its location.  We were thrilled on both counts.  The staff and accommodations could not have been more gracious, and our teen-age granddaughters were delighted with our breakfasts and high tea.  At the end of a busy day of touring, coming back to Brown's truly felt like coming home.  Kudos to a diligent, professional and truly friendly staff and a beautifully updated historic hotel."
December 2018,Super stay,"Stayed in December for 3 nights in a classic corner suite.  Very much enjoyed our stay, Madga in reservations was excellent and really set the stay up to be lovely, which was very much appreciated as it was our 35th anniversary.  The suite was lovely, overlooking the street and the breakfast service in room was excellent both in terms of the quality of food and the service, especially on our last day when we had an early flight and asked for a continental breakfast at 4am - they came and set it up in the room, regardless of the very early time - quite exceptional.  We had asked for a quiet private room and they had really thought about our needs.  Housekeeping was also excellent - very clean and tidy, and very much enjoyed the bed linens and furnishing and design.  Bathroom was…"
December 2018,Remarkable,4th stay at the Brown’s hotel. That was not the best one but this is still a fantastic place to enjoy the Christmas period in London. The renovated Donovan Bar is great and Beck finally found his place. 
July 2018,Great central location with outstanding service,"This was my first stay at Brown's in Mayfair, and I was favorably impressed. But as a Rocco Forte hotel, this is what I've come to expect. I'll say this: I've stayed in several Rocco Forte hotels over the years, and I've never been disappointed. It's a bit of an anachronism; there just do not seem to be any lapses or exceptions to their quality - especially when it comes to service. I've wondered if employees are all put through a charm school somewhere that makes them ever so pleasant, courteous and helpful. Truly... I have absolutely no financial interest in this organization, but service-wise, they seem to operate on a higher plane that the rest of the industry.   But back to Brown's: Reservations and check-in were smooth as silk. The staff arranged an early check-in for us,…"
July 2018,Wedding anniversary stay,"Spent two nights at Brown’s to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. First time here, but we will undoubtedly be back. It’s beautifully appointed, with charming public areas and gorgeous, spacious rooms. Donovan’s bar I would highly recommend for cocktails, but worth reserving a table, even as a resident as it can get busy. Our room was beautiful, with high ceilings and an excellent finish. Immaculate I would say, which can’t always be said, even of high class hotels. The bathroom was similarly stunning, with a large bath and shower, spotlessly clean and well stocked. Final note is the staff. Quite brilliant. Friendly, helpful and attentive without being over-facing. Having booked our stay, the hotel made contact to ask the occasion of our visit. I mentioned the anniversary…"
January 2018,Great hotel,"This hotel was where having High Tea  was introduced to the world. The atmosphere,elegance, and service are  second to none. This hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace. I Will definitely come back to visit again!"
July 2018,The Hotel workers are as one of your family members..,The hotel workers are very friendly and helpful. Especially Givi and George. They are very fond of their job. Excellent! The main restaurant’s new tastes are well chosen and can be developed..luxury boutique hotel..
July 2018,Splendid in every way,Great hotel and service and amazing location. First visit to London with the kids and we were able to navigate our way seamlessly and put together a great itinerary with the help of able concierge staff
July 2018,Good choice for Luxury stay in central London,"I booked the Brown's hotel through the FHR programs of AMEX, which I can definitely recommend since a booking comes with perks. Because it was holiday season, I did not receive an early check-in or an upgrade, the hotel was fully booked. I was promised a phone call when my room would be available, but this never materialised. By the time we arrived back in the hotel the room was ready and luggage had been arranged in there.   The hotel is classic in style, but has been modernised over the years. There are only 2 elevators, with one hidden in the back of the building. The floors are old, so expect some creaking of wood or small level differences, even in the room. Service was in general good and friendly. There is a spa and gym room but no pool.   The room was a Junior Suite on…"
July 2018,Outstanding in Every Way,"We just stayed at the Browns Hotel a few days ago.  The service in every aspect of the hotel was phenomenal.  Whether it was the concierge, front desk, the restaurant, in room dining, bell men, housekeeping service; we were so pleased and were so comfortable with our home family.  In addition, the Browns Hotel is in an excellent location.  We look forward to going back to London and staying there again!  "
July 2018,60th birthday,"Two days with family to celebrate my 60th birthday. We were looked after very well, with nothing too much trouble. Balloons, canapes, cake, champagne were all arranged without fuss or difficulty. Breakfast was excellent and even when we were kept waiting to be seated, there were apologies and efforts to sort out a table quickly. The rooms were adjoining as requested, spacious and comfortable.  Thoroughly recommend and will go back."
July 2018,Unparalleled service,"The service at Brown's hotel is exceptional. Everyone who works there has a positive, friendly attitude and a desire to ensure they meet all of your needs. It's the perfect size hotel to provide such personal service, and it's the perfect location to see all of the sites and enjoy fine dining. The rooms were comfortable and convenient if adjoining with another room. Highly recommend for couples, families or business."
June 2018,Love my home in London,"Been staying at the Browns for 2 decades. My home in London. Love the place and one of my favorite hotels globally.  And I'm happy to report its never been better than now. Just spent a few nights there. Felt I owed it to the staff to say, ""Well done!"". The spirit of the place and the quality of the people... Just perfect. And I echo the prior reviewer that Janine is absolutely 1st rate, an extremely professional and truly caring manager."
October 2018,Agatha christie slept here.,"Brown's Hotel was portrayed by Christie as a somewhat dowdy and sinister establishment in AT BERTRAMS HOTEL. Today, it is, in fact, a wonderful townhouse hotel with a cheerful staff and a great new Italian restaurant ""Beck"". The Bar is busy and afternoon tea is also a big attraction. Some  rooms look out on a interior space but trouble has been taken to provide each window with a box of miniature shrubs. Its' location is superb and if you are really lucky, you might snag a lift in the house Bentley (i did)."
October 2018,Excellent,"We stayed at Brown's Hotel Mayfair for 3 nights last week. We were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and my wife's birthday. Our room was spotlessly clean and the service was fantastic. The staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast was lovely with an extensive menu and buffet. The hotel is very central to all of London's top spots and within walking distance of the West End, Covent Garden and Piccadilly. We highly recommend Brown's Hotel."
December 2017,Wonderful !,My husband took me here for our anniversary as a treat and it was just wonderful.  The staff are very attentive and the rooms very relaxing and traditional.  It was the perfect base to explore the shops in the west end such as harrods and for visiting the theatre (Les Miserables was also great).  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.
October 2018,Afternoon tea in style,"Six of us celebrated a friend's birthday here and we all were delighted with our choice.   A friendly greeting as we entered from a wet Albermarle Street and a glass of chilled blackcurrant tea was followed by a wonderful array of sandwiches, small buns etc with very interesting fillings and toppings. These were constantly replenished and likewise our wide variety of teas in gleaming indiviual pots were poured and refreshed without hesitation.  This was followed by a selection of interesting small pastries and warm scones with home-made jam and thick cream.  The service was faultless and very friendly and the elegant pianist added a wonderful background to our celebration.   Staying well beyond our allocated timed tea slot but at no time were we rushed and it could not have been…"
October 2018,"Historic Brown’s Hotel, Mayfield, London","Brown’s Hotel is elegant, comfortable and tastefully decorated. It is conveniently situated in the heart of London close to art galleries, museums, theatres, shops, restaurants, Royal Parks all within easy walking or running distance. Public and taxi transportationis also conveniently at hand.   The reception and service at Brown’s is always courteous and friendly and the restaurant is extremely good as is breakfast. Refer to their comprehensive website for details.   Brown’s is highly recommended not only because it has an illustrious past but the fact that it is provides a quiet, relaxing and comfortable experience for travellers.  This is especially important after a long haul flight."
October 2018,Faultless,"After so many disappointing stays in alternative London hotels , this will definitely be THE only option for me in London . From the minute I arrived, the check in staff had the premium factor expected of Mayfair but with the home from home element . The conceirge team ( David in particular ) could not have been more helpful having arranged, with little notice , reservations at London’s top restaurants , a make up artist and hairdresser at the drop of a hat . The food and drink was of such a high level too and I can’t wait to return next month"
December 2018,another fabulous pre-Christmas stay at Browns,"Christmas starts properly with a stay in this wonderful hotel and this year was no exception.  So lovely to be welcomed by long term staff, feels like coming home.  The Christmas decorations are amazing, we loved the look and feel of the newly refurbished dining room for breakfast in the morning and thank you for upgrading us to one of your wonderful suites.  The beds are still the most comfortable we have ever slept in.  Albermarle Street looked very festive with the lights outside - all in all a huge pre-Christmas treat!!"
December 2018,Wonderful Allergy Friendly Afternoon Tea,"I had the most wonderful afternoon tea at Browns Hotel on 7th December. I have a number of allergies being dairy free, gluten free, nut and seed free and low sugar. I’d almost given up on trying to have afternoon tea out in London. However when I made the reservation - Browns said that their chefs could cater for my allergies - no problem. I was so amazed as Fortnum and Mason had said that they could not cater for me and that I had to go and have afternoon tea somewhere else!!?? My afternoon tea was perfect at Browns Hotel with delicious sandwiches, scones and fabulous cakes. The service was excellent - Zoltan’s team were first class - nothing was too much trouble - very impressed!! The chefs who created my afternoon tea were excellent too!! It was the most wonderful afternoon…"
December 2018,Right Hotel at the right Place!,"TheRocco Forte Hotel BROWN’S Hotel in London, at the Albemarle Street in Mayfair is a fine hotel. The reception was good and friendly. Service fine. Room just right. No nice from the streets. Bath comfortable, warming towels etc. We liked the Afternoon Tea at the Lounge. Perfect service. We love the elegance of the Rocco Forte Hotels in general."
December 2018,10 Stars Easily,A definite `Must do before we shuffle off our mortal coils`.The `Afternoon tea` is fantastic as are the staff.A classic English experience which we should share with all our family and friends. Truly historical.
December 2018,Lovely couples massage ,"We had a lovely couples massage followed by afternoon tea.   The spa staff were very pleasant and they bought my husband the most delicious birthday cake I have ever eaten!!   The went that extra mile to make our experience special, massages were very relaxing!!  The only thing I wish they had was a relaxation room, a place where we could have to wind down in our robes. Though the staff gave us the massage rooms for as long as we needed, it would have been nice  if there was a wholesome spa experience.   Overall very good massages and delicious cake!"
December 2018,A beautiful hotel in a fantastic location,"Loved our stay, this was our third visit and we definitely shall be returning for a fourth.  The staff both in the hotel and the bar are the friendliest we have seen in a very long time.  A fantastic location in easy reach to all the amazing highend shops, so many lovely restaurants nearby, the choice is mind blowing.  Thank you so much Browns, you have excelled yourself yet again."
December 2018,NOt so hot,"Convenient, excellent room, but lacking in the crispness, style and efficiency of the great Rocco Forte Hotels such as the Savoy or the Hotel des Ruisse...slow and slightly unfocused service.  Classic move that we all hate--they insist on taking light bags which are no trouble and then you're still waiting for them twenty minutes after your in your room.  Check in felt endless.  Nice people, well meaning, but need a little more direction."
November 2018,A Wonderful Stay,"A quick note about another wonderful week at Brown’s Hotel. What consistently impresses one about Brown’s is the attentiveness of the gracious staff. Upon arrival George (and I regret not knowing George’s proper title) took charge to ensure that our check-in was smooth. Since we had arrived at 10:50 on Remembrance Day, George offered either to get us to a service nearby or participate in the two minutes silence in the lobby. We attended in the lobby as George led the observance by staff and we marvelled that such a thing was not done in Canada. Two other examples of staff attentiveness stood out.  Upon returning to our room one day, the scruffy receipt that I’d been using as a bookmark had been supplemented by a Brown’s Hotel bookmark. You know your maid service is top notch if…"
November 2018,Fabulous Stay,"My husband and I just had our third fabulous stay at Brown’s. This is a perfect hotel! Our suite was large and beautifully decorated. The staff was warm, welcoming and helpful. The food and rom service at this hotel is great! It is in a wonderful location. We always look forward to returning!"
November 2018,Afternoon tea,We went there a week ago and were served by 2 lovely gentlemen(Indian and Italian guys). They were very helpful and professional. We enjoyed the quite afternoon with a guy playing piano in the background. May be the tea selection could have been better but having said that it's a place one sud def visit.
October 2018,Afternoon tea,"I recently went for afternoon tea with my friend. The staffs are extremely friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere to be. I was served by Mr akshay, who is very friendly and welcoming. I am very happy with the service."
April 2018,Beautiful Hotel,We had a great time at the hotel really made us feel welcome and nothing was a problem. We request some fruit for our little two year old and they made sure we had fresh fruit in our room everyday for him. They also made a very cosy cot up for him and add baby toiletries in the bath for him too. The staff are beyond friendly and always go the extr mile for you. I will definitely be staying here again with my family next time I come to London.
October 2018,Beck at Browns- Beautiful restaurant,"We chose Beck at Browns for a 15+ family lunch gathering/ celebration and I cannot stress how highly organized and professional the staff were. They made sure all my requests were fulfilled, including my really last minute request of having place cards on the table. Our three course meal was succulent to the say the least and they have a really good selection of wine. Lastly the setting is just beautiful. I previously went to Brown's precedent great restaurant Hix, but Beck at Brown's elegant and traditional yet fresh and airy atmosphere made it the perfect setting for a family celebration. I highly recommend it."
June 2018,How special Brown's hotel is,"Every time I return to Brown's hotel, porters & a door man welcome me like their family always. One step out from the car, you are warm welcomed by some familiar faces, like John, Givi, Max & reception team. Brown's is the special place where you do not feel like staying at hotel. usually the process from arrival to check-in is like catching up with staff.. how you are, how we are etc.. etc.. As soon as entering the room, my preferences are well remembered and immediately feel like a home in London. It is really a precious jewel with history. Restaurant & Bar are lovely too."
August 2018,Friends visit to London,"The hotel itself has lots of history and grandeur. But it would be great if that could be displayed a bit more in the hotel, and by that I mean the stories behind the building and the bar itself etc. It is one of the best hotels catered for families, although we didn't bring children. Great location in London. Must admit I prefer the quieter areas, but as it was a city trip there is no escaping the hustle and bustle. Rooms were clean, but stairwell and hallways could do with a fresh up and deep clean of the carpets. Upon check-in there was a bit confusion as to the bed and bedding, which was resolved, as we decided to cope with a king bed instead of the preferred 2 twins.  Doormen and concierges have great tips to make your stay comfortable and fun. And umbrellas to use when…"
October 2018,Room far below expectation,I booked an executive room that probably is the entry level room for this property. The room was small and not charming but confortabile. The view from the room was on some technical equipment just outside the window... in my opinion this is not a room of a first class hotel even if the cheapest one. 
October 2018,The Donovan Bar,"Had a gorgeous evening in The Donovan Bar, enjoying a coktail with friends. It will surely be the first of many! Not only is the atmosphere luxurious but the service is impeccable. Mid week at Browns in Mayfair has been revamped with live jazz, perfect for leisure, business, or both. As a discerning guest I was very impressed with the authenticity and standard of hospitality! thank you!"
November 2017,PERFECTION has a name: BROWN'S Hotel in London!,"This is my favourite Hotel in London! It is always a pleasure to stay at the BROWN'S.  Upon the arrival the doorman called me by my name. According to the Hotel's fine reputation  the service is very professional and personalised (reception, concierge, restaurant, bar..). They are all so attentive and pay attention to every detail. I really felt at home and enjoyed every moment of my stay.   Luxurious and elegant atmosphere with a twist of Dolce Vita-feeling (also italian staff)!   Accomodation: quiet, very comfortable bed, walk-in shower (eco-friendly amenities),  perfect housekeeping. Delicious breakfast, fine dining in stylish location, first quality products.  Tiny SPA: excellent Thai massage by KARMINI!  Perfect situation in walking distance to high-end boutiques,…"
August 2018,Girls' lunch and celebratory dinner,"I love the refurbishment of both restaurant (now Beck at Brown’s) and the extended Donovan Bar. My first post-refurbishment visit was lunch in Beck at Brown’s, which now has an extended bar area with comfortable seating - ideal for that aperitif whilst awaiting the arrival of friends rather than having to go straight to your table.  My second visit, a celebratory dinner, commenced with cocktails in Terence Donovan’s ‘Naughty Corner’ in the Donovan Bar (now about twice its original size, spacious and with extended bar and seating) before dining in the restaurant. As a result of my brother-in-law’s interest in wines, the sommelier took more time than normally expected to discuss various options and make recommendations to ensure the right choices were made to complement our menu…"
October 2018,London’s First Hotel is still tops,"We have been to London almost 2 dozen times. We’ve stayed in hotels and rented an Apartment .(flat) So staying at Browns comes with a good deal of experience. We love the location. Our suite was large, comfortable and very lovely. The service of a small hotel was very noticeable here.  I recommend Browns without any hestitation."
September 2018,"A beautiful hotel, complimented by exemplary personal service.","My stay at Brown's hotel was fabulous, from the moment I arrived, the team were lovely, they paid attention to all the finer details, the personal touches are what makes an experience memorable. The rooms are fabulous, lovely natural light, old school charm and luxury with stunning bathrooms. After travelling over 24 hours from Australia, I had the most wonderful sleep in their beautiful beds with the most comfortable pillows. The entire team across all departments have so much pride in what they do and it was a delight to stay here. A true compliment to the entire team at Brown's.   Will most definitely be staying here when I travel to London."
September 2018,Weekend at Brown’s,"We stayed at Brown’s hotel only for one night,but it was an amazing experience. At the time of booking we’ve mensioned that this stay is for a special occasion -as a surprise  we had a welcome Champagne and chocolate dipped Strawberries and rose pettals in the room. The room was very specious with beautiful bathroom. Part of the evening we spent in the hotel restaurant where we enjoyed lovely dinner with Wine pairing and I have to say - it was a real pleasure to be served by Sommelier Emmanuelle. His choice of wines and knowledge were incredible. We preordered breakfast for the next morning and asked it to be delivered at 10 15 but we woke up very early and asked it to be delivered sooner and they brought our food shortly after we called. Thanks for everything Brown’s, I cannot…"
September 2018,Excellent Hotel Top Class Staff,"This is an absolutely excellent hotel, it is my favourite hotel in London, we always stay here when we are in London and we wouldn't consider anywhere else! The hotel is in a great location, there are lots of shops and restaurants close by and being in the centre of London there will be something to do for everyone. The rooms are spotless, they are very clean and comfortable. The staff are fabulous, they are always so friendly and attentive in particular Givi and Max. Thanks again to all staff at Browns for another fantastic experience and I am already looking forward to my next stay. Best wishes, Nuailin"
September 2018,A Fine Hotel,"To paraphrase Dr Johnson ""When you're tired of Brown's, you're tired of London"".  This is a hotel at the top of its game, and the beautiful recent refurbishment of the downstairs areas, including the bar and restaurant completes the picture. Brown's is one of a handful of 5 star London hotels and richly deserves the fine reputation it holds.  It is an historic hotel with the occasional quirkiness you'd expect from a very old building, and its location in Mayfair is perfect for dining and shopping, and close to most galleries and museums. The balance between contemporary design and historical inclusions is a triumph.  The rooms are generously proportioned, decorated in a relaxed, comfortable, contemporary style, and the bathrooms are large, attractive and well-equipped. Both are…"
August 2018,Exceptional hotel!,"We recently stayed at Brown's and can't say enough about our experience there. The location, the service, the dining options [including breakfast, dinner, high tea, and the bar], and the rooms were all top notch. All the staff were responsive, attentive, willing to help and bent over backwards to make our visit exceptional. We highly recommend Brown's."
August 2018,Great stay,"A lovely weekend stay at Browns. Service was fantastic and we were made to feel very welcome. Also a thank you to Max, Chris and Roy for supplying our umbrella’s when we were checking out in the pouring rain."
August 2018,Such a nice surprise!,"We have just spent a beautiful weekend at Browns. It was our first time there and everything was simply perfect: the room, quite, elegant and very confortable, the facilities and, moreover, the high level of service. The staff is kind, gentle, very professional without beeing too formal. When you get in, the entrance, certainly stylish, doesn’t reflect the overall excellent standard of the rest of the property but shortly you can discover the beautiful lunchroom of Beck’s restaurant and the sophisticated atmosphere of the Bar. We were used to stay in other hotels in Mayfair but we will be back at Browns! Piero and Annalisa Longo"
July 2018,perfect english spot,"Brown's is the perfect hotel for an english immersion. Great location, kind service, good tips on where and what to do, comfortable and quiet rooms, wonderful bar, and great food. A must for afternoon tea!"
June 2018,Customer Service Excellence,"One of my favourite London Hotels. You are always made to feel welcome, the staff are friendly and professional without being intrusive. The accommodation is of an exceptionally high standard and dining is a real experience for the seasoned foodie."
August 2018,Location and Service at it's finest!,"It had been many years since I last stepped foot into Brown's Hotel, and I was a little reluctant about our very recent stay.  After our recent family vacation, we all concurred that Brown's is one of the finest gems anywhere in the world!  Location is as good as it gets.  Centrally located, everything that we wanted to do was close by.  The rooms were blended traditional elegance with modern comfort; and were quite large by European standards.  The restaurants and bars are absolutely gorgeous, and my girls loved traditional tea time.  With all that said, the people at Brown's are as professional and hospitable as we have ever found at other very fine hotels around the world.  Their 24 hour concierge service was at our service around the clock. We look forward to staying at…"
July 2018,Wonderful Personable Hotel in the heart of London,"This was our first stay at Browns and it really did not disappoint. My wife and I love the Rocco Forte brand and had stayed often at the old Manchester property and the Mayfair located hotel was on our list. The promise of good weather, a break from the schedule and a family Birthday presented an ideal opportunity for a city mini break.  The service experience actually started at the time of booking where an incredibly helpful and obliging Paris tailored the Two rooms that we needed exactly to our needs and also to our budget by way of offering excellent value. Immediately after the booking was confirmed came the introduction and offer of assistance from the hotel Concierge team. A special mention must go to Paul who worked really hard to offer help and advice on visits and…"
July 2018,"Great location, Professional Staff","The hotel is a true classic.  It is one of the oldest hotels in London. It is in a great location in the heart of the luxurious shopping district of London and very close to the Green Park metro station.  I'm a fan of Rocco Forte Hotels chain and really love the professionalism of hotel staff as well as condition of their hotels.  When you're in one of their hotels, you know that you'll be staying in beautiful, clean and spacious rooms with great bathrooms with good amenities.  Always a beautiful bar, great breakfast and professional staff.  However, this time our bathroom had a maintenance problem.  Moreover, it was really uncomfortable to use the bathroom where its window only had a see-through linen curtain.  I hope we were not seen by people across the  building as we were…"
July 2018,Very fine hotel in the center of London,"This is a really nice hotel.  There's a doorman to greet you and hail a cab and inside it is beautifully decorated in an elegant, European style.  The lounge and tea room are beautiful and a piano player on weekend creates a nice atmosphere.  The breakfast service is very good and the staff are very professional and attentive.  The rooms are nicely appointed and ours had a very good sized bathroom. The only downside is the awful traffic in London.  It is great to be centrally located but awful when it takes 30 minutes to get on to Piccadilly to actually begin a journey. Much easier to walk two blocks to the underground station at Green Park."
July 2018,Hidden gem,"I've seen a lot of (very) good hotels in London, but this one is definitely my favourite. It's located just behind Bond Street, yet in a rather quiet street (be it with good bars and restaurants very near), so you have all of the advantages of the city centre, without the noise. The room was excellent and so was the service: truly what you can hope a 5* hotel to deliver. Nice and clean rooms, helpful and friendly staff, and a very chique and trendy yet classic interior. The only minor commentary I can give is that our suite had views over the courtyard, which was not bad, but not very exciting either. But aside from that: a wonderful experience. I'll definitely stay here again!"
June 2018,Afternoon Tea,This might be the best place in London for tea.  The service and choices where excellent and they went over the top to accommodate one of our travel partners that has issues with nuts.  Fun part of London as well.
July 2018,Browns Wins again!,We come here whenever we are in London and never fail to be impressed. It is renowned for High Tea and it does not fail to deliver. When Janine explained the History behind the Hotel we knew even more why and how it retains its position of Numero Uno. The owners build a team who care for your experience.
June 2018,Wonderful staff reunion,Thank you to all the staff at Brown's Hotel who looked after us so well during our ex-cashiers reunion last weekend. We worked there in the early 80's and thoroughly  enjoyed catching up on 'the good old days'.  The afternoon tea was delicious and plentiful and we loved the updates the hotel has undergone although were relieved to see that it continues to retain it's unique character and atmosphere.  Thank you for helping us to create more happy memories of Brown's. We'll be back but hopefully we won't leave it another 30 years until the next one!
June 2018,Classy and Stylish,I spent a  memorable evening in this charming hotel which is located in the elegant area of Mayfair. Their piano bar exhibits the B&W photographs of Terence Donovan in its walls and has one of the finest cocktails you can possibly find in London. The main restaurant offers a unique Italian menu with a wide selection of international fine wines. I could go on and on talking about the delicious dishes and drinks I had (especially the Mersault wine) but I'd like to highlight the outstanding service they offer. They really know how to make a guest feel at home and special.
June 2018,What a GREAT hotel!,"I travel around the US with clients looking at real estate and travel around the world with my wife on vacations.  This is one of the BEST RUN hotels we have stayed in.  The location is GREAT, the room was GREAT, the staff was GREAT.  We'll be back!"
June 2018,A special trip requiring a special base from where to taste London shopping,"We last visited London's Browns Hotel 8 years ago - at that time we rated it OK but a little tired. This time therefore was always going to be under the microscope. What a transformation! It is now simply one of the finest hotels we have visited - every aspect was truly special - from check in to check out some 4 days later - accommodation superb, housekeeping, valeting, in-room dining, reception, concierge service, all couldn't be better. Add to that the now beautiful lounge bar (a disappointment some 8 years ago) with comfortable seating, and a truly exceptional restaurant (now Becks) with food among the finest we've ever eaten anywhere (and we've stayed at some truly world class hotels all over the world), coupled with top class service, and the wonderful experience was…"
June 2018,H and D clark,"Whilst we’re regular guests at Browns the entire experience is always exceptional and somehow just continues to get better.  From the moment you arrive and are greeted by the doorman, followed closely by the wonderful Givvy (the MOST helpful man in Ldn) you feel “just like you’re back at home “. The entire experience from guest acknowledgement, service, cleanliness to ambiance and making everyone feel special doesn’t change whether you’re a 1st time guest or returning one. We can honestly say there is NO better concierge team worldwide. As extensive travellers we can call upon David Young and his team 24/7 to assist with anything- nothing is ever a problem and they always have a solution! If you haven’t been to Browns you’re missing out... a must stay when in Ldn. "
February 2018,Not quiet,"I have visited this hotel in February - the room is good. The toilet as well. The only problem, and a major one, is that it isn’t a quiet hotel. The flooring is out of wood and you can easily here when someone in the room above yours walks or moves. You can also hear very well if someone passes through the corridor. I seriously had to wake up at 8 am everyday, regardless of what time i slept. I never went back to this hotel because I’m a light sleeper. Shouldn’t be a problem if you aren’t."
June 2018,A wonderful bar with great staff,"As we discovered that the Royal Institution was not open on a Saturday we wandered across the road to have a drink in the Donovan bar at Brown's. I was interested in the portraits on display of people largely from the 60s and 70s but the decor was also very good, giving a relaxing ambience. The selection of gins on offer was interesting and my husband chose a good one with the help of the bar man. I felt like a sorbet but that was not available when we were there so I had wonderful fresh mint tea - which came with home made biscuits which were deliciously crispy. (The cost was waived as I had not been able to have a sorbet, which came as a delightful surprise.) This is a wonderful place to stop off and refresh oneself just away from the bustle of Pall Mall. The drinks are great…"
June 2018,Customer Service at its best!,"My dad and stepmom stayed at The Browns, and I enlisted the concierge's help to surprise my stepmom for her birthday. They far surpassed my expectations, put together a beautiful fruit spread and cake with a note from me. She was so touched by the surprise, they really went above and beyond to help me surprise her."
June 2018,My Birthday Stay and Afternoon Tea,"After coming back here to visit the Hix Mayfair back in 2013, for my Grandads Birthday. I decided to return for my own Birthday and actually stay. We arrived last night( the night before on the 10th June) my birthday which was today the 12th, where the staff on duty was very accommodating, from the receptionist on duty to Matio at the concierge Desk, we was quickly shown to our room. We then ordered room service withing 20 minutes the room service waiters quickly delivered our food, and was very attentive and showed us everything we ordered. The room was very beautiful it was a large room which was so cosy. The Bed was rather comfortable and the pillows was nice and fluffy, our room was extremely clean.  We ordered room service breakfast and again the 2 waiters who delivered our…"
June 2018,Top Notch Service!,"I was only in town for one night and decided to stay at the Brown's by recommendation of a colleague.  It is in a great part of town where you can spend the day to SHOP or visit a few pubs!  There was also an art museum that stayed open late.  Once I arrived, I was greeted like royalty from the doorman to greet you with a smile and by name, to the front desk that greets you with another welcoming presence and morning coffee.  I even ate the best gnocchi as a late night meal from my jetlag.  I had a minor change to the dish and the chef was more than accommodating to my request, it was delicious. I wish I had more time to explore your property and experience more of your hospitality!  Thank you!"
May 2018,Truly special,What a fabulous experience. We absolutely loved your hotel in London. It is perfectly located. The entire staff was so helpful and accommodating. They were especially kind and considerate to my elderly mother. Becks was a fabulous find!  Our suite was lovely and comfortable. Our stay was truly a delight.
May 2018,Home away from home,"This is an excellent hotel for an extended stay. The staff are professional and welcoming. After long days exploring London I was able to relax in the Donovan's Bar or Beck Restaurant. The Afternoon Tea was beautiful. Any issues brought to the attention of the staff are quickly dealt with and resolved. The room is comfortable and quiet, allowing for a restful sleep. The location allows easy access to public transportation and the Hotel Car is available for short trips nearby. I would gladly return to Brown's Hotel."
May 2018,Amazing stay!,"We stayed for one night in a standard room. Nothing ""standard"" about it. It was larger and more exclusive than any standard room we have stayed in. The ""turn down"" service made us feel special and taken well care of. It all started with the warm welcome in the reception and by the consierge. Since it was a birthday celabration we decided to have Lunch, tea and dinner at the hotel. The staff in both the restaurant and in the tea-room were service-Minded and the chef even turned up at dinner to ask if everything was at our satisfaction."
June 2018,Birthday Celebration @ Beck's,"We had an outstanding meal for my birthday celebration at Browns Hotel. The food in Beck's @ Browns is fabulous, excellence in quality, brilliant menu and five star service. We had the Octopus Salad, Pan fried Veal Sweet breads followed by the best pasta in London and Beck’s signature affogato tiramisu and hazelnut planet, pure class and indulgence matched with brilliant table service - Becks @ Browns will not disappoint!"
June 2018,Pre dinner drinks in Donovan Bar,"I had pre dinner drinks in Donovan Bar. It was my first visit after the refurbishment. What a transformation! Loved light coming through the windows, cooler scheme which seamlessly brings you into good old glitz and glam of London night life. I had Lavender me, nonalcoholic cocktail. Sooooo nice!!! Lovely selection of nonalcoholic cocktails. Definitely coming back!"
May 2018,Spa birthday treat ,"My daughter chose this venue for her 19th birthday treat - her first spa experience has set the bar very high indeed. The team was wonderful- incredibly kind and welcoming, lovely treatments and a surprise birthday cake from them really made the day extra special. Thank you all x"
May 2018,Very Special,"We booked this hotel to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. On arrival we were asked if we were celebrating anything special and when we told them they upgraded us to a suite, which was incredibly spacious and comfortable. It was a great start and made us feel really special. We had lunch in Donovan's bar, the food and service were impeccable and the surroundings comfortable and interesting. When we arrived back later in the evening our bed had been covered in rose petals! The attentiveness of staff at Browns helped to mitigate the disappointment of our dinner at Le Gavroche. There was a fantastic choice at breakfast and there was no drama about us being a little late. All the staff we encountered were friendly and very professional. This was an outstanding stay and we…"
April 2018,Fantastic hotel!,"Fantastic  hotel  with outstanding staff, who just couldn't  do enough  to help us and make us feel  comfortable. The rooms were  lovely and the food was decadent, we had a perfect anniversary stay, and wouldn't  hesitate to return.  The location is great too."
May 2018,Fantastic afternoon tea!,"Stayed here overnight for a very special occasion, service was extraordinary, highly recommend for anyone wanting a luxury short stay in London!  Great afternoon tea, one of the better ones around for sure!"
May 2018,Wonderful experience,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Brown’s where the service and rooms were exemplary but the highlight had to be the tea, simply splendid.   Couldn’t recommend the hotel highly enough and we look forward to another stay soon."
May 2018,Simply lovely ,Had a wonderful afternoon tea. The food was a delight and service was high standard. Really enjoyed this and would recommend this if you’re looking for a nice spot or afternoon tea in London Town. Thanks guys. 
May 2018,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at Brown's is in the best tradition of London teas. A cozy atmosphere, a live pianist goes with the usual assortment of tea and delicacies. Our only criticism is that the service was a notch below comparable hotel teas."
May 2018,Excellent high tea,"Second time I have been lucky enough to have been taken to Browns for high tea.Comfortable surroundings and beautifully served.We were sat close to the piano,this was quite intrusive and a little loud for us,harp might have been preferable. A little disappointed that the cake trolley no longer available,much preferred to the individual small cakes,of which both were previously offered .Scones were a little heavy and not the best I have had. A great experience but a little lacking in sparkle."
May 2018,Fantastic!,"We had a great time at Browns, from arriving to leaving the experience and service was fantastic. Only slight improvement would be to have tea & coffee facilities in the rooms, however the trip in the Hotel Bentley to the Palladium was pure luxury & we felt very spoilt. Afternoon tea & breakfast in our room were both amazing & excellent quality. Thank you to everyone at Browns"
May 2018,Faulous time at The Brown,"Centrally located to shopping, tube, The Mall, Mayfair.  Lovely.  The staff was welcoming and delightful.  We had dinner, breakfast and socialized in the bar.  Overall, the staff was outgoing and accommodating to our every need.  Just pampered"
April 2018,Grand central hotel,"For such a upmarket hotel, there were some problems. On the whole the staff were enthusiastic and happy to solve our problems but there were some misunderstandings possibly because of language. Once these were cleared up, there was excellent service. Breakfast was a happy affair, Antonio was very enthusiastic and gave me endless coffee.  Although there is a coffee pod machine in the room, there were no tea making facilities which is unusual in an English hotel. They were happy to provide these, when we asked, on a daily basis. Location just off Bond St was excellent for all things in the West End and of course close to the Green Park Tube station, but reasonable walk to both Oxford Circus and Piccadilly. 4 stars is because of value for money in this expensive hotel."
May 2018,Best English Tea room,"If I could do 6 stars...I would. Professional, welcoming and friendly staff. Quintessentially English tea which was delicious and we didn’t leave hungry. Loved the pianist in the background. Thank you Browns hotel, we will be back!"
March 2018,Best Hotel Experience,"You get what you pay for.  The Brown's isn't cheap, but this hotel is centrally located and has WONDERFUL service.  Every detail was attended to.  The room was very comfortable, the Tea Service was extremely memorable, and everyone was warm, professional, and welcoming."
February 2018,F&B Service lets it down,"Great welcome but struggled to get any service at lunch and breakfast. And low seats in breakfast area are not good for eating at. A real pity because a great detail has gone into all else, but people make the difference!"
March 2018,Greatest Choice to Stay in London,"Brown’s hotel is the best location you can find in London. Mayfair is centrally located and walking distance to every place, neighborhoods, restaurants, shops and major attractions.  The hotel has wonderfull and friendly staff, always helpful to get everything you need, from the front desk to the concierge and the general manager. They all made us feel like we were at home. Definetely Brown’s Hotel is a place to return without any doubt. Congratulations."
March 2018,afternoon tea,part of a big group in private room. we took a whilst I get settled / started but  food was delicious . staff very helpful . they kept refilling the plates until we could eat no more. a nice birthday treat.  
December 2017,Discrete Charm,"I have been here a few times and do love it, small, attentive and charming. Rooms are quiet and comfortable. Service is very good but detailed, location is perfect. The bar is good and Dover st is lovely."
February 2018,Great Classic Hotel,"great location in center of London, perfect for shopping and culture..Browns is a very stylish hotel with classic friendly service. Very nice decorated rooms and nice restaurant & bar. Of course the classic High tea !"
February 2018,Really nice stay,"Stayed here for my 40th and it was fab.  Room was nice and spaceous and it was very quiet at night (we overlooked the court yard).  Breakfast was also really nice. It’s not a flashy grand hotel but comfortable with very attentive service.  The afternoon tea here is great too, I have been to a number of places in London for afternoon tea and keep coming back to Browns as it is very constitent and the food is really delicious and thoughfully prepared."
February 2018,Buzzing Bar!,We just called in to this hotel bar for a drink following lunch at The Ritz. We clearly hadn't booked a table and although there were many vacant tables we had to hang around before being shown somewhere to sit. We enjoyed an hour here catching up  with friends over a couple of drinks while admiring the photographs. In future we would book a table and would recommend folk coming here to do the same even though our waitress thought that this was unnecessary.
December 2017,So far the best hotel I have been in London,"I have stayed in this hotel for 1 night on boxing day. Honestly nothing to complain about. I stayed in executive room category which is one category higher than the classic room. The room size was excellent for london. It was really big and toilet was very clean and spacious. Comfortable bed. Clean room. Check-in was easy and the lady was extremely friendly, kind, and informative. Breakfast was good as well. The chauffeur service is an add on and useful. Handy phone was a plus and useful also. Location is the best you can be in London. All luxurious shopping is just few meters away of the hotel. Lots of high end restaurants are walking distance as well. Price is reasonable as well. I stayed in other 5 star hotels in London and even leading hotel of the world but wasn't anywhere…"
February 2018,Weekend in London ,"We stayed at Browns last weekend for a bit of R and R , good restaurants and good shopping as the hotel is perfectly located behind New Bond St.  We drove up from Surrey which as we knew would have more things to take home seemed like a good idea , I had already enquired about valet parking which at £50 per 24 hrs seemed really reasonable ! They were aware of our car details and when we pulled up were waiting to whisk the car off and get us checked in . Within a few minutes we were in our junior suite over looking Albemarle St .  Beautiful room , Queen bed , sitting room, walk in wardrobe and bathroom with double sinks , bath and large shower , perfect for a couple of nights . Nothing to be disappointed in.  Breakfast was included on the Saturday morning we dined there, amazing…"
January 2018,"Manhattan, NY guests winter 2018","This gem is a wonderful classic British hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  The professional staff aims to please without being too formal or obsequious.  The hotel has the amenities of a larger hotel despite its smaller size which gives it a homey feel.  The street doesn't get much auto traffic but when you step outside there are restaurants, galleries, and coffee shops.  Cabs were readily available and the is  just a few minutes away."
April 2018,great in every way,"the browns hotel is great in every way: location, rooms, bar, restaurant and gym. we have stayed there more than 5 times for london weekend trips. Staff deserves special mention - very attentive and polite."
April 2018,Amazing hotel !!!!,We have stayed in Brown’s for my partners birthday. I have booked this as surprised and we loved every moment of our stay. Staff was friendly and accommodating all last minute request. Room was clean and top condition.  And the Dinner in restaurants was top class. Will recommend this hotel to everyone.  We will definitely be back thank you all for amazing stay. 
May 2018,A London treasure.,"Browns hotel is the oldest hotel in London and retains many original features coupled beautifully with some contemporary features. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious , immaculate and very comfortable. The Donovan Bar was the perfect place for a pre dinner cocktail. We had an amazing stay."
April 2018,For business with pleasure!,"My wife and I recently stayed here for a meeting at the QE II conference center. I chose it for the recommendations and location. It was a 20 min walk to the conference, much of it through the park. A metro station was one block away. From the minute the doorman greeted my wife and I, the experience was superb. All of the staff, doormen, registration, concierge staff, and restaurant staff made sure our experience was great. They made me feel like I was the most important guest they had. There were a lot of business people staying there, so suits and jackets were common in the restaurant and bar, but casual was also welcome. My wife was taken care of by the staff while I was in meetings. Our room was comfortable and room service excellent. When a tour they recommended was not…"
April 2018,An experience,"It was something I think, one should do, just once....have an English high tea at TheEnglish Tea Room at Brown's, the hotel where 'it all started'.... Thus it was with great anticipation, that my companions and I gathered for our high tea at Brown's. We did enjoy our outing; the welcome was warm, and the service efficient and professionally friendly. Four of us had the Traditional Afternoon Tea, while one opted for the Tea-Tox Menu. There was ample food to go around (tasty too) and the service staff was conscientious in asking if we wanted further servings. The atmosphere was comfy and just as it should be... (I am assuming that most people go to tea at Brown's because well, it *is* Brown's..) and my companions and I enjoyed our afternoon there.  It is quite pricey, but if you…"
April 2018,"Breakfast, fantastic","I went to have breakfast with a client and we both loooooved our time there. Eggs were perfectly cooked, my croissant was delicious. Very elegant, staff absolutely perfect, too. I will go back soon and I would recomment to anyone."
April 2018,Spacious and elegant rooms; great location,"Our new favorite in London! We have never stayed this close to Piccadilly, Regent Street and Bond Street. This old style traditional British hotel feels like it's family operated; the doormen and receptionists know your name after one day and you feel really looked after. The breakfast restaurant is cozy and comfortable both in size and style; the food served is between good and great (haven't tried the evening restaurant, which seems to have a great reputation for exquisite Italian food). We loved our (Deluxe) rooms which were very spacious with lots of cupboard room and a big bathroom. This hotel deserves to be up there with the best in London."
April 2018,Very Friendly,"We stayed here over the marathon weekend as the hotel we usually stay in was full and we were dining with friends nearby. I think this will now become our go to hotel, very friendly staff great you with a smile, the hotel it's self is beautiful and the rooms , clean comfortable and well equipped, except that is for tea making facilities (my usual gripe). Had cocktails in the bar, a good choice , around £20 each unless you want one of the very special ones (nearly died  at some of the prices, but dont think anyone ever has a cocktail over 5 grand). Good atmosphere. We didnt eat there as we were out that evening an  left very early the next day...maybe next time."
April 2018,Amazing!,"I stayed at Brown's for the first time recently and it has quickly become one of my favourite hotels to stay in on my visits to London. I dined in their restaurant one night which I believe had just opened and I have only one word to describe it - incredible! The food was delicious and the staff were so welcoming, I'm already looking forward to my next stay!"
April 2018,all time my favorite!,"We had stayed 2 nights and a afternoon tea at their traditional tea room. They provided us professional, warm and sicere service through out our stay. Especially all the staffs at concierge desk are very professional and replied promptly to our requests all the time and we had such a lovely time there. Also their afternoon tea is the best in London. I have had afternoon tea at Ritz, Capital Hotel, and many other famous hotels in London, but the afternoon tea at Browns is the best!"
April 2018,A true British luxury hotel,"We stayed here for our first weekend without kids for many years. The experience was excellent for both me and my wife. The hotel's location is just perfect with walking distance to all you need on a couples weekend getaway. The staff were great and we really enjoyed the room, the restaurant, SPA and everything else this 5 star boutique hotel has to offer"
April 2018,T. Boyer,"A friend and I stayed at Brown’s for six nights last week to celebrate a milestone birthday. We had a fabulous experience - a lovely, spacious room; excellent service all around; a staff that responded quickly and graciously to all of our inquiries and requests; a location that, while on a quiet street, is close to the action in Soho and within walking distance to almost everything we did throughout our visit. We happily returned to the tranquility of the hotel at the end of our busy day - a calm in the storm that is London - to enjoy a glass of wine in the bar before turning in.  We will be back again!!!"
May 2017,Yes.,"I stayed a week here. It was an incredible experience that I will never forget and definitely my favourite London hotel experience by far. There is nothing quite like a boutique hotel, especially Brown's."
April 2018,"“Excellent environment, friendly service, great menu choices and really brillant food and affordable prices''","we had an awesome lunch experience at Browns Hotel with a very professional stuff in a  bohemian atmosphere. The starters were amazing, burrata with marinated courgette and dressed crab with grilled Roman lettuce. Since I'm an Italian pasta lover I ordered house- made Spaghetti al ''cacio e pepe'' with peccorino cheese on lime- marinated langouistines I felt like beeing in Rome, pasta sky on earth, very tasty-  a must try!        My friend has been very exited about the pea soup with fresh mint and quinoa, fantasticly bright, light with a great balance. As well the red mullet sandwich has been delicious.  “Just a quick thank you for the hospitality and excellent food we had when we visited yesterday. We will certainly be returning in the near future.“"
April 2018,Barnaby Warboys,"The best that London has to offer!  The location is excellent - near Bond Street, Piccadilly, the Royal Academy, and a walkable distance to the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery, the Mall, the Palace and Green Park"
April 2018,An Oasis of calm in a busy City,"An exceptional hotel. Rooms and décor are immaculate as you would expect in a hotel of this quality.  What really makes Brown's stand apart however is its staff.  They are personal, helpful and caring.  Its clear they take great pride in their job.  The staff not only ask how your day was but remember your answers and take an interest when they see you again. Cookies with the children's names on supplied as a surprise after a busy day. A concierge that can organise almost anything. Its all in the detail and at Browns there's lots of detail.   As an example my six you old son picked up a sickness bug whilst we were in London from the tube or another public place.  On returning to Browns that evening with him in my arms we had everything we needed within 2 mins of returning. …"
April 2018,Wonderful stay at London's finest hotel,"Great location in the heart of Mayfair. Attention to detail, great staff and service. A lovely room with a view. We felt pampered our entire stay. Concierge made every reservation we requested. Afternoon tea is a must. Highly recommend"
April 2018,Perfection. ,"Not one thing to fault. True perfection. We spent 3 nights with two children in two interconnecting rooms. The rooms were stylish, welcoming, impeccably cleaned with fantastic walk-in wardrobes and modern bathrooms. Service was always truly professional and totally genuine. We were made to feel at home and we relaxed straight away. A perfect 5 star hotel that welcomes families and indeed caters for them with such wonderful touches, children themed bedding with a teddy bear for each child, children toiletries in the bathroom, small slippers and dressing gowns, children’s magazines and even welcome cookies in the room with their names iced upon. The children’s private tour of London was not to be missed and  something they shall remember forever. The hotel restaurant was…"
March 2018,Special Occasion,"This was the second time that we have been fortunate to stay at Brown’s,  an iconic hotel and a superb experience. All of the hotel staff were extremely professional and friendly and our suite was simply divine. I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone and it could only be described as perfect."
March 2018,Brooks Investment Presentation,"I was invited to this property investment presentation in this hotel.  It was a small and personal presentation in a room on the first floor.  I was impressed with the Ruinart champagne that was served. It was that impressive I didnt need to try the red wine. We were treated to some quality canapes and the service was A1.  By the way, the presentation was interesting to the point where I had committed to invest.  I noticed there was a nice bar called Donovan donwstairs. I look forward to trying and reviewing."
September 2017,Exquisite experience!,"My stay at the Brown's Hotel was definitely a great experience. Being located in the very nice neighborhood of Mayfair, the hotel was almost perfect. The staff is great, they are very attentive and polite. The rooms are spacious enough and very nicely decorated. All the amenities were great. The breakfast had a very wide selection and extremely tasty. Everybody at the hotel made sure that my stay trhere was as comfortable as possible. Overall the price tag may be on the high end but it is worth every penny of it."
January 2018,A Wet Weekend in January.,"We were welcomed to Browns by a friendly and helpful team in reception. As the room was not ready we had a drink in the temporary bar, which lacked atmosphere. However the waiter was pleasant even if the service was slow. Later we were shown to our upgraded room on the 4th Floor which was a large, comfortable room with a stunning bathroom. Unfortunately the promised bottle of champagne did not materialise. This did not really matter as we were meeting family and dining out. When we asked fort the following day  they were very apologetic. Later ordering cocktails in the temporary piano room was a disaster, see previous comments. Breakfast on the Sunday morning was excellent, and a suggestion from the concierge to visit the Wallace collection was very well received and we had…"
January 2018,cozy & comfortable home away from home,"we found Brown's Hotel to be well situated in a great Mayfair neighborhood.  Superb concierge and management teams.  Not snooty or stiff, but terrific personalized warm service.  Rooms are spacious, bathrooms well equipped and good breakfasts."
January 2018,Mint! Enjoy your visit,"When visiting Browns Hotel, in London, the reception by the hotel staff immediately conveys that your visit will be as comfortable as it is elegant. This has been my repeated experience with The Rocco Forte Hotels, as this is our third property visit of the eleven under their management. The “Browns & St. Georges Hotels” is in Mayfair, sandwiched between two chic streets (Albemarle and Dover) with shops at The Royal Arcade, as well as Victoria Beckham, and Jimmy Choo. Tiffany & Co., and many, many more are just around the corner on Old Bond Street. It is a tony neighborhood indeed.  But that is not why we were there. We went there for strictly touristy reasons, and the purpose of the hotel was to rest and relax. Browns provides R&R in spades. Be forewarned that comfort does come…"
January 2018,The best and gorgeous hotel ever,"it is a very warm and welcoming hotel. I chose this hotel because I know the one  in Florence. I was not disappointed, it is located in the best place in London. Upscale place at Mayfair.All the staff are friendly and helpful. I had the flu while I was at the hotel and they took care of me so much that I felt as if I was at home. the concierge has very good restaurant address, place to visit ... Valet Georges is so professional and kind and always smiling. it is the most beautiful and pleasant hotel, I love it."
January 2017,Beautiful hotel with traditional heart ,"As soon as I walked in the hotel, I love it. The atmosphere there are old England and elegant. The receptionist was welcomed but polite. Imagined they are well tough about manners. Went to the spa and had one of the best treatment in my life. Unforgettable experience. The bar with some live music and the afternoon tea, etc... bond street is just there but quiet. I want to live in the hotel..."
December 2017,Browns Best of London,"From the minute you step out of your car and into the hotel the feeling that this will be a special visit begins. Front desk staff and concierge were very accommodating to my family. They enhanced our stably with assistance at every call. The bar was fun and relaxed, the dinner outstanding. My only complaint is being there for just 3 nights...it wasn't enough. Special thanks to Max and Semion who dealt with our extra large Christmas luggage. 17 bags 5 people....moved in and out with smiles and insistence we not lift a finger. Thank you for starting our holiday so graciously."
November 2017,One of my Favourite London Hotels,"This must be one of London’s best kept secrets and is consistently excellent. I have stayed here, come for dinner, just for drinks and for afternoon tea. The perfect quiet place for Mayfair drinks in the evening or for a place to escape for tea and cake, a business meeting or even a glass of wine in the afternoon  I have been coming here for years and if ever one needs a recommendation for friends or visitors to London Brown’s hotel will never fail you!   We had a wonderful afternoon tea here (which I have had many a time!) and as always, everything was fresh, beautifully presented and lovely, attentive service.   Bottle of champagne or two to go with it and everyone is happy!  Five stars! "
December 2017,Afternoon tea at browns ☕️,"We went to browns for my aunts 50th birthday. As it is 22nd of December we got the festive afternoon tea. The other option was ‘tea-tox’ and after reading the menu there was only really one choice as the ‘tea-tox’ had some strange (otherwise known as ‘healthy choices’)such as spinach crepes and raw dessert slices. The deciding factor however was that instead of scones With clotted cream and strawberry jam it was ‘a selection of fruits and nuts with a trio of dips’ which for an afternoon tea I think is fundamentally wrong. This tea was aimed at health freaks. And if you are a health freak you are unlikely to be eating an afternoon tea. The festive tea sandwiches consisted of cucumber and cream cheese, egg mayo,  coronation chicken, smoked salmon and pickled fennel, and turkey…"
December 2017,Festive treat,"We had afternoon tea in the welcoming wooden panelled tea rooms, sat in comfy chairs beside the fire.  The sandwiches were plentiful (and refilled on request) as were the pastries, cakes and scones.  We were even brought Christmas cake and chocolate log.  The teas were beautifully presented in dribble free pots with tea strainers - we hardly had to pour for ourselves so attentive were the team.  It was an absolute treat and much welcomed after slogging through the heaving streets of Mayfair and Piccadilly.  Service was impeccable - it’s a pity that the manners of some of the other guests left a lot to be desired but the team handled everything professionally."
December 2017,Afternoon tea at Christmas,We try different luxury afternoon tea venues in London at Christmas and Brown's yesterday was definitely one of the best. Such solicitous service!  Really welcoming and efficient. Great atmosphere also with lovey decorations and a nice feel to the rooms where afternoon tea is served. Excellent pianist also The tea itsefl was truly generous and delicious!  No sense of meaness nor being hurried. Such a treat for Christmas and such a lovely location to launch into London at night which is better decorated and atmospheric than any other city I can think of.
December 2017,"Wonderful, friendly hotel.",One of our favourite hotels. Our third or forth stay this year. Browns is a home from home. Superb location. Stylish and spacious suites. Very child friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. So glad we found this hotel
December 2017,Excellent hotel,"Our 3rd stay at Browns and as always, a great experience. The superb staff make you feel so welcome and it's great to see familiar faces.  Donavan's Bar has been revamped somewhat since we were last there and the larger space gives it a fun vibrant atmosphere. We did not eat in the restaurant except for breakfast so cannot comment on the menu but breakfast is still first class. Thank goodness London has Browns!  "
December 2017,Afternoon tea a delight,"Went as a group of four for a Christmas treat of afternoon tea at Browns Hotel. The enviroment and ambiance added yo the occasion with the pionist  playing in the background. Beautiful surroundings which take you back yo a time gone by. Staring with a glass of champagne the food was excellent, with a spiced tea, a mixture of sandwiches both closed and open followed by scones, jam and cream an a number of delicious tea cakes.  A selection of different teas were available. Service was good however a 12.5% service charge gave no option of how much you might have wanted to contribute"
December 2017,A treat,"Overall the hotel is lovely. I find the staff particularly helpful, efficient and welcoming (particularly The doormen). The only gripe was the state of some repairs in the bathroom which were unbecoming to a 5 star hotel. "
November 2017,Classy and comfortable,"It was a short 2 days but spent well. The exterior building gives the feeling of what I dream of being in London and interior is comfortable. The staff is attentive' service is good quality. Lovely rooms, good location,fabulous afternoon tea. Everything that I could expect"
November 2017,TeaTox,"Very creative afternoon tea! Detox Tea Time!   Fabulously delicious clean gluten free cuisine. Amazing tea selection.  Service was wonderful. Ambiance lovely, seated at a corner window table with woid burning fireplace close by.   Wonderful afternoon tea!"
October 2017,Sheer class,"Outstanding service, fabulous food and decadent surroundings. What more could you want? Our experience was faultless and I would not hesitate to stay again. The afternoon tea was also fantastic , like a work of art on a plate."
November 2017,"True Old School London, but beware of the room’s location","It cannot be much more British albeit it is part of an Italian chain. It did used to be entirely British to the bone, but now it is a bit touristy, but pretending still to be British to the bone. It is, however, still priced as being Old School, but is not entirely there any longer. Service is excellent. Book it, but do insist on room facing the street. The rooms facing the court yard faces a very noisy air conditioning system. Do not accept that"
October 2017,A London Treat!,"Our second visit to Brown's Hotel for afternoon tea.  The experience is a great pleasure. A lovely room, friendly staff and a pianist playing in the background.  I needed to have gluten-free food and my needs were well provided for. I even had GF scones! Normal and GF sandwiches were tasty and plentiful, indeed, we knew from our previous visit that we'd not need much of a breakfast!  A nice way to pass a couple of hours, away from the hustle and bustle of several days' sight-seeing in the capital."
October 2017,Not too hidden treasure,"Unbelievable service, perfect rooms, the best location and the restaurant and bars are the best.  The food at the restaurant was excellent and the wines were great.  The people who work at this hotel are the friendliest yet respectful and helpful.  The rooms were serviced perfect every time and being the hotel is not huge you did not have a long wait for the elevator and the lobby was quiet yet busy.  Highly recommend this hotel!"
November 2017,Wonderful Afternoon Tea in the English Tea Room at Brown's!!!!,"I took my daughter, who is a university student in London, to the Brown's Hotel for the Afternoon Tea in the English Tea Room. We enjoyed it so much! The atmosphere is absolutely stunning with the piano player playing, the fireplace lit, the tastefully decorated room with elegant and comfortable furniture and a very professional staff. Our waiter, Ennio, kindly made sure we were well looked after at all times.  We enjoyed the Tea Tox Afternoon Tea which is a lighter version of the traditional English Afternoon Tea and that suited us just perfectly; it was in every respect a most delicious choice! When it comes to the tea again I can speak only in superlatives; the Brown's House Afternoon black tea is absolutely delicious and very fine. I am glad that I was able to purchase a set…"
October 2017,Perfect from start til finish!,"We arrived at the Brown's hotel after a very long flight from Los Angeles where we were going to visit our daughter who was studying abroad.  The staff provided impeccable hospitality from the moment we were greeted by the doorman until we were escorted to our room and our bags delivered.  The entire 5 day stay was flawless. Room service each morning was beautifully presented and delicious. Cocktails in the lounge were wonderful as was the service! We asked a lot of the concierge team and they exceeded our expectations.  I was trying to arrange for a French macaroon class for myself and 20 year old daughter. The concierge presented a couple of options but none worked out because we were trying to do the class on a Sunday afternoon.  Trying to ""deliver"" for us, the concierge…"
November 2017,Comfort and Service Extraordinaire!,"Brown’s is difficult to beat for luxury, service and location. It has everything for the leisure traveler. My wife and I enjoyed 5 nights at this incomparable hotel and every need was met, some even before we requested them.  On arrival, we were shown to an upgraded room, available through the AMEX Platinum travel program if an upgrade is available. The junior suite had a large king bed, extremely comfortable, a huge bathroom with two sinks, bathtub and separate enclosed shower stall. The ac system worked perfectly and this was important because London was unseasonably warm and the only window was on the courtyard. Do not expect a view at Brown’s. It is only 5 stories and located in the heart of Mayfair where it towers over nothing.  The room lighting was strong. The only…"
October 2017,Afternoon tea,Lovely afternoon with delightful food and very nice and attentive service. We will definetely come again. We tried both the traditional and the tea-tox meny and they can bith be recommended.  The scones were absolutely perfect and everything was filled up as many times as we wanted.   
October 2017,Perfect stay,We had a fabulous stay at browns hotel and will definitely be back to stay again. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very welcoming. The location of the hotel is perfect and we love the quintessential English feel of the hotel. 
October 2017,Excellent service,Very nice hotel ! Excellent accomodation and friendly staf . The drinks in the bar are a little bit overpriced . Breakfast very good . The hotel is located very good for shopping and a lot of good restaurants
September 2017,"Quaint, Comfortable, and Convenient","I stayed at Brown’s recently on a short trip to London and had a great experience.  Brown’s is located in Mayfair, not the most happening spot, but perfect for being centrally located for both work and touristy activities.  I was close enough to run in Hyde Park but also able to quickly get to meetings around the city.  The staff at the hotel was friendly and on top of everything – I could not walk a few steps without being offered help. One note is that they forgot to mention that breakfast was included in my room.  The room was really comfortable with decent modern amenities and a really nice bathroom.  It was also really quiet and decently sizable, which I appreciate.  The bar at the hotel was great as well, with signature drinks for night and a decent place to take meetings…"
February 2017,Everything you expect and more,"I first stayed here with my wife for a weekend and the last time was with my wife and 2 daughters.  Each visit has been perfect.  On the first stay I ordered the romantic getaway offer for our anniversary as Brown's is somewhere my wife has always wanted to stay.  Everything was perfect, from checkin to our own monogrammed dressing gowns when we got to the suite.  However, the real treat was afternoon tea when they presented us with a special desert selection and plate with happy anniversary written in chocolate.  We did not expect this and it was a lovely surprise.  The last time we stayed was for Easter, with the girls.  The girls had their own room and Browns had made a real effort with stuffed toys for the beds and bath toys for the bathroom.  The easter egg hunt was fun and…"
October 2017,THE place to be for a pre-dinner aperitif,"I should say we didn't stay in the hotel, but we were eating at the Ritz to celebrate our son being presented with the Duke of Edinburgh Gold award earlier on in the day.  The Donovan bar in Browns proved to be the perfect location for a pre-dinner aperitif.  A warm ambience greeted us as the doors were politely opened in front of us.  I would have preferred my whisky served in a proper whisky glass rather than a tall cocktail glass, but that's my only slight criticism, apart from that a very pleasant visit."
September 2017,Unsurpassed. ,"Rarely do we find hotels of this caliber. Browns has managed to retain an old world charm that so many hotels lack these days.  The staff remembered every guest giving a delightfully personal feel.  Nothing is too much trouble, simply ask. "
August 2017,Traditional English hotel with great service and good for children,"I mainly picked Brown's as it scored high for being child friendly because I was taking my goddaughter for a trip to London, but also because it is a hotel with a grand history and reputation for outstanding service.  Not being used to travelling with children I was a little apprehensive how my goddaughter would react to a five star hotel.  Fortunately, the staff were brilliant and gave us a lovely greeting on our arrival including the manager personally greeting us at reception.  I had booked two connecting rooms, both of which were furnished with understated elegance.  My goddaughter loved the ""secret"" connecting corridor between the two rooms that accommodated plenty of wardrobe space.  My goddaughter's room had various gifts/toys/books which was a lovely surprise.  The only…"
August 2017,Very Classy Hotel,Classy old-style English Hotel in great location.  Easy to walk to Piccadilly and other major areas. Staff is so professional and will drive you to Harrods and elsewhere. Great food and a fun bar right out of a James Bond Movie.  I would recommend this hotel and it's worth the price!
October 2017,3 Great nights,"Very attentive friendly staff top to bottom.  Front desk and bellman amazing.  Cocktails, especially Donavan martini in the Bar were outstanding. Close to everything.  Enjoyed wonderful spa treatments, experienced therapists.  Can rely on this spot.  "
November 2016,One of the finest hotels in the city,"My bags were sent straight to the room upon arrival, saving my time to explore the city! Maybe I was staying alone, the bed seemed larger lol. Encountered a lovley housekeeping lady, and the doorman was very helpful getting me a cab. Breakfast selection is simple.Still, it was a good stay."
October 2017,Perfect in every way!,"Our second visit to Brown's was simply magical. The property is located in a great neighborhood in Mayfair. Walking distance to so many places. The staff welcome you like you're an old friend. The rooms are tastefully decorated and well appointed. The bedding is amazing. The bathrooms with separate shower and tub are lovely. Our breakfast was included. The hotel continental breakfast buffet features  fresh fruit that alone is worth the visit. Fresh meats, cheeses, yogurts, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, breads and pastries and more. Lovely service in every part on the hotel. Great bar, check the bar menu for lighter eats. Spa, nice gym and hotel car when available. Great concierge team to assist whatever you might need. We took the hotel car service from the airport and found that…"
May 2017,Old World Charm,If you want a home from home then book into to Browns. It has fabulous atmosphere and the service is second to none.  No visit is complete without a cocktail from their excellent bar and it is fun to learn about the art of making them from a consumate professional.
October 2016,"A juvel in London, outstanding service!","My favourite Hotel in London!  Very professional and attentive staff (especially : german lady and young man at front office). Upon your arrival you feel at home! Concierge service excellent.   Delicious breakfast: enjoyed food selection and quality. HIX restaurant very good (loved salmon). You get a ""dolce vita""-feeling, as some of the staff are italian (cf Rocco Forte).  Massage very professional, even if tiny Spa.  I will return in october to this faboulous hotel! Even if I travel without my husband they make me feel comfortable!"
August 2017,Beautiful Hotel with Impeccable Service,"Brown's Hotel is an absolute treasure.  The rooms are beautiful, the hotel is quaint with lots of history, the location is fabulous, and the service is second to none.  We loved the restaurant and lounge, and the consierge were so engaging and helpful.  We couldn't receommend this hotel any higher.  It's a wonderful experience from start to finish!"
August 2017,Fantastic service,"I took a tour of the hotel and had the 3 course set meal recently. The food was excellent, the setting was excellent and ALL of the staff including the guide restaurant manager and eating staff were extremely professional and friendly. Faultless service and food. Highly recommended."
May 2017,Perfect for High Tea in Mayfair,"Formal affair, but in a good way. The exterior of this historic building is sheer class, good for serious meetings and an atmosphere which reminds me of the dining rooms filmed in the Titanic movie. patrons are quite upper-class, the service impeccable. would love to go there though its really not my kettle of fish.   but is highly recommended for those who love to experience luxury and service quality at the highest level"
May 2017,A terrific place to stay with great service,"My wife and I stayed at Browns during a week in May while attending a legal conference in London.  The room we got was really nice and for sure it was large enough for a longer stay.  But, what stands out for me during our stay was the wonderful and attentive service  -- starting with Michele at the front desk, David at the Concierge desk and, of course, the really terrific front doorman, John.  Those people and more made our stay very comfortable and pleasant.  Thanks to you all."
May 2017,Mayfair as it's best,Returning back to London we again stayed at Brown's hotel London. Located very central to can easily reach the major points of interest in walking distance. Nice restaurants nearby. The hotel itself has very friendly and attentive staff and the interior gives a very comfortable atmosphere.  
May 2017,"Decadent setting, service previously lacking but now recovered","My girlfriend went for afternoon tea with some of her friends and wrote to the manager because they found the service a let down. They wrote back and offered us a free glass of champagne by way of apology. We returned specifically for this as we were in the area and the front of house and bar staff were wonderfully polite and lovely.   We chose from the champagne menu, had some complimentary amuse bouche and delicious smokey almonds, and had a lovely relaxing sit down. The setting, drinks, food and service were faultless on this visit."
May 2017,London oasis,"Wonderful relaxing stay.  Great service and personal attention.  Spacious, comfortable room with good work space and large walk-in closet.  Outstanding location near theatre district, Piccadilly, and Trafalgar Square"
April 2017,very smart elegant hotel in the heart of Mayfair close to Piccadilly and The Ritz,was meeting a new client so we opted for nearby Donovans Bar. The hall was decorated in a beautiful flower arrangement which I stopped to admire before having drinks in the bar. The bar is intimate and was busy even at 6;15 but was pretty noisy I think due to the echoing of sound so we didn't stay long as we wanted to have a proper chat so we went to the Arts Club just a few yards away.
May 2017,Posh cocktail bar in Mayfair inside Brown's hotel,"The bar is located on the ground floor of the hotel, passing through the tea room, right at the end of it. It's quite a posh place as you would expect given its location, the staff is super nice and they have an impressive menu in terms of drinks. Cocktail prices range between £17-£20, and they also have an impressive wines list. The range os beers was a bit limited to around 4-5 different ones starting at £7 from what I remember.  If you're looking to impress your date it's definitely a good option :) although expect to spend a bit more than in a Soho cocktail bar."
May 2017,Quiet Quality,"Stayed here for a trip to the Chelsea Flower Show. Checking in was friendly, efficient and professional. The room was spacious (for London), clean and well equipped.  The staff were all extremely helpful and attentive without being intrusive."
May 2017,Surpasses expectations,"We stayed at this hotel for the first time having used a number of other hotels in the area for our previous visits. Our arrival followed an early morning journey from Dover. The arrival experience was friendly, efficient and helpful and included a welcome cup of tea . Our room was large, clean and quiet with a large bathroom. All of the staff with whom we came into contact were friendly, helpful, and willing to go out of their way to offer help when it was sought, also offering what turned out to be expert and accurate advice on a number of our sight-seeing excursions. Donovans Bar was a welcome place to have a quiet drink after a busy day or evening. The fact that Ruinart is the house champagne adds to the moment. While we did not take it, the award winning afternoon tea…"
May 2017,Outstanding Experience,"We chose Brown's London because our previous stays at Rocco Forte hotels in Rome, Brussels and Edinburgh were wonderful. We were even more impressed in London!! We felt their attention to our particular needs created a stress-free London experience. We HIGHLY recommend Brown's London and the Rocco Forte group. "
March 2017,Great Charm and wonderful service in downtown London,The hotel is one of the old established hotel and deserves the highest praise. The staff are wonderful and are there to take care of any need you may have. The know you by name and are quick to offer to help in many ways
March 2017,London Business,"best accommodation and english history combination . best available location for business, shopping, entertainment and sightseeing  the breakfast is outstanding, food quality is excellent , service outstanding congratulations to Rocco Forte Hotels "
June 2016,Afternoon tea. ,My friend and I had a fantastic afternoon tea here. The tea room is truly beautiful especially if you get the nice comfortable armchairs. The sandwiches were fresh and well presented. They give you as much as you need. The scones and cakes were scrummy. The staff are friendly and attentive. You don't feel rushed. One of my favourite experiences of afternoon tea. 
March 2017,A slightly different five star hotel,"If you want to feel at home when away, this is the place. Outstanding, friendly service. Rooms are very well designed and there is a a fundamental attention to details. Elegant rather than grandios in its style."
March 2017,Center stage,"The Browns hotel is one of the true gems of London.   The rooms are large and classy.  From its service to the amenities - the wonderful  food and beverage and morning breakfast with the family.  I loved it's bar and bartenders, it's restaurants and central location in the heart of London.    The there is it's history. My favorite poem is ""if"" by Ruyard Kipling. The poem comes from the ""Jungle Book"" which was written by Kipling while living at the Browns. That is by definition a quintessential London experience.  Our stay was simply for pleasure.  We had never been to London.  I had my wife and two children - the four of us were in a connecting suite and added bed room.  The connection was through the wardrobe room which was wonderful for both our own privacy and the security of…"
March 2017,One of the finest hotels I have ever stayed!  Fabulous service and wonderful location!  Can't wait to return.,"Loved our week at Brown's. I last stayed almost twenty years ago and loved it then.  Its even better now with the best Concierge services I have ever experienced, and I travel frequently, staying at many fine hotels.  The hotel is beautiful, old world, chic and very well maintained.  The service throughout was impeccable, the breakfast was delightful, and the location is perfect.  They welcomed us when we returned each day and were always warm and gracious.  It is truly a special place and worth the splurge."
March 2017,"Fourth visit in last twelve months,so I have opinions!!","OK,obviously,if I stayed the number of times I indicated ,I must live it,right? Yes,true.  I live the comfortable rooms with all one might need except a micro wave AND FOX NEWS CHANNEL.  The ready and endless supply of Blenheim Palace spring water,has charms you can't imagine. The TIMES each day is a nice touch . The quality of your food is just exceptional. Your ""burger"" may be the best on planet earth. Your pastas are very good,for sure.  I could go on and on,but  the REAL key is your people. The concierge helped us on several occasions,but the treat of a Bentley ride had to be a capper. We will be back a couple more times this year.   The entire staff seems highly motivated and well trained."
March 2017,Fun in London!,"My husband and I just spent a week in London. Staying at Brown's is our home away from home!  We enjoyed the service, the continental breakfast which came with the room through AmEx the supply of  Blenheim Palace water, the kind and helpful staff, especially John the doorman and the manager who upgraded our room. "
March 2017,A very charming place,Great hotel with lots of history and tradition. It offers business and leisure travelers unique comfort and service.  Located close to Bond Street it is a perfect place for an English day. Fantastic breakfast. Great tea time. Busy bar.  Enjoy!
March 2017,A hotel like no other!,"We stayed at Browns for the first time on a recent weekend in March. It was our first time staying at this legendary hotel and from the moment we arrived, we knew we were in for a treat. For one reason: the staff. It is an incredibly rare thing to experience a feeling of being genuinely looked after, without being fawned over - such a hard balance to get right in the hospitality industry. The team at Browns (special mentions to George on the front desk and Paul on the concierge desk) cannot do enough to help you, and ensure your stay, both at the hotel and in London, is a very good one. Who knew how good it makes you feel to walk in to the hotel and be warmly welcomed by name! The standard room we had was tucked away in the back of the hotel – no view to speak of from the window…"
July 2017,Afternoon tea - what could be better,"There is nothing I can say to augment a review.  As a global traveler and having lived in England for 3 years,  Browns is an English classic.  Sophisticated service, makes a significant difference.   Prepare to skip dinner."
June 2017,Classic hotel in the middle of London,This is one of the oldest hotels in London  The building looks small but has a very claasic look from inside. The rooms are modern and very clean.  The lobby restaurant is wonderful and has a nice breakfast.  I recommend this hotel if you want to be near Mayfair and Regent Street with quick access to Picadilly. The area around the hotel is classic london.  Very corteous service.
October 2016,"good location, elegant room and pleasant breakfast","good location in the middle of mayfair, but still in a quiet area, so no cirkus around at night. elegant and contemporary room, with an excellent room service even late at night if you might have partied late in the early morning; excellent breakfast with an dedicated team."
July 2017,Bloody Mary masterclass,This was a Sunday treat from my wife with some friends..... Had the bar to our selves 4 of us and 2 cocktail waiters could not have been a better pre lunch experience interesting canapés learnt this history of Bloody Mary's and the opportunity to be the business side was an amazing experience
November 2016,The mark of a top class hotel during stressful time,"THis hotel has all one would expect of a classic London property with 5 star reputation.  However during my stay I had a crisis issue involving stolen luggage and travel documents in London City. The way the hotel assisted me, went out of their way to help and get things done in terms of resolving all the issues involved when something like this happens, is the mark of a true top quality "" home away from home"" that I would expect and require when in need.  Cannot speak more highly of all staff involved"
May 2017,My favourite hotel in London,"May was my 5th visit in just over a year and every time the standards are always the same - exquisite.  The team are all on point, the restaurant wether for breakfast or Dinner is excellent and the tea room is just divine and particularly good if you are having a small discreet meeting   My recommendation is if it matches your budget then don't hesitate to try it out   "
July 2017,Afternoon Tea,"Just tucking into afternoon tea on a Sunday.  Just a delight. Sumptuous surroundings, relaxed with touch of formality, wonderfully attentive staff, exceptional food, and a top drawer range of teas. Seek it out. Worth every penny."
July 2017,3 day stop over,"Excellent hotel. Breakfast was a dream of selections, coffee very good. Room very good a little crowed with furniture but most comfortable. Location you can't beat it right in the middle of down town Lisbon. All staff most friendly and very helpful."
June 2017,Afternoon high tea with champagne ,"I went here on the recommendation of DKs top 10 London because of the high ratings and it being the first hotel in London so I was able to be a part of history also.  The tea was lovely, I could have as much as I wanted and could have stayed as long as I liked.  Champagne was only one glass though.  Food was very rich and was no able to eat everything I was served.  The dining area is used for tea exclusively and felt like my cosy family room at home.  A fantastic experience and well worth the price tag."
June 2017,"Great location, excellent customer service but room was just average",With the Bown's hotel you may be sure that the service will be always perfect. The location is also really good as is the atmosphere.  But my room will not remain unforgettable due to its low ceiling and limited space...check before booking...
August 2017,A Lovely Stay Indeed......,"I can not say one negative thing about this hotel.  From the accommodations to the attentiveness of the Concierge Team, the Browns Hotel is definitely a cut above the rest.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you are in London.         "
August 2017,Perfect Location !,Nice Rocco Forte Hotel with a very British feeling... the restaurant and the tiny bar are nice. Very mature and professional concierge ! But the location it's jus perfect right in the heart of Mayfair. Walking distance to great restaurants and upscale shopping !!
August 2017,Luxury in London,"We spent five nights at Brown's this summer.  We cannot imagine a better experience -- everything was perfect.  The accommodations were luxurious with every detail thought of, and the service was top-notch.  The hotel is also in an unbeatable location.   While Brown's also serves business travelers, we found it incredibly family-friendly.  Our son (aged 7) received his own child-sized bathrobe and a set of toys to entertain him in the room.  The restaurant staff looked out for him at breakfast - making sure he got all of his favorites from the buffet.  The concierge and other staff were thoughtful and attentive.  They helped us arrange a tour and gave us good restaurant recommendations and directions for getting around the city.  Our room was large and luxurious.  The beds and…"
July 2017,Glorious Four Days,"We stayed at the Brown's Hotel in fashionable Mayfair in mid-July. We were assigned to a lovely and spacious suite. We had a nice bedroom, lovely living room and very nice bathroom with a great shower. We had breakfast included in our rate . The breakfast was excellent and our server, Dominick was charming and very responsive. The concierges we worked with, David Young and Matteo Biondi were simply outstanding. Their restaurant recommendations were spot on and they got us fabulous seats for the outstanding award winning play Ferryman for significantly less money than I was quoted on the internet secondary ticket market sites. The hotel location in Mayfair is wonderful. Very near the theater district and historical parts of London and wonderful access to the tube. Also, it's…"
May 2017,Fantastic Hotel in London,"The past few times in London, I have stayed at this fantastic property.  It is located in Mayfair in a very safe neighborhood, very central to everything,  Hyde Park is a 10 minute walk, Bond street for shopping is a 5 minute walk, Selfridges on Oxford street is 20 minutes away and the best bar in the world and probably the most expensive is at The Connaught just off Berkely Square, which is a great neighborhood as well, is a quick 10 minute walk away. One of my favorite streets is Jermyn street, it is a 5 minute walk away as well.  We always stay in a Deluxe Suite, big enough for the two of us for about a weeks times.  They just had a remodel and the rooms are nicer than before.  The service here is great, everyone treats us really well and they do whatever you want very…"
August 2017,A first class British Hotel,"What an enjoyable time in London. Our hotel was very much a part of our enjoyment.. excellent service, first class faculty and a great location. The staff was very attentive and went out of their way to take care of our every request. We will be back."
August 2017,MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE,"Browns is the oldest hotel in London but you wouldn't know it. Everything is perfect and every need is catered for. The staff are absolutely amazing and so helpful. The beds and pillows so comfortable. Rooms are light and spacious. There is not one more thing I could wish for here. It's delightful and charming and perfect. Placed just off Old Bond Street it is right in the heart of the shops and restaurants .this hotel would be my pick every time I am in London, it's like coming home"
August 2017,Afternoon tea delight,"Had a lovely afternoon tea at Browns Hotel in Mayfair. Lovely setting and great service. Tea itself was very good, but not quite as sumptuous as the ones we have had at Claridges and The Savoy. Nice piano playing as well but my wife thought it could have been a bit too loud if we were sitting next to it. Perhaps she is right but I thought it was fine. However, overall it was a very pleasant afternoon in a relaxed setting. My only criticism was the seats were corner sofas so didn't really support you very well which meant you couldn't sit back in them, and you had lean forward to the table."
April 2017,The best,One of the finest and the best hotel to stay in London located in Mayfair with beautifully done rooms huge in size walking distance to many attractions including palace and park in centre of shipping district and amazing restaurants the staff here was very helpful and helpful will for sure stay here again 
March 2017,"Dinner with friends in a great hotel, fabulous location","Some friends and I decided to share a late meal after attending an opening event in Mayfair.   We had no reservation, so decided on Brown's as it's very relaxed whilst keeping its 5 star setting and standards. Dinner was great with really good food, timely and attentive service. A little pricy, but you get what you pay for. I'd really recommend this gorgeous hotel in the heart of Mayfair."
June 2017,Always familiar - Excellent - 2 stays in June,"What a delight to come back to an old favourite. Years ago I used to stay in the Four Seasons Hyde Park but when it went through some renovation I had to find alternative accommodation - FS was gracious and actually introduced me to several fine hotels in London and I picked browns because I do not need some of the luxuries in other hotels whereas others that are important to me are well delivered at Brown's. For many good reasons I have stuck to Brown's as it delights in every way. Food is excellent, rooms are immaculate, general service is great, concierge well staffed, good restaurant, great bar and tea room and superb location as I enjoy many of the fine dining restaurants close by. The managers seem to be able to deliver a solid product by retaining good staff and they all…"
May 2017,The Ultimate High Tea,A chef that lived in London for decades told me to go here. It's pricey but the best you'll find in the place that does this kind of thing. I'm gluten free and that didn't affect my bliss at all. Trays of artful food were presented in a lovely antique setting. Do this if you're in London and you want to treat yourself.
June 2017,Wonderful afternoon tea,"We went here for my sister's birthday celebration.  I love afternoon tea and have been lucky enough to have had a few very nice ones.  Brown's was definitely one of the best.  Delicious tea,  nice cosy surroundings but best of all was the service.  The staff managed to be friendly and super attentive without fussing and getting in the way.  I would say that their excellent staff made the occasion very special - along with the lovely tea of course!"
June 2017,So good!,"Rarely do I enjoy a hotel enough to look forward to a return visit.  However Brown's is in a class by itself.  The friendly, professional staff are very helpful and welcoming.  The rooms are just about perfect (except for a slippery bathtub) and the beds are comfortable. The lobby is limited but we were able to use the tea room to play games in the evening. And the food is truly outstanding.  The English tea room combines the right mood and decor with traditional tea sandwiches and treats (leave room for the scones). The hotel restaurant served one of the best dinners of our week-long feast. The same restaurant provided the wonderful daily breakfasts that were included in the room rate."
October 2016,Best location in London ,"Stayed in a standard classic room, which I found to be much bigger than the standard London size, excelent cocktails at the Donovan Bar, the restaurant was quite full so my booking was pushed back 15 minutes and a complimentary drink was offered. All the staff was very nice and helpful and the location is unbeatable. "
June 2017,"Amazing position, Fantastic Hotel","My 5 night stay at this hotel was flawless.  Fantastic big rooms with a walk in wardrobe, big bathroom with bath and a big comfy bed.  The bars downstairs were the best way to end your day, you must try and cheese platter with the most amazing chestnuts I have every tasted.  The concierges were fantastic and overall the staff were super friendly and so efficient.  I loved everything about this hotel and its in the best position, walked to Buckingham Place, Hyde Park and fantastic shopping all around you.  Highly recommended and cannot wait to return."
February 2017,Birthday dinner with friends,"I had a truly wonderful dinner at HIX Mayfair for my friends birthday, everything was really exceptional from the service to the food. I had the steak tartare because it's a favourite of mine and this one really outshone any I've had in the past. 10/10 would recommend to a friend "
June 2017,very enjoyable,"Very comfortable modern bedrooms, good service from willing well trained staff, delicious breakfast with many healthy choices (Madeleine Shaw dishes).  Perfect for central London with a lively bar which is perfect for a G&T at the end of the day!"
June 2017,Perfect weekend ,"What a amazing hotel in London first time here but will definitely return. amazing room, service, fantastic food!  great location will definitely be recommending to my friends best hotel I have been too in London.  "
June 2017,Excellent as always,"The best service as always - my preferred choice in London. Perfect location, never too busy, historic building - I have been staying here for 15 years and the hotel is always consistent. Look forward to my next stay..."
April 2017,London Travels,The Browns is an excellent  hotel in the heart of Mayfair.  Walking distance to everything and fabulous shopping steps away.. Hotel is impeccable as well as the staff.  Beautiful bathrooms Highly recommend!!
November 2016,Such a joy ,"Had the most pleasant afternoon tea, staff were very attentive & nothing was too much trouble. Staff very friendly & kind, was a joy to be there. We ate at our leisure & were not rushed at anytime. Piano player was amazing made the afternoon so much more special "
April 2017,Perfect Hotel,"I love this hotel.  It is a comfortable haven in the heart of London - a home from home with exceptional service from the staff. The rooms are scrupulously clean and the food is varied and delicious.  Just check in and let the staff handle your baggage.  In minutes, you can be looking at an exhibition at the Royal Academy or wandering down Burlington Arcade.  "
March 2017,Brown's always a pleasure,"Great service, always welcome. Love returning to the Browns in London. Perfect location. The concierge was so helpful in arranging a golf game at the Grove as well as reserving theater tickets for us and providing excellent info on trains etc."
April 2017,Excellent - as always,"We continue to come back to Brown's - when we are in London for pleasure. The explanations are simple: the staff and their attention, excellent breakfast and the bar rooms and: the most effective location. As frequent hotel enjoyers, We hope that the Brown concept will continue to deliver excellent value to us!"
April 2017,Fantastic afternoon tea at the English tea rooms,My family and I went for afternoon tea as we were celebrating our birthdays We ordered 3 tea-tox afternoon teas and 1 traditional afternoon tea the food was amazing the staff were lovely and the waiter who served us was fantastic  There was more than enough food and you could order more if you wanted  We had a very relaxed couple of hours and we were not rushed at all I would definitely go back again  Thank you for making our visit special
April 2017,Brown's - always pleasant,"Returning is always nice. Excellent service. Everything runs perfectly, but in a very relaxed and easy way. You are always welcome and there are never anything that cannot be solved. You want to come back and back"
April 2017,Fab For,"We only stayed one night and had Dinner out.  The Continental buffet breakfast we had was good.  The location is perfect for London, the Staff and Service wonderful and the room we had, King Executive, very comfortable. We only really dealt with Reception and Concierge and nothing was too much trouble for any of the team we met or contacted. Would highly recommend."
April 2017,great place in London,The best place to stay in town. The athmosphere is very British. Tradition and modernity. The service is impeccable. TH efood is excellent. The best tea room in London. Beatiful and spacious rooms. Great Experience.
March 2017,"A superb London hotel, with modern amenities and old-fashioned elegance","This is, simply stated, the best place to stay in London.  The staff could not be friendlier or more helpful, and, while the Hotel is not inexpensive, it is great value for the money. Centrally located in Mayfair, within easy walking distance of London Clubs, the West End Theater District, and the best shopping in the world."
April 2017,Posh,"We just walked in here for an early dinner at THE Browns Hotel not far from Bond Street. The  interior design was classic and POSH. There are some guest departments where you can have Afternoon  tea, and relax in the Lounge area which are all incredibly beautiful but the one we chose to go to was the HIX Restaurant. It was  breathtaking  with the wall half covered in wood. We thought this place while not cheap but you get a great selection of food and fantastic service. William was our Sicilian server who was very attentive and polite. We  absolutely loved the place and will definitely recommend to  anyone to go.  We haven't seen any rooms, etc. But  we can only  comment on the Dinner  experience. So nice to be here with my Welsh darling."
April 2017,Weekend visit,Old fashion courtesy and character within a busy capital city hotel is enhanced by its being positioned within easy walking distance of a plethora of shops that offer a wide choice for the discerning visitor. 
April 2017,Probably the best hotel we have stayed at in London,"Everything is excellent at Brown's including the staff, the room, the atmosphere, the food and the location which is really quiet. We will definitely stay there again. Having tried several top London hotels, this exceeds them all so far."
April 2017,perfect place to be in London Mayfair,"top hotel in the heart of London - we will always be back again. Comfortable, clean, well kept, familiar, lovely atmosphere, very friendly staff, nice breakfast, helpful concierge and porter, relaxed receptionist, an overall positive experience .................................................................................................. ................................................................................................................................................................................"
April 2017,Tea at Brown's Hotel,"Amazing!! My daughter's dream was to have a special tea time in London. Thank you Brown's Hotel for fulfilling her dream. The food was delicious and the ambience was perfect. Our server, Miguel, was extremely gracious. I recommend venue hands down.  SCP, NJ "
April 2017,London Stay,"Superb hotel as you would expect for London, the staff were just superb and very polite, helpfull, and made our stay really enjoyable, would def stay again, the location was very good too not far from the busy shops of Oxford Street, and Bond Street, the building itself was full of charm, will def be back  only one niggle was the people in the room ubove were like a herd of elephants till quite late and the  air condionting unit outside was quite noisey but apart from that very good indeed,,"
April 2017,A more subtle Grand hotel in London with disparities in its rooms,"Ditto, Brown's hotel belongs to the luxury hotel category of London and is conveniently located in Mayfair, but lacks some of the luxuries that its competitors offer (lobby, more restaurants, common grounds). Also, there are significant disparities between the rooms, even of rooms in the same category. On the other hand, you can get a better deal than in most other grand hotels of London. The first room that they showed us was unacceptable for an hotel of this class. Finally, we got a very nice room with nice king size bed (at a surcharge). I also have serious objections about the bathroom amenities by James Heeley. They are of very good quality and surprisingly large packing (100ml), but the scent (Fresh grass, Rhubarb, Fig Leaf, etc.) is debatably pleasant. I understand that…"
October 2016,British treat with class,"It's a perfect understated hotel without too much people coming and going. I stayed for a week and the place was all I needed. Not too much fuss from the staff but the choices available for both cocktails and afternoon tea.  Had several spa treatments which was nice, especially after long working days in London. Would go back for an all girls' weekend, but perhaps not the most romantic of choices. "
May 2016,Ultimate perfection ,I visited with my mum for a very special weekend break. From check in (personal and friendly) to afternoon tea - this hotel is in a league of its own. Luxurious without being pretentious and personable without being intrusive. Our room was beautiful - a bottle of champagne on ice and a plush teddy bear to greet us was such a thoughtful and generous gesture. Breakfast and dinner was impeccably served and the food was superb. We hope to return again. Special mention to the afternoon tea - the best we have ever sampled in the most salubrious setting. 
April 2017,Delicious Portland Crab and Torbay Dover sole,"Brown's is everything that one would hope for, and before London transmogrified from its British past, used to find in the best yet Mayfair hotels.   Calm and dignified, exquisite service with a really lovely interior.   The Hix restaurant has never failed to provided a most delicious lunch. The ingredients being good quality that is then wonderfully cooked.   Rooms are elegant and relaxed with none of the pretension of some of the more avant garde offerings.   Prices are such that if there is a need to ask of them in advance it might perhaps be best to consider and alternative. That said the prices are typical of central London's top establishments.   The bar is a real pleasure, providing a wide range of the better spirits, liqueurs, champagne etc and really well made…"
August 2017,Fine dinner experience in Hix Mayfair,Friendly welcome and efficient service. Relaxed atmosphere in Hix restaurant followed by a delicious meal chosen from a menu with a mouth watering choice of fine foods. Overall a most enjoyable evening helped by excellent service.
August 2017,Excellent supper,"Excellent supper in Hix, hugely helpful waiters and staff, who made you feel welcome the moment you walk in. I would recommend the prawn cocktail and sea trout.  I will be coming back again with friends, thank you for a memorable evening."
August 2017,Fantastic Hotel,"great service, fantastic room, great food from room service and the restaurant  and right  in the middle of the city overall a great experience and fantastic/helpful staff would definitely come back. ☺☺☺"
August 2017,Mixing business with vacation,"My family and I recently stayed at this hotel.  I was in London on business and my family joined me to tour London.  You cannot choose a better hotel for service, accommodations, and location.  From the Doorman to the concierge to housekeeping to the rest of the staff, the people were friendly, and insightful in helping my family have a great experience in London.  Highly recommend."
July 2017,"Wonderful Staff, Wonderful Location...You will want to stay here when you're in London",What a wonderful experience my daughter and I had at Brown's Hotel. This was my daughter's first visit to London so we were out and about playing tourist. The hotel is conveniently located to many tourist attractions and shopping. The concierge and porter were very helpful in recommending places to visit. The high afternoon tea was amazing! and HIX Mayfair was wonderful!  We are looking forward to going back soon. 
July 2017,Crew,"The crew is excepcional all the times in all places. Te concierge crew are outstanding finding what ever you are looking for, no matter the difficulty. The Browns locattion y very good, near tube, theatre and important city points."
July 2017,Excellent,"Very charming place, and our primary London choice since many years. Charming and exclusive without being stuffy or arrogant. Nice atmosphere. Very cosy bar. Rooms are not large, but all you need is there. We stayed in a junior suite, and that gives you that bit of extra space - recommended. The location is wonderful, and you can walk to Bond Street, St. James, Oxford Street, Regent Street."
July 2017,Baby Shower,"I was ringing around different hotels regarding a tour around London whilst we stay! The telephone Operator Brenda was very professional and friendly which is very hard to get nowadays. She was very patient as I really wasn't sure what to ask for, she suggested I be put through to concierge who was very helpful I believe I spoke to a Paul! Who knew everything I requested! I felt safe knowing how helpful he was (Friendly Helpful Staff All Round)"
May 2017,Perfect!,"Our second stay at Brown's Hotel and it delivers in all aspects of a perfect stay.   The ambiance within the hotel is warm, friendly and you feel there is always someone more than happy to help if needed.   I couldn't fault the hotel and it lived up to my expectations from our previous stay without any trouble at all.  Perfect location and central to just about everything. The breakfast on offer is terrific.  The staff are amazing right from the concierges to the front desk staff. Having flown in a day later than my family they could tell it had been a long flight and it was late at night so they parked some of the usual check-in requirements until the morning.  Perfect!"
June 2017,Mid week,We decided to visit London and were recommended this hotel. Wow what a find the restaurant was amazing and the food great. The bedroom suite was massive and well equipped. The staff were all very professional we will be back
May 2016,Enjoyed the stay in this hotel,"I have been in this hotel for some times, it is always perfect. The old atmosphere you feel and the first class service gives you the impression that you stay at home. The rooms offer all the modern amenities, without being flashy and modern."
December 2016,Love this hotel,Stayed here a few times. Has that atmosphere of elegance and class. Love the stylish design and service was excellent and attentive.  Definitely recommend for its location in Mayfair and it's bar feels lively enough and trendy.   It's high price is justifiable I will choose this hotel above the Dorchester any day
February 2017,Best Hotel in London!,"I have stayed in London at a few of the top hotels and this is by far the best.  Fantastic rooms,  quiet location but central to everything.  Service was perfect in Hix, Donovans, Reception and Concierge.  Breakfast was perfect too.  All in all a great stay in a lovely hotel.  5 Star and more.   Left my car in valet parking and got a free tin in sweets on our departure.  Little touches like that make the difference!!!"
November 2016,LOVE the Brown's Hotel,Our go to hotel in London.The location is perfect and the staff is lovely.  Love that they improved their wifi - but I don't think that guests should have to pay extra for faster internet. It's a luxury hotel -- that should be part of the package. 
February 2017,Amazing Hotel,"There wasn't a time we were there and interacting with the staff that they didn't address us by name. They seemed genuinely happy to be working there and the location was amazing. Green Park tube station just a few blocks away. And the bar at the hotel, The Donovan Bar, makes amazing cocktails. Our room didn't have the greatest view but our studio suite was roomy and everything was taken care of for us each day. Would definitely recommend this Hotel and come back again. A great experience. "
February 2017,Sabine,"Very warm and welcome Hotel with exzellent Service, Food and very comfotable. Top located in the Heart of London. Quiet Roms and very clean. Breakfast is very good, Nice bar with excellent Drinks! Overall excellent "
February 2017,Escape,"My husband and I decided to have our first night away from the kids so we wanted to be pampered and have a little bit of luxury. Browns was exactly that. The hotel is exactly what you expect. Excellent, traditional service with beautiful interior. We loved Donavans Bar.. would we stay at Browns again? Most certainly. "
February 2017,Browns - Mayfair,"Excellent stay at classy Mayfair hotel. Reception and concierge as expected of a high end hotel. The overall feeling of class rather than glitz. Would definitely stay again. Great part of town, easy to walk to central attractions."
February 2017,quality!,"if you are looking for a small business meeting - that will be good place to start.  location is more the better: - 15 to 20 minutes for almost all London ""place to visit"" - parking is available for hotel guest and visitors as well, big bonus as to park a car there is a task"
January 2017,Great New Year at the Brown's Hotel,"A grand old hotel with a lot of history, our stayed over New Years Eve was made most memorable by all staff members that we met. Hospitality Professionals is a fitting title for what they do but, these professional at The Browns are the best we have ever had the privilege to meet. The hotel is very buttoned up and the service and help provided by staff was excellent always going the extra mile or kilometer (which ever measurement you choose). One example was on New Year's day. Up early and ready to go to the airport we were advised that our cab was p4rked 4 blocks from the hotel as the City was being prepared for a rather large New Year's Parade and the car could not drive to the hotel. No problem, 2 Brown's professionals walked us and our bags to the car without being asked.…"
February 2017,My London Love,I love this hotel. My boyfriend is in London very often and sometimes I´m lucky enough to join him :-) The Browns is like our second home. Always feel welcome and it`s some kind of familiar. The location/ neighbourhood is lovely Mayfair. Very posh and just a scroll from Oxford Street / Bond Street for shopping. The rooms are lovely and very high end and there`s nothing the staff wouldn`t do to make their guests feeling comfortable and this in a very gentle and decent way. There are other high class hotels in London where the staff is really pushy but not at the Browns. Very professional. Thank you for being so lovely.
April 2017,On arrival  immediately felt like returning friends,"We arrived in the freezing London rain worn out from several days of travel. Immediately we felt like returning friends with the warm welcome from  the staff. All the staff were courteous and attentive without being intrusive. The rooms were large, clean and beautifully prepared.  Thanks for a welcoming stay."
May 2017,Barrister,"First rate in all respects - facilities, staff, service, food, and location. John the Doorman is a delight - the best professional I have ever encountered in that job in all my travels! I would give Brown's 10 stars..."
May 2017,Disappointed. Did not meet expectations.,"Check in Nothing special.  No welcome drink or personalized seated check in.  Did receive upgraded room as booked through FHR.   Room Junior Suite on 5th floor.  Large room, comfy bed/linens, although 2 singles pushed together, so ridge in middle.  Room needed upgrade. Stains on carpet; bathroom old with shower over bath; AC unit very loud and not very effective.  No view.  No iron/ironing board in room. Had to request. Had to request hairdryer. Would like more complimentary water. Did receive welcome chocolates and fruit.  Housekeeping Was impressed with housekeeping. Generally very good.  Only comment is that on night 2 they didn't do turn down until 9.30pm (after saying they'd do it at 8pm), which meant we were in the room at the time  Afternoon tea Pleasant but slow service.…"
April 2017,hospitality,"Very warm hospitality in the room, at reception, at concierge,transport driver,at restaurant and door men. Everybody works smartly and carefully. Very good access to Barlington arcade and Jermin street which are our favourite places."
April 2017,Mayfair gem,"Stayed at the Brown's hotel a few times and love it. Great hotel. great hospitality, great location, Indian restaurant across street was fantastic. Love staying here. Great location, easy access to the tube."
November 2016,Afternoon Tea,I ended up booking Browns for afternoon tea as Claridges was full so I wasn't sure what to expect. I contacted beforehand to explain I had a nut allergy and that my mum doesnt eat meat or eggs or cheese  (a tricky combination of people). We areived 20 minutes early which enabled us to grab the seats next to the open fire which was exquisite. The staff were SO friendly and helpful. The setting was beautiful and the chef had created sandwiches and cakes especially for our dietry requirements. Highly recommend it here!!
April 2017,Grand Dame still (again) in great form,"Splendidly refurbished, this older, charming hotel still competes at high level. exceptional service, great location, and quintessential British charm. Home of the iconic afternoon tea experience. Concierges know the insider tricks of navigating London"
April 2017,One of the best London hotels by far,"Fantastic hotel in one of the best locations to explore London. Spacious and comfortable rooms and very family friendly, Staff were attentive and helpful at all times and the gifts for the kids were a lovely extra touch. HIX restaurant thoroughly recommended although we did not have time for the afternoon tea this time round.. Great hotel.. Many thanks for making us feel so much at home.  "
April 2017,London Weekend,Fabulous hotel in an excellent location. Staff truly wonderful..... so helpful and polite. Donovan bar superb.... invited 16 friends to join us for drinks and it was a perfect place to meet and have pre dinner drinks
March 2017,"Brown's Hotel, London, the best it ever gets!","I have been staying at Rocco Forte hotels, across the world, for many years. The attitude, approach and culture of the staff remains a solid consistent, at Brown's. The experience is magnificent, it has never changed in that regard. As ever,  it does so much more than it says on the tin! "
March 2017,perfection,"Just the most wonderful hotel, discreet, with just the most exceptional staff who show utmost care for your well being and just do that little extra that makes this hotel so special and better than the competition.  Can not recommend it enough. The flowers in the hotel are worthy of a mention alone, together with the most beautiful fig toiletries from a previously unheard of brand,Heeley. A very special place for a special treat/occasion/splurge."
March 2017,Wonderful afternoon tea,"Taken here by our kids for a family celebration, specifically for afternoon tea. The public areas of the hotel are very traditional, but lovely all the same. The lounge area where the tea was served was equally pleasant, a good ambience and none of the feeling of rush and over crowding that seems to be typical of so many hotels serving afternoon tea.  The service was relaxed but efficient.  We were allowed to linger for two hours over the meal with plenty of time between the savoury dishes and the yummy cakes and scones. The amuse bouches (one beforehand and one between the 'courses') were a nice touch, as was replacing the sandwiches and scones on request as we finished them.  We particularly liked the bitter orange jelly amuse bouche. The main food elements were all excellent…"
March 2017,Lovely stay,"I grew up in London and return often. This is my first time staying at Browns and definitely not my last. Wonderful friendly staff, clean spacious rooms and attentive house keeping. The location is perfect - close to sites but also a little out of the fray of touristy hotels. Close walk to Green Park and Bond street tube stations. We were upgraded to a suite which was such a treat. Will be back. Thank you Browns for a fantastic stay in London."
March 2017,Superb!,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful.  We live in a Ritz Carlton property in the US so we are familiar with top notch service.  The Brown's Hotel is definitely top notch.  The service is amazing, they attend to every need and are extremely helpful.  The restaurant was excellent.  Terrific location.  They even have a house car during the day that can take you to your destination (based on availability).  When we come back to London, this will be our go-to."
March 2017,Simply first class,"Brown's is my favorite place to stay in London.  The staff could not be more warm, welcoming and professional. Both the bar and the restaurant are exceptional.  Loved the coffee, espresso and warm milk and pastries from 5-7am in the reception area--provided a nice jolt to my morning workout.  The hotel is simply first class on every dimension."
March 2017,"great hotel, great service, good location and spacey rooms","great hotel with very friendly staff, fast reception process. Fast reacting concierge, good location and spacey rooms (especially in London where most are rather small). Very clean, lots of light in rooms and lobby, a bit slow service in hotel restaurant HIX, nice afternoon tea"
March 2017,Must stay!,"Brown's Hotel is not only perfectly located with a very short walk to Bond street and all the shopping areas, it has beautiful rooms and great food options in the Hotel. I can only recommend the afternoon tea in the English Tea room. We also had drinks in the bar, which is slightly dark but very smart nonetheless. It is a very pricey stay but definitely worth it as the level of service is very high."
March 2017,TOY London,Brown's Hotel is in walking distance  to Bond- and Regent Street and Piccadilly Circus perfect for shopping trips and cultural stays the service of the whole staff is absolutely adorable the high tea is very delicous
March 2017,Top Notch Browns,"Browns has always the most attentive staff, it has wonderful suites and a bar to have fun in Fabulous for a shopping stay in the heart of London, there are never any issues, the luxury is pure 5 star and you are always looked after supremely well - thank you again"
February 2017,very good and I never stayed at hotel which has same services can be provided,"i stayed at connaught hotel before, but I am sure that I can recommend Brown hotel to our VIP clietsn after this staying. I found two gentlement from your hotel whom are discussed of food while I am having breakfast at restaurant, I can feel how concern of your hotel for food quality for clients.   "
January 2017,Amazing Afternoon Tea!,"First time coming to Brown's hotel...as you go in, you can hear tinkling piano music from the dark wooden tea room. Arrived for my friends birthday and were greeted by the very friendly maitre de. We had the champagne afternoon tea  (£65 but managed to find 25% off with voucher online).  There were 2 sets of savouries: finger sandwiches; and generous salmon blinis/goats cheese tarts. Classic scones that were warm, and very tasty cakes. We indulged on extra sandwiches so barely had room for the cakes!  They also brought over a cake with a candle for my friends birthday!  The ambience was relaxed and comfortable, with a mix of people. Was a love treat and by far the best tea I've had! Highly recommend! "
January 2017,"Amazing location, attentive staff, elegant accommodations","The staff at Brown's went above and beyond. My fiance and I had come off a red-eye and went to the hotel several hours before our check-in time with the expectation that we would just be dropping our things off before sightseeing. Upon check-in, they informed us that of course our room was ready now and promptly took us up to ensure that everything was to our liking. The room itself was very comfortable. The hotel has been recently renovated and the style of the room is transitional while the lobby and other public areas have stayed true to many original details - striking a nice balance between homage to the history of the hotel and many of the modern conveniences we've come to expect at luxury hotels. We were amazed to learn that we had a local cell phone with unlimited data…"
February 2017,Lovely Tea!,"Gorgeous afternoon tea, in very relaxing surroundings. Perfect sandwiches, fresh scones. Piano music was great. Great London experience. Went with friends, felt we could relax the whole afternoon there."
January 2017,Simply The Best in London,"As a huge fan of Rocco Forte, I was very much looking forward to my stay at Brown's, and I certainly wasn't  disappointed. The hotel is set in the heart of exclusive Mayfair and is easily accessible by taxi and public transport. Check in was efficient and welcoming, and turn down was arranged for later that evening, The room itself (110) was perfectly decorated in muted tones, whilst being stylish and comfortable. On returning to the hotel in the evening we enjoyed a range of cocktails in the Donovan Bar which were tasty and the service was impeccable. We retired to bed and had a great night's sleep and we were awoken with a delicious breakfast from in-room dining which included fresh fruit, juices, piping hot coffee and much more. Checkout was once again faultless and the…"
January 2017,HORRIBLE,"What disgusting game does your Portuguese receptionist at the front desk DO! And it's NOT the first time, she gives you a HORRIBLE  room and then miraculously tells you I can offer you something better if YOU PAY MORE. SO CLASSY!!!!"
January 2017,Afternoon Tea with gluten free options in delightful surroundings,"A friend and I visited the hotel for a Champagne afternoon tea. My friend is gluten intolerant so we were both keen to see what alternatives would be offered. Decent tasting gluten free bread with her selection of sandwiches. We had a three tier stand of cakes and scones each! Gluten free options included scones, a panna cotta but most cakes were cheesecake based. Overall my friend was pleased.  Too much to eat in one go but we were able to take the rest home in the hotel's cake boxes.  I have had a few afternoon teas and felt  this was good value having taken advantage of a 25% discount offer via a booking website. Great ambience with a piano player in the lounge. Attentive and polite staff. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. I would visit again."
January 2017,Birthday treat,Fantastic location - a nice sized hotel in the heart of London run by people how are exceptionally good at what they do - having stayed in most of the city centre hotels I can strongly recommend this hotel if you are looking for something comfortable and more welcoming
January 2017,An Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is full of character, style and comfort. The staff are wonderful, as is the food. A great location for shopping and the theatre whilst away from the noise of the London traffic. We would love to live here!"
December 2016,"AFTERNOON TEA ROOM, soooo  DELIGHTFUL!!","I was fortunate enough to be surprised by my Lovely Daughter & be taken for Afternoon Tea at the beautiful Browns Hotel Tea Room!...(a wonderful birthday treat for a tea lover!) On arrival we were welcomed by immaculately dressed staff...shown to our seats & presented with menus...perfect courteous service...A choice of several tea blends...along with a choice of sandwiches, sweet treats and delights!!! delicate china cups ...silver teapots.. This was true English afternoon tea at it's most magnificent!! background music by a live pianist...beautiful surroundings.... and as Queen Victoria and Agatha Christie were past visitors..IT WAS CERTAINLY GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!!!! I absolutely loved this whole experience...Will never Forget this super memory of the PERFECT AFTERNOON!!! would…"
February 2017,Shopping trip in London,"Nice and comfortable hotel the best place in London. Very friendly and helpful concierge ..  The room was large and comfortable, but only the view of the courtyard, the reason that it was a little dark.  The bed was very comfortable and the furniture nice, but I do not like rooms with carpet flooring. Overall 4 beautiful and relaxing days in a beautiful and very hospitable hotel."
February 2017,"Love this hotel! Super location, great service, great rooms!","We have stayed multiple times, we love this hotel. Location is unique, if one choses Mayfair. The rooms are large, cosy and beautifully decorated - one of the strong advantages of RoccoForte brand. Service is always great, very friendly and discreet. "
February 2017,Valentine's day at Brown's!,"We had an absolutely wonderful time at the hotel. Reception was very friendly and efficient, the room was comfortable and chic, we had drinks before the theatre in the tea room and a great breakfast next morning. The hotel had organised as requested lovely flowers and chocolates and added their own little treats which was sweet, in every sense! If you want great tradition and yet 21st century comfort and service then Brown's is the right place!"
February 2017,Excellent stay at Brown's for the BAFTAs,"I recently stayed at Brown's while traveling to London for he BAFTA awards ceremony. This was my first time staying at Brown's and I was very pleased with all aspects of the hotel. In fact, my only regret is that my trip was so short, I wasn't able to take full advantage of all the hotel had to offer. "
February 2017,Lush,From the moment you arrive at the front door until you leave you are treated with smiles kindness and non problem is too big or small for the excellent staff . Great in house dinning no matter time of night 
February 2017,Great Mayfair location with exceptional service,"Wonderfully appointed rooms, exceptional service from front desk, concierge, doorman, and restaurant staff. Great location in Mayfair. Tea room was perfect London experience. Breakfast was plentiful and service was friendly and professional. "
November 2016,Classic London High Tea,"Anyone who does business in London knows the importance of high tea.  Mayfair is known for the best of the best in high end Hotels.  My favorite by far, whether it's for business or pleasure, is Brown's Hotel.  The masculine decor is perfect to sip a sherry or scotch by the fire.  Move on to a lovely sampling of scones and sandwiches and round it all out with their exquisite dessert selection.  Each bite has developed flavors with traditional perspective.  Fresh ingredients, smart presentation, attentive staff."
February 2017,"Farewell, my lovely","I've been visiting brown's for over 15 years and it has always delighted me for its reserve, the quality of service  and it felt right. See previous reviews  Sadly, no more - the hotel feels cheap, cost- cutting and the service in the dining room and library are disappointing. Tables crammed too close together.   The tranquility and joy has gone out of the place.  The long- term manager has left and you can feel the space he has left behind.  It all comes down to leadership whatever the industry.  My husband enjoyed his breakfast- perhaps because some of the long serving staff are still working in the Morning.  But me I'm looking for a new place to stay."
February 2017,Excellent Traditional Hotel,"We arrived in the morning but the hotel had already set up our Junior Suite. We requested and received a quiet room on the courtyard. The room was comfortable and spacious. The only noise came from doors slamming on the hall, but I'm not sure they can do anything to remedy that and it only occurred one night. There was no street noise at all. Housekeeping was impeccable. The cold buffet is a solid offering. The only week link was the dinner at Hix, which I reviewed separately (too much pushing to upsell followed by an attempted overcharge). I recommend Brown's and would return."
January 2017,Just what you would expect....,"Wonderful hotel, great service, nice bar, wonderful breakfast, great location.  Only issue is the low price rooms have views of a lightwell and airconditioning ductwork, but this is probably a common problem in long standing city hotels."
November 2016,5 * Trually,"Visited Browns hotel with my husband and everything about it is amaizing, its so conviniently located in the heart of London. Everything was simply amaizing from the service, welcome, the rooms to the afternoon tea with the lovely victoria sponge cakes.  Trually a 5* start hotel. "
December 2016,Best Boutique Hotel in London,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a small hotel with an emphasis on service. It has a great location in the mayfair / piccadilly area with easy access to the tube. The staff makes a point to know each and every guest. They are truely interested in making your stay and visit perfect. They will help with any booking or reservation.   For example, I was having trouble booking tickets to a local attraction. We mentioned it to the concierge as we were walking to breakfast. He secured the reservation and brought the tickets to our table before we finished our meal.    Yanick (Yannis) in dinning provided the most exceptional service. He knew our favorite drinks / coffees by the second day. We felt like family by the end of our trip. He truly cared about our family…"
December 2016,Wonderfully comfortably luxurious place,"The staff at Brown's hotel has a talent for taking care of you without bothering you.  It's hard to explain how subtle and attentive they are.  I felt watched over without being intruded upon.  It's efficient in a relaxing way.  The hotel is comfortable and cozy while still fancy.  I will absolutely come back here the next time I'm in London.  The location is unparalleled, the rooms are spacious and well-designed, it's a great place."
December 2016,A very good year end,"A very good location an good services and installations, nice room and bed, allows a pleasant  days in London,  Staff are very helpful, and the restaurant and breakfast used high quality foods. you will feel more in your house than in a hotel   "
December 2016,Superior London Hotel,"Exceptional... what more is there to say. It is our choice of the many London Hotels and restaurants if you are seeking pretension, reception and communal areas like an airport arrivals lounge, this isn't a place for you.  A hotel where Churchill could enjoy a beverage or two and reflect on his day.. we are still doing the same!"
December 2016,Brown's London,Fabulous hotel in excellent location. We particularly enjoyed the bar which had live entertainment while we were there. Staff are very helpful and really want you to enjoy your stay. Our room was large in comparison to other London hotels in which we have stayed.
January 2017,Superb Afternoon Tea!,"I can't think of a better way to spend New Years Day, than by having Afternoon Tea at Browns Hotel.  What a wonderful experience my husband and I had. The ambience in the tea room was lovely, with the pianist tinkling the ivories in the background. All the staff were friendly, but also completely courteous and professional.   The Afternoon Tea was simply superb, excellent choice of teas which were poured for us, then the selection of sandwiches, mini rolls, and bagels with delicious fillings and toppings. After a second round of savouries, we were then plied with warm scones and exquisite patisserie, which were absolutely to die for!   We had expectations, and I must say they were well and truly exceeded. All in all, a truly wonderful afternoon. Many, many thanks!"
December 2016,Excellent,"The location of hotel is very good for shopping, meals and theaters. All the staff of the hotel are kind and friendly. I want to use it when I next stay in London. I would like to recommed this hotel to my friends."
December 2016,Understated elegance in the heart of London,"Excellent stay in this exquisite hotel.  The attention to detail is second to none and we were made to feel extremely welcome, looked after and part of the ""family"".  Even the doorman who hailed our taxi knew our name.  The service was faultless, non-pompous and friendly.  Concierge were exceptional in managing excellent restaurant recommendations, managing car pickups and last minute changes.  "
December 2016,Overall a first class experience!,"When traveling to London, you have a lot of hotel options. And we have stayed at many. Brown's Hotel may be the best. Located in Mayfair, the hotel has an unassuming entry - but once inside you are quickly impressed with the level of service and intimate engagement. If you read my other reviews, you know I'm not easily satisfied. Brown's makes you feel right at home and in the cradle of luxury. The suites are impeccably appointed with amazing bathrooms and comfy beds. I can pick apart almost any hotel stay but I have a hard time finding any fault with Brown's. From the concierge, who chased reservations during a busy time of year to the front desk staff that worked hard to handle my many requests, the entire stay was a true joy. Thank you Brown's for making our trip a great…"
January 2017,Exceptional,"The hotel is beautiful, the mix of modern art and traditional furniture and fixtures is seamless. The service is outstanding - charming, warm and friendly staff. You feel truly spoilt staying here. Could not recommend it more."
January 2017,Very Good With Great Service,"I have stayed at this hotel several times, with the most recent stay on January 14, 2017.  An upgraded room was ready and waiting for me when I arrived (I was staying on a free Leading Hotels of the World night award).  Staff were great, housekeeping was great.  Room was spotless.  Only issue I bed it too soft and low to floor.  Did not seem like a true king bed, possibly two twins put together.  Other than this issue, this is a quality hotel with a great location.  They go above and beyond.  I will be back again on February 17 - hope for a firmer bed, but otherwise expect a great stay.  "
January 2017,"Superior Hotel, Staff, Stay","Exceptional one night stay. The welcome, check-in and at check-out was charm and efficiency. We had drinks at the Donovan bar and Afternoon Tea - both of which are at the top of comparable experiences (eg Claridges Tea and Conaught Bar) in terms of quality and service. Exceptional hotel and staff. "
January 2017,London is the best!,"I stayed at Brown's Hotel in my last trip to London. The location is amazing, the service was perfect and my room (junior suite) was very comfortable. All the staff was very friendly and did their best to improve our stay."
January 2017,Teatime Treat,"Marvellous! Visited this lovely hotel for afternoon tea during the festive period and was delighted with everything. Our table was sited very close to the piano(lovely musical accompaniment to tea!) in a comfortable lounge area with a lovely log fire blazing in the grate. After a pleasant welcome from helpful staff, we were shown to our table and soon afterwards our orders were taken.  Tea started off with a delicious beetroot and ginger seasonal drink- quite warming considering how cold it was outdoors! The sandwiches and savoury treats were excellent, so too the warmed scones served with clotted cream and homemade strawberry jam. Then a blood orange jelly palate cleanser arrived(also delicious) followed by an array of beautifully presented cakes and pastries. The tea pots were…"
January 2017,Perfect Party!,"We had a 2 night break here including a private dinner to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday - it couldn't have been any better. Brown's was the perfect location for our celebration - a lovely private dining room, excellent service from the first moment we arrived to our departure and the best food possible.The entire weekend was fabulous and we can't thank the staff there enough for all their hard work. If you have a special occasion to celebrate it will be extra special if you choose Brown's Hotel."
December 2016,THE best afternoon tea in town!,"Browns afternoon tea is memorable for all the right reasons...I really could wax lyrical, but having toured a few of the 'best' venues in London, this just wins hands down, for us. Classy, exclusive, world-class service, food, beverages, music and ambience. Just go, and message us if you disagree!"
January 2017,Shoot,"Perfect loacation, great food, helpful staff bar the front of house who was cold and unhelpful. Quick service of anything we needed. Suite was lovely size if not a bit dark and a strange picture above the desk."
January 2017,A Great Stay in London,"The Brown's Hotel is the place to be!  The staff was incredible and made us feel right at home, especially with our two children (5 & 7). The concierge team was very knowledgeable and made booking things a breeze. The other hotel staff was a delight to be around and very accommodating. The location is one of the best in London as well. A must when visiting London!"
December 2016,Wonderful City Hotel,"Wonderful city hotel and for london standards big rooms. Good price for Christmas time. Very nice breakfast selection and very friendly staff. Cozy tea room atmosphere and bar. Perfect location for piccadilly, soho, regent street and bond street!!"
January 2017,Best in London?,What a truly great hotel. The Brown's Hotel combines its glorious past and superb location with excellent staff and very comfortable accommodation. The bar is a treat and breakfast a morning highlight.  We'll be back.
January 2017,Excellent ,"From the moment we checked in we knew this would be a special stay.   Reception, Doorman, Porters, Barman, Restaurant Staff and everyone else are all second to none.  This is an excellent hotel and one we will return to.   Thank you. "
January 2017,"Excellent stay , wonderful hotel","Another fabulous stay at Browns Hotel , Excellent staff and stay and great location to Bond Street - Loved the suite we had and the bar is a wonderful experience - a must in London, and never disappoints ."
January 2017,Home from Home,"It's always a pleasure staying at Brown's. Comfortable accommodation, excellent and attentive staff,  great food and service. Never disappoints. Always sad to leave, but can't wait til we stay there again."
January 2017,Home away from home!,"This is a wonderful hotel in a terrific location. You will feel at home here. The staff could not be more friendly and attentive, our room and bathroom were splendid, just stay away from the afternoon tea which is outrageously priced!"
January 2017,Weekend stay in London,"Chose Browns for a overnight stay in London and visit to the Arts Club across the road + Great Hotel, perfect location, top if you are looking for a cosy hotel with a warm boutique-hotel feeling. Not a classical ""grand hotel"" setting like the Ritz  + Breakfast: supreme quality, few choices at the continental menu but trade-off for quality is worth it + Location, location, location  "
January 2017,Business with Diana,"Brown's Hotel, centrally located, in London is a 5 star hotel with all the great amenities. Great staff and internal restaurant..(Mayfair)..  This hotel is part of the Rocco Forte chain from Europe..wonderful place."
January 2017,Very nice afternoon tea at Browns,"Visited as part of a 50th birthday celebration and found the whole experience very enjoyable.  This is certainly not going to be the cheapest place you will drink tea and eat sandwiches, but it will pro a lay be one of the most enjoyable?  Upon arrival coats and bags were put in the cloakroom and we were shown to our table. Pianist playing away in the background.  A fine selection of teas for all tastes were offered, along with a tray of sandwiches, which were replenished each time you finished them. Next was scones, cream and jam and cakes.  A very nice treat, nothing could be faulted.  "
January 2017,Attention to detail,"A truly beautiful intimate hotel within the heart of Mayfair. A tasteful fusion of traditional and modern. The service is outstanding. Every single member of staff within the hotel proved attentive and that makes all the difference be it a one night stay or a week. I would absolutely recommend a stay here, and as a result am now keen to discover some of the other Rocco Forte hotels worldwide."
January 2017,feeling at home,"We allways enjoy our stay at Brown's. Everyone is very friendly, concierges very usefull and housekeeping staff very atentive. The restaurant offers gluten free food which is vital for our sun who is allergic and the quality is exceptional. "
December 2016,London at it's best,"I read a quote that I can only confirm emphatically. ""I do not stay in a hotel, I stay at the Brown's"". Excellent service, familiarly, my children were given really good attantion, etc. I've stayed at many good hotels in Mayfair, but this is one of the best."
December 2016,A Real Gem!,"I nearly gave Brown's a 4* review, due to the very high cost of staying here, but that seemed somewhat unfair, as that's London for you. I arrived on foot (Green Park Tube is just around the corner) and was greeted at the door, my bag taken, and escorted to reception. Check-in was very smooth and I was allocated a Classic Room - 211. It's next to the lift, but I was not disturbed in any way with noise from the corridor and the hotel was fully booked. No view, but as I secured the room at an extremely favourable rate, I wasn't expecting one. The receptionist showed me the features in the room and also pointed out a hot water safety feature on the bath taps.  Lost of nice touches in the room (bathrobes, selection of different amenity kits, full sized shower gel) and not long after…"
December 2016,Missing the little things,"My wife kindly booked a weekend here for my 50th and the hotel promised to deliver a great experience down to the tiny things. In truth they did well but still fell somewhere short. Despite being told that our daughter was a mature 12 year old they still decorated the kids room like she was a 12 month old! When we arrived at 1500 our rooms were not ready and we were forced to come back 15 minutes later - an inauspicious start. Service at breakfast on the Sat was slow to say the least (which was addressed on the Sunday) but the food quality was not what we had expected. The bacon sandwich on the Sunday had little more than a hint of meat! A great weekend was had, but the hotel didn't contribute as much as it should have."
December 2016,Brown's nice location but not Claridge's,Brown's was surprisingly pleasant except we did not have hot water and we could not shower before getting on an 8 hour flight.  The staff should have been more forthcoming and offered to reduce our bill.
December 2016,"Great Location, Fantastic Hotel","A truly fantastic hotel - in an excellent location. The staff really go out of their way to make you feel at home - in a very genuine way. I was very impressed! The location is also excellent as you are within walking distance of so much, be it: shopping; restaurants; bars; musicals; theatres; museums or many of the main tourist attractions.    "
December 2016,One of the best hotels!,"Absolutely a top hotel - from professional and friendly staff, to superb location, to wonderful 'home-like' pampering during the stay, they make you feel like royalty when you're there. We come back all the time!"
December 2016,Nice place to stay,We were upgraded from a room to a suite which was impressive. The suite was lovely although there was a bit of a smell of cigarettes! Staff were welcoming and friendly. Very expensive but it was in Mayfair!
November 2016,Total disappointing for loyalty,"I was staying at Browns: 29th of November 2016 till 03 of December 2016. Booking procedure by phone was nice and smooth , person in charge introduced as Roberta, she looked in  my profile and deluxe room was booked with preferences ; view on Albermarle street. (i gess it's gonna be 4  time for me to stay at Browns, if am wrong hotel stuff will amend me), as well promised  to do everything to allow me to check in to room early then 15.00  due to early time of my flight. So I arrived at hotel at 14.40  room wasn't ready,i was offered cup of tee for fee, (flight from frozen Moscow was delayed and difficult) Person on reception kindly asked my credit card to frozen some amount for expected  expenses , which is rather unpleasant thing , because if you not using hotel facilities and…"
November 2016,Excellent,"Location, property, service vet excellent  Worker, housekeeping, laundry, dry cleaning, bed sheets, pelow, food beverages was excellent, experienced staff always smiling, door man very nice , concerige well experienced "
November 2016,Brilliant,"Spending a night in Brown's Hotel has been a long-term dream of mine since having afternoon tea there in 1990. I have such wonderful memories and photos of that day that I actually chided myself for setting myself up for disappointment as nothing could be as wonderful as my memory of it. At least I thought so, but I was happily mistaken. Much has changed since that long-ago afternoon and the atmosphere is quite different but I liked it. Brown's have their own next door florist in Ellie Hartley (ELH) and her artful arrangements of hydrangeas dominated the public spaces giving this venerable  hotel a modern vibe.  Our room was small but very well appointed and the bathroom was fabulous. Everyone treated us very well and we loved celebrating our birthdays with a formal tea and a…"
November 2016,"My favorite hotel in Europe, US and Asia.","I like the relaxed informal and not over attentive style. Small things remembered. The best of English style and taste. The rooms are relaxed and beautifully designed without any bling, especially like the pictures."
November 2016,Stay at Brown's,Our stay was three nights end of November. The hotel is excellent. Its typically English. Very good location at the best region in London being Mayfair between Regent Street and Oxford Street. Next the New Bond Street. Staff of quality and professional. Highly recommend the Brown's in London. 
November 2016,Old favourite,"Excellent service and location. More intimate than the competition. Not entirely business focused, but ambiance makes up for all. Food and staff at HIX particularly praiseworthy. Extremely helpful doormen."
November 2016,Seasonal paradise, As usual a wonderful Winter stay in a wonderful City at a superb hotel.  Brown's always excels.   Staff kind and efficient and know our names - always a good sign.  Looking forward to another visit in 2017.  
November 2016,Super service,Fantastic location for shopping and dining and super service. Nice and big rooms and bathroom.  Stayed there for an early Christmas weekend together with our children and some friends.  We will definitely come back.
November 2016,Perfect in all ways,"We had a marvelous time with our first stay at Brown's Hotel in London.  The staff are wonderful and really work to look after you.  The staff went the extra mile for us as our flight arrived early in the morning, and our room was not yet ready.  Additionally, whenever we wanted to use the tea room, the staff made it available to us.  The concierge was great in suggesting fantastic eating places - and very helpful with walking directions for us to get about.    The tea room is really nice as is their restaurant.  The location of the hotel is perfect as the access to anywhere in central London and access to the underground was fantastic.    Love the place in all ways!"
November 2016,Great home away from home in an amazing location!,"I recently stayed at Brown's for four nights and couldn't have been happier with my choice. The hotel is a 5-star hotel, without the 5-star stuffiness. It's cozy, as it was once a number of townhomes, which were interconnected. It feels like your own little apartment building. The staff is great, accommodations are beautiful, location is amazing and the food and bar scene is also really good!"
November 2016,So cosy do not want to leave ,"Wonderful and welcoming this is my fist choice of london hotels if the piece is correct as it is expensive. The rooms are cosy, very clean, modern but classic. High tea great, restaurant is ok but could be improved. Excellent location"
November 2016,Nice hotel with great service!,"The hotel might need an upgrade soon, I used to stay here a few years ago and loved it, but now it looks a bit tired. Comfortable stay, good service, great spa and cool bar with good vibes. The location is great."
November 2016,You must allow more space for comments to make this document of any use to management.,"Bathroom comment !  One other comment...not enough space to complete sentences. Why ? This hotel sets the standard for good hotels in London ! You will not find better or friendlier staff anywhere in London in such totally convivial surroundings. If you want glitz and glamour and noise around you all the time ...don't stay here but if you appreciate a peaceful environment, exceptional service, good food and staff who will take that extra step to oblige...Browns Hotel is the place to stay in London. But please don't everyone book to stay there or we may not get a room next time we come to London !"
December 2016,Typical hotel in excellent location,"Very good experience, beautiful and nicely decorated hotel, comfortable rooms despite the many little flies in our bathroom. Very friendly staff giving personalized service. I also had a great spa experience !"
December 2016,Sophisticated and stylish,"From a few oranges left on the side table at evening turn down, to ease of in-room breakfast, no detail was overlooked while also giving us privacy and much-needed recharging. We stayed just two nights but know we will be back. "
December 2016,Luxury in a great location,"Luxurious, friendly hotel in a fabulous location.  Very upmarket yet not snobby or pretentious.  The room was lovely, the staff couldn't do enough for us.  Breakfast was delicious.  We'all definitely return."
December 2016,Browns a real home from home,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay ,Browns is old school charm at its very best.All staff recognised us and called us by name,breakfast is amazing and lots of choice.Location is minutes away from shopping and popular areas.The bar is a great hang out after a hard day in the shops,the afternoon tea looked good too."
December 2016,Afternoon Tea at the Brown's Hotel,"We have just finished our lavish afternoon tea at the Brown's Hotel, this afternoon. The ambiance is very pleasant, with live piano playing, and pleasant and plentiful food, the usual sandwiches, including cucumber ones, delicious scones and home made strawberry jam, with clotted cream and delicious cakes. But what made our afternoon truly nice was the service, provided by Andrea, from Italy, who worked incredible hard! He was on his feet during the whole two hours of our stay and serving us, and everyone else in our room, with a charming, polite smile and a friendly, very attentive service, looking after us, all afternoon perfectly! We have been at several, equally high quality places, for a pre-Christmas afternoon tea events, over the years, but ultimately what makes these…"
December 2016,Little gem ,"What a fabulous place ! A minute you enter you feel relaxed and comfortable , the staff is friendly and Christmas decorations are beautiful .   We had a meal at  Hix restaurant and nothing was too much trouble ! Was busy that evening but service was quick and had a great atmosphere.  Highly recommended ! "
November 2016,It is fantastic hotel,"It is real fantastic hoel with nce staff and very good traditions  Staff is very friendly , ber is very tasty and cozy  I think it is the best place  I have ever been in my life  There are only good words for service of this hotel  Nothing compalin about"
December 2016,Simply stunning lunch and stay - why haven't I been here before ??,Managed to sneak in a quick shopping trip to London before Christmas arrives and was lucky enough to stay at Brown's Hotel. I have to say the hotel wasn't my choice (a friend made the booking) so it was a very pleasant surprise.   The room was much larger than I expected in Central London and was the perfect retreat from the chaos outside the hotel and the staff were all so friendly and welcoming. We were so delighted with the hotel we decided to have lunch in the restaurant (Hix) and turned out to be very glad we did !  We somehow managed to loose several hours of shopping to both the restaurant and bar (not a hardship in any way) and are already making plans for a repeat visit next year !!!!!  Massive thank you to all the team for making it such a delightful visit.
December 2016,Great cocktails ,I work just round the corner from the hotel and the lobby is perfect for meetings. They serve excellent cocktails and the waiters are very attentive and welcoming. I really like the old English decor and elegant surroundings
December 2016,A truly wonderful lunch in a stunning hotel.,"Visited with a friend for a bite to eat before the theatre - what a treat from beginning to end. We were greeted at the door by such welcoming staff, and felt thoroughly spoilt by very attentive thoughtful service. The food was delicious and indeed our light snack lunch turned into a three course delight, we just didn't want to leave. A big ""Thank You"" to all the staff who made us feel so at home."
December 2016,Drinks in the bar,"It was late (21pm) and a doorman referred us to Browns for a nightcap.  So pleased we went. Were welcomed by a friendly and super professional doorman, escorted to the bar, welcomed by efficient friendly staff and our cocktails and the lounge bar were fabulous! A real highlight and we will definitely return.    Decor in the bar was so stylish and it had a great chilled out vibe. We might book the night next time!  The cocktail was about £18 but worth every penny and I only regret not finding it sooner."
December 2016,Excellent stay,Fantastic staff exceptional concierge service and good location both for shopping restaurants and touristic venues.Child friendly.This hotel has his own identity and character although it is part of a group of hotels.
December 2016,"Browns, Mayfair","Excellent hotel, very well located for Bond Street, Oxford Street, Mayfair etc. Genuinely helpful and caring staff. Exceptional quality food in the main restaurant (HIX). Only let down by an inflexible policy in the Afternoon Tea Room."
December 2016,London Hotel at it's best,"We had a wonderful three night stay over Christmas.  The staff never faltered in their attentiveness and friendliness. Great location for theatre, restaurants, galleries and shops. Look forward to a return visit."
December 2016,Totally impressed throughout my stay!,"Had the opportunity to spend three nights over the Christmas holidays. The Brown's team (every department) was so attentive to every detail, went above and beyond, and catered to every need, and more.   Have no hesitation recommending this property to anyone looking for location, service and true English character."
December 2016,Christmas in London,"The Brown's Hotel was fantastic in quality, service, and location.  The room and bath were spacious and very well appointed.  The service and attention to detail was superb.  We would absolutely choose to stay again on our next trip to London."
December 2016,Not to be missed,"A jewel of an establishment.  Location superb.  Good corner shop (Fortnum & Mason!), wonderfully efficient and friendly staff.  Room facilities brilliantly conceived, the best in my 50 year experience.  Service impeccable.   Dining disappointing.    The room has the NOISE disease too - I would have thought Brown's immune.  Please do something about this urgently."
December 2016,outstanding London stay,"We opted to stay at the Brown's per recommendation from a friend.  Welcoming, comfortable, well located...simply outstanding.  Extraordinary service, very personalized, name recognition, wonderful room. Now a top choice for our future visits."
December 2016,Real London hotel,"This hotel is located in next to Bond street that means if you want shopping without enough time, it would be great choice. Brown's Hotel's staffs will give you very friendly and professional services. "
December 2016,Afternoon tea at Browns is the most wonderful way to spend a couple of hours!,"I found myself with a free afternoon in London and decided that I would rather relax and be spoilt than go frantic at the shops. The staff were excellent, the food was beautifully presented and had lovely flavours. Yes, I would warn you that it's a little on the pricey side but I found the experience worth every penny. A dream come true."
November 2016,Fabulous stay,Had a wonderful time as always at Browns. Classy and Fabulous with the best staff. Cannot wait to be back and enjoy the hotel again. You can't beat it. Perfect location and rooms are incredible - enjoy!!
November 2016,Experience of several stays,"We have stayed at this hotel for several years, at least once  a year. Though it is a five star hotel it gives you the feeling of home - the take care of you and no task is impossible! Location is great."
November 2016,Very good location and helpful staff.,"If you go to London for business, leasure or, specially, shopping, thesis your hotel. Excel.lent staff ready to help and service. The only thing to reclaim is the quality of wifi. at least in our executive room. and, because it's an old renewed building, a little difficult to find your room as it has a lot of stairs and corners. anyway, very recomendable hotel (with a healthy credit card!). Thanks."
November 2016,"Excellent, small and cosy","Good attitude of all the personnal. Quiet and clean rooms. Hix restaurant : very British and excellent foot and wine. An overall charming hotel and location. Attentive staff, starting at the entrance, ending boy leaving the hotel.... "
November 2016,Pampering hotel stay in Mayfair,We are more than pleased with our stay at Brown´s. The location was perfect on a quiet street. The service was excellent and we slept like babies in the comfortable beds. Small luxury details through the entire stay such as housekeeping preparing the beds while we where out for dinner. We will definitely be back.
November 2016,Great Hotel in a great location,Was a great weekend at Brown's. It is so convenient to have a base in the heart of Mayfair. Rooms are nice and quiet. Service is great. The Bar astonished me with a large selection of Gin which I loved. We will be back
November 2016,Birthday treat!,"Exemplary welcome, service and room..we felt relaxed and at home from the moment we arrived....beautiful hotel...thank you for making us feel special...we will be back and will be sure to recommend Browns to all!"
November 2016,Family visit Nov 2016,"Did not live up to its usual flawless service. In the past the welcome to our family has been fantastic. A few things were missing this time, which could be considered minor but which actually set apart Browns from other hotels."
November 2016,Unforgettable Stay with fantastic staff,"It started with a very warm welcome at the door and continued with an excellent and friendly check-in at this beautiful located hotel. They showed us the whole property and introduced the staff while going to our room. It was super clean and we had everything we needed. Especially the friendly and very helpful concierge team (Thanks David) created a perfect start to the trip with the hotel car to a recommended sushi restaurant! All in all, we had a great time and would definatly come back for any other London trip in the future. Thanks to all...!!"
November 2016,My first time at Browns, usually stay at claridge's but was unable this time have eaten in HIX restaurant many times So this was my first time I have stayed in Browns 's was very impressed from the moment I arrived great service I stayed on fourth floor over looking courtyard lovely room all the staff were a credit to  this hotel  goodbye claridge's now will be staying at Browns.'s in future 
November 2016,Consistent fantastic experience,"My all-time favourite in London. Excellent location, attentive staff, very nice rooms and hilarious breakfast make this an all-time favourite in London. A slight mishap upon checking in was immediately corrected in a very professional manner. Perfect staff and very nice to see that many of the staff have been with the hotel since years."
October 2016,"Excelent location, wonderful service","A lovely hotel in a great location and  with excellent service.  We had a complementary upgrade to a Junior Suit, late ckeckI out, and other amenities.  The beds at Brown´s are very comfy and Hix Restaurant delicious ( I had  dover sole for dinner).   I highly recommend Hotel Brown´s, we were very happy there, I hope to return soon.   Thank you Hotel Brown`s."
October 2016,I Love This Place,"I have stayed a Browns a few times and I like it more each time I go back.  The staff are great and they remember you from your previous visits.   The rooms are very clean and well designed, The house keeping is also top notch.  I stayed there recently with my wife for her 40th Birthday and they put balloons in the room and a cake which was great.  Keep up the excellent work."
November 2016,Best value luxury hotel in London,"By London standards, the room was large and sensibly as well as comfortably furnished. Also by London Top end standards, not expensive. The staff is invariably courteous and pleasant. The English breakfast is to be avoided - cheap ingredients,  indifferently cooked at a high price. The buffet on the other hand is excellent - brilliant cheeses, lovely fruit and other offerings (which I did not get to taste). The hotel cannot help the gloomy English autumn weather but, though they provide a lot more lamps than other good London hotels, for my Australiana eyes, a bit more light would be welcome. Unfortunately the restaurant is to be avoided. Poor value but more importantly badly cooked food. My son had stake tartare and I fish with peas - both made us feel that we made a mistake in…"
November 2016,"Excellent, again!","My wife and I stayed here for a long birthday weekend and had another excellent experience at Brown's! Our previous visit was a year ago and we upgraded this time to one of their larger rooms, a Junior Suite, to enjoy the larger space. We were delighted to have a complimentary fresh fruit basket and delicious Hix Trio during our stay. While the particular room was very comfortable, there were a few minor niggles with the bed; however, their pillows were super!  We enjoyed an excellent meal in their restaurant one evening; their gym was very convenient and their inclusive breakfasts were delicious!  Keep up the great standards and service: we are looking forward to our next visit!"
November 2016,Ho Hum,"Arrived at 4.15 pm...room not ready, very poor. Welcome to Brown. Came back 45 mins later and could get into my room. £7 for a small beer in the bar, then they add service. Room uninspiring (112)....see photos. No view. No iron in room, poor. Good bathroom. Very expensive hotel, expensive bar, expensive restaurant, but it's Mayfair so that's what you should expect.   Probably will not return."
November 2016,Excellent home from home,"The location is excellent , the staff superb and the beds/. Duvets provide the best sleep ever experienced In a Hotel. Nothing was too much trouble : the in-room breakfast was delivered very quickly and was excellent . The cocktails were to die for - a great experience !"
November 2016,Confortable stay,It was so nice and confortanle stay there.The staff was so kind to help us anything.and the location is really good at shopping.Green park station is just walking distance. Facility looks not so new.However I highly reccomend to stay. 
November 2016,The Best,"Great overall stay with terrific service. Dinner at HIx was special. Wonderful breakfasts. Management needs to improve the business center. Computers are obsolete, and having to get a code to use them and which doesn't work is ridiculous in this day and age. Wifi service is poor. Have to sign in every day and pay extra for high speed. Even lesser hotels have better service."
November 2016,Great base for a sporting trip,Yet again Browns hotel made me feel welcoming and comfortable despite this being a trip for the England v Scotland International Football and presenting myself in a Kilt.  Room service was swift when required and food cooked to my taste.  Staying here made it easy to get to my friends in Hammersmith as well as access to the tube for the big game.
November 2016,Great property in a great location,"Excellent stay - very nice room, breakfast was great - would definitely recommend  Stayed in room 212 - very spacious and comfortable  While it doesn't have a view it felt very welcoming and was a good home base for a recent business trip"
November 2016,Fabulous Hotel with even better service,"Stayed in a fabulous Deluxe Suite - incredible!! The service from valet, doormen, reception to restaurant and bar - all were amazing. Very personalized and detailed service. Highly recommend and will definitely return!"
November 2016,Great hotel,Excellent location. Really comfortable hotel with delightful staff. Traditional and very English but also uunstuffy and welcoming. Our room (junior suite I think) was stylish and quietly luxurious. AND I could work out how everything worked easily (more than you can say for some hotels). Definitely would recommend.
November 2016,Amazing,"The experience was amazing. The service is very nice, warm and lovely. I really recommend to stay in Brown's Hotel. The location is perfect, The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay in London!!!"
November 2016,A very sweet Suite!!,"We hired the latest addition to the Browns Hotel room collection, the Kipling Suite. We were so impressed with every element from guest experience to in room facilities. Wow is an understatement....  staff are super helpful in every way possible. The room knocks spots off its competitors, large, luxury and beyond comparison in London. This is the room to end all rooms. "
November 2016,Room 116,"We were allocated this room which is not suitable midweek as directly opposite the room is a meeting room. My husband was trying to gain access into our room as was told to be quiet by one of the attendees of the meeting , "
November 2016,Number 1 in London,"Best location, best service, warm & cozy interior it really reflects London!!!  Do not look further: I have visited and stayed at many other 5 star hotels in London and Brown's hotel is the best around. "
November 2016,Always great.,"I love staying at Browns when visiting London, the central location is perfect and the staff always ready to help make your stay. This trip was a short one but the place is fabulous. Looking forward to staying again when I visit next. Thank you Browns."
November 2016,Iconic Hotel,"A most enjoyable two night stay to celebrate a special Wedding Anerversry. Very attentive staff our name was always remembered. The room was nicely furnished and spotlesly clean with a large bathroom with a very large bath,most likely the largest we have experienced.  The location is just perfect for central London."
November 2016,Absolutely perfect,"In my job, I am lucky enough to stay in fabulous hotels often - but because I am away from my home comforts so much it matters to me that things are easy and comfortable. Of all the wonderful places I have stayed this takes the top spot in London (and elsewhere!)  by MILES. It starts from the moment you walk up to the hotel - the welcome from everyone on arrival - from the doormen to Reception -  is smiley, exquisitely polite and genuine. It's true that it is expensive and luxurious but it's beautifully done by EVERYONE with the most incredible warmth. Such a rarity. Too often hotels in this bracket are snooty and full of their own self-importance (The Langham springs to mind) but this is how to do it properly. In a high-class field of staff, a special mention should go to…"
November 2016,Relaxing Stay,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Browns, the staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough.  We stayed in a Junior Suite which was very comfortable and decorated to a high standard. We are looking forward to our next stay at Browns."
November 2016,Very good service,"The sevice is very good, very nice staff, they do go above and beyond however the room is very basic plus there was a whole in the wall in my bathroom waiting to be fixed. The location is very good for shopping and public transportation "
November 2016,The only place worth staying!,"Brown's is discreet, quiet and elegant. The staff are accommodating in the extreme, the rooms comfortable and the location unimpeachable. The rates are reasonable, and in all aspects the hotel is impeccably run. If you are looking for an oasis of calm in the middle of London then Brown's is it. The food is excellent too."
November 2016,The perfect London retreat,A quiet and beautiful haven from the London hustle and bustle.  In David Young the hotel has a truly superb concierge offer which will afford the guest the very best looking boon has to offer . . . I would recommend this hotel above all others I have ever used. 
November 2016,Fantastic ,"This hotel is my new home in London after this stay. I usually stay in Mayfair. However, the rooms are luxurious and practical. The staff goes out of its way to accommodate your needs. The location is lovely. Close to everything but yet obscure in its placement. They have won my loyal patronage. Keep up the grand work  "
November 2016,Very Happy Overall,This is a classic property in one of the best locations in London.  It is well managed and immaculately clean.  Staff was superb with fantastic memory for names!  My only disappointment was that I felt my specific room lacked character consistent with the other spaces in the hotel.  It was roomy and comfortable for one night but the decor of the room was on the pedestrian side.   
November 2016,Perfect,Perfect in every way.  At just a stone throw from Bond Street provides luxury with top service and a cosy intimate environment.  Service is among the best you will find anywhere and we stay regularly in top hotels around the world.
October 2016,"Splendid Attention , Splendid Fare","On this latest trip to London we chose Browns because of their Mayfair location, near shopping and Piccadilly, and their superior service.  They did not disappoint.   When we made our reservation, we  mentioned that our 10 year old granddaughter,who was wanting to see the historic sights of London, was joining us.  The exceptional concierge, David,  arranged for the perfect tour guide: informative and very friendly. Later, the hotel delivered  cookies with her name on them to our rooms , which were both comfortable and beautifully appointed. Our granddaughter was thrilled.   Brown's dining room and attentive service are world famous; they deserve every  starred  accolade  possible."
October 2016,British,This was an excellent choice of hotels. Our stay was for pleasure and business. The service was fast and very polite. I will highly recommend this hotel. Close to the Piccadilly if you like to walk. The hotel cars was excellent and luxuries. We felt special.
October 2016,Our Home in Mayfair,"Could not have chosen a better luxury hotel to call 'home' in Mayfair!  Perfect location just off the madness of Piccadilly on Albermarle, yet within easy walking distance of West End. Brown's makes you feel right at home from the moment you step inside the hotel. Check-in is a breeze and concierge is very helpful (remember to tip accordingly!) Lively atmosphere, can't miss afternoon tea, and gourmet dining at HIX. Donovan's bar is fun for drinks with the after-work crowd. Rooms are well appointed, quiet and modern. Beds are heavenly - you will wake up well- rested. Best breakfast in London!!  "
October 2016,London Home Away From Home,"Browns is responsible for making London my favorite city to visit.  Most central location, chic amazingly comfortable rooms, fantastic bar and restaurant and the warmest most professional staff that make you want to move in. Hard to even leave the hotel once in London and a place of solace during any busy trip. Classic, elegant, tasteful and cool. I hope it never changes.  "
October 2016,Short Stay Fam visit,"We spent 1 night at the Brown's Hotel. What a wonderful and unforgettable experience. Wish we would have had more time to enjoy this wonderful Hotel. The hotel has elegant , tasteful, historical influences. You will not get tired to browse around discovering new details and art-I-facts throughout. The Donovan Bar makes for bustling experience of award winning Cocktails. The Hotel Restaurant and Food  The Hix , we enjoyed the best brunch ever with exceptional waiting staff. The Brown's offered first class service ,yet making us feel like family with their very warm and friendly staff. Thank you again for your excellent service."
October 2016,A Plesant Surprise in the Heart of Mayfair,Great location in the heart of Mayfair one block from New Bond street. Easy walk to Oxford Street and all the great restaurants in Mayfair. Older buildings turned into a hotel decades ago lead to slight differences in floor levels so you have two steps up here and four down there. The rooms are bright and airy and as it is on a side street the car noise is minimal. The front desk staff is very professional and the concierges really do know all the 'in' restaurants and can actually get you a reservation. Great bar for a quiet drink.
October 2016,High tea at its best,"My daughter, her friend and I had high tea and it was excellent. We have had high tea in many places and countries, this ranks among the best we have ever had. It may indeed be the best!   The food was plentiful, tasty and a wonderful variety. The egg salad, salmon and corned beef sandwiches were exceptional. The scones were to die for and the the only slightly less amazing dessert treats were all delicious. The tea varieties were varied and exceptional.  Highly recommend this classic English high tea in an old world setting!"
October 2016,Short London stay,"My wife and I over-nighted in London and spent 1 night at Brown's.  I wish we had scheduled more time.  The hotel is elegant.  The staff is very warm and friendly.  And, the location off of Piccadilly and Bond Street is excellent.  The concierge picked the perfect restaurant for us and made the reservation on such short notice that I'm convinced he is a magician(or at least extremely influential.)    The bar in the evening was lively and very comfortable and a good place to relax before dinner.  The hotel is definitely an A+ for anyone needing luxury accommodations in London."
October 2016,Personalised service Hotel ,"Great hospitality, service and food. Second home feeling every time we go. Rooms are spacious and clean. Room service is quick. They always remember you. Staff is always helpful and friendly. And their consistency is remarkable."
March 2016,Classic hotel with style,"I've been there during a business trip and my stay was great. Very good located, easy accessible the staff was very professional and the breakfast was great. The style is traditional with contemporary touches. Very beautiful the bar and the breakfasts room. "
October 2016,Good of enough for Winston...,"Lovely boutque hotel in London that was apparently one of Churchill's favorites. Very great location in Mayfair area (especially if you want to shop in high-end shops).  Front desk and concierge team were terrific.  Room was nicely appointed, although mine was a bit small.  Nice size bathroom.  Breakfast expensive and not as good as I remembered."
October 2016,London at its best ,"What a lovely stay and so much joy for kids and adults a like! very detail oriented house and staff. Most comfortable beds! Little things as give aways for the kids made them so happy! Location great for trips, shops and tube. Definetly coming back!"
October 2016,we love Browns!,"Our second stay here. We love the 5 star yet friendly and approachable service. The hotel has a traditional yet contemporary feel that is very inviting. The location is excellent for shopping, dining, sightseeing. Kudos to General manager Stuart Johnson who is hands on and runs this finely tuned hotel !"
September 2016,Brown's Hotel London,Brown's is an excellent hotel in the Mayfair area of London. Lots of incredible restaurants close by and the concierge is extremely helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel. The Hix Mayfair restaurant at the hotel is great for breakfast and dinner.
September 2016,Nice!!,"Nice and well located hotel, rooms are nice (size depends), bathroom and amenities are excellent. The bed is a key feature for me as it is so comfortable.  Staff is polite and eager to satisfy any queries"
September 2016,Outstanding experience,"You can not top Brown's when you are in London. Can't beat the location, the great rooms, the impeccable service and the art shown. If you love history as well (e.g. Winston Churchill was a regular) and you do not like to wake up like in certain hotel chains where the rooms look all the same no matter what city you are in, this is the place to stay."
September 2016,Great Hotel and Staff,"From the moment we arrived I knew this hotel would be special.  The staff was attentive and courteous.  Ate at the restaurant our first night and had such an enjoyable evening decided to eat there again.  Enjoyed having a drink at the bar, the bartender was very pleasant.  We also enjoyed tea and the service was excellent and the piano music made it perfect.  This will be my first choice when visiting London."
August 2016,Excellent service,"Brown's is now my favorite London hotel, and it is thanks to the wonderful service.  Everyone at this property is helpful, friendly, and very competent.  Additionally, the food is delicious - the breakfast buffet is extensive and hot items are made-to-order.  I have stayed at the Savoy and the Corinthia, and neither come close to matching this hotel's service, sincerity, and authenticity.  Brown's is a special retreat in the heart of Mayfair, and it will be my first choice on future trips to London."
September 2016,Very epensive for what you get,Not up to standard of a 5 stars hotel / 850 BP per night. Very poor quality of furntiures in the room and very old carpets. Need a full renovation. AC very noisy in the room. House keeping not the most friendly.
September 2016,The edge...,Great hotel in the heart of London. From the sincere welcome I first received from the doorman to the moment I had to leave my stay was excellent. I normally stay at claridges when I visit London but Browns may have the edge.
September 2016,A very pleasant hotel,"In a great location and has an excellent sense of charm. Just a few minutes to the tube and Green Park leading onto Buckingham Palace.  The greeting at reception was very good and nice that this is tucked away so that you don't feel on parade as everyone else comes in and out.  Our room was very pleasant with a comfy bed, choice of pillows, walk in wardrobe and a very spacious bathroom. The only downside is we could clearly hear the people above us moving around (and presumably those below could hear us). But this did not spoil the visit and perhaps to be expected in a very old building.  The hotel bar is lovely and the staff were very attentive. Had one of their 'Around the World' cocktails which earned me a stamp and a scratch and sniff business card for that region, a bit of…"
September 2016,"Great Location, Great Accomodation",this is the perfect address if you wish to visit London in style.. we enjoyed our stay in a warm and comfortable surrounding.. the location is great and the staff very friendly and responsive .. you would certainly want to come back..
September 2016,The best in London,"The brown's is not a conventional hotel,it makes you feel like home,when you're away. The food is amazing,the breakfast is an awesome experience,the Donovan bar is warm welcoming and serves the best cocktail you can taste. The concierge service is second to none,and the location is unique. Do not hesitate to adopt the Brown's while in London"
September 2016,Outstanding comfort in the center of Mayfair,A remarkable hotel with 175 years history just a few steps from Bond Street with its boutiques and shops.  The best afternoon tea in London. A very professional Consierge who can help with organizing tickets for any evening performance and advise many interesting things to do and to see.
September 2016,Excellent Hotel,"Five of us stayed one night on a special  visit to London. Two standard rooms and one executive room. Executive room  overlooks Dover Street. Situated in Albermarle Street in Mayfair so it is pricey as one would expect. Only 5 minute walk to The Ritz and about 7 minutes to Green Park tube station. Just off Picadilly and about 2 minutes from Old Bond Street and Burlington Arcade. Tiffanys is just round the corner for those with money to spare! All the hotel staff have a nice style: attentive but not intrusive, sociable and not pretentious. Breakfast excellent, dinner excellent. Lovely restaurant. Decor in the rooms is light and classy. Only black mark for me is a lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room. The hotel is very relaxing. "
September 2016,One of the very best luxury hotels in London,"This hotel is truly 5 star and delivers in every conceivable way.  Modern, superbly appointed, highest quality rooms, bedding and baths, detailed and professional turndown service, fantastic concierge services and wonderful on property restaurant.  Fantastic London location.  A must stay for those seeking the truly refined, luxury stay.  Unlike other mass London luxury hotels, this is the adult, refined, modern, civilized and highly personalized experience. I did not want to leave and look forward to my return!"
September 2016,London's best hotel,"Another fantastic stay at what must be the best hotel group! Professional and friendly employees who make every stay memorable. Nothing is too much trouble. Coupled with a luxurious environment, Browns Hotel is simply the best Mayfair offering."
September 2016,Birthday treat,The hotel was excellent and the service was outstanding. Location is great for high end shopping and I don't think I would stay anywhere else - much preferred it to Claridges and my 14 year old daughter loved afternoon tea.
September 2016,true Londonian hospitality,"Lovely hotel which managed to keep its true Londonian charm. The architect managed to unite old with new in a fabulous way. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable, the choice of colours is excellent. I quite liked the bookshelf with an interesting reading choice. Spacious wardrobe (important) and big bathroom which is beautifully clean too. Personnel is incredibly friendly and efficient and makes you feel home. All in all, a wonderful experience. Thank you."
September 2016,London at its best!,"A gracious historic but totally renovated and modernized building combining traditional charm with modern amenities, Browns lets one experience the London one hopes for.  Service is quintessentially polite, rooms are quiet and comfortable and the ambiance is of refined yet unobtrusive elegance. "
September 2016,Exceptional,"A truly special weekend away, in a perfect setting.  All staff were extremely helpful and accomodating, the room exceptional and the location couldn't be better for shopping, theatre and the sights of London."
September 2016,Birthday afternoon tea absolutely  amazing,Cannot recommend afternoon tea enough. We went for my 40th birthday the setting the food are excellent. The staff are an absolute  credit to the hotel so warm and welcoming and couldn't do enough for you. It's a beautiful hotel with so much history  thoroughly recommend it . 
September 2016,Not a grand hotel,"This hotel, albeit rated 5 stars, is not one of London's grand hotels. It is an okay 5 star hotel but is not one of the grand stand-alone properties which are so typical for London. Eg. Reception is hidden somewhere in the back part of the property. Gym and Spa are small and lack grandour"
July 2016,Excellent,Excellent location.  Very high standards. Exceptional quality of the personnel of the Hotel.  Special aattention to your requests and needs.  Facility to obtain transport.  Will always return to that hotel. 
July 2016,Afternoon tea -excellent ,"We enjoyed the champagne afternoon tea here yesterday for our wedding anniversary.  The tea lounge is more relaxed than others such as Savoy or Claridges, with a cozy feel. Some of the sandwiches weren't to our taste but we are fussy,  so not the hotels fault at all! All food is unlimited so they'll take away any you don't like and bring you something else. The scones were superb,  and all the cakes very tasty. The service is amazing and unintrusive. A great afternoon "
July 2016,Excellent hotel for a quick getaway or a business trip,"A wonderfully located hotel in central London. I judge a hotel by their consistency, and the Browns has never disappointed me (after an average of two stays a year for the last 5 years).  The rooms are always immaculate, comfortable beds with wonderful amenities.  The service in the bar was exceptional (as is the restaurant).  Just a wonderful place to stay. "
July 2016,Harry Murray MBE,"Excellent, comfortable, and  most enjoyable stay thanks to a skilled, caring and efficient team who exceeded all our expectations. The Kipling suite is one of London's most elegant suites. The cuisine  & service for dinner in a private room was memorable "
July 2016,Excellent Everything,"Browns Hotel is everything you expect and more for a hotel in its category. A fantastic blend of classic and modern , the blend is just right. Great location, rooms and restaurant. Tentative staff but never over bearing.  I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel when in London. "
July 2016,Usual Excellent Stay,"For many yeas we have treated ourselves to an annual weekend In London and have settled on Brown's Hotel as our favourite destination.   Location cannot be beaten.  The hotel suits us.  It is not flashy and loud (like some on Park Lane I could mention) but comfortable, tasteful and discreet.   Service is outstanding. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite (Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts) which was just perfect.   We never heard any sounds from the adjoining suites.  Breakfast was delicious. "
March 2016,Best old fashioned cocktail in London ,The bar area is very cosy with nice decor and it offers really great cocktails which are beautifully presented (see photo) even though it's quite pricey- recommend the old fashion cocktail= superb! Also they offer free snacks with the drinks.
July 2016,Best hotel in london,Browns Hotel is very very special location rooms staff the afternoon. Tea is simply Perfect I can't say anything else apart from AWESOME  in every way please everyone should stay at least once to experience london at its finest ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
July 2016,Wonderful London hotel,Great hotel in fabulous location. Service is impeccable throughout the hotel. The rooms are large by London standards and are extremely clean. Beds were very comfortable and a good nights sleep was had by all. Nothing was too much trouble and housekeeping even came by to check that we were happy with the way our room had been serviced. 
July 2016,Loved Brown's!,Our family of 5 enjoyed excellent service and comfortable junior suite rooms at Brown's. The concierge service was great and we loved the location. Tea at Brown's was a highlight. Our english breakfast each morning was a perfect and convenient way to start the day. We will be back!
July 2016,great stay and location,"Had a lovely stay with my mum and 7 year old daughter. we were upgraded to a junior suite and this had ample room.  Service and staff are great efficient friendly without being intrusive.  They really went out of their way to make my little girl at home, so child friendly. Love the location and breakfast at Hix was super too."
July 2016,Great hotel,Excellent location. Generous room and bathroom size - we had a 2-bedroom classic suite. Staff were very friendly with our kids (7-9yrs old). Will be staying there again on our next trip back to london. 
July 2016,A Diamond in Mayfair,"Fantastic hotel in the Heart of Mayfair. Located in the street that runs parallel with Old Bond Street , this is a great hotel Location , amazing rooms , helpful employees and great restaurant ......this is the recommendation for Central London  A must !"
July 2016,What a place !!!,"What a fantastic place to visit. 5 of us went there As a family treat for afternoon tea & to be 1000% honest I wasn't really looking forward to it, thought it was going to be very snooty. We got there a bit early so crashed with a cocktail in the bar (Donovan's) and it was fabulous, polite people serving & attention to detail was a excellent. So so relaxing could have stayed there all afternoon but e had afternoon tea booked so in we went & I wasnt dissapointed. 5 of us there & we had more than enough food (top quality) cakes (top quality) tea (top quality) champagne (top quality) staff (fantastic) A day that I will not forget in a hurry & will definitely re visit for the next special occasion. Thanks to all the staff we met for making our visit very very special"
July 2016,afternoon tea celebration,We visited Brown's Hotel for afternoon tea to celebrate my mum's 70th birthday.  The service was impeccable. Our every need was catered for and nothing was too much trouble.  The food was of a high standard.  The English Tea Room had a wonderful atmosphere with a gentleman playing the piano to add to the occasion.  The food was replenished throughout our stay.  We were not rushed and mum was made to feel special when a personalised cake with a candle was brought over to our table during a rendition of Happy Birthday.  It was a really enjoyable afternoon.  I would definitely go back.  Thank you Brown's Hotel.
June 2016,Great Hotel with the touch of Royalty,This Hotel is nice and cozy. being a traveler on the go. i travel to a lot of places this hotel captures most of my memories with my father. we use to go there on our vacations he passed away 2 years ago but i always return to this place.
July 2016,Excellent example of a traditional London hotel,"My wife and I stayed at Browns for five nights during our recent trip to Europe. The service was excellent, friendly and personal without being stuffy or too formal. We were upgraded to a spacious suite and our room was ready for us to get some much needed sleep by only 10.00am after an overnight transatlantic flight. Definitely recommended."
July 2016,Browns,"Business trip, i have 't been there for a long time. Room look a bit old now. It looks like there is a bit less service . They still have the best London door man. One of the reason I am coming back. Best location too"
June 2016,Enjoyable Stay,"Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would definitely consider staying at Brown's again.  The staff was friendly and courteous. The rooms were clean and well-appointed, if not extraordinary.  The location was perfect. "
June 2016,London June 2016,"We enjoyed our four day stay at Brown's very much.  The hotel staff and service are excellent.  Our one complaint was the specific location of our room which overlooked an air shaft and building AC units.  It made the rate v. overall room quality imbalanced given how much we paid.  We did not complain to the hotel as many others would have.  We did not let it ruin our trip and did not come to London to stare out the window.  The staff and service outweighed this as they provided many nice extras like bottles of water, a cake for our anniversary (after only a passing mention of the date on check in), and a difficult to get dinner booking.  They seemed to want to do more for us than we asked for from them.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Brown's for service, location and…"
September 2015,Perfect!,"The first time I came to Browns' was five years ago when a close friend celebrated his wedding here. It would only be 3 years until I would experience staying here. I'm so glad I finally did for my 28th birthday thanks to my parents. A week to remember. This place is situated in the heart of the city and is easy to commute and from any airport.  The staff assigned to your suite is always only a call away, ready to serve you and your friends at a drop of a hat.  There is nothing these warm people won't do to make your stay that little bit more special. Enjoy the breakfast in your room or go downstairs for brunch or tea.  If you enjoy staying in style then I strongly recommend staying at least a long weekend."
August 2016,"Great location, but I expected more in my room for the money","This property is very well located for shopping. We were not interested in seeing the museums and common tourist sites. Been there and done that. This one's all about the location. After just having stayed at another Rocco Hotel, the Hotel de Rome in Berlin, I was a bit disappointed. Our room paled in comparison. I guess it's London. This should be what I expected. The service and amenities were equally exceptional. Not sure I would stay there again unless we upgrade to a suite or ask to see more rooms. We were offered the opportunity to look at other rooms on our arrival, but we were tired and just wanted to get checked in. We'll know better if we return."
August 2016,Perfect afternoon tea.,"Booked this hotel for afternoon tea has it had been recommended to me several times and we were not disappointed; faultless.    We arrived and were shown to our table, we went with the traditional afternoon tea.  We went for a bottle of champagne to share on the side.  There were plenty of teas/flavours to pick from.  We went for the Cornish tea and it was nice, suited the afternoon tea well.   The lounge was very comfortable and plenty of space to relax.  A member of staff was playing the panio which really set the atmosphere.   The food was perfect. The cakes and pastries were yummy! Plenty of food.    The staff were all very polite.  The service was first class. We felt very looked after and I honestly can't find any faults with anything."
July 2016,Best location excellent service ,The location is quite yet near everything.  The services was amazing the concierge was extremely helpful specially David. Helped us with hiring baby sitter and book the best restaurants on short notice.  Very friendly with my children.  They have the best doorman.  I would definitely recommend it. 
August 2016,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel and service. Quietly understated. Best pot of tea in London! We stayed for 2 nights and had a lovely relaxing time there. Staff went out of their way to assist and were very welcoming. As I would expect from a Rocco Forte hotel.
August 2016,London in a rush,"A perfect place. All the staff very helpful. Very close to all the important stores. Restaurant was very very good. Bed extremely clean. The shower, by far, the best in town. To be honest I do not have any recomendation because everything worked out very well.  Many thanks"
August 2016,Special Hotel in a Special Part of London,"Recently attended a business meeting at the Brown's Hotel and stayed in the hotel for three nights. It was an extraordinary pleasure - beautiful room, attentive staff and great food! The surrounding area - Mayfair is lovely - very London like and with lots of services, restaurants and retail. Excellent for walks after dinner. This is a very special hotel! I highly recommend the Brown's Hotel."
July 2016,recent stay,"very quiet room - perfectly presented. All of the staff were very helpful, all the time. ambience great as are the facilities. Restaurant good with great food and fine wine selection. Location great for the west end. London is expensive which is why value for money is less than other cities - would i change it, no !"
July 2016,Weekend in Mayfair,Very nice small hotel with excellent customer service. I would definitely recommend to anyone staying in west end/Mayfair to stay there. Great location and exceptional value compared to equivalent hotels in the area.
July 2016,a wonderful hotel,"Brown's is a great hotel, with excellent staff, fabulous service, excellent location etc. I particularly liked the breakfast room/ HIX restaurant, our room looked towards Bond St so could hear the carillon being played there on Saturday afternoon"
September 2016,Wonderful stay,"Only stayed for a day but felt so pampered and taken care of that i wanted to stay to never end. everything was top notch, the staff were friendly and so attentive to our need. The property was in excellent shape and condition. We didn't hear anything even with they renovation going on our floor. I will want to stay at Browns every time I'm in London. "
September 2016,LOVE it!,"I stayed at Brown's last year and when I decided to come to London to celebrate a milestone birthday, I knew I had to come back.  The location, the rooms, the staff, the history of the hotel, it's all wonderful. Everything was impeccable.  I have recommended this to hotel to many friends and business associates.  "
September 2016,A lovely afternoon tea experience,"It was our first visit to Brown’s hotel and we really enjoyed the wonderful traditional afternoon tea. We were served by Miguel, who gave us a great teatime experience. One can choose from several very tasty finger sandwiches followed by warm scones with homemade jam and of course, not to forget the different teas. Whenever we felt like trying a new blend, Miguel served us a delicious cup in silver tea sets and nice porcelain tea cups. The third course consisted of cakes and macarons which were a little too sweet for our taste, but all in all we had a lovely time in this elegant Mayfair hotel.  The whole atmosphere is very British, our chairs were comfy, service and menu were excellent. And the nice live piano music really adds to this unforgettable experience. Time flies easily…"
August 2016,Particularly,"We like the design of the rooms. It looks exclusive, plain and we feel like home. In the hotel you feel the history and it is a particular that this building is a hotel. In some situations you feel like in the past and you can understand a lot of things. "
August 2016,Luxury in London,"Spent 2 nights at Brown's Hotel in London. Lovely twin room, although small it was well presented with excellent bathroom. Continental breakfast in the restaurant was well presented and lots of options. Being such a central location close to Green Park made this great for shopping. Most of the staff can't do enough for you - very attentive and helpful. I have previously sent my parents to the hotel for a trip away which they throughly enjoyed. "
August 2016,Afternoon Tea,"We visited earlier in the month for a hen party. We had the Roosevelt room which was absolutely beautiful. I cannot stress enough how brilliant and attentive the staff were from start to finish. The afternoon tea itself was fabulous, unlimited sandwiches- what's not to love? Staff were very accommodating with other refreshments such as coffee, hot chocolate and water for those who didn't like tea. Nothing was too much for anyone, I would thoroughly recommend Browns for afternoon tea, or for a special occasion. Many thanks to Imogen in the events team who organised the day, also a big thanks to the gentleman who looked after us on the day (apologies as I cannot remember his name) but he was very attentive. "
August 2016,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"Visited Browns today for afternoon tea as a pre baby/30th birthday celebration. From the minute we arrived and were shown to our very comfortable armchairs the service was impeccable. Very friendly and superbly efficient, I didn't even have to top up my own tea cup!  The tea menu is extensive and it is lovey to be able to ask the staff for more information  and recommendations if you are unsure. The selection of sandwiches were all delicious and the lovely staff provided many refills. The warm scones with fresh, homemade jam and clotted cream were soft and crumbly-the only downside was we couldn't manage them all! The next treat was a beautiful selection of delicate pastries and mini-deserts. The highlight has to be a sublimely rich chocolate slice with rich dark ganache and…"
September 2015,Heart of mayfair,"English style is the point  Afternoon tea, staff and service make you feel in London The suites are big enough and check in very easy with helpful people. Very well located, steps from New Bond street, in the heart of Mayfair."
August 2016,Fabulous stay -,Excellent hotel and service - Fabulous staff and the rooms exceptional. Close to old bond street so good shopping nearby. We have stayed several times before and always had a fabulous room and great attention- and would not hesitate to recommend to all of our family and friends - Excellent Browns Hotels again .  
August 2016,Perfect!!,Fantastic location. Friendly staff. The room was spacious and had everything we could need. The staff couldn't do enough to make our stay perfect!!!  The bar had a really good atmosphere. Although we didn't eat in the restaurant we did have some snacks in the bar which were delicious!  Highly recommend this hotel! 
October 2016,October 2016,"Excellent hotel, also for families. Good location. Large rooms and very friendly and helpful staff. from the hotel you can walk to a big part of the attractions and shops. If you like English tradition and style,choose this hotel."
October 2016,Wonderful stay,"Great location, staff was very polite and friendly making you feel almost at home. Breakfast was well served from the buffet or à la  carte. Rooms are comfortable and  spacious. I will definitely come back!"
August 2016,Great hotel with worst technology,"Stayed here with my Girlfriend for the weekend, loved the hotel and staff, and the English tea time, wanted to spoil my Girlfriend so I booked a SPA treatment and a dinner reservation both via the Rocco Forte app, did both the bookings in app, took forever, and when she arrived at SPA no booking was there, same for our dinner reservation.. Just embarrassing that its 2016 and the hotels cant handle simple technology - Will still for sure come back, just not use the apps.."
November 2015,English tea,"Great atmosphere for me as a single attendee.  Service was great, piano playing in the background.  The food and tea were outstanding.  The hotel itself was beautiful.   This was recommmended by my coincerge at the hotel I was staying and American Express made the reservation for me."
October 2016,Perfectly Pleasant!!,"A terrific location for upscale shopping and amazing food. Above all, however, the staff is unmatched in their hospitality, warmth and friendliness.  A lovely piece of London tradition and history, the food and service is excellent. My husband and I stayed 8 nights and could not have been more comfortable. We attended a reception, Sunday bottomless brunch with local friends,a Hix dinner event and a Traditional English Tea. All were wonderful and top quality. We had a 6am checkout and there was complimentary coffee, tea, croissants etc. for those departing early. A class act from check in to check out!"
October 2016,the best,"the inside is much better than how it looks from the outside, bigger room, good service, interesting history, better than the ritz for sure. place to experience history of London. very expensive however  recommended. "
September 2016,good but not perfect,"I was rather disappointed with this 5 star hotel. entering, it is not easy to find the reception.  the staff always seems overwhelmed and makes you feel almost interrupting and disturbing. the tea room is very nice.  tea preparation is correct.  the uniforms of the waiters are immaculate, except the butler -a rather pompous- to whom it lacks a button from his jacket the rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet. space for relaxation and spa are rather small."
October 2016,Very happy,I arrived early at the hotel (9.30am) after having got up at 3am to make my flight to London. I was fully expecting just to drop my suitcase - but the welcome from reception was excellent you are always welcome at Browns and of course you room is ready! This sums up the whole experience at the hotel which could not have been better 
October 2016,Excellent.,"Excellent hotel, exceptional location. The rooms are very new and contemporary, although the hotel is in a historical building. The breakfast is amazing.  The hotel team could not be more kind!  Loved it! "
September 2016,Wonderful Stay at Brown's Hotel,This is the ONLY place to stay in London.  The hotel and entire staff are beyond exceptional.  They will exceed your expectations at every turn.  Guests are treated to a special and pampered experience when staying here.  We had 3 rooms during our recent stay and each and every one of our guests in our group could not stop talking about how impressed they were with the hotel experience.
July 2016,A special long week end,"Excellent stay, wonderful breakfast and congratulations to all the staff  for the courtesy and kindness. Impeccable service, great attention to the customer and his needs. It will definitely be considered for a future stay in London."
June 2016,Weekend in London,From the minute we walked into the hotel until we left we had a wonderful experience staying with you. We visited the same time last year and were not disappointed this year. The services you offer from the Concierge to the valet service are excellent. Breakfast was enjoyable the service and food. We will definitely come again next year.
July 2016,Great comfortable boutique hotel,"Comfortable beds with high quality linens, great bathroom, fab bar- the Donovan - in prime location. Service excellent . The gym was also perfect. Breakfast healthy and delicious. Understated and chic. Not cheap  but worth it We loved it !!  "
June 2016,Feel at home in London,"Browns in London is the perfect recipe for warm, genuine service, great location , quiet street and excellent  restaurant . I wouldn't stay in any other hotel in London. The mood in the hotel is understated and not pretentious. You will feel like you're an old friend coming to stay at ""your home"" while in town.Newer hotels may be more elegant, but the true warmth of the staff will encourage  you to want to return."
June 2016,Happy Reflections,"Excellent food, wine  and service.   Efficient and attentive waiters.    Courteous and welcoming staff, Very satisfactory service from housekeeping staff  it is well worth a visit.  We hope to come again in the very near future."
September 2015,Wonderful,"We had a wonderful time here. Everything was fine, the staff was welcoming - though some should work on paying more attention to their guests' needs. ;) Beverages and food were excellent and quite tasty."
December 2015,Timeless and elegant,"I stayed here with my mum in December and it was perfection - a stones throw from my favourite - Old Bond Street and the hustle and bustle - yet you could be in Victorian England.   Food, service and aesthetic all wonderful - we had hoped to go to Hix but couldn't fit in.   Look forward to returning. "
June 2016,My favourite place,The Hotel is in the best location to art galleries and auction places as well as the Royal Academy of art and in the heart of the Fashion mile. The Hotel has the glamour of old tradition and is a very well run place for business but also leisure. My home in London. 
June 2016,Perfect place,Great location Lovely staff Amazing breakfast Relaxed environment near best shopping area. In the thick of things without feeling the hustle bustle of Bond street or Oxford streets. Staff was so efficient and helpful with reservations taxis etc. 
June 2016,Special occassion,For personal service and attention to detail the hotel and facilities could not be faulted.  Relaxed casual atmosphere makes one feel very at home. Prime London location makes staying in the capital a pleasure. 
June 2016,Wonderful in every way,"5 star in every way , true English style and elegance and welcoming throughout. Plus the beds are something else , and the breakfast was to die for. For anyone wanting luxury in a great location and a truly relaxed experience."
June 2016,Perfection personified,"Great location, great staff, great service, just great, great, great. Not a single flaw in service at this wonderful hotel. Cannot recommend highly enough. The hotel staff were truly impeccable -- they are all to be highly commended."
June 2016,Fabulous Stay at Brown's,We stayed at Brown's Hotel for 2 nights on a trip to Ascot.  We were looked after very well and would recommend a stay to any of our friends. The service is great and the atmosphere welcoming and sincere.  The Donovan Bar is lively and friendly and the HIX Restaurant is superb.
June 2016,Business Trip,"Excellent location and friendly helpful staff.  The standard room was very nice albeit no views.  Its and expensive stay but you do get what you pay for.  I used the gym and it was a little small, with only very standard equipment. "
June 2016,Wonderful,"Every aspect of my stay at Browns was perfect. You are made to feel so welcome, the rooms are amazing with lots of little extra touches that make you feel special. All of the staff were happy and very willing to help in anyway possible. The breakfast one of the best. Well done."
June 2016,Perfect Service,We had an event in the Brown´s Hotel and everything was perfect organized and we all had a great experience in London. We are looking forward to stay again in this beautiful located Hotel with it´s amazing services. 
June 2016,Superb hotel,Wonderful hotel with incredibly friendly efficient staff who are always will to assist with anything needed and who always provide a really personal service.  Always stay here if I get the opportunity to do so.
June 2016,Diasppointed,"We had stayed there many years ago and were looking forward to the return visit. We were very disappointed. Room was average at best, bath was nice. Service in the bar was poor. Obviously a place for the locals."
June 2016,Great experience,"My travel agent recommend the hotel and she was right! It is a very nice hotel, great staff, friendly and very attentive. It is very well located in London. I would highly recommend it and definitely come back next time in London. Thank you all for a really nice time!!!"
June 2016,London's First Hotel,Everything tip-top.  What mainly interested me was the history of the hotel (est. 1837) and the famous guests that had stayed there.  The fact that everything else was top-notch was the icing on the cake - highly recommended.  
May 2016,Amazing afternoon tea,"I visited for afternoon tea for my birthday and really enjoyed it: Excellent service, lovely food, very relaxing. The staff couldn't have been more helpful- it was a pleasure to be there. They brought as many refills as we requested and it was a thoroughly lovely afternoon. I would highly recommend it."
May 2016,a perfect stay in not just a hotel,"I am visiting London about 8 times a year and Brown's is just the perfect spot as a base for Sales Calls in the city. Right at Green Park, with the best tube connections, nice and luxury rooms, very friendly and attentive staff. This time was once again perfect. Thank you everyone. I will be back..."
May 2016,Afternoon Tea at the Brown's English Tea Room,"English decor, comfy chairs, yummy tea, relaxed atmosphere, delicious little sandwiches and sweets, beautiful piano music plaid live. We enjoyed wonderfully relaxing 2 hours at the Brown's English Tea Room and when we left we had full bellies and happy faces. I can only recommend to come with an empty stomach."
May 2016,Fantastic all around experience,"Browns Hotel enjoys a perfect location in Mayfair....excellent pubs in the immediate area and restaurants of all varieties at your disposal.  Easy access to lots of site seeing.  The concierge staff sees to your every need and we particularly enjoyed the service provided by the housekeeping staff - very clean room and very nice turn down service.  Probably won't stay anywhere else in London.  Oh and a nice bar, good service and the live music was a nice touch."
May 2016,Just the best,"This hotel is wonderful. Truly a find. It is elegant without being ostentatious. The best thing about it is the service. Everyone was so lovely and helpful. Best of all they were the opposite of stuffy, as some 5 star hotels feel compelled to be. The beds and pillows were heavenly. Everyone in my group commented on how fantastic they were. The location is fantastic as well. Brown's will be my standard for London."
May 2016,One of the best hotel in London,From i arrived i was treated very special and the employees were the best.  They pamper to  your every needs. I would recommend  this hotel to anyone visting London. The staff was professional. And the room was exceptional.
April 2016,A hidden gem,"Brown's Hotel in London's Mayfair may not be the first Hotel name that pops into your head when looking for a luxury stay in central London.  People tend to have heard of The Ritz, Grosvenor House, Claridges &The Dorchester and those names seem to come to mind first.  The owners of Browns Hotel would not mind that they are not the first on your list but they would be upset if you overlooked them altogether.  I suggest that you would be upset if you overlooked them.  This fine Hotel which opened it's doors in 1837 is for the discerning traveller who wants comfort and excellence and is not minding the pennies.  The selection of Rooms and Suites are First Class and as a Dining experience it is unparalleled.  It is not the largest London five star Hotel and that to is in it's…"
May 2016,Not in class of Ritz or 51 Taj bucking ham gate.,The hotel is bang opposite the ritz and has excellent service. Very helpful and service is 10 out of 10. The rooms are small and almost have no view. It is leading hote of the world. Breakfast was nice .
May 2016,Week-end In London,Excellent week-end at the Browns. Always a pleasure to stay there. The service at the Browns was excellent as always!! I always choose Rocco Forte hotels during my city trips because the service is always perfect!!
May 2016,Perfect,Excellent hotel in every way (the only comment is that the duvet (down filling) was a little too thick). Everything else was perfect. This hotel has everything we want and could possibly need. From now on will definitely stay here everytime we travel to London.
May 2016,I don't think it gets any better!,"This place is amazing.  All of the rooms are tastefully appointed and allow you to relax and feel like home (as much as you can in a hotel).    The bar, tea room and restaurant are wonderful but I think that what stood out for me was the service as well as the location.  You are so close to so much in the City - Bond Street is minutes away, as are Regent, Oxford and Piccadilly.   The people are also terrific - every single one.  Lee at the Concierge provided an excellent dinner recommendation and the Valet is always helpful with any requests you have.  It's a definite splurge but if you can swing it you should experience this at least once.  I'm glad I did.  I was initially shown a room that faced one of the streets but I know that the traffic and occasional sirens would have…"
June 2016,Simply THE BEST!,"From its perfect location to the rooms decorated with such taste and understated elegance, this hotel is truly special.  The touch of modernity is just right that preserves the old charm of the building and provides  a state-of-the-art amenities at the same time.  Would not think of staying elsewhere anywhere in this entire city."
June 2016,Best Hotel in London,"I travel to London 3/4 times a year. I have stayed in many hotels. What sets The Browns ahead is it excels in Service. Everyone is fantastic from the Doorman to the Front Desk. All in between are Top Notch. The Donavon Bar is a great place to meet friends and enjoy a cocktail or nightcap. Ask for Ronnie. Best mixologist around. The rooms are quiet and beautifully appointed. A full retreat in the City. Above all The Browns Hotel is simply put the most Centrally located Hotel in Central London. You could not ask for a better location. You are mins from all of London's major attractions, shopping and  culinary fare of Mayfair. I would recommend this Hotel hands down to everyone!"
May 2016,Proper English five star Experience with an Italian twist!,The Brown's Hotel is a wonderful experience with all the amenities you'd expect of a proper five star property. The staff was attentive to every detail from the point we arrived until we left. They were very helpful with logistics too and finding us a wonderful afternoon tea as the hotel was booked. We felt like we were the only ones there with all the attention we received. Feels very Italian too as the property is owned by Rocco Forte out of Italy. Bar tenders were fantastic too (Peter and Ronnie) and make great old school drinks as well as cutting edge cocktails. You will spend some coin but it is well worth every pound!  Enjoy!
May 2016,Best of the best in London,"In a city full of great hotels this is a stand out. We had an excellent and spacious room, a wonderfully comfortable bed and terrific - and flexible -  service from all the staff. From the time of our arrival it seemed that most of them knew our name. The location is of course superb"
May 2016,ExcELLENT,"Excellent service, terrific location-close to many excellent restaurants, shops, casino, sights etc.Concierge was so helpful and attentive. Room 224 was delightful-nice comfortable seating area, excellent bathroom-separate shower and tub, two sinks etc. "
May 2016,High Tea at the Browns Hotel,"We had a wonderful afternoon of High Tea at the Browns. Our server, Mohammed was attentive and wonderful.  The food:  sandwiches cakes and scones was fantastic. This is a must for anyone who wants to experience a true British tradition."
May 2016,Tea at browns,"Although it is expensive, the service, the ambiance. And the food are well worth the price we had our choice of different levels of tea. Service.  It is not necessary to have the most expensive,  the least expensive will give an average appetite mother than enough to eat, especially the scones and clotted cream.  And don't forget to ask for more if you want to."
April 2016,Magnificent location.  Extremely friendly staff and all in all a wonderful experience!,First time I have stayed in London with my mum and my two daughters.  Everyone was extremely helpful.  Their attention to detail was superb - especially the gluten free breakfast they made for my daughter
May 2016,Excellent Hotel!,"From start to finish the hotel met all my expectations. This was my first time staying at the hotel and certainly won't be my last! All staff provided excellent service, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone.   I ate at HIX restaurant.  Dinner and desert were absolutely fabulous.  The restaurant has a cozy, intimate feel to it being right in the heart of the city.  Afternoon tea was a delight! Scones served hot right out of the oven and the tea room is a beautiful room with comfortable chairs.    I have experienced massages all over the world and the hotel spa was one of the best.  Staff were so professional and friendly and I couldn't recommend them higher.  Don't waste your time looking for another hotel, book right away!  Nisha"
May 2016,Very classy small hotel - London done right. ,"Very clean, super skilled staff, awesome food and a great London experience. Would definitely stay here again.   The room 521 was a tidy interesting room overlooking typical rooftops. The neighborhood was super convenient to high end shopping and some great restaurants. "
May 2016,Intimate hotel in wonderfully convenient location,We could not have had a better stay. The hotel staff was exceptional as was the intimate and friendly atmosphere. We also loved the location and were pleasantly surprised by how quiet the neighborhood is. We will definitely stay at Brown's on our next visit to London.
April 2016,Amazing staff,Coming to this hotel never fails to lift my spirits: the staff here are always polite and helpful. The restaurant is excellent and the bar very pleasant indeed. The rooms are spotless and incredibly comfortable. price can be high at times. But it is worth it!
May 2016,Fantastic,The staff really made us feel special during the stay. I would definitely stay again and have no hesitation recommending Browns to all. Of special note they looked after our 2 boys in a very personal way.
May 2016,"Perfectly, wonderfully, utterly British home base","Its the sort of review you put off writing as it might make it more difficult to get in. I've stayed in loads of old school established London hotels -  the Claridges, The Connaught, The Savoy, Dukes and the Goring to name but a few. Whilst they are all great in their way I always come back to Browns. As anyone knows a good hotel is really so much more than just a good bed. It is a collective of quality elements, including and especially the food. Mark Hix food is just so consistently delicious, such a a celebration of just about everything that is good and wholesome and British, right down to the gull's eggs with celery salt in season. You might even be tempted to call Brown's a brilliant dining room with a hotel attached if it weren't for the truly perfect overall English…"
May 2016,Grand hotel In the best location,Brown's hotel is a perfect location for luxury shopping In Mayfair. The staff is very professional and nice. Rooms are clean and well maintained. Old splendor with modern touch. The SPA is an oasis In busy London. Hix resturant is a nice experience with a traditional english menu (try the fish and chips!).
May 2016,Brown's is our nr 1 hotel in london.,"I actually mentioned Brown's hotel on twitter. thanking everyone. Since I myself work as an anchor woman for dutch television, it will be picked up by many. Thank you so much. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay!!"
April 2016,Quintessential London hotel!,"This is the hotel to consider amongst the others! It hits all the marks - excellent location, classic yet stylish, warmest hospitality and truly ""at-your service""! The staff is attentive and the service is on point."
May 2016,Most sophisticated ,"A reborn classic, this first hotel in London has been transformed into a chic European winner under designer Olga Polizzi. It has an elegant clientele of Euros, not young US investment bankers lugging roll-on luggage like most other once deluxe London hotels  It is without pretense but with a jumping ground floor of with-it young English designers and personalities in a Hix restaurant, sprawling library and tea room with multiple fireplaces and a chic, hopping bar serving nonstop food and drinks. Dom Ruinart is the house champagne. Enough said."
May 2016,"Stylish, expensive, English and worth every penny!",Marvellous place for Friday cocktails with my beautiful daughter. Worth every penny! Drinks are served with olives and other nibbles. I was surprised to see and hear people openly and loudly chattering on phones at the bar when the code says this is not allowed. Bad form!
April 2016,A delightful home from home in Central London,"Every time I have stayed at Browns I have felt genuinely welcomed. From the Doorman who takes the trouble to get your name (if he doesnt already know it!) and then escorts you to reception where again you feel they already know you even if its a first or second visit as they clearly look through their reservations in advance (which sadly few hotels do nowadays) and at least seem to know a bit about you which is very reassuring. The two rooms that I have experienced were both a delight. The decor is modern yet very discreet and the Deluxe Kings overlooking Albermarle Street are particularly spacious with very large bathrooms with separate showers and double sinks and bags of fluffy bath towels, his and her sized bathrobes (again few hotels bother) and superb toiletries. A mini…"
April 2016,LIke getting a big warm hug,"Everytime I stay here, whether for work or leisure, I just feel so happy and warm knowing that I will have a wonderful time.  This last stay was just as amazing as always.  From the comfort of the bedroom to the mouthwatering food to the exceptional care taken by all the team... It just feels like I get a big warm hug everytime I walk in the door!"
April 2016,Amazing service at every touch!,"Previously we stayed at the Ritz. This was our first stay at Browns and hopefully not our last! A world of consistently friendly professional service was our experience at Browns. The location is ideal in lovely Mayfair.  The property is beautiful with a lovely tea room, busy bar, restaurant and spa. Our favorite pubs and Indian restaurant were right out  the door. We had a deluxe room that was extremely comfortable. The quality of the sheets is amazing. The bathroom was roomy and had a separate glass shower and soaking tub. The continental breakfast buffet was fabulous! It included fresh fruit, pastry, meats and cheeses, fish and more. This was a five star experience and we adored it! The atmosphere was welcoming and we appreciated the experience. "
March 2016,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"A wonderful hotel worthy of the the heft bill. Five star service, luxurious amenities, well equipped gym and a very helpful concierge. Breakfast was a gastronomic experience and the concierge was both knowledgeable and informative. The staff was very attentive and focused on addressing every guests concerns and needs. The hotel is well located and within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus and countless outstanding restaurants."
April 2016,Expensive but luxurious and very welcoming,"We return regularly here as it is always a lovely place to stay, with very good, friendly service. A quick chat with John on the door is always a pleasure. Very central. The restaurant is excellent but can be very noisy when busy."
April 2016,Great Hotel & Professional Team & HIX Mayfair,"Stayed here for one night only, but had an amazing experience. Very professional check in (I think the gentleman name was Stefan), room very well designed - modern with historic touch.  Had a dinner in HIX - great food and service. To finish our evening we moved to the Donovan bar where we were greeted by Head Barman Riccardo and tried two amazing cocktails -  ""Between Heaven and Earth"" and ""The Photographer"" made by  Luca - amazing - you HAVE to try these cocktails!  Cant wait to stay here again soon!"
March 2016,A wonderful experience!,"I went here for a special birthday treat. We booked far in advance for afternoon tea and got a table near the piano and the fireplace. This was more expensive than other afternoon tea venues but I didn't feel ripped off. We have a love dark wood hotel setting, great service, and even a doggie bag of the items we didn't finish after it was refilled anyway.   It was lovely, thank you."
March 2016,A delightful place to stay,The staff are incredibly friendly and hospitable. Very well mannered and always willing to help with a problem. The rooms are comfortable and not too noisy. Good amenities and comfortable beds. Very good location and excellent bar. The Hix restaurant is a pleasure to eat at as well. Would always choose to stay here.
April 2016,"Good Hotel, almost perfect",Very satisfied except for the unbearable noise coming from the airing system which did not allow sleeping with an open window. Helpful and friendly waiters. Outstanding Concierge. Will come again but will make sure to get a better room. Avoid room on the inner court.
April 2016,Nowhere Else,I would not stay anywhere else on London. The staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful. The rooms are of a very high standard.They are modern without being chintzy. The food at Hix including breakfast is of the highest order. This is an understated hotel of the highest order. 
April 2016,Brown's Hotel sets the Standard for London Hotels but even the best can occasionally slip up. !,"This is a superb hotel where the staff, who mostly seem to be from overseas, have been very well trained. Service is remarkably good and all the staff are very friendly and attentive.We had one bad experience which, although quite trivial left a bad impression of the housekeeping staff but this did not in any way spoil our visit. It just demonstrated that no matter how good the management team may be, there is always someone who will, let the side down. i have pointed out this problem and am confidant that it will be rectified. We will be returning to Brown's on our next visit in July.."
May 2016,Afternoon Tea in a private dining room!,"Fabulous afternoon in the Byron room, a private dining venue for 12 girls to relax, drink champagne and eat cake! Brown's Hotel couldn't have been more helpful in arranging this special afternoon. Followed swiftly by some of the best cocktails in London in the Donovan bar - stunning to look at as well as on the tastebuds!"
April 2016,Feel at home in Mayfair,"Our family spent ten days at Browns. We could not have had a better experience. From our grandson who turned 10 the same day the Queen turned 90, to his grandfather who is 75, the experience was perfect. The friendly and professional service was evident from start to finish. Every member of the staff seemed to know our names within the first twelve hours of our stay. Wow!!"
April 2016,Fantastic!,"We had an overall great experience - private transfers in a luxury car which was well maintained, great service of the concierge and event team, great breakfast buffet as well as nice ambiente and very good service in the Donovan Bar. Rooms were well maintained and very clean. Just great!"
March 2016,Donovan's bar ,A very pleasant location just off Piccadilly great staff decor private special great service good food well recommended will go back again  The afternoon tea is a real delight try it!! A super romantic yet funky bar with some super photographers by mr D!
April 2016,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"We have stayed here previously, this visit was for afternoon tea yesterday and had a wonderful time. Three generations; well cared for by friendly attentive staff who were only too happy to explain and look after us. Tables not too close together, lovely. As much food as we wished and the choice of traditional afternoon tea or tea-tox (the healthy option). Great sandwiches, (although the bagel was too chewy), brilliant scones, great cakes. Excellent choice of teas. Altogether a really positive experience. Only one thing (and this is not the only place to do this) why does it cost £10 per glass of champagne?"
April 2016,Brown's hotel Trip,"We mixed up our reservation and arrived 1h too late. This was no problem and we got seated at a nice table within perfect distance from the pianist that played nice background music. We started the tea with champagne that was delicious and choose our tea, one each. Then the food arrived, lots of it! Great sandwiches and sweet pastries. As much as you'd like. Very good service and special thanks for celebrating my husband's birthday and our one year anniversary. This was our first Afternoon Tea and we couldn't have chosen a better place for it."
April 2016,Survey,"Excellent, attentive Service. Staff greeted me by name after only a few hours. The decor in my room was a little dated, but everything was functional and clean. Food quality and service in the Hotel's dining room (HIX) was very good, value for money and excellent."
April 2016,Second stay at Browns,"Excellent all the way.  Second visit and I was not disappointed. Love the large bathrooms with separate shower. Preferred the REN bathroom amenities.  Rooms spacious with two beds plus a couch.  Very quiet even with room located over Dover Street. Excellent service at reception, in the restaurant, in the bar.  Well looked after by the concierge staff.  Without a doubt we will return.  "
April 2016,Discreet & Understated Elegance,"Nothing much to say, this is our second time here and we will always stay here when we come to London. This trip the hotel was a surprise for my fiance who arrived in London Saturday morning and the hotel, working with my travel agency, provided a transfer from Heathrow and went along with the rouse that we were staying at another Hotel where I had been stationed for work that week before dropping her off at Browns. The hostess in the Hix for Breakfast knew our names and drink orders after one seating, she was very pleasant. Breakfast here is one of the best breakfast's in any hotel I've stayed at in the world. The Donovan Bar is still a bit of ghost town every time we go in there, and the service has never been on the same level as the rest of the hotel, which I've written…"
April 2016,"Excellent afternoon tea, lovely atmosphere","Wonderful ambience, charming chic & comfortable! Oozing character in a discreet & efficient manner.  Would not hesitate to stay here every time we are in London. Well situated for Green Park tube station & walking distance to Bond Street and accessible to all the main shopping areas. "
April 2016,The greatest birthday ever,Went for my sixty fifth birthday and it was well beyond my wishes. Wanted to take afternoon tea in the tea rooms. This was my sixth and seventh visit there. It was my fourth stay at Browns. My wife had told the staff it was my birthday and everyone went well beyond what would be expected. After we came back to our room on my birthday night I was shocked and overjoyed to find a chocolate mousse cake with a chocolate ganache icing in the room with the words Happy Birthday inscribed! 
April 2016,Dany,was a good an quality time in this very high british standard hotel. the service was exellent and the availability from the staff was exeptional. requests were handle very quick and with the highest standard. very british ideed.
April 2016,excellent but...,"I considere the Brown's one of the best hotels in London in a absolutely strategic location welcoming , quite , amazing service and very nice rooms . The breakfast is verygood for food and service . The SPA is gorgeous and the Gym has everything  you may need .On my opinion an hotel at his level should not require payment for wi-fi connection ."
April 2016,"World-Class, lovely hotel in the best part of London","My experience at the Brown's Hotel was outstanding from start to finish.  While the hotel was luxurious, and my room was large, well furnished & beautiful, the hotel was not stuffy at all.  I've stayed at many ""fancy"" hotels where I felt a need to dress a certain way in the lobby.  Brown's was not like that.  It's a perfect hotel for those who like being pampered & like to stay at a high class hotel, but who don't want snobby staff our ostentatious surroundings.  My junior suite was enormous.  It had a large sitting area, huge bathroom, as well as a walk in closet.  The location was perfect.  It's a quick walk to Soho and many tourist attractions.  But it was nice being a couple short blocks away from the hubbub.  If you like luxury shopping, Brown's is really the best hotel…"
March 2016,Amazing Stay in London,This was our first trip to London and several friends had recommended (demanded) that we stay at Brown's.  Are friends were correct - from arrival to departure we has a truly first class experience.  We will definitely stay at Brown's next time we visit London!!
March 2016,Home away from home.,The hotel is located in a high valued area with friendly and experienced staff. This is a great place you need to be to reach your destinations as quickly as possible A place like Brown's hotel is very good for real relaxation. 
March 2016,Amazing Easter Afternoon Tea,"Went there for Easter afternoon tea with the family and loved it. Everything was perfect. Unlimited sandwiches and savory scones, unlimited tea, delicious cakes and friendly and impeccable staff. It was a pleasure to be there and will recommend this place to friends and family."
March 2016,Brown's - wonderful London Weekend getaway,A wonderful stay with great service from all the staff we met and a room that was just what we needed. I would definitely recommend the hotel for anyone whether for business or leisure and look forward to staying again in the future
March 2016,Champagne Brunch at Hix restaurant,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were met with smiling friendly personnel from the hotel, the waiting staff were exceptional from the moment we entered the restaurant we were offered a beautiful table by the window and lit the fire so it was cosy for us both, champagne was poured and our glasses topped up whilst we reviewed the menu, the food was sublime  and the unlimited champagne made our experience very special , I have been to many champagne brunches but the setting & service certainly topped Hix @ Browns hotel as my restaurant of choice and I will definitely be returning"
February 2016,Wedding Visit,"From the minute you walk through the doors of the Brown's hotel you are greeted by personel- it has a touch of hospitality that you just don't see displayed as often these days. Service in the bar/tea room was attentive. The hotel is well kept and decorated, had an elevator. It is also home to a Hix Restaurant, which was delicious.  *I went to Brown's hotel when looking for wedding venues- although in the end we chose a venue better suited to our needs I would like to post because I was so impressed!  When being shown around the spaces were clean, beautiful, the events planner I met with was absolutely lovely- she even brought some cookies for my partner and I for valentine's day.  I was very impressed with the Suites which we could have pottentially stayed in had we done our…"
February 2016,Classy hotel in the BEST location . ,"If you are visiting London and want to be near the best upmarket shopping , restaurants , bars and clubs then stay at Browns . It is also a short walk to Green Park and Buckingham Palace . The staff are exceptionally well trained and extremely friendly and genuinely make you feel special . The breakfast is fine but if you fancy a special breakfast go to the ""Wolseley"" on Piccadilly , you must book in advance ."
February 2016,Fantastic hotel & great location,"We returned to Browns for the third time in the last six months, once again the whole experience from making reservation, check-in, standard & cleanliness of room, breakfast and freindly courteous staff was exceptional!"
March 2016,"Review of Browns in Mayfair, London",An excellent hotel with staff who are very competent in their roles.  The staff just cannot do enough for you and go out of their way to ensure you are happy and if you have everything you need.  Highly recommend.
March 2016,Wonderful!,"Whilst on a short honeymoon and after an unfortunate first night at another hotel we decided to try 'the best'. We were treated as honoured guests, upgraded into a beautiful suite and made to feel absolutely special. On our return from the theatre our room had been decorated with rose petals together with candles - all too fantastic. As was breakfast in the morning. We took this in our suite - another absolute delight. Our heartfelt thanks to the management and staff for a truly memorable stay. We cannot wait for our first anniversary as we may treat ourselves!"
February 2016,Superb attention,"From the start of organising the event to the delivery it was superb.  The Food and wine were outstanding and the staff always attentive.  We had dinner for 28 and while not cheap, as you would expect in this part of London, it was definitely worth the money and the organising."
February 2016,Brilliant Service,Very impressive hotel. Entire team treats every guest with the upmost respect and provides excellent service. Caught the Brown's limo to theatre several night. Lovely perk. Best lemon tarts in the tea room.  Enjoyed the pianist and fireplaces.  Location is primo.
March 2016,Afternoon Tea,"Browns offered the best Afternoon tea in London The service was excellent, professional,with out being over fussy,the waitress was polite and  gave a passionate information on the afternoon tea. The hotel made my mothers birthday so very special and a lovely afternoon  Thank you "
February 2016,Fabulous stay!,Stayed for a night with my husband part work mixed with a relaxing break. We couldn't have picked a better hotel. If service and cleanliness is important to you this is the perfect hotel. It doesn't have all the gadgets you may get at some other hotels but it is truly luxurious. The afternoon tea is divine as well as the breakfast. We will definitely go back.
February 2016,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel was amazing!  The staff is lovely, always wanted to help and helped even more then they needed!  The rooms are clean with a sense of warmth. I higly recommend this hotel,due to the staff, the location, the food and the overall experience."
March 2016,An excepcional experience,"It was like a ""royal"" fantasy.... Thanks for the personalized my experience in London, and  made me feel at home, far from home.  Strongly recommended, I would like to repeat the experience in a next trip"
March 2016,Excellent hotel - a luxury stay,"Another amazing stay at Browns. It was my birthday during our stay and the hotel kindly upgraded us and delivered a delicious birthday cake to our room which made it really special. Just a fantastic hotel, beautiful rooms, great service. Hope to stay again soon."
March 2016,Terrible view,My husband and I stayed recently at Browns  Rocco Forte Hotel in London  based on our previous excellent experience concerning the Charles Rocco Forte hotel in Munich. They put us in an average room with low ceiling and the worst thing was a window facing old drainage tubes . The upper space was covered by a metalic net in order to keep  birds away. It was a really depressing situation. They offered  us another room but we had to pay additional 100 pounds per night !!  Also the breakfast was limited compared to the Charles Rocco Forte in Munich. Why  the  standards  are not the same for all Rocco Forte Hotels???
March 2016,Back again,"Our family has come to Browns a few times over the last 25 or so years.  We try to spend the last two days at Browns before returning home.  The concierge was excellent, everything they did for us was invaluable: accepting delivery of a perishable package, restaurant recommendation, flight check-in, and more.  "
March 2016,Tea Torial --- Amazing day.!,"For last Christmas my wife gave ma voucher for the above event. We arrived very early but were soon accommodated by Andrea in the Tea Room. We were taken into a private room to be shown by a young man, Saju the pastry sous chef, how to make scones and then macaroons. Saju has only been at the hotel a few weeks. What a great ambassador for Brown's. We were with him for two hours!! Then we had the full afternoon tea which was superb. We have been many times in the past and it is definitely the best in London! Andrea then arranged with Saju a quick tour of the kitchen and two Gorgeous suites. This was a visit to go into our special memory bank. Please thank those men plus the other staff for a truly wonderful time."
March 2016,Wow!,"Fantastic service, always made to feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Friendly staff. Very central location, close to theatres, shopping and parks. Very luxurious and pampering experience.."
March 2016,Afternoon tea perfection,"Exquisite setting to meet an old German friend for a quintessential afternoon tea in the rather cosy and stylish English Tea Room.  Our waiter, Akki, couldn't have taken better care of us.  Big tip:  pace yourself.  the moreish sandwiches and delicacies followed by hot scones filled us up so that we couldn't manage the cake.  Prefer it to the Ritz.  it's that good."
March 2016,A luxury stay in London,"To celebrate a special birthday, we pushed the boat out and booked a room at Browns for a night, following a visit to the theatre. It was - for us, anyway - expensive but the experience proved to be memorable and well-worth the cost. The attention from the staff was first rate, starting with a quick tour of the ground floor before being taken to the room. Nothing was too much trouble - and a birthday cake and card were an extremely nice touch. We couldn't fault the room. We had chosen Browns after dinner a year before in HIX, their restaurant. We didn't dine this time - but breakfast provided an interesting choice with very  different items on the menu. The Irish bacon sandwich, a Moira soda farl with Peter Hannan’s guanciale, was novel and excellent and matched the subtle but…"
March 2016,"Delicious food, lovely being spoiled, relaxing ambience","We booked on-line Tea for Two in this Hotel, just this Sunday.  It was recommended by a friend.  You get treated like royalty, your coats are taken, shown to your seat, very comfortable chairs, lovely piano player playing in the background.  We had standard Tea for Two and lots of it!  Early Grey Tea that was replenished whenever we needed in beautiful silver pots.  Salmon, Egg, Avocado, Cheese sandwiches, rolls, daintily cut.  (we are non meat eaters).  And were asked if we wanted more - which we did!  Then fresh scrumptious scones with clotted cream and the best strawberry jam I have ever had.  An array of little cakes and then we were asked if we wanted chocolate fudge cake or lemon meringue.  we were bursting but we said yes :)  The attention from the waiters was lovely, not…"
February 2016,Back in mayfair,"My wife and I spent a view days in London for my birthday and we love Mayfair, so consequential we came back and stayed at the Browns hotel. Very friendly and attentive personal from the concierge, reception and the waiters. Very excellent breakfast with nice and honey seating. Also the dinner is absolutely good which is not always the case at hotel restaurants even those with 5 stars. We come back for sure."
February 2016,Another Exceptional Rocco Forte Hotel,"Staff attentive, nothing too much of an effort.  Hotel and staff excellent from concierge, reception, housekeeping and restaurant and bar staff, fantastic location would love to return again soon.  Typifies The Rocco Forte Hotel Group, superlative service."
February 2016,Another Fine Stay,"Over the years one thing you find from staying at the best hotels the world has to offer is their consistency of service, level of personal connection, and luxury of comfort.  The Brown's exceeds each of these on every level.  Each year and season I visit London and stay at the Brown's, I am addressed by name immediately by the many members of the team.  Who doesn't love to feel welcome and remembered upon return.  The level of service from the team is always on point, and expected from such a strong establishment.  The rooms are consistent, elegant, quiet, and luxurious.  There is simply nothing more that you need.  It is all here wrapped up in a beautifully British package of luxurious comfort.  This hotel makes you feel special in so many ways.  You simply have to experience…"
February 2016,Winter city break,"Browns is ""quintessentially British"" and was chosen for that very reason, and did not disappoint. A very traditional British hotel with well presented, polite, efficient staff, making every effort to make your stay as personable and comfortable as possible. "
February 2016,Afternoon tea,"Having visited Brown's many years ago it was chosen for a celebratory 60th birthday tea. Booking was very easy on the internet. On arrival we were shown to our table, squashy sofas and comfortable armchairs provided an excellent relaxed atmosphere. The staff were most attentive and were diligent in their explanation of the tea menu. The sandwiches were delicious with a varied selection of fillings; there were plenty and they were quickly replenished once eaten. Scones and cakes very equally yummy. For those who did not want tea to drink different coffees were available. An excellent place to have afternoon we will all revisit in the future."
February 2016,Lovely Valentines afternoon tea,My husband took me to Brown's for afternoon which was truly relaxing with wonderful service throughout on a special day with other couples enjoying the atmosphere. Our friends did try to contact the hotel to arrange a couple of drinks for us whilst we were there. Unfortunately they declined ( not sure why) however we would definitely return.
February 2016,Browns - a lovely hotel!,"I stayed at Browns in February. The staff are outstanding, The service was personal and the restaurant staff made our birthday meal a memorable occasion.  The room was luxurious and the turn down service was really special.  Truly 5 star!"
February 2016,Classic afternoon tea,"Enjoyed this afternoon tea visit was nice from start to finish, friendly attentive staff, delicious sandwiches, we had cocktails which was very tasty, nice atmosphere and we were sat near the fireplace which was great after been in the cold with a warming cup of tea which finished it all off lovely. Would defiantly recommend! "
February 2016,Exelence in hospitality,Apsolutely great location and nice and professional staff. I truly recomended this hotel if you are planing to stay in London !  You feel like you really are a guest. Not  just a another turist .  They want to enjoy honestly they do...  Next time in London I will stay with Browns ! 
December 2015,First Class,First stay at Brown's.  Loved the effortless mix of old and modern styles in this hotel which retains a traditional style whilst also seemingly chic and cool.    Lovely room and facilities.  Bathroom v generous (sorry can't remember the room number).    Breakfast was good but not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel - especially our first morning - service was slow and therefore when we didn't get things exactly as we had ordered we didn't send it back for fear of further delays.   Things improved for day two I have to acknowledge so hopefully first day was a one off.  Bar very nice for early evening aperitif and late nightcap.    Would be happy to return.
January 2016,Best location! ,"I spent 6 nights in Browns hotel last month, The staff is amazing the room was big enough and well furnished. The toilet is very nice with a bathtub. The lounge is very crowded I couldn't enjoy it much but the afternoon tea was nice experience.   The concirge was helpful with us as they planned our stay and made us all bookings. The most what I loved about the hotel is the location! "
December 2015,A relaxing oasis with exquisite service!,"After an hour on the ice rink at the Winter Wonderland, Hyde Park we were in need of a cup of tea and respite! And I knew just where I wanted to go, Browns Hotel. On arrival we were greeted warmly by the doorman and taken through to the bar for tea. I might add that our party included our three year old who was equally welcomed (and given a chocolate coin by the doorman on our way out which was such a lovely touch). Our pram and coats were whisked away and we were given a wonderful table and seating area in the beautifully decorated bar. The service from all staff was exquisite and very friendly, just as I'd remembered it. My son ordered a hot chocolate (£9!! and worth every penny) and was presented with a tray of melted real chocolate, warm milk in a Turkish pot, marshmallows…"
December 2015,Outstanding ,"The English Tea Room at Browns Hotel not only captivates the quintessential English afternoon tea but serves it with tremendous style. Our waiter, Stefano, provided us with a friendly, professional high level of service that I almost forgot existed.  The gluten free option of sandwiches and cakes were by far the best I have ever had and we loved the Cornish afternoon tea blend.  Browns remains one of the best afternoon tea experiences London has to offer. A marvellous place to sit, relax and enjoy the tinkling of the ivory and a tradition that lives on with understated class in this charming establishment."
December 2015,December 2015,"Quintessential London - best in class service, wonderful rooms and excellent restaurant for breakfast and dinner. Fully recommended if you want to treat yourself and be in the thick of it all in the West End"
January 2016,The best hotel in London,"I have tried all the 5-star hotels in London and finally realized I will not stay anywhere except The Browns -- from Claridges, Four Seasons, Mandarin - this is the best.  Rita, Alistar, and Stefan ensured I stayed in my favorite room - all the rooms are spacious and luxurious - I just have a preference to a special room here.  The bathrooms are very very large with a separate shower, tub, bidet and of course, the towel warmer.  Room service is fast and friendly and food very yummy.  You cannot go wrong staying here - simply stated it is a luxury hotel experience in the best neighborhood (Mayfair) yet on a quiet street. Cheers to the staff at The Brown's!  and a big thanks for making my stay great."
January 2016,Beautiful & relaxing hotel in central London,"Browns is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair, off the beaten track and surprisingly quiet for a London hotel.  The service is excellent, staff are friendly and helpful, yet non intrusive.  I love the fact this hotel is not pretentious and all guests are treated with the same care and attention.  There is a lovely ambience in the hotel and as you step into reception you can almost feel your shoulders soften and relax after a long day in the office.  The room I stayed in was comfortable and well equipped.  My only criticism would be that the television needed upgrading and the bed was two singles joined together which was not as comfortable as a King. Despite this I had a lovely stay and the food was delicious.  I will definitely be returning in the future. "
January 2016,Pure Luxury,Browns Hotel provides a 5 star experience from the moment you check in. Staff are professional and friendly and the rooms offer a timeless elegance and comfort. The style and decor of the hotel is classic and celebrates old English Heritage. Highly recommended.
January 2016,January 2016 stay,"It was a great experience to enjoy the level of luxury that Brown's can offer. Everyone makes you feel exceptionally welcome.  The room was beautiful, the breakfast was fresh and the service was the best. "
January 2016,Best hotel in London,"A first class hotel in a fantastic location. You cannot get more centrally located. Wonderful service - all the staff were friendly not stuffy but extremely professional. In all a ,totally relaxing. It is like stepping back in time but with all modern conveniences. If you fancy being a Miss Marple this is the place for you."
December 2015,Prime location,"Well established high end hotel, well placed for London attractions, luxury shops and restaurants. Staff are trained well and are discreet and friendly without being OTT.  Room 417 was quiet and comfortable. Improvements would be to have tea making facilities in room, and the TV opposite the bed rather than under the chaise.  Nice touch to have interesting books available in the room not knackered paper backs."
December 2015,Elegant home base in the heart of London,9 days between Christmas and New Year.  Wonderful experience made better by a great staff and superb location.  Staff makes everyone feel welcomed and astonishingly almost everyone greeted me by name on every encounter.  Elegant without being at all stuffy; exceptionally high level of service without being intrusive.  One of our best meals of the trip at Hix.  
January 2016,"Discreet, superior service - the way to go","This was my fourth stay at Browns and I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to experience this amazing establishment and everything it has to offer once more. In fact I've just realised its probably the only place I've repeat visited given the wide choice generally available. From the smiling, welcoming doormen to the seamless booking in process (an operation so, so many other hotels could learn from) our two night stay was a real treat. I love the fact that nothing is too much trouble for the staff, all of whom without exception provide such great service. This time round we stayed in a deluxe room with a fantastically comfortable king-size bed. The room was a great size and exceptionally quiet which was the benefit of room overlooking a courtyard, so no view to…"
January 2016,Couples massage at the Browns Spa,"We stayed one night at the Browns Hotel in London, we dined at the Hix restaurant and enjoyed cocktails in the Donovan bar all with great service, but the real highlight would have to be our visit to The Browns Hotel Spa.  Our therapists, Angela and Kelly-ann were truly amazing, they made us feel comfortable instantly, gave us various options of oils to be used.  The treatments were amazing, completely relaxed and revived after this 50mins Couples massage, both Kelly-Ann and Angela are amazing therapists."
January 2016,Excellent from check in till the very end of my stay,"I have stayed in Browns hotel for my early birthday and anniversary celebrations with my husband. Everyone was really helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. I had excellent time, it was better than I could have ever anticipated. Hannah, Rita and Alex were really helpful during my stay. Sarah served some amazing cocktails, helping us choose the best. I loved my experience and I would definitely recommend it Browns hotel to all my friends and family."
December 2015,Fabulous Luxury treat yourself and your loved one,What a perfect stay wish it could have been longer suite was heaven. A selection of chocolates appeared in our room by magic just because the reception remembered I said it was my husband's birthday. Breakfast was delicious with so much choice and the Donovan Bar had a great range of cocktails. Will return.
January 2016,Charming Boutique Hotel,"It's beautiful boutique hotel. The services we have received were excellence. Quite close to famous high end boutiques,from LV,Patek Phillippe, Chanel,Gucci and much more. About 7 minutes taxi ride to Harrods.  Also they have wonderful Tea Room and restaurant.   "
January 2016,Posh Afternoon Tea,Had a lovely afternoon tea at Browns as a treat.  Quite expensive at #47.50 however you're made to feel special and it is served in a relaxed atmosphere.  Was a little disappointed that no real cream cakes were served and that the Browns Teddy Bear was out of stock so no souvenir afterwards.
January 2016,short trip to see friends,It really feels home away from home. I almost didn't want to leave the hotel. Its cozy and they give so much attention to detail. Amazing breakfast buffet. Only a few blocks away from the famous Bond Street. Great for shopping. Love the art within the hotel and the special packages they offer for art events in house.
January 2016,Tea fit for a queen ,"Tea fit for a queen...yes, I had once, at Brown's Hotel, Myfair. What a glorious party. My prince and me, dressed for the occasion, chatting by the fire, having a good time sipping Champaign and tea and tasting the absolutely marvelous sandwiches, cakes, shortbread and scones with jam and cream, like we were in some British novel or film. Unforgettable. Loved every sip and every bit and every second. "
January 2016,Twice as nice!,"This was my second time at the Browns Hotel. The suite was spacious and clean. The location in Mayfair is perfect for business or leisure travel. The Donovan bar is a great place to meet for a quick drink or to linger after a long day in the city.  The best thing about the Browns is the service! The staff is amazing!! Alastair at the front desk, the housekeeping staff and the whole concierge team are by far the best in all of London!! The Browns should be at the top of everyone's list when visiting London. I can't wait to return!!"
January 2016,Never disappints,"I love Browns - it's like a home from home.  my room was bright, light and airy  Highlights- The bed linen is divine , the staff are delightful and the gym has really improved and the eggs Benedictine is to die for  What more can I say."
December 2015,Tea Time ,"Good was very good. The egg sandwiches were amazing. The scones were excellent. The clotted cream and strawberry jam were really fresh and good. Service impeccable as always. Very nice decoration, typical traditional English style. This is the best English tea in London. Prices are reasonable, 47£ per person and you get everything as much as you want. "
December 2015,Brown's is not a hotel,"Brown's is not a hotel but a place to stay, nearly as comfortable as home. Excellent rooms, service and food. Well located in the middle of Mayfair. Good access to local restaurants (Nopi) and theaters."
December 2015,BROWN'S HOTEL,"A marvellous stay in London thanks to the location and excellent service. We had enjoyed this beautiful hotel. It 's such a very nice pleasure to stay at the Brown's Hotel. We recommend the High Tea, in warm and cosy place."
December 2015,Increasingly elegant ,"Don Ashton, the famous hotel designer said that design doesn't make a great hotel, the guests do. Brown's luckily has both, a beautiful international clientele of what appear to be liked minded sophisticates and an evermore refined ambiance of Olga Poluzzi's wonderful textures, artwork and colors out of a lifestyle magazine vs the faux redo of pseudo-English motifs like many other luxury almost Disney theme-park properties.  It's all very comfortable with the ability to enjoy light food in the tea rooms and bar from 11-2AM, a luxurious Hix restaurant and of course excellent room service each so good you don't want to leave.  Best of all, Brown's is in the middle of Mayfair so you can walk to great restaurants and shopping, and skip the taxis.  One of the best hotels in the world."
December 2015,Be careful of your room class!,"I was not going to put anything on Tripadvior,but Browns own survey as taken me here.We booked via BA using some of our accumulated Avios points. I believe this was a mistake,as we were given the possible worst room in the hotel. 114.The room was very dark and looked over the fire escape,air con units and was in a small high sided brick yard, on the 1st floor, there was no daylight from the window as high walls surrounded the air con metal boxes outside the window. The shower was within the bath and there is a large step from and into the bath.If you are shorter than 5ft 5 then you will struggle to get in and out of shower. I would have expected a separate shower. The room was averagely fine.The TV is very small and outdated.The worst of all was the noise from the corridor…"
December 2015,Brilliant is understatement!,"One night stay as Christmas treat for wife and self. Would give 6 stars if possible. Have stayed in many 5 star places in the past on business, but none come anywhere near this place, mainly owing to brilliant service provided by staff. Greeted at door, luggage whisked to room, check in seamless and guy then escorted us to lovely room and showed us round and offered to unpack. Wife enjoyed good value massage in spar, and we had lovely lunch in Donovan's bar which was very good value. Bed turned down in evening with slippers left and face cream. Staff appeared to be everywhere and nothing too much trouble. Breakfast buffet was wonderful and almost anything available cooked to order - I had lovely fresh kippers which were a joy. We had a magical stay and are plotting to stay…"
November 2015,My favorite hotel in London ,"We love Browns because of its perfect location, its comforts and its great service. Everything in this hotel is consistent and discreet which is how we like it. Great concierge staff and lovely greeting staff at the entrance. The gentlemen who handled our luggage were super helpful. Our room was quite spacious although its difficult to get one with a view: we have stayed there over six times I think and only once ( August) did we get one Deluxe overlooking Albemarle street. The afternoon tea needs some improvement. Overall, I highly recommend it because its location is unbeatable: walking distance from all the shops, restaurants, museums, parks and theaters. "
November 2015,great repeat visit,"This is a classic establishment, providing great service and a great stay. Located in the middle of good, quality shopping and easy access to the tube. Offers a great tea room and a nice restaurant, but it is also within walking distance of other great restaurants."
November 2015,Disappointing,"There were a catalogue of small issues which, cumulatively, made the stay less than satisfactory. First, the room key wouldn't work and, since I had not been accompanied to the room, I had to go back down to reception to get one which did work. Then, I had specifically asked to have my luggage to be brought to the room quickly, because I had to change for an appointment and was running late. Nobody brought it and, after 20 minutes or so, I ended up going back down to reception to fetch it myself. I found it lying unattended  on the floor. Nobody would have known it was mine, but nobody said a thing when I picked it up and walked off with it, and nobody later queried whether it had gone missing. I was asked, when I checked in, whether I wanted a newspaper in the morning. I said…"
November 2015,Fantastic balance of heritage yet in the moment,"This hotel is a gem:  small, private and inspiring.  Everything from the bar, the breakfast room, the in-room dining, the intimate lobby, reception with a fire place... staying here is to share and to be part of building the hotel's history and future.  Inspiring renovation.  Excellent bed.  Excellent pillows, bathroom amenities, real Italian-style enormous wooden clothes hangers, black out curtains, minibar assortment.  Just waiting to meet Agatha Christie in one of the corridors...  Love it.  Will definitely be back.  Feel very well rested."
December 2015,A wonderful stay ,Amazing hotel very friendly with beautiful rooms.  Checkin and out very swift with attention to detail. Breakfast extremely good with many choices.  Service in bar was superb with extensive selection of gins.  Position in London great for shopping and underground. Highly recommend much preferred to Ritz. 
December 2015,Excellent service,We stayed with our twin 10 month old babies and were given a complementary upgrade to a junior suite on arrival. The suite had been prepared with toys and treats for the babies which was wonderful. The food in the Hix restaurant was excellent as always.
December 2015,West end luxury,"Fabulous place in the west end of London. Recommended if you are looking to be in the center of the west end. Service was fantastic, rooms luxurious and staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Atmosphere was relaxed luxury.  "
December 2015,A home from home,It is simply perfect staying at the Brown's. You feel so comfortable and well looked after and of course the room is sublime. I only can recommend this hotel to everyone who likes to feel save and comfortable. It is very quiet and just lovely. The staff is exceptional.
December 2015,another wonderful pre-Christmas stay at our favourite London hotel,Staying at Browns any time is wonderful but Christmas time has to be the best.  This year's decorations were stylish and sparkling as ever - very clever tie up with Fortnum and Masons just down the road.  THE most comfortable beds ever so a perfect night's sleep guaranteed every time and and as always the usual wonderful friendly welcome by everyone from the Doorman on in.  The bar was buzzing and breakfast the next morning finished off our perfect pre-Christmas treat perfectly - the burford eggs scrambled with smoked salmon on gluten free toast really was the icing on the cake - we left set up for the perfect Christmas.  Thank you Browns
December 2015,Excellent Tea,"Booked well in advance and had a most pleasant experience. There are multiple rooms used for tea all with a fine ambiance, with a piano player in residence. Seating very comfortable, noise levels fine. Firstly you have to choose the tea, large selection, then the sandwiches and pastries are brought, which are replenished on demand. Sandwiches fresh and tasty. Scones with and without sultanas with mini mince pies and a very thick curl of clotted cream with strawbery jam- very good. Pastries delicate, numerous and delicious (perhaps the blackcurrant ""Macaron"" is an acquired taste). Finally there is a choice of christmas cake or brownie mousse cake but by this stage every one is stuffed, so I would recommend moderation to get to the end. All washed down with copious tea. Perhaps…"
December 2015,"Excellent hotel, can't wait to return","Cannot fault this hotel. A great luxury hotel in a great part of London. Room and bathroom was spacious, clean, high quality- one of the best I have stayed in London. Staff are exceptionally friendly and very helpful. I cannot wait to return..."
December 2015,Our family hotel,"Booked via our Personal Concierge. Travelled with my husband and 3 daughters (13, 12, 3). Git 2 classic rooms with adjoining doors at no extra costs, Given cot, bath set and nappy change set and complimentary hit choc and biscuits for all family. Personalised ginger breads for our daughters with their names on them. Rooms clean and beautifully decorated and large. Our daughters love the hotel. My husband and I love the hotel. Location very good for shopping and Hyde Park. The hotel does valet parking. Have stayed there twice before. Would definitely stay there again."
December 2015,"Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere!","The tearoom.....a must visit for those who want to experience a tradition. Sandwiches were so excellent I never got to the scones and clotted cream, not to speak of the Christmas cake that awaited. Many teas to choose from, comfy seats, waiters falling over themselves to please you. We had the last sitting which allowed us to stay at our leisure. A treat! Don't be surprised at the prices....they are high. "
December 2015,"Brown's Hotel, Mayfair, London","Brown's is a luxury heritage hotel in the heart of London steeped in history with fascinating literary connections.  It is conveniently close to parks & gardens, theatres, galleries & museums, cafes & shops, and tube stations.   It has excellent dining facilities and a well-equipped gym and spa. This hotel is very highly recommended not only for its beautiful architectural exterior and tasteful interiors but because of its tradition of providing high quality service.   Brown's should be considered for any special stays especially at Christmas time when it creates a beautiful festive atmosphere.   "
October 2015,Browns accommodation,I'm a frequent business guest and would appreciate if my room preference would be acknowledged. For a usual long stay of a week a spacious cloakroom is highly appreciated. Ultimately negative comments about room smell should be acknowledged as well. Giving me rooms with continuous short falls doesn't feel right considering the amount of stays of 1 week per month minimum.                     
November 2015,First class,"Ten most fabulous warm and genuine welcome set the tone of our one night stay this weekend. The room (203) was superbly furnished and finished to a high standard with little details thought of, leaving you wanting nothing. Although no tea and coffee making facilities in the room, service to the room was always efficient. The hotel bar was busy with top notch service and a great atmosphere. A duff cocktail and a nasty appetiser were put right fairly swiftly and without any fuss whatsoever. We thought the service at the hotel throughout was exemplary and made a fun weekend fantastic. We'll definitely be back if staying in London again."
September 2015,Club Sandwich in the bar area.,"To me, the sandwich was very tasty and absolutely perfect! The beer I ordered was very chilled and lovely.  The service was flawless, kind and attentive.  Only slight downside, was that the live piano music was a bit overpowering.  Would I recommend the place? Absolutely!  I will return."
October 2015,Best hotel in Mayfair,This hotel is in an amazing location the staff are awesome so so friendly and the rooms  are perfect clean and modern with character and the Hix restaurant is just awesome !!! I always feel it's a home from home at Browns they never forget me my name and can get you into the best restaurants as they have the conceirge in london they bend over backward to help you get or make thank special event special !!! If browns can't get it it literally means it can't be got anywhere !!!!! I stay their possibly 4 times a month I have the choice to stay where ever I wish and I wouldnt ever go anywhere else !!!                      
October 2015,week-end in London,I first experienced the Brown's 25 years ago. Standards have significantly been up graded burt the spirit of the hotel has been preserved.  An exclusive place were to stay. The Brown's is a combination of tradition and modernity.
February 2015,Stayed there 4 times and id stay again,Rocco forte is one of my favorite chains in europe and they will make sure to satisfy you by all means.  Concierge is outstanding (Omar)  Rooms are beautiful Reception always try to do their best to check you in as early as possible taking into consideration that my flight always arrives early in the morning. The bar is gem in london very classic and classy and of course the location is just the best
November 2014,"simple, elegant and comfortable",Rocco Forte Brown doesn't seem to be a very popular but I think it is a very nice hotel that offers great amenities. It is centrally located in a nice neighborhood. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet is excellent. The only negative is that we have to wait a long time to check in to our room. We were forced to upgrade so we can get in to the next available room. The room was huge and very comfortable but they should have given us a better deal since there are no other rooms available.
October 2015,Excellent stay,"Great central location, handy for Oxford, Regent and Bond Streets, as well as Picadilly; great staff from your first encounter with the doorman and who always speak, try to be helpful and recognise you as an individual rather than as a room number and very comfortable, impeccably clean room. All adds up to a great stay.                     "
January 2015,Afternoon Tea,"Had a lovely Afternoon Tea here shortly after Christmas.  In a lovely, old-fashioned style room with an amazing open fire, much less modern and contemporary than Claridges, for example. The Afternoon Tea itself was delicious and we were well looked after. However, our drinks upon arrival (we were a little early) were extortionately priced, £13.50 for a pineapple juice and a sherry! I would therefore recommend you arrive just in time for your Afternoon Tea slot."
October 2015,Superb,Excellebt service. Everyone friendly and welcoming. Perfect location. Food and afternoon tea lovely. The art gallery tour was a terrific addition to trip  I can't wait to recommend to friends and to return                      
November 2015,Wonderful place to stay,"This isn't a cheap London option but it is a lovely one. The staff are friendly, the rooms sizeable, showers, beds and pillows all welcoming and gorgeous. Location is perfect and the breakfast was wonderful. If you can afford to treat yourself go for it. It is a far better option than  other more pricey options in the capital in my experience."
November 2015,Excellent stay as always!,"Flawless service. All the staff are excellent with our children. It is all the little touches- personal greeting, children's bedclothes and toys- that make staying at Browns such a pleasure. We love coming back to our London home!        "
November 2015,Elegance and Service,"A venerable, elegant hotel with a stylish, cosmopolitan air.  Superb service and staff made our stay easy and enjoyable.  Unlike many hotels at this level where a stiff formality prevails, Brown's cultivates a lively and personal touch among its staff.  Our Junior Suite was glorious, the bar was warm and festive, breakfast selection was extensive and of high quality.  I will certainly be back."
November 2015,Nothing to complain,"Luxury hotel in the west end of London. Rooms are spacious, clean, and with a lot of extras typical for Rocce Forte resorts; breakfast is delicious. I really had nothing to complain and the service team obliging. Prices are at the upper end  but given the Mayfair location not really surprising."
October 2015,English Tea,"My husband and I had a terrific afternoon at Brown's for tea. We visited London (from MA) while our son was studying abroad.  Going to a fine tea was a ""bucket list"" item for me, so I did a lot of online research about the best places to go.  Brown's did not disappoint!  The tea room was beautiful; elegant yet comfortable, not stuffy.  The staff were polite and attentive, not snobby.  (I work in the service industry so I really hate attitude from my server when I'm the paying guest).  The food was beautifully presented and offered a nice selection.  Seconds were at the ready.  It was all delicious.  I had a glass of Ruinart Champagne... Delicious (wish I could find it in the States).  Our waiter asked if we were visiting for a special event so we said yes, ""the day before was…"
November 2015,A Lovely Stay,"We had booked afternoon tea and a stay overnight. We wanted to check in early at 1215pm but our room wasn't ready. We had booked afternoon tea for 1430hrs. The reception (very busy and we had to wait !)            suggested we took tea early at 1215pm, which we did as we had a long morning attending to other business in London. The afternoon tea was delicious. We had to ask the reception if our room was ready after tea (when we arrived home we had a message from the reception on our home phone advising us that the room was ready !!!!). The room was very nice and quite. Overall a lovely English hotel with excellent staff."
November 2015,Great Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon Tea in the private Lord Byron Room, service was outstanding and staff very helpful and informative. The whole experience was lovely from the minute we walked in the door, great selection of sandwiches and cakes and more cakes, the scones were delicious to."
December 2014,Quintessental excellence in leafy Mayfair,"Took afternoon tea at Brown's and it could not have been better. Better than The Dorchester and Claridges, Brown's is in a class of its own. Set in the heart of Mayfair, from the beautiful façade to the sumptuous interiors, this place welcomes you and more. The staff are wonderfully attentive and the cuisine better than you will experience at most of London's top hotels. In short, Brown's Hotel is arguably one of London's finest and feels like a home away from home every time you visit it."
November 2015,World Class Experience,"I know its a 5 star hotel but it truly was a wonderful stay.  Every aspect of my stay was world class.  Hotel was beautiful, the staff were fantastic, the Donovan Bar bartenders and back bar staff were amazing - they are truly masters of their profession.  The food was excellent throughout my stay.  Anyone looking for a world class establishment with the budget to support should consider Brown's Hotel without hesitation."
October 2015,Boutique luxury in the heart of Mayfair,"Stayed here for the first 2 nights of a part holiday / part business trip to the UK, and can not say enough good things about this hotel. Location wise, straight forward to get to by taxi from Heathrow, easy access to local tube stations, walking distance to the shopping areas of Regent street and New Bond street, strolling access to the restaurants and bars in Mayfair, and manageable commutable times in and around the West End.  We booked a Classic Room with king size bed, which was perfect for the 2 of us. The bed is one of the most luxurious I’ve slept in, as are all the finishings and amenities in the rooms, exactly what you’d expect from a Rocco Forte hotel. The room’s are large, with a great work space area, reclining sofa, seperate wardrobe area and bathroom,. The…"
September 2015,I Love This Hotel,I absolutely love this hotel.  I am in London frequently and have stayed at many hotels there.  This is one of my favorites.  The location is perfect....unless you are trying not to shop.  This is right in the heart of all the shopping on Bond Street and walking distance to Piccadilly and Oxford Street....but on a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle.  The service was excellent.  Everyone knows your name within a few minutes and they bend over backwards to make you feel like you are at home with the added benefits of room service.  Tea here is one of the best in town and the rooms are lovely with the feel of an apartment rather than a standard nondescript hotel room.
March 2015,Certainly Not a 5 Star,"Stayed at this hotel but to my dismay found the Room Attendants running around like headless chicken looking for fresh linen, pillow cases and towels. Seemed like this hotel has lost its way . This is not the reflection on Room attendants but the management . I would never have expected a 5Star hotel not to have adequate supply of fresh linen, pillow cases and fresh towels. I know for sure that this was not a one off event as I noticed this everyday over  a period of 6days . Shame on Rocke Forte group of hotels."
October 2015,Always great,"I love Brown's!  I've stayed several times, the discrete Mayfair location is absolutely fabulous, the service is excellent all around (OK maybe a bit disorganized at breakfast) and the rooms are elegant.  I had a nice snack in the bar and lovely breakfasts in the dining room.  Thanks everyone, I'll be back!"
October 2015,Perfect Business hotel in central London,"I stayed at the Brown's for business I had to conduct in central London. The location is perfect as very close to Green Park station but also a bit away from the madness! The hotel is beautiful, the rooms gorgeous and it is very quiet as opposed to what I feared. I slept so well, and the breakfast was gorgeous."
August 2015,Serene,We normally stay around the corner at the Westbury but decided to try this for a change. Upon arrival we were whisked away to reception and the bags taken from us immediately. The service was excellent from start to end apart from missing doormen from time to time. The rooms are a good size and immaculately decorated. The cooked breakfast is also very tasty. You also notice how much less hectic it is compared to the Westbury. Will definitely stay here again if the chance arises.  
October 2015,Understated elegance,We stumbled upon this place for mid afternoon lunch fortunately for us they had two spare tables. I would imagine that booking would be essential for afternoon tea. I have looked at the photos of this hotel professional and fellow trip advisors and to be honest; they don't do it justice.  In reality it is a place where funk crosses elegant comfort. The staff are attentive enough without being too fussy. It has a lovely relaxing feel to it and is a welcome relief from the busy hussel bussell outside in near by new bond and regent streets. The food available was a good range high price end as one would expect in Mayfair. I looked into the bar which exuded atmosphere and I will definitely return for drinks mid shopping trip.
September 2015,Brown's Hotel London,"Simply faultless. Definitely the best hotel in London. A country house hotel in Mayfair. Wonderful guys there for who nothing is too much trouble. The chefs even did an ensuite dinner for us that was way off the menu.Also very quiet at night. I will recommend it to anyone , and now won't stay anywhere else.              "
October 2015,Lovely atmosphere and location in Mayfair ,"Service is as you could expect in a top 5*hotel and you feel welcomed. Location is, if Mayfair is your destination, perfect! The rooms are delicate and the J suite spacious. If the temperature could have been lowered a bit in the room (some one turned the air conditioning off, before I return for the night) my sleep would have been perfect to. But it's definitely a hotel that I will return to. "
October 2015,Afternoon tea,"A real treat in a lovely setting  Very unstuffy service in the English tea room - lovely sandwiches - nice cakes, great earl grey tea. Only one downside  was a Victoria sponge that was burnt . Would go again but I pass on the spongee ne  that was Byrne  downside was "
October 2015,Too early? Too short!,"Arrived at short notice without a hotel and Brown's was available - what a gorgeous place to stay. Room wasn't ready (no surprise, the hotel was fully booked the night before) but I was seated in the cosy tea-room, and before I had finished my breakfast, the room was ready."
March 2015,Centrally located,"Central location great for shopping or hopping on the Tube. Very friendly staff. We had high tea in the restaurant, which was a great experience - they had a wonderful selection of teas. We stayed in a junior suite and found the accommodations to be quite enjoyable."
December 2015,Nice Hotel,"Full of tradition and a great welcome . Was somewhat disappointed with the room, nothing special and quite expensive for what it is, in fact a little tired in the bathroom. The bar was excellent with a good selection of drinks and food.  Great location, hence the price."
December 2015,Christmas Tea,"Had a wonderful Christmas Tea. Brown's Hotel is a London landmark. Impeccable service with attention to all the details. The atmosphere is sophisticated yet family friendly. The quality of the tea (finger sandwiches, scones and sweets) was exceptional.  Highly recommend! "
December 2015,Fabulous Browns Hotel,Beautiful quality hotel with an air of class set in a fabulous part of London. Well situated for fine shopping and dining. Staff courteous and welcoming at all time. Will Be returning to this hotel sometime soon. Five star.
December 2015,Classy Hotel,"Birthday lunch for two, early December.  Can't wait to return and stay over.  For me its all about style, ambience and service [good but not fussy], food comes second.  The trip began with a magical cab ride through Mayfair - this has got to be the best area to visit at ths time of year.  Claridges, which I almost booked looked spectacular.  Brown's however did not disappoint.  I'm a fan of the Endsleigh and Tresanton and although I was aware of the connection I didn't expect this hotel to feel quite so intimate and exclusive on arrival.  After an hour we reluctantly swapped the Donovan Bar for the dining room where the excellent service continued.  Highlights of the meal included the soda bread, the sides [delicious mash and creamed spinach] and the Sancere.  Prepare yourself…"
December 2015,Best location in London,Brown's is a legendary hotel in the best location in London. The staff and management are outstandingly helpful and friendly and go out of their way to make you comfortable. I cannot recommend the hotel more highly! Sebastian Taylor
December 2015,Fantastic 50th Birthday Celebration,"Fantastic team made our friends 50th Birthday extra special.   From the point of arrival and being greeted by the doorman, to a relaxed drink in the bar and then an exquisite meal at Hix - the entire evening, service and food was faultless. Nothing was too much trouble.  If you want somewhere extra special then this is the place to go! "
November 2015,perfection,"all aspects top notch. casual , understated luxury. simply wonderful.  feels like a home away from home. staff excellent.  extremely impressed with room, service , restaurants, bar, room service and facilities ( gym ). "
December 2015,Once again another perfect stay,"This was our second stay at Browns and we thoroughly enjoyed it. From the well appointed room, huge bathroom, quiet but central location, high level of service,  a lovely ambient bar, and the perfect breakfast, we couldn't have had a more perfect stay.  We will definitely stay here next time we are in town."
April 2015,Wonderful Anniversary Micro Break,"My husband and I stayed here to celebrate our wedding anniversary, a one night micro break!  The hotel staff were fantastic from start to finish.  When booking we mentioned we had stayed at Brown's for the first night of our honeymoon, 6 years ago and they couldn't have been more accommodating at having us back!   On arrival the door man greeted me by name (very slick!) reception staff were charming, we had a huge upgraded room, complimentary champagne and rose petals on our bed in the evening!  Superb customer service!   The bar is great for a pre dinner drink, really buzzy but intimate to get you in the mood on a Friday evening.  We shall definitely be returning for another anniversary micro break in April 2016! "
September 2015,The best Home from Home,"Our second time at Brown's and we were welcomed back by the friendly efficient staff. The service is top, the food beautiful. They do a top, popular afternoon tea. The concierge and doormen make you feel so at home and seem genuinely interested in what you are and have been doing. The room was most comfortable and the bathroom large with a proper shower!!"
November 2014,Elegance in the heart of London,"Stylish hotel in the most famous business ans shopping area in London. Perfect location, high quality service and great cocktails at the bar. Rooms are nice with old furniture. Part of famous boutique hotels chain. Prefer Hotel de Russie in Rome but this is an excellent hotel as well."
August 2015,How a Fine Hotel Should Be,"Brown's is one of a handful of hotels at the pinnacle of the accomodation business. Like it's sister establishment, The Savoy in Florence, the team at Brown's (and they are so obviously a team) provide a professional and friendly welcome, seamless service and concierge assistance, generous well-appointed rooms immaculately maintained, in a perfect location. All without fuss but with perfect aplomb.               "
August 2015,"5star, real Britisch, real London","Enjoyed two days at Brown's very much, what I've experienced was well above my expectations, excellent location too. Do not miss the Afternoon Tea and Spa. OK, what was negative? I've forgot and would love to return to this hotel."
September 2015,Convenience at its maximum,"Everything was extremely, convenient, supportive and friendly. This was my first time in the hotel and I am sure I will be back soon. Business trips through this accommodation become very easy and make you to wish to be back!"
September 2015,Understated luxury,"A fantastic hotel to experience London, a perfect location with perfect service. Rooms are understated but terrific. Breakfast and afternoon tea are fantastic.  Close walk or tube to most of the highlights of London in a nice quite setting.   "
August 2015,English charm,"We stayed here for our anniversary using our Avios and had a wonderful time. The decor was classy and comfortable with references to the Queen, Winston Churchill and Rudyard Kipling. It was convenient to get to, walking distance from Green Park and many restaurants and clubs.        "
August 2015,"Service, style - sublime","Of course the location is perfection for food, shopping and exercise - the magnificent Hyde Park in summer a minute away. But for privacy, attention to detail, unobtrusive but omnipresent service - this hotel rates on all fronts.Love that you don't bump into others in the corridors, that a quiet corner can be found in the bar if needed but another seat 10 meters away is on offer as well with a different vibe and audio.  And when the day is done sinking into the bed with pillows to die for, floor mat and slippers laid out, along with glass bottles of still and sparking mineral water sleep seems almost a waste of time. As we bade farewell to the doorman in tails as the car was brought up  - given bottles of water and a tin of traveller sweets for the journey we knew we had a new…"
August 2015,Fantastic Afternoon Tea,"At GBP55/head you cannot fault this afternoon tea. We booked and arrived a little ahead of time and were promptly shown to our table. The sandwiches and cakes just keep coming. The service from the staff is efficient and pleasant. In theory the booking is only for 90 minues, but we stayed on a little longer they continued to serve us with more3 cakes. The choice of teas is excpetional, and for non tea drinkers coffee is available. Much better value than some other nearby ritzy hotel."
August 2015,"Excellent, traditional style hotel","We booked a suite and were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was wonderful, especially as I was very unwell and retired to the bedroom allowing my partner to watch football and enjoy room service to his heart's delight.  The staff were excellent, even offering to send up some honey when they heard my croaky voice requesting more tea bags!  Breakfast was a lovely leisurely affair with the most spectacular buffet display and it was delicious.  My slight critique is that I prefer coffee to be served in an individual pot or cafetiere rather than poured from an albeit elegant, jug.  The whole vibe of the hotel is laid back luxuriousness and I hope I can return when I can really fully enjoy it"
September 2015,Want to be pampered?  Stay at Brown's!,A fabulous romantic retreat with wonderful service and exceptional staff! Nothing was too much trouble and we were made to feel so welcome.  I would whole-heartedly recommend this as a place to stay if you want a treat!              
October 2015,MARAVILLOSO!!! Outstanding service!!,"We stayed for our second honeymoon for 4 nights, everything was excellent starting from service, details, crew attention, food, and LOCATION! It is near everything you want to visit and crew sent us every night to the best restaurants at walking distance. Very nice experience 👍"
October 2015,Low key,"Small, low key, great location, good service. I have stayed here before but didn't appreciate it as much. Probably my top pick in Mayfair--no bling, simple. Room was reasonable size with a very good bathroom. Espresso machine in room would be welcome. B&O TV should be replaced with a newer Samsung that swivels. House keeping did a sloppy job initially but management addressed the issue immediately and gave me a free upgrade."
September 2015,Out of this world,Brown's Hotel offers something different than other hotels in London -peace and tranquility but only 2 minutes away from all the action! The staff are amazing and nothing is too much trouble. I adore breakfast in the restaurant every time I visit. After a visit to the theatre we always go to Donavan's bar in the hotel and can not praise the staff enough. Already planning my next visit.
September 2015,Perfect location,Loved the Hotel. Staff were excellent and provided a faultless service. The building itself was stylish and well appointed. Breaks at was good and the staff in the bar very helpful. Would happily stay again.
April 2015,Our first Afternoon Tea experience could not have been better,"Me and my friends visited Browns on my trip to London during Easter Holidays and as this was our first time experiencing genuine English Afternoon Tea and we were very pleased of our choice of place. We opted for their Tea-Tox Afternoon Tea menu, which seemed interesting. When we requested staff for re-fill of sandwiches, they told as that at that moment kitchen was making new Tea-Tox sandwiches but they could bring us the regular sandwiches and some traditional scones in addition and of course we were happy to try them as well. Also, staff was kind enough to suggest if we would like to try a different type of tea (and of course we were not hard to persuade) ;): Only one hick-up during our setting was that, i guess we over stay our booking little bit and we were kind of…"
July 2015,A great place to stay in london,"Great location, great food and accommodation. We really enjoyed our stay at Brown's. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we will definitely go back to Brown's. The hotel is near a myriad of great restaurants and shops."
September 2015,Outstanding/pristine hotel for short ( or even long ) business trips,"Nothing else except that this is a true gem in Mayfair. Great team of staff, made my stay very enjoyable. Very central location, ideal for visiting London. Will visit again. The beds were so comfortable I felt like I was on a cloud. Nice breakfast selection too."
September 2015,Excellent Location Great Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel twice with family great service comfortabl rooms excellent location near to best store resturant very distinguished location. Rooms are decorated elegantly very well maintained clean spacious bathroom shower and bath tub included. Rooms get prepared for night as well.  Breakfast is rich satisfying and delgious. Specially if you get English breakfast. Very close to Bond street , Picadilly street, Ragent street, and Oxford street. It is at cross road. Walking distance to all of the above. Room service is fast and friendly. At the door they are very helpful to find taxi. Good concierge service ."
July 2015,Exquisite,"You know you are at a premium hotel in Mayfair when the porter brings up your bags and says, ""Would you like me to unpack for you, Madame?""  The level of service; the location; and the demeanor and attention of the staff at Brown's cannot be exceeded. I had the full English breakfasts each day, tea in the afternoon, and lunch one day as well during my stay. All were terrific. The neighborhood is fun for walking and window shopping, but mostly, it was the graciousness of the staff and the hotel itself that I loved so much.  I have to confess, I wish they had not updated the rooms to the very modern '70's retro. The washroom was wonderful, but the decorating in the bedrooms is not to my taste anymore. I loved the timeless, old world, traditional antiques and am afraid this new…"
July 2015,Sandy,"Great experience. First visit they had our room ready after a long flight. Very friendly front desk concerie bellmen housekeeping, everyone could not have been more friendly. All amnentities were great, the Ron service was. Wry efficient              "
July 2015,Cherry on the Cake!,Staying at Brown's Hotel was the icing on a wonderful weekend in London celebrating our silver wedding anniversary. Levels of service and attention were excellent throughout.  Champagne afternoon tea is a must!       
July 2015,A great watering hole when we are in London,"When we go to London, we always find time to pop into the Donavan Bar for a drink.the welcome from the staff manning the front door, walking into the lounge and in the bar is first class. The service in the bar is excellent.msee you very soon."
July 2015,Excellent,"Room was very comfortable and modern, the staff are what you expect from a fine hotel. The hotel is centrally located. Great value considering how steep London hotels cost in general A hotel I certainly will come back."
July 2015,Iconic splendour,We have returned to Browns and are staying in one of their jn suites. It is well appointed with a spacious feel. The bed is very large and extremely comfortable. The bathroom surpassed our expectations with it's amenities. The hotel itself feels like a home away from home. They really do make you feel as though you are family. I think that is the best thing about the place! This is a very classy establishment and we're very pleased to have the pleasure of staying here. We will certainly stay again! Thank you so very much to all the wonderful staff who do such a terrific job at making guests feel so at home!
August 2014,Great Location Nice Hotel,The service was very good with a friendly team. The location was great and close to shopping area and other attractions but on a quiet street.  Rooms were excellent and up to date. Great value considering how steep London hotels cost  in general.
July 2015,Exceptional Service!,"Wonderful hotel; exceptional service. Excellent food and beverage the Bar and Tea Room.  Concierge services far exceeded our expectations.  Fitness center was average, but everything else was top of the line.                     "
July 2015,Birthday afternoon tea ,"Three of us went, it was for all our birthdays, the hotel is lovely, had dinner there 12 years ago, even nicer now. Service was really good, as good as the ritz. Really nice choice of sandwiches and cakes, hot scones were nice too. They bring you more of everything so rat up. Lovely room to sit in modern art doesn't really go it's a shame, but still go really chilled out afternoon, they don't rush you your not on the clock like you feel you are at the ritz , will go again .  "
June 2015,Superb Hotel!!,"I loved everything about this hotel - from the location, the beauty, the pub and restaurant and the extremely accommodating, super friendly staff.  Any staff I encountered always greeted me by name and they were very helpful with anything our group needed or asked.  I highly recommend this hotel if your budget allows."
May 2015,Old building has to reinvent itself...,"I have booked a Junior Suite at The Brown's and felt a bit disappointed by the room: nice size, comfortable but a bit dated in need of refurbishment. The bathroom is convenient with shower, bathtube, nice bathroom amenities and bright thanks to a window over the courtyard.  The carpet in the room was not soft enough to walk in without slippers, the TV is not well oriented and just front a big picture, odd design! Little small touches are missing...  My rating goes to the staff, really professional from front desk, bar to housekeeping, Thank you!  The Brown's is a nice property but facing the hard competition in London, it must innovate to stand out!"
September 2015,Excellent service,"Great team of staff, made my stay very enjoyable.  Very central location, idea for visiting London.  Will visit again.  Only thing I do not like is our bed was made up by two single beds, could be better if it was one proper bed                                   "
July 2015,Great Afternoon Tea,"Booked Afternoon Tea for a treat for my wife and I.  My wife has several dietary requirements and we explained these requirements on booking.  We were pretty dubious before booking as to whether they'd be able to accommodate her.  We could not have been more pleased when they brought out her 3 tiered afternoon tea stand, she had gluten free sandwiches, and cakes, scones and chocolates.  The selection of teas were very interesting.  The service was very good and we felt as if we'd stepped back in time and we felt very special.  The decor is very in keeping with the classic hotel, and the atmosphere is very welcoming. Would definitely book again and recommend to others."
September 2015,Afternoon Tea,"My husband and I stayed at Brown's Hotel some years ago and could not rate the hotel highly enough!  This time we booked afternoon tea there for our 30th wedding anniversary.  The experience was so enjoyable.  Staff are trained to the highest standard and could not be more helpful.  The afternoon tea was like no other with an abundance of treats. We started with a glass of pink champagne as the occasion was special. The smoked salmon was the best I have ever had. Before we enjoyed the most delicious cakes warm scones arrived with jam and cream.  These are baked fresh every 20 minutes and we actually had a second helping!  We finished the cakes and were completely full, unable to eat anything else on offer.  They even gave us a cake box with two large portions of gateaux to take…"
September 2015,Excellent experience,"Our recent stay at Brown's Hotel was a fabulous experience.  Their staff are their best asset right through the hotel from the reception we received on arrival, checkin, house keeping and the restaurant staff.  Special mention to the concierge team for their help also.  I cannot speak highly enough of all the staff we encountered during our stay.  This hotel seems homely and inviting and not intimidating in it's atmosphere.  We will definitely be back!"
October 2014,Very Nice Hotel,Stayed here for a weekend and enjoyed the visit. The restaurant is very nice and breakfast and lunch was excellent with good service throughout the hotel. Nice bar with good snacks if you only want a light meal.
September 2015,Perfect for any occasion,Attention to detail was second to none. Mentioned it was our 20th wedding anniversary and later on received a plate of delicious cakes delivered to our room! A wonderful hotel in a fantastic location!
August 2015,Wins the prize for kid-friendliness!,"We've travelled extensively with our baby in her first 6 months.  Just to give you an idea, she's already clocked almost 25k miles on British Airways alone.  As you can imagine, that also means we stay in a lot of hotels with her.  We can definitively say that Brown's has been the best and most pleasant stay we've had.    One of the first few things we have to do when we arrive at any hotel room is set up the nappy changing station because there's a good chance the baby's been sitting in a very soiled diaper no matter how well you timed the previous diaper change.  That wasn't a problem for us at Brown's because the lovely Housekeeping staff have already set up a changing station replete with a few nappies, wet wipes, and baby oil/nappy rash cream at the ready.  If things…"
September 2015,Great Hotel,"This Hotel not only is one of the oldest hotels in London but still provide excellent service, in the Hotel, restaurant & Spa. All the staff are very helpful nothing to much trouble. The Donovan Bar for cocktails is just amazing, a must if your staying at Browns. The Hix restaurant is also excellent, with a very good choice on the a la carte menu & also a greasy selection of wines to choose from.  Thank you it's always a great experience stopping at Browns. "
September 2015,Afternoon tea at Brown's,"We only had afternoon tea here, but enjoyed the atmosphere, the service and the excellent food.  I had never had scones with jam and clotted cream before, not a recommended menu for anyone with heart disease!  The finger sandwiches were yummy, as were the tiny desserts.  I tried two different types of tea; both were good but I am not a big tea drinker in the best of circumstances and wanted to try the ""total experience"".  Was good but rather pricey."
October 2014,I love it,One of my favourites from more than thirty years. Confortable rooms and bathrooms. Junior suites are excellent. Tea time is absolutely as it has to be: traditional and cosy. Perfect location. Bepi Olivieri
July 2014,A Favourite,"Brown's Hotel is a favourite in London for location (convenient to tube, Fortnum and Mason and restaurants), service (classic and just the kind I like without being over the top) and I enjoy the 24 hour fitness gym (some hotels have huge gyms that are not open when one needs them to be or that are pushy with time-wasting - and money wasting - spa services but this is just the basics but well maintained. Restaurant is decent and I've enjoyed some classics including grouse, good Burgundy and more. Also enjoy walking in and out of the Royal Academy because of the changing nature of the place."
June 2015,Visit to London,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to London.  The Brown's Hotel was so welcoming.  We have stayed in London before, but The Brown's Hotel was the best.  The room was so comfortable.  The hotel is newly remodeled and the attention to detail is so very thoughtful.  We were warmly greeted by George upon arrival with a handshake.  And he was always available at the front door to welcome us.  Givi was friendly and took care of our luggage and was there to help us as well.  The concierge recommended wonderful restaurants for dining and took care of our reservations.  We also enjoyed the young man at Donovan's Bar and I regret to have forgotten his name.  I hope his back has gotten better.  But he will prepare the finest cocktails to your liking.  The entire staff at The Brown's was…"
June 2015,Loved,I was staying at this hotel for a Louis Vuitton advent in new Bond Street it was a 2min walk. This hotel is so central you can walk to everything. I just loved this hotel I have stayed many times in London but this is the best hotel the staff are so so helpful and friendly they go out of there way to help you. I also had breakfast which was very good I loved the orange juice it was so good better the Florida !! I really can't wait to go back. Thank you for looking after me x
June 2015,Business & Pleasure,Had a wonder four-day stay combining business and pleasure. Everything was top notch for business and very welcoming for my family. Thank you to everyone we encountered at Brown's. We will be back...!       
June 2015,Gluten free afternoon tea,Upon arrival we received a warm welcome directing us to the very glamorous English Tea Room. We were shown to our table and sandwiches and pastries were brought out with a our selected tea - most delicious gluten free food including scones - great way to spend the afternoon :)
May 2015,"Matchless Charm, Gorgeous Decor and Wonderful Staff. Browns is unique.","I arrived a couple of hours earlier than my wife and was immediately greeted by Johnny who opened the taxi door and took my luggage. It almost seems telepathic, the staff's uncanny ability to know your name as soon as you enter this beautiful Hotel. Johny was an absolute gentleman and he set the tone for what was to be a memorable two night stay. What is so special about this hotel is that it is not simply a case of one or two highly trained and motivated members of staff making up for the apathy of others, you often meet in other, less memorable hotels. At Browns, they are all incredibly professional, charming and helpful and the main thing that sets them apart from other establishments, is that they manage such high levels of service without being stuffy or superior. It is as…"
June 2015,Green Park Grandeur,A haven of calm behind Picadilly to repair to and relax. Tried this for the first time for a weekend break in London and was not disappointed. Bedroom and Bathroom were excellent although for me the bed was too soft so ask for a board if you dont like soft beds! (One was offered when I mentioned this on my departure. In room dining and restaurant were superlative.
June 2015,excellent review,"I think that Brown's provides quality service with an attentive staff who are most helpful and pleasant. The porters are terrific, and the various concierges are responsive and eager to help. I am always eager to return.                     "
July 2014,Timeless classic,When you walk into Browns you automatically feel apart of history.  I did visit many years ago. And feel in love with this hotel. The history itself dates back many hundred years. The food is out of this world. The atmosher is simply great.  A must visit for people who deserve the best. 
June 2015,Modern charm,"I was a guest originally over 30 years ago and had fond memories. I was not disappointed to revisit. Mayfair is the place to be and Browns remains the place to stay. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have experienced. This is a classy, timeless hotel."
January 2015,"Great Location, Great Service!","I highly recommend Brown's, the service was great, location perfect and the rooms are cozy/modern. It's infraestruture it's very london syle. The restaurant serves great food. The only inconvenience would be its cost."
June 2015,Very good hotel in the heart of London.,"From our arrival, when staff appeared from the hotel to help with our luggage, until we left for the airport, with luggage already loaded, the staff at Brown's made the visit rather special. Nothing was too much trouble, and making this a home from home was the objective, and it was well achieved. Hix Restaurant provided an excellent breakfast, and when we decided to dine there, again it was wholesome, well cooked, prepared and served. Room was comfortable, and the hotel has character - loads of it! I have a feeling that we'll be back......"
June 2015,Excellent hotel,"Nice and cosy. Well located near bond street. Service is really excellent Rooms are rather nice but some are bigger than others also views will depend.  First time I had a nice street view , the following trip I had a view in the internal court (more noisy)   Hotel more for business than family  "
June 2015,anniversary break,"I don't write reviews very often, but wanted to after a nice relaxing break at Browns Hotel.  Set away from the hustle and bustle of London's Piccadilly but very centrally located, Browns Hotel is old with a twist of modernity to keep it up to date with other hotels in its class.  The staff were very attentive and made you feel special, without being too pushy.  We were made to feel very special and all our requests were swiftly accommodated. Thank you to the bar manager who saved us a lovely table for my sister in law to enjoy a birthday cocktail.  Many thanks."
May 2015,Great hotel in London,I think Browns is the best hotel option in Mayfair. Great atmosphere. The concierge desk is the best I've experienced anywhere. They gave fantastic recommendations for dining and shows and very efficient to get us reservations in tough places              
May 2015,First Rate in Mayfair,"This is a wonderful hotel, reputedly the oldest in London. Comprised of a series of adjacent townhouses the rooms have been redone in a contemporary manner - spacious bedrooms and sitting rooms and luxurious bathrooms! The staff is super -very attentive and friendly. Bond St. shops are right round the corner and Buckingham Palace is a short stroll through Green Park. Not cheap but well worth the money! I'd stay here again in a second!"
May 2015,"Excellent atmosphere, style and location","Excellent place to stay in London - a true luxury hotel with a very personal touch and atmosphere. Great rooms with very good facilities, including large bathrooms. Staff is outstanding, and always helpful and smiling.       "
June 2015,Understated luxury in the heart of London,"Myself and my partner have been fortunate enough to stay at this amazing hotel twice before in the last 18 months so we were looking forward to this, our third stay. There was simply nothing to disappoint. People are so important in every industry, none moreso than the hospitality sector and so I feel its important to highlight just how friendly, professional and helpful all the staff at Browns are, or certainly have been in our experience. From check in to dining, to seeking help, nothing is too much trouble. The room is incredibly stylish, the bed wonderfully comfortable and all those little touches like the quality of bedlinen, the discreet lighting, the decor and an amazing bathroom, just take the strain out of travelling and make you want to linger here longer than your…"
May 2015,Superb,"Browns is a wonderful home whilst in London. I love this hotel, the bar, Hix and the staff who cannot do enough assist. Its stylish and familial at the same time. From specially mixed cocktails to the kippers at breakfast you will enjoy every minute."
May 2015,Great hotel,This is a great hotel near Bond Street and fFortnum and Masons and Libertys . Food is excellent and rooms large and very clean with great bathrooms . Staff are very pleasant and go out of there way to be helpful . I will definitely stay there again
July 2015,A wonderful afternoon tea,"A return visit to Browns of Mayfair for my husband and myself and in the company of Australian friends for their first visit.  A wonderful array of teas from which to choose and for one, vegetarian sandwiches, replenished immediately and just at the right time, our lovely warm scones with strawberry jam and clotted cream.   The savoury delights were just right and we each enjoyed a glass of champagne to make the afternoon extra special.  Staff here are always welcoming and attentive and we love the gesture of two small bags of our chosen teas to take away with us.   Our friends were charmed.  Highly recommended."
July 2015,Wonderful hotel,Had a great experience at your hotel!   Wonderful staff!!!  Great location to walk to everything!!!   Would highly recommend the browns !!!   Will be back soon!!!  Thank you and your great staff for a great experience !!!
August 2015,What an experience,"We went to Brown's for afternoon tea and what an experience it was. Haven't been to many five star hotels to compare it with but boy do they do service, friendliness and attention.  Our waitress was looking after two tables and was hugely attentive and  provided brilliant service. But, not only that she was very welcoming and friendly, really interested in us and also gave a little of herself discussing her native Italy. She was excellent We then went into the bar and the same can be said of the staff there, really good service and welcoming. A special mention too to the head doorman who greeted us like a long lost friend Brown's also has a great feel about it, traditional, mature and comfortable. I guess all this is what you pay for! We've had more flavoursome afternoon teas…"
August 2015,Amazing Browns,"I was a bit dubious about staying here.  Not because its the oldest hotel in London or because it looks quite fancy (I've stayed in plenty of those) but because I was under the impression that it was a bit ""up itself"".  I could not have been more wrong! Browns is a wonderful hotel, homely and charming with wondrous staff who simply cannot do enough for you during your stay.  We were given a couple of nights bed and breakfast by a friend and had sort of put off the visit, choosing the seemingly less intimidating One Aldwych or The Metropolitan on trips to London but the voucher end date was coming close and we really didn't want to waste them.    From the moment I contacted the hotel to book, they could not have been more helpful Joana and Francisca on reservations were very…"
September 2014,An institution in St-James,"I have been since 15 years. I like the location and the dual entrance. You can walk to hyde park, do shopping and go to piccadilly /Soho in the evening. The room are quiet and with full amenities. excellent service. Tea-time is an institution here and you need to book during the Weekend."
July 2015,Great Afternoon Tea,We had high tea at this Hotel and it was fantastic. We made a mistake and made the booking for the day before and the staff were very helpful and were able to seat us very quickly despite use mixing up the dates. The food was high quality and very filling. We had a great afternoon tea. 
July 2015,Intimate setting.  Attentive service.,"On a quiet street, within walking distance to the finest shopping and attractions in London.  Feels like a large, private home, offering exceedingly warm, yet unobtrusive service. Room service arrives quickly, and is served beautifully.  A true English classic.       "
July 2015,Quintessential Brown's Hotel,Excellent location in Mayfair with some of the most friendly and helpful staff I have come across in a hotel.  The bar is lively and does great cocktails and I would also recommend Hix for lunch or dinner. 
July 2015,Outstanding in every way!,"Our experience couldn't have been any better! From start to finish the food, service and general experience was of a very high standard. The room was spotless and had a great view over Dover St and we were given a fantastic upgrade which was much appreciated. I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone."
August 2015,Fantabulous service...,"I've never waited for an ironing board less time...the service is really quite exceptional...ironing board on....the rooms are spacious and appointed in a sophisticated way.   The location is  great for London visits and getting to and from the City.  All the rooms are different and they are helpful for making changes....I'm an a/c freak, Browns gets a top score for getting the room ice box cold.   With this hotel you get what you pay for."
August 2015,Perfect Location,"Lovely London icon. Location can't be beat for walking and shopping. Excellent service and attention, only wish the rooms would match the 5 star treatment. They are comfortable, but could be so much more."
August 2015,Classy and so comfortable with assured friendly service,"We stayed at Brown's for a birthday celebration for 2 nights. We arrived 10am and chanced asking if our room might be available ahead of normal check-in time, and the lovely front desk lady arranged this in 15 minutes - great start! Our spacious bedroom was spotlessly clean with lovely luxurious amenities and the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in, superlight duvet as well. We went out for the day to return to a lovely birthday cake from the hotel, such a nice touch. Concierge chaps Jack and Amr were just fabulous, asking all the right questions and more importantly listening, to home in on what would turn out to be perfect choices in restaurants and exhibitions for us, this made our stay very enjoyable. Breakfast was delicious with good choices and the staff were very…"
August 2015,Excellent hotel in great location,This hotel and staff and service are great. I do not know the rooms other than the Deluxe suite which is great. The location is great for shopping and taxis are readily available for sightseeing. The only disappointment is The Hix Dining.
August 2015,One word.......AMAZING.,"Stayed this weekend for a business trip and all I can say is I was treated like royalty from start to finish. Stayed in room 221, first class to say the least. The staff on arrival, throughout the weekend, breakfast staff, doormen, porters, just everyone..... you are all a credit to the hotel.  I can't wait to return again soon."
May 2015,Quintessentially English with a fabulous cocktail bar," really lovely cocktail bar and great sharing menu. Must go back for dinner. The staff are delightful, decor and ambiance are gorgeous. This is the place to go for afternoon tea. Quintessentially English."
August 2015,Excellent,"Fantastic hotel in a fantastic location. Close to Piccadilly and just around the corner from Old Bond Street , this is close to all the designer shops and many restaurants  The hotel has a great bar and offers afternoon tea and although we didn't use the restaurant , it looked ideal"
August 2015,Lunch at the Hix restaurant,"We treated ourselves to lunch to celebrate our wedding anniversary as we very much liked the look of the menu. We had the three course set menu and it was absolutely delicious, not too heavy and very tasty. Service was excellent with lots of staff around and we were presented with a complimentary plate of cakes to go with our coffee afterwards in honour of the occasion! The hotel is beautiful, quite old-fashioned and atmospheric, but with some good modern art in the very comfortable dining room. All in all a very enjoyable outing."
August 2015,"Perfect Hotel, Perfect Location","I don't write a lot of reviews, but this place deserves one.  The property is excellent.  The rooms are clean, VERY quiet and the beds give a reason to sleep in.  It's also great that they have a tea room, bar and full restaurant, each of which is excellent.  (The bar has some of the most innovative cocktails that I've seen).  The location is great for everything, as well.  But the best part is easily the staff.  Wow.  Everyone from the concierge, to valets to doormen, etc.  Just A+.    I live in hotels and due to business many times find myself at much pricier hotels around the world, but never a better experience than this one."
August 2015,Pedicure,"Visited the spa on 14th August and was greeted by Kelly-Anne. She was delightful and gave me a lovely pedicure. I was almost tempted by the mojito pedicure but am looking forward to the the winter season when they have mulled wine, a real fun idea."
August 2015,Friends Birthday celebration - Afternoon Tea,"Had Afternoon Tea with friends on Sunday 16th August, 2015 Very nice, bit disappointed with the lack of smoked salmon in the sandwiches. Instead they provided a kind of salmon mousse in Bridge rolls, which just ok. Also the scones are very small and tend to break up. Everything is replenished, there is plenty to eat. Lovely venue, we were sat on a corner sofa, plenty of room and comfortable. Service was ok, did struggle at times to understand the waiter, but he was very pleasant. Would recommend because overall it is very good, but could improve in my view as mentioned above."
July 2015,Afternoon tea,"Afternoon tea treat for my husband. A delicious selection of sandwiches and sweets. The scones are delicately soft and chewy. The staff are attentive and kind. Slightly disappointed in other ""guests"" not making an effort to dress smartly. One person in a hoodie and another in tatty jeans and trainers! Come on people. Give afternoon tea the credit it deserves.  Tea at Browns was a lovely experience that I would highly recommend!"
July 2015,Perfect,"Absolutely first class experience from check-in to (reluctant) check-out.  Browns is the friendliest and most efficient hotel at which we have ever stayed in London, and its location could not be surpassed for our particular requirements.        "
July 2015,"Browns Hotel, Mayfair",Browns meets all 5 star expectations and the location is excellent. The breakfast offering is a delight and the table service first thing in the morning is a great way to start the day. It makes a difference when key staff know your name and greet you with it every time.        
July 2015,Perfect hotel... and keeps getting better and better!,"This was my third time at Brown's with my family for a relatively long stay (about 15 nights) and I have to say this excellent hotel keeps getting better and better! Rooms are spacious and the decor is extremely pleasant - classic with some modern touches. All rooms I have stayed so far looked like brand new, recently refurbished. Location is perfect for tourism or business. Therefore, in terms of the physical aspects of the hotel, Brown's is clearly a 10! It deserves to be mentioned that the hotel prepared some nice touches for the kids - books, toys, special bed linen, everything specially designed for kids. Even a special ginger biscuit with my son's name on it was there waiting for us! However, the real difference you feel in the hotel services. The staff is AMAZING! Doormen…"
July 2015,A lovely stay,"I have stayed at this hotel previously but not for a couple of years and it was great to go back.  My wife and I arrived on a very wet Friday night to be met by the very friendly doorman who has been working at Browns for years. We had booked an Executive Room for two nights and we were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was lovely. My only criticisms was that drinks in the hotel are exorbitant for example for a jug of Pimm's & Lemonade I was charged £96.  My wife and I also ate in the hotel restaurant Hix on the Saturday night and we both had a very disappointing meal not helped by the restaurant Manager who had attitude and reminded me of the lead actor in Faulty Towers having a rude moment with customers, perhaps dealing with customers is not his strong point and he needs to…"
January 2015,Wow!,If you are looking for a hotel in London I defiantly suggest Browns hotel. Here's why first of all the service is splendid. They are so kind to everyone and it is a great hotel for grown ups and children. When we came back to the hotel they had baked ginger bread cookies with our names on them. They also have a library and more. The rooms are great perfect for a stay in London. I recommend Browns hotel for sure.
July 2015,Old school charm,I have only ever used the bar here but the staff are great such a friendly escape from the hustle and bustle  It's a great place to meet people have a nice drink I must allow more time to go to the restaurant next visit
July 2015,Wonderful hotel!,"This is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Mayfair. Great service, nicely decorated and superb experience! We decided to stay here as we also had a similiar experience in Berlin at Hotel Rome. Don't miss!       "
December 2014,Classic character downstairs upstairs a surprise!,"I have put off writing this review to try to consider my feelings which are mixed. We have known the pubic areas of Brown's for many years and consider it a favourite in London for afternoon tea, Brunch, a drink or a pop in. The staff and service is superb. We stayed a couple of nights last December as a surprise for my husband's 60th birthday. The downstairs stuff was divine as ever including afternoon tea with surprise guests and brunch with more. I was terribly disappointed with the room though. It was huge which was great and the bathroom was also large and well appointed, But it was horribly over-modernised and corporate and frankly reminded me in style of a Premier Inn which was so different to the lovely clubby wooden traditional feel of downstairs that it was a shock.…"
June 2015,When only the best will do.,"Browns Hotel in Mayfair reaches that level. From the time you walk in the front door until you leave, you are treated as someone special. Nothing is too much trouble.  Share that special moment at the Hotel they will not let you down.       "
December 2014,Fantastic Service,"Great location. Fantastic, extremely helpful service by every member of staff. Nice little touches such as providing some toys for infants and a ginger bread man with the child’s name on it. The major drawback is the size of the room. We were upgraded to allow enough space for a baby cot and whilst it was perfectly fine, it was more Paris size than London size."
March 2015,Hats off  to Brown's Hotel in London,"Hats off, old school polished hotellerie, in a refreshingly historical cum contemporary ambience, made more notable by comfortably competent and friendly (yet not too familiar) staff...this is why we respect and need to keep old school hotellerie legacy alive."
February 2015,Great calm place ,"I enjoyed my stay in this hotel a lot. Big room, very quiet, great location. The staff was very friendly. I appreciated their assistance during my stay. It is a great choice for private as well as business trips. There are many restaurants and shopping possibilities around"
April 2015,superb,"We went to the Browns restaurant for afternoon tea , and when we got there they had reserved the seat that Agatha Christie was supposed to have sat in to gather info for the famous books  we had a lovely time the food the teas, the scones and fresh cream and preserves not to forget the service not fussy at all but so good , they even offered for us to take cakes home , had we been going home we most definitely have taken some  next time in London as we love afternoon tea this is where we will come  thank you all  we did not get names of who served us sorry you made us very welcome  Marion and John"
February 2015,Exquisite,"My wife's grandfather used to stay at Brown's Hotel 50 years ago, and although it's no longer £5/night, it's maintained its old world charm with a contemporary elegance that renders it exquisite. As soon as u step out of the taxi, you're welcomed at the curbside by the liveried staff and whisked inside. Subdued elegance, a cozy bar, nooks and crannies for sitting and people watching, and an elegant restaurant complete the picture. A very helpful and friendly staff are expected at a hotel of this level, but what surprised me was the consistency of wonderful service, from the check in desk to the bellman who brought our bags, all were professional and helpful. The room was spacious, elegantly appointed with a sexy bathroom and soft towels. The extra chocolate truffles were the…"
April 2015,Nice hotel with an excellent staff and great location,"Loved the location in Mayfair.  We walked to our West End shows and the museums, and the Green Park tube stop is a couple of blocks away.  We had two interior rooms on the fourth floor, a Classic and an Executive. They were both decent size, the Executive obviously a bit bigger with a sitting area.  The furnishings are sturdy and rather plain, with neutral colors.  The bed was comfortable. No view, which was okay with us.  I always travel with earplugs but didn't need them. The only noise I heard was people occasionally clomping down the hallway outside. Complimentary bottles of water and apples were replenished every day. The Classic bathroom had a tub/shower combination, the Executive a separate shower and tub. We quickly discovered that the tub and shower floors are very…"
April 2015,A Magical Wedding Day,"Words cannot do justice to our fabulous experience at Brown’s hotel during our wedding last week!  With less than 48 hours before our wedding ceremony and after months of planning, our original venue notified us they were unable to host our wedding due to the major fire and power-outage which impacted much of Central London last week. However, Brown’s came to our rescue and just hours after we met with the wonderful staff at Brown’s, our worries were alleviated as they swept into action to plan our special day.  We were initially met with the kind of professional and pro-active attitude you might expect from a luxury hotel such as Brown’s. However we soon found out that the service was much more than that. We were truly made to feel special throughout our entire stay, with a…"
June 2014,Great location and in house dining for foodies,"I have never stayed here before however our Daughter who was working in London at the time said ""There is a truly great looking hotel just over the road from where she was staying"" so we booked and I have to say it was fabulous. Our room was a little on the small side but more than adequate, but the star of the show is the restaurant downstairs, you must go, we did on our last night and it was superb, you never eat in your hotel do you as you feel that it is just too local. Trust me you will not regret it make sure that you book however when you first arrive as lots of people who are not residents of the hotel eat there"
April 2015,Amazing,"I attended a wedding reception at this venue.  The reception should have been held at another hotel, but due to a power cut caused by an electrical fire, the reception had to be moved.  Browns worked with the other venue  and with only 36 hours notice, arranged a perfect reception for approximately 45 people.  The food, hospitality and staff were amazing.  The hotel stunning and the dedication to make the day perfect was truly outstanding.  One person, Sebastian (a Manager I believe), was just a credit to the hotel, I was amazed at his ability to ensure that everything was done, at the right time, by the right people and still managed to assist wherever he was needed.  Well done Brown's I hope that I will be able to find a reason to come and stay at this wonderful tasteful hotel."
March 2015,Stunning luxury boutique hotel in Mayfair,"I went for a weekend with my boyfriend and absolutey everything was SPOT ON - We were delighted by all the staff attention and lovely details. They made us feeling welcome and valued guests at all times. Rooms were bright with large windows so lots of natural light, and very big for London standards.  The style is contemporary but nothing too edgy, therefore classy and suitable for everyone. Great location to top it all up, heart of Mayfair, walking distance to Piccadilly and Trafalgar, next to Green Park - you are in the very heart of London!"
July 2015,The essential London!,The Brown's Hotel is quintessential London. It does not have a herd mentality or the snobbery found at many chain 4 and 5 star hotels. There is a personal touch to everything they do there. The location could not be any better. It is now my absolute favorite hotel in London. Impeccable hospitality and attention to detail no matter now large or small the issue.
May 2015,Best Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel twice and I plan on staying there again, as I visit London more frequently to view houses for when I move there in August. The Lobby is really pretty and the rooms are stunning as well. It also has a restaurant, which gives you the full London experience"
November 2014,No. 1 Hotel in London for us,"My Husband & I stayed at Browns Hotel in London for 2 nights over the Bank Holiday weekend.  This was a gift to us for our Ruby Wedding Anniversary.  The Hotel upgraded us to a Junior Suite which was amazing.  We sat over breakfast on our last morning trying to think of one negative point about this Hotel & its Staff.  There was NOTHING we could think of. The place and its Staff were immaculate with nothing out of place.  This being the sort of Hotel that’s really out of our league we thought we might be out of our depth but every member of Staff were kind, courteous & helpful.  They made us feel so welcome.  Every little thing to make our stay enjoyable was done with the minimum of fuss.  It is in the perfect spot to explore the West End of London.  If you are staying in London…"
May 2015,London Experience,The Browns Hotel is everything you imagine when you think about London! Excelent service and location!! Friendly and  professional staff and in the heart of Mayfair.  My favourite hotel in London so far.              
May 2015,"True English hospitality , staff that aim to exceed your expectations & a fine five stars accommodation",The staff & management are the key factor for making my staying as pleasant as it was .. the way they look after details really impressed me. The accommodation itself was nice. The attitude of the hotel exceeded my expectation .. they offered many complementary things .  Love the hotel & love the staff  
May 2015,Browns hotel London's luxury friendly,"I stayed here recently on business and it was a 5 star luxury experience without the unfriendly staff you can often encounter in premium hotel properties. The location is perfect, staff wonderful and food was delicious. The bar is also a cool little hideaway perfect for important but intimate business meetings or drinks with friends.       "
May 2015,Very British and stylish in London,"A true taste English culture ! Located in Mayfair, and just moments away from the famed Bond Street boutiques, Dover Street Market. I very much enjoy the Rocco Forte collection hotels especially for their elegance; modernity and style. the room was perfect with Wi-Fi, interactive entertainment, iPod docking stations as well as bathrooms in Bush hammered limestone and more... The service is indeed outstanding. Must try the traditional tea experience...so British !! and Mark Hix restaurant that cooks a perfect modern British cuisine."
May 2015,London Hotels at their best,"A lovely stay at Brown's - intimate top class hotel, Arriving was perfect and no hassle with the Doorman taking care of our car. Gorgeous room and service as always was exceptional. Professional but personal service and a stunning building and location thank you       "
May 2015,wonderful hotel,"My wife and I experienced a wonderful stay at Brown's Hotel. As I heve been satying at Brown's for more then 40 Years It is allways a place where I feel coming back home. The only downside ist the outdated air conditioning system in the guetsroom. It can not be adjusted properly -  a strong draft flows troughout the room - therefore I did catch a cold after the third night. Unfortunately windows can not be opened. And if, you are faced with the steet noise ! "
April 2015,Best of the Best,"We just completed our second stay in less than a month. Superb service, excellent food, classic England comes to life. The concierge can make almost anything happen and the bellmen and valets provide a one of a kind service. Our rooms were well appointed and very quiet. We have stayed here in the past and will always stay here in the future. Central location to everything you want to do. "
June 2015,charming and well located,"We just spent about a week at Brown's. Service was impeccable. The concierges are fantastic and pleasant. The bar/tea room was quaint and lovely. You could navigate from the hotel and do quite a lot without even having to take the ""tube"". Breakfast buffet was very nice in the HIX restaurant. I would stay away from having a real meal in the restaurant though as we found the food mediocre and expensive. Our room was spacious and had a very large bathroom with two sinks and a shelf to set up private toilet articles. Sadly the room was not as ""charming"" as I had hoped and was a bit ""motel like"" in decoration. Nice touch: a series of interesting books in the room! Great shoe shine service free of charge. Not sure what other rooms were like. We had a day and a half without the…"
June 2015,Disappointing High Tea,"We went to Brown's with high expectations for a truly authentic and stunning London High Tea experience.  All started off well, and fell apart as the experience continued.  We paid for an upcharge for a champagne tea for two. After our cake was served, we were left alone for half an hour with dirty plates on our table that we had not touched for that half hour, as well as empty tea pots and champagne glasses.  Finally, when the manager came by to ask if everything was OK, we explained the situation.  She offered a glass of champagne in their bar as compensation which we declined.  We were supposed to receive large macaroons (2) to take away if we desired.  Finally they brought one small cookie in a box for us to take away.  The manager took 25% off the bill.  Even if she had not…"
July 2015,Amazing !,Amazing stay at Brown's - went back for first time since our wedding night 15 years previous and were made to feel so welcome and at ease by all the staff. A special mention must go to Bonnie who treated us to a gift in recognition of our celebration - Brown's are lucky to have an employee who recognises the importance of such gestures in this day and age.
June 2015,"Genuinely kind, competent service and all-around excellence","We experienced some of the best service we have had, _ever_, at Brown's. The genuinely friendly, kind, and competent staff made us feel welcome, and really went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable and had any help that we needed.  Just a few examples of the non-standard, beyond-the-call-of-duty service we received: 1. Massive help receiving and forwarding luggage (from other hotels, and to our home in a different country); 2. Extreme kindness when I was felled by a massive migraine on the day of our departure (and felt so unwell that we needed to stay another night); 3. Stepping out into the street (from the front desk) to make sure we didn't lose our way; 4. Locating speciality shops for us (we were shopping for a wedding gift for a dear friend and wanted…"
May 2015,Return to Browns,"We absolutely appreciate this wonderful hotel. We do, however, find it a bit unusual that having shown such loyalty to the Rocce Forte brand, we do  not seem to be shown any real recognition in return. Who else from Australia has stayed at Browns, Balmoral, Verdura and Hotel de Rome?"
June 2015,Decadent afternoon treat,"Organised birthday trip for my partner which included afternoon tea at the English tea rooms at Browns. Did a bit of research and it was widely acclaimed in the telegraph afternoon teas review so thought we'd give it a go.  You need to book in advance as this is a bucket list the of visit, also don't be put off by the dress code email either, it is smart but casual and rightly so but certainly not trainers and football shirt!!!! The staff are extremely courteous and helpful and the choice of teas and cakes is wonderful. You pay for what you get and at Browns you get culture, good food, ambience and style and for a once in a lifetime treat you need to go for it !!!"
June 2015,One of my Favorites ,Browns hotel is for sure one of my favorite hotels. The service is fantastic. As soon as I entered the room there were gingerbread cookies and hot milk at the side of my bed. Everyone there was very helpful and kind. The hotel is built and a great location close to lots of landmarks. 
July 2014,Room with a view,"Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my recent stay here  I've known of Browns for many years and have always avoided staying but got stuck due to the availability of other hotels   What a really nice hotel, feels a bit like a boutique as opposed to part of a chain was also really pleased to find it wasn't as stuffy as I thought and unlike the Mayfair wasn't full of Russian business men   The rooms are smaller than places like the landmark but it's very refreshing to be able to go shopping and be able to drop bags back at the hotel within a few minutes walk   I would recommend this for romance or shopping "
June 2015,I was robbed,"I was robbed by the house keeper, and the manager in duty failed to help me and there was no cameras in my room corridor to proof that happened, as it was a do not disturb sign and she still went in the room while I was in the shower."
August 2014,Magnificent !!,"This lovely old establishment is so British traditional. You truly taste the culture of England.  From the beautifully appointed rooms, luxury sheeting. Very comfy beds.  The in room menu typifies famous British culinary delights. Location ! Its right in the middle of everything. Mayfair. You can walk to any top restaurant, attractions and Famous Parks. The shopping in Bond street is not for the 'faint hearted'. If you appreciate the finer things in life then 'Browns' is your destination hotel in London and also because it is boutique , it is private and luxurious. they attend to your every whim!..  We always stay when travelling to London."
April 2015,"How to perfectly combine Classy, Historic and Funky","What must happen for you to want a write a Trip Advisor review straight away?  In my experience the stay has to have been amazing or terrible.  Browns is amazing. From the welcome on arrival to the cheerful goodbye it’s fabulous.  Enough of the superlatives – what makes it so great?  As with all great hotels the building and the décor are wonderful. We like well-maintained, great quality (we had a B&O TV in our room) and clean. Browns was all 3.  But no matter how clean and smart a hotel may be at the end of the day it’s all about the staff.  Warm and caring spring to mind. But also self-deprecating; especially with Lewis from the front desk, who has us laughing about his first (and only visit) to a professional gym.  The bar is funky and they make a great G&T. We even spotted a…"
April 2015,Splendid Afternoon Tea,Afternoon tea in a private room for my birthday - this is no ordinary tea as the food just keeps coming till you can literally eat no more. We had the champagne cream tea and it was  a genuinely lovely experience. Great green tea
March 2015,Over perfect!,"We found a hotel we love in London! Finally! We've been here for 4 days and it was absolutely perfect! We were upgraded to a Deluxe room upon arrival, so we started out better than expected! The room is fairly big for London standards. The ambience of the room is perfect.... classic but not old, and with a minimal touch of modernism that makes it contemporary! Service was absolutely outstanding!!!!! Do not miss the breakfast that is amazing too! To add up to all these factors is the best part:  LOCATION! Will definitely return! Magical stay!"
March 2015,"Beautiful, clean, and designed","Located between  Albemarle street and Dover street, Browns Hotel owns the tranquil environment and convinience St the same time. The hotel is well decorated, rather classic than contemporary. The room is very cozy, bright, and spacious, with a big bathroom. I would like to visit again definitely!"
March 2015,Better than Ritz,"During my 2 days stay in London I had the pleasure to stay at this architectural gem. This hotel it one of the best, I have stayed in London. And I mean, it topped even my stay at the Ritz ( very stuffy ). I can be very picky when it comes to service, food, comfort, stylish ( tasteful) environment and decor. However, I can not fault this place in any of those areas. Yes, it is a bit higher on the price range, but you get every penny worth.  This place is suitable for businessmen who are tired of hotels with no atmosphere. it is great for elderly people as it is super quiet. Even couples and families will find their stay here delightful"
October 2014,The most amazing Afternoon Tea (and Gluten Free!),"My first Afternoon Tea experience as a Newbie to London was at Brown's Hotel, and it couldn't have been more perfect. I had done some research into where to get Gluten Free Afternoon Tea in London, and Brown's Hotel was recommended. So, I made a reservation for my husband and I to each have our first afternoon tea at Brown's (a surprise that it was his first too, seeing as he's a native Londoner!)  The Hotel itself is gorgeous, and you feel a great sense of history when you walk in. There is a beautiful parlour area for afternoon tea diners, and we were graciously welcomed into the warm sitting area. Despite not having specified when I made the reservations that I would be needing Gluten Free, they were happy to accommodate and it was no problem.   We each had the most beautiful…"
March 2015,Wonderful Hotel in the heart of Mayfair,Love this hotel.  The location is superb. We could walk to so many places.  Loved that there are so many restaurants nearby.  The staff was so friendly and couldn't do enough for us.  We had an interior room with all the amenities expected of a luxury hotel. What surprised me the most was how quiet the room even though we were in the city .  I will certainly stay at the Brown's Hotel the next visit to London.
February 2015,Sublime Luxury,"The location, the style, the history and the staff all make this iconic hotel one of the finest you will ever stay at. From the moment you step through the door it is bliss. The attention to detail is what Browns is famous for and they don't disappoint. Food, service, cleanliness & comfort are all 5 star I will return again soon, there is simply no point in looking around London for a better place to stay."
March 2015,Wonderful location and amazing service!,"Used to come here occasionally with my parents for high tea back in the day, so it was wonderful to revisit and stay a couple of nights. It's a really fabulous central Mayfair location close to Bond St, Regent St, Piccadilly & Royal Academy, Soho and Green & Hyde Parks.  Brown's is a small hotel and there isn't much in the way of public rooms - but what there is, has a lovely country house feel.  We were staying for B&B and the breakfast was first rate, served in the attractive Mark Hix restaurant.   Our non-standard executive room was nicely understated and just fine though nothing special.  Bathroom was good - nice tiling and marble.  Very comfortable bed and good quality bedding.  Pretty quiet though you can clearly hear people walking along the corridors. What really sets…"
March 2015,A wonderful birthday treat.....,"I booked this hotel as a special treat for my partners birthday some months ago and finally last weekend it was time to go…………. On arrival we were greeted by the concierge who escorted us to check it and there we were taken through the normal check in procedure with speed and ease and this is the point we were told the key machine was broken and we would be taken to our room and let in but would not receive a key…………….. oh dear I thought. I need not of worried the key machine was not fixed during our stay but the staff were always quick to recognise us and take us to our room when required and chatted to us whilst doing so, it turned out to be rather a nice experience!!   We had booked into the spa for some treatments and the ladies in there were wonderful, very professional and…"
May 2015,Nowhere better,"Home from home! Staff wonderful, think of everything, nothing a problem. Location fantastic but also quiet. Relaxing - even though really busy, controlled ambiance. Staff not afraid to show personality and humour but so professional. Enjoyed every minute of our two night stay"
May 2015,Very Personalised Service,"A lovely stay at Brown's - intimate top class hotel, it was a last minute decision to go and have a late supper in London.  Arriving was a very personalised affair with the Doorman knowing exactly who we were and taking care of us and our car - Thank You              "
May 2015,Home from Home,"I consider Browns a home from home-the location is perfect The reception and concierge staff are friendly,highly efficient and professional The breakfast is first class and good value for money The bed and bathroom make the stay comfortable despite the age of the property The gym is small but as long as few guests use it I found it functional My only complaint would be that the bar staff were somewhat aloof and tended to treat high-spending walk-in groups (in the area for dining) better than hotel guests "
March 2015,4.5 Stars Rounded Up,"Everything about the hotel is tremendous, but it's not perfect and I didn't have the heart to round down to a four. We stayed in a junior suite the room was great and the turn down service was exceptional. Here is why it is not a perfect five stars: 1) though the rooms are well done the hallways themselves are tacky and do not exude five stars 2) the reception area is in an awkward location and is not welcoming, though the staff was fine 3) we had a rather crotchety bar tender the only time we went into the bar (Monday March 9th Evening) and that was our first service experience in London. He was just rude, which we were expecting in Paris but did not expect in London, not sure if he was just having a bad night or he's always like that but it certainly stuck with me. 5 star…"
January 2015,Great hotel in central London,"Was lucky enough to stay here, having had fond memories of it in my grandparents' time, and really enjoyed it.  It is a superb location, near museums, galleries, shopping etc., and the staff were extremely professional, courteous and always helpful.  The curious thing about the downstairs is that the lobby is basically a passage from the entrance on one street to entrance on the other, which doesn't leave anyone an easy place to sit when waiting for friends to come down elevator.  The rooms that I saw were oddly lacking in charm, very spacious and every comfort and luxury one could possibly think of, but depressing colours and arrangement of furniture."
February 2015,Very Nice Hotel,"My stay at Brown's was overall a very good one.   The hotel has a lot going for it. Great location in regards to access to shopping and sightseeing and I found the service to be friendly and courteous.   The breakfast in the hotel was of excellent standard. The room I had on the fifth floor was comfortable and nice. The only issue for me was the the noise coming from the squeaky floorboards outside my room when someone would walk by.   While in Asia you can find five star hotels which can be better in regards to what they offer for the same price as this hotel, I would rate Brown's as one of the best hotel stays I had in Europe so far.   "
March 2015,Service needs improvement,"I stayed at the suite for four nights, and while the suite was spacious and tastefully design, I found the overall service lacking. Especially the reception. Unlike other hotels, I was not briefed about details like where breakfast will be served, what services does the suite come with, facilities in the suite...the basics.   Breakfast selection is rather limited, and the spread remained the same throughout my stay. They do pretty good afternoon tea though, but I highly recommend booking in advance if you're planning to have it during weekends.   Location is great as it gives you access to Albermarle and Dover Street, and is just a walking distance to Fortnam & Mason along Piccadilly. The room is very comfortable and I do like the turn down service offered.  When I checked out,…"
February 2015,"Our wonderful first visit wasn't a fluke, the second time was just as good",Second time around and Browns just gets better and better. This time we ate at HIX and had the most delicious crispy fresh fish and chips imaginable. As always the bedroom and the bed were extremely comfortable and well appointed. The staff were very helpful and gracious and made us feel like old friends even though it was only our second time there. The cocktail bar is fun and funky and has a wonderful and diverse range of cocktails including one named after Sir Alexander Graham Bell who made the worlds first telephone call from Browns! I have very high standards and I have no hesitation recommending Browns
February 2015,Great Stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay over Valentines weekend. Within a stone's throw of top London restaurants, the hotel truly offers a 10/10 service. Will certainly be back in future and will be recommending to friends and family."
February 2015,Top class hotel,"I use to work at this hotel on reception about 30 years ago and my husband booked a stay here as a valentine surprise, which was lovely.  When we arrived, Michael on reception gave us a tour to show how the hotel has changed since I worked there which was really nice of him.  It has hardly changed in a way as still has a lovely traditional atmosphere about it.  It's still delightfully 'posh' and has been beautifully updated.  Our room was lovely and I liked the little touches of moisturiser on the pillow instead of chocolates.  We were visited by staff who asked if we wanted fresh apples in the afternoon which was a lovely touch.  Staff more than helpful and friendly as I remember them all to be when I worked there. Lovely hotel, I was so happy to return there, it just has such…"
February 2015,an amazing stay,"My girlfriend an I had the chance to stay in this beautiful property in the hart of Mayfair during S. Valentin week-end. The room was very quiet and comfortable, the service tailor-made and made our stay a unique experience."
February 2015,Fab valentines treat,"I stayed here last weekend for a night away with my wife. We started with the champagne afternoon tea - service was great and my wife loved the fruit scones.   We stayed in a classic room, which was larger than expected and looked just like the website. The bathroom was very smart and the large mirror was a great feature.   We did not dine in the hotel, instead choosing Hakkasan nearby (well worth a visit).   Breakfast was very relaxed and I'd recommend the 'egg soldiers' with sourdough.  Overall a romantic night away in a hotel that felt luxurious without being over the top. Only downside is the price, but it was definitely worth it."
January 2015,Luxury in Mayfair,I stayed in the hotel recently when visiting London on a business trip. The room was elegant and very comfortable. Good range on the breakfast menu and staff were happy to accommodate my preferences. I only had one evening meal in the hotel but it was very high quality and the service was outstanding. I will certainly stay again when I next visit London.
May 2015,Best service in london,"The location is in Mayfair. Great place! Close to many restaurants, quiet, stylish- the best location you can find! Rooms are new! But their biggest advantage is the staff! They are nice, helpful and welcoming. Always try to help and give you a feeling they really care. A Mandarin Oriental style of service but less expensive. They are the reason we will definitely cone back!!!"
May 2015,Excellent management of property by Mr. Johnson!,"This is by far the best hotel in London! Mr. Johnson run's a team of people who are completely committed in meeting the high quality of hospitality that is expected from this land of Kings and Queens! A special note and mention of appreciation of Mr. Nick Davies, Mr. Alasdair Turnbull and Mr. Russel!"
May 2015,Great Stay,"Had a fantastic and unfortunately short stay at the beautiful Brown's Hotel, in a perfect setting for all the main spots in central London.  The hotel feels small and intimate with friendly and efficient staff who make you feel very welcome.  Lovely contemporary furnishing incorporated into a traditional interior, with a cosy feel but spacious. The breakfast menu is great in the Hix restaurant with walls adorned with artwork by famous artists. Highly recommend a stay at Brown's!"
May 2015,Brilliant location for a weekend of art and shopping,"Brown's does what so few London hotels do well -- mixing a historical location with contemporary interiors and service.  A friend and I stayed here for a weekend of gallery and museum-hopping plus a bit of shopping and were delighted.  The rooms are generously sized, with comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms, and we loved the large-sized REN toiletries and little hand cream or other treat on our pillows every evening.  The concierge was extremely helpful in recommending and booking restaurants, although afternoon tea as well as evening drinks in the Donovan Bar are great experiences within the hotel.  All the staff we encountered were articulate, professional and on the ball.  Right around the corner from the auction houses and galleries in Mayfair as well as fantastic…"
May 2015,Best hotel i have stayed in! ,"I have just spent bank holiday at the hotel and i felt like royalty!  The staff are super kind and will do anything to make your life easier and your stay more enjoyable!  The rooms are kitted out with everything you could need and the used items are replaced asap!  Every night the staff would come round and organise your room for ""bed time "" e.g draw the curtains, take the throws off the bed, lay your slippers next to the bed and provide you with a day cream and a bottle of complimentary water.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to come back or recommend!!! "
May 2015,A haven of calm in an excellent location with exceptional service,"We arrived to a warm welcome at reception where we were efficiently checked in without feeling rushed.  We had arrived early with the intention of dropping off our bags however the room was almost ready and so we had a drink in the bar while we waited.  When we had finished we were shown to our room and provided with useful information about in-room amenities and the hotel. The rooms are elegantly designed with good quality materials and are wonderfully comfortable.   In addition to the beautiful hotel and great location however, it was the staff who really define Brown's as outstanding. The staff were genuinely friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble; this level of exceptional service really made our relaxing weekend in London and we can't wait to come back."
April 2015,Excellent service,My partner has severe breathing difficulties and has limited mobility. All of the staff at the hotel were exceedingly he!pful and nothing was too much trouble. The hotel has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The In-Room dining and turn-down service  is extremely good and staff are very efficient.
December 2014,Amazing afternoon tea experience,"The most amazing afternoon tea experience with champagne. Beautifully prepared finger sandwiches, mini pastries , hot scones and cream cakes. The cake stand will be filled up as much as you like however , you can just about finish one stand. A huge choice of teas. As it was around xmas we were also given xmas cake to finish. Small cake boxes are also offered if you wish to take home the cakes you can't finish. The staff were amazing and made the whole experience wonderful."
January 2015,Excels again,Browns again met and exceeded expectations during my three day business stay. Hix was excellent  for business breakfasts and Donovans great for the end of day drinks (although needs a little more life - maybe the music or the lighting??). The spa massage helped a weary executive. Well done. 
January 2015,Amazing Browns,"We just returned from staying at Browns Hotel in Mayfair on a sales conference, the standard of service was more than 5 star from the doorman to the reception. Nothing was too much trouble and the rooms are all amazingly comfortable. If you want to spoil yourself and have a trouble free stay then i would highly recommend Browns. This was my second visit and i will certainly be back."
January 2015,Stay in the lap of luxury in Central London,I stayed in Browns for 3 days this week and i couldn't fault it. The rooms are large and spacious and bathrooms are stocked with REN skincare products. The bathrobes and huge and fluffy and beds are really inviting and cozy. One pet hate is my Double Bed was actually Two Singles pushed together - i'd expect more from a 5 star hotel but it is par for the course these days. The hotels welcome on arrival was terrific as was their hosting skills and management of check-out. All in all a lovely stay right in the heart of London with some beautiful boutiques nearby for shopping and dropping. Highly recommended
February 2014,Great Place,"Stayed during Valentines Day and this place is amazing, simply amazing, great food, lovely staff, especially Natalie. and I loved the afternoon tea what a delight. All I can say was we really enjoyed our stay. Hope to Come back soon"
January 2015,What a gem!,"We stayed for the weekend for a shopping and theatre break arriving Friday lunch time and from the moment we entered this wonderful Boutique Hotel  could not fault the excellent and very personal service shown by all the staff we encountered. Donovans Bar was buzzing with a very dedicated bar team mixing up some excellent cocktails - Gin Daisy being our particular favourite. Afternoon tea was very good despite it not being in the Tea Room due to refurbishment. Our room, especially the bathroom, was particularly spacious, extremely clean and well appointed. The Hotel itself is majestic and full of old world charm and obviously prides itself on attention to detail. The location is perfect with London on your doorstep - ideal for  theatres, shopping and restaurants. Will hopefully…"
December 2014,Great Cocktails,"Historic, well run and has a grand feel , particularly the tea and dining rooms as well as the well known cocktail bar. The cocktail bar is well run and the drinks are interesting and well made *if slightly expensive. Still they are served in a nice comfortable setting and I would recommend it for a visit."
December 2014,Back to Brown's!,"We stayed at Brown's the first time we took our children to Europe many years ago, and we have very fond memories of our stay there.  When my husband and I took a sudden trip to Europe last month, we thought we'd stay there again to see if the magic was still there.  We were very happy to know that Brown's has gotten even better!  Our room was perfect with a view right down Albemarle Street, so we could enjoy the Christmas decorations.  The service is outstanding.  Each time we returned, the doormen greeted us by name.  What we really love about Brown's is its coziness.  Most times I see the word 'cozy' associated with a hotel, red flags fly up letting me know that it may be run down or have a lot of deferred maintenance.  Not at Brown's.  It's just as high end and luxurious as…"
June 2014,The ultimate London hotel experience,"From the high tea to the incredibly helpful doormen, it's a wonderful experience. Located very close to my favourite arcade (Burlington) and Regent street. It is expensive, but if you only need a night or 2 it's worth it. "
November 2014,"High quality, superb location (odd lapse in service)","We stayed here late November as we had an evening dinner in Mayfair arranged. I was keen to book a high class hotel as a treat for my wife. Having booked early, through lastminute.com (top secret hotel), using a discount code and using Topcashback I managed to get a Classic room for approximately £240 for a Friday night which was outstanding value considering it can be £500-700.  The room was clean and tastefully decorated, the hotel is magnificent in it's old world charm, iconic in a world famous area of London.  However, ordering room service was a little slow and an urgent request for an iron and ironing board took 20 minutes and 3 phone calls which was very disappointing.  Overall it was very good but for the cost of the room and Brown's reputation for service - this was a…"
February 2015,Fantastic stay!,"My husband surprised me with a trip to London for Valentine's day and it has been one of the best get aways I've had in a long time. Right in the heart of Mayfair, the surroundings were beautiful as well as the hotel itself. The staff were extremely friendly and eager to make our stay as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. The room was superb. Spacious and beautifully decorated. Had everything and more that we could possibly have needed. It was a very enjoyable stay. The next day we had afternoon tea in the hotel which was excellent. Brilliant value for money and will definitely recommend to anyone. My husband and I will most definitely be returning and already looking forward to it."
February 2015,a night in town,an exceptional friendly and professional welcome was extended from everyone.   incomparable  service  housekeeping  prompt and good delivery of our breakfast  next time we'll stay for afternoon tea Thank you
February 2015,Exceptional hotel,I recently spent 3 nights as this hotel on business. Exceptional service and beautiful rooms. I only tried the restaurant for breakfast and totally enjoyed the choice and food. Donavans Bar was a great place to meet up with colleagues and had a great atmosphere and drink choices. I'll judge all other hotel stays by my stay at Brown's.
February 2015,Perfect!,"Recently stayed at Browns for business. The location is perfect and the staff were accommodating and helpful. My room faced the road, but I could not hear any noise at all.  The room was lovely and felt ""homey"". I fully recommend a stay for business or pleasure."
February 2015,Exceptional Hotel in Perfect Location,"I recently spent three nights at the Browns Hotel Mayfair and could not find fault in the standard of accommodation, service, and location. The perfect hotel for business or pleasure.   The rooms are classic in style, spacious and have all the modern conveniences a business traveller requires.   A visit to the Donovan Bar is a must for a great cocktail. "
February 2015,Perfect old-style service and politeness,"Although Brown's has had a modern make-over - in terms of the bedrooms and some of the artwork (!), the great aspect of this old hotel is still the fantastic service from all the staff. Everyone from the doorman, reception to restaurant and bar serving staff were very professional, friendly and polite in that wonderful proper English way - not over the top or fake, just what you'd expect from a top class hotel in Mayfair. Just for info - our room was on the 5th floor but we could still clearly hear the party-goers outside on the street at the early hours of Sun morning. Food for breakfast was really good with large helpings and the bar staff were really friendly. Some of the finishes in the bedroom (window blinds) are showing signs of wear-n-tear but room was very comfortable…"
February 2015,A great experience at The Brown's !,"My wife and I spent 2 incredible nights at The Brown's. Everything was perfect, the smiling service, the very nice and comfortable room, the large and warm bathroom, the excellent food we had either for breakfast and dinner and the great location, just to mention a few oustanding peculiarities of this nice property !"
February 2015,Afternoon Tea,"In case you would like to experience the classic afternoon tea in London, that's the place to go.  The ambiance of the Brown's hotel is pretty classic and  the service is great. The sandwiches, scones, pastries and cakes are all deliciouse , as well as champagne. Regarding the tea, I would suggest you to try the Brown's Afternnon Blend , really tasty and rich. However make sure to book ahead, as closer to the date , many spots might not be available."
February 2015,Perfect Afternoon Tea,"To Brown's for our latest Afternoon Tea in London - and I must say this was probably overall the best we've been to. The usual sandwich and cram tea/cake selection boosted by an excellent selection of ""designer"" teas which offered a flavour range to suit all. Very good, understated service by the Brown's team and all in lovely, old school luxury surroundings. Thoroughly recommended"
February 2015,Excellent on all levels,"From the minute we arrived everyone was friendly and efficient,checking was a breeze & the luggage was bought to the room almost immediately. Afternoon tea is a must do at this hotel,everything from the sandwiches,patisserie & scones were excellent.The breakfast was also very enjoyable & nothing was too much trouble much better than some similar hotels we have experienced.Location was ideal for what we had planned ( Theatre & some sightseeing) & everytime we walked through the entrance were greeted by very friendly colleagues.Having stayed at the Rosewood last time we were in London we found the whole experience far superior at Browns,would return without hesitation."
January 2015,"OK, But There Are Better Places To Stay In London","A difficult review to write as Trip Advisor does not have a good rating. I would not rate  the hotel as very good ,hence the average rating.Check in was fine and there was a pleasant doorman to greet us.We had booked a classic room which was clean and comfortable but very basic and small with that view, as some others have commented on ,to  a cold looking courtyard and air conditioning vents, as the manager states in other reviews, 60% do not have that view ,not much consolation if you are in one of the remaining 40% .The room did not have tea and coffee making facilities ,but this was remedied when I expressed surprise and a tray was brought up to the room .There was no complementary water in the room ,which I would expect from a hotel of this class. The bed was comfortable…"
January 2015,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed at this hotel with my family and was awesome. Super clean, large room, staff very welcoming and warm. Brilliant location, few strolls away of everything. Delightful ambience and tasty breakfast full of everything you may need in the morning. Recommended 100%."
January 2015,Super Hotel,"Brown's made London even more fun than it already is. The service was impeccable at all levels. If something didn't work, such as a movie, they credited it immediately. Friendly and knowledgable, all our questions were answered with a smile. Johnny, one of the doormen, was fantastic."
March 2014,Perfect London stay,"The weather was awful but the hotel was fantastic. Very clean room, spacious bathroom, top amenities and very good range of food and drinks. We loved everything about our stay, once we tried the spa which was nothing wow, but quite ok, slightly on the pricey side."
January 2015,"SUPERB, SUPERB, SUPERB","Check-in such a nice, easy ,smooth, smiling process what a pleasure. Rooms are cosy , not over the top but tend to give a home away from home feeling. Spa treatments incredible, even though the spa is very small the therapists are extremely well trained.  Concierge tries to accomodate complicated requests with ease. Breakfast was good, would encourage the maitre d' to less brusque but maybe that comes with his territory.    Loication seconds away from Bond Street ."
January 2015,A whole new meaning to excellence ...,"Last weekend I had the privilege of staying at Browns.. Having just arrived back from a two week trip in Thailand where luxury is considered common place, my family and I took a short stay up in London to visit the theatre and museums. First question; where to stay? Browns was the answer... What a treat on every level...I was reminded  of what true excellence is. The moment we arrived on the door step we were greeted with a welcome that was stunningly professional but at the same time warm and  friendly. Then we were shown, to the reception,  around the hotel, up to the room and then to the restaurant. I can honestly say I have never, in a single hotel, experienced true excellence in every area quite like this. There is normally one or two things that can ever so slightly taint…"
December 2014,Outstanding,"I am going to keep this short and sweet. Browns is exceptional in every way.   The rooms, the food, the staff, the location.    It's a superb luxury 5 star experience. Certainly, the best london hotel we have ever had the pleasure of staying in.   So in a word, faultless."
January 2015,A truly excellent hotel.,"A superb experience from the moment we were greeted by the doorman 'til the moment we left. All the staff young and old present as courteous, professional with even the youngest displaying a level of confidence rarely seen. If I have any criticism at all it would be to provide Nespresso machines or similar in the rooms, coffee sachets do no favours to such an illustrious hotel! We will return and would happily recommend this hotel to anyone looking for understated luxury in the heart of Mayfair."
December 2014,Excellent Hotel in Mayfair,"Our family of five enjoyed a wonderful stay at Brown's Hotel over Christmas and New Year's 2014. We had two deluxe rooms next door to each other. The children were so spoiled! Cookies and milk everyday. Over Christmas the hotel delivered embroidered stockings filled with goodies for each child.   Adults also enjoyed the gorgeous, comfortable room (everything recently renovated.) We received a complimentary bottle of champagne our first night.   The breakfast everyday at Hix was excellent. We also enjoyed tea at the hotel and a lovely hotel lunch one day.  The concierge was incredibly helpful with reservations at restaurants and even helped us get transportation to the Harry Potter studio.   Overall, excellent hotel; excellent location;  excellent service. Will definitely stay…"
January 2015,A 7 star service with a Smile!,"We often travel to London, yet this was our very first time at the Rocco Forte Brown's Hotel.  This place could not fault in any way, thanks to its brilliant position, its ""British-Italian"" atmosphere and moreover thanks to its well trained, professional, courteous and always smiling staff.  Our overall experience at the Brown's hotel made our last trip to London a very special one and can not wait to be back.  Hats off to all...from the Island of Malta."
December 2014,"Exceptional Hotel, truly British","This hotel is amazing.  True British hotel.  I stay in London every December with my mother and stayed at browns for the first time this year and I was blown away by the whole hotel.  The reception staff where incredible helpful when we arrived, offered us tea and coffee in the tea room on them as our room was not ready yet, (being 10am we were not expecting it to be)  The room was lovely and cosey, extremely clean. We ate at the resturant at the hotel, the staff again were so helpful and polite.  I can not rate this hotel any higher not a bad word to say about it. Amazing. Will be staying here every time we visit London from now on."
December 2014,great location,"That is a great hotel in a great location in London, close to a lot of shopping. You also get superior service and great concierge. Not cheap, but you pay for the service and the location. Breakfast buffet was also quite substantial, but not sure if worth the price. There are stores within a block where you can grab coffee and snack if needed."
January 2015,As always amazing,Quick overnight at our most favourite hotel. Always total understated class. Attention to detail is the key to this amazing hotel. Breaks my heart everytime we have to leave. Thanks to everyone for working so hard to keep Browns our second home! With best wishes for 2015 Liz & Keith Grieve
December 2014,Another wonderful Christmas stay at Browns,"However many times we visit Browns we are never disappointed and this stay was no exception. The superb welcome as we pulled up in our car, the welcome at reception and smooth transfer of us and our luggage to our lovely room was as we have come to expect.  The bar was buzzing as always as we enjoyed champagne with friends before going out.  The concierge was amazing at securing us a table for a large party in a nearby restaurant and breakfast was superb as always - cannot believe how yellow the yolks are in the tasty eggs and wheat free toast is always a treat. The Christmas decorations were up to the usual standard making it a really festive stay in Christmas week.  We will be back!"
December 2014,Shear Luxury in Mayfair,"From the moment you meet the Doorman you cant help noticing the quiet confident and efficient service of the staff at Browns. It is said that without great staff any hotel is just a building, well Browns have both. Our room was what you would expect from the number one hotel in London but the Concierge and Restaurant staff were either engaging or discreet as required. We enjoyed our  stay and recommend the Hotel to all."
December 2014,Great Hotel,"Currently staying at the Browns Hotel with my family. The location is excellent and the rooms are very well decorated/appointed. More importantly the service has been excellent. The hotel had a room ready on our arrival after an overnight flight, set up the adjoining room for our young children with gifts and kids bedding, and the concierge/doormen are always friendly. I have stayed here on business and with family and believe it is one of the best hotels in London."
November 2014,Nice experience,"We are loyal guest of Rocco Forte, but it was our first time in the Brown's.the hotelis nice , the location perfect, and people who works there very professional and available. Surely one of the best in London. "
June 2014,Modern Classic,"The history of the property is evident but doesn't weigh heavily here. While areas of the hotel are still older, the rooms and restaurants are better described as modern classic in style. Comfortable and homely but not at all stuffy, it's easy to understand why it's popular with the art and fashion crowd and the Euro 'jet-set'. There's even a Tracy Emin artwork in pride of place at the Hix restaurant. Breakfast there is traditional but with a twist and one of the best in London (according to Harper's Bazaar too). London is on your doorstep so if you need anything from a pub to a sushi fix, everything is a short walk away."
September 2014,Best in London,"In all my years traveling to London both for personal and work reasons, this special place has become my home away from home. Every last detail is executed with perfection. It is a beautiful place to wake up each morning and truly the best of the best in my opinion. Everything you could want is steps away and what's more, Hix, is just inside and this restaurant delivers an incredible culinary experience surrounded by a fantastically curated art collection. I will never stay anywhere else when in London! "
November 2014,Great Classic hotel In London,"Great hotel, excellent location. One of the best hotel services in London. Classic, upscale but with a family atmosphere. Roos, restaurant and tea room were in line with our high expectations. Not the first time we've been there, but that was longtime ago."
November 2014,Fabulous hotel on a perfect location,"Stayed in this hotel with my partner for four nights. The room was stylish decorated with plenty of space. The staff was very friendly and helpfull. This hotel has the most comfortable beds I've slept in in a hotel.  Only point of attention is the noise of the hotel, you can hear people walking through the corridor when you're in the bathroom and I heard several times noise from above. Nothing really bad, just an old building in the perfect Mayfair district."
September 2014,Great location and outstanding service,"My wife and I were in London for a week and though many times before this was our first time at Brown's. It exceeded our expectations and we plan to return in the Spring, All our needs were met and the concierge went out of his way to help with touring and financial arrangements."
November 2014,Exceptional Service,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Browns Hotel.  We were well looked after and definitely will come back.  We have stayed in many of the ""top"" hotels in London, but the service we had a Browns exceeded the level of service we have had in any other London hotel.    There was nothing we could fault with the hotel.  The service and the quality of the food served in the bar was excellent - so good we went twice in 1 day.    The breakfast was also top quality -  loving the pancakes and bacon which was of similar standards to that of Sarabeth's in New York.  Will definitely be the hotel of choice from now on in London.    If you are thinking of staying in Claridges, The Ritz or The Dorchester, give Browns a try, you will not be disappointed.       Fantastic location for shopping with…"
April 2014,Good location,If you need to stay in Mayfair it's a great spot. I found the rooms a bit confusing. They weren't really quaint and not at all modern. Somewhere lost in the middle. While I wouldn't hesitate to return I might not recommend it without reservation.
October 2014,Quintessentially London,"Having stayed in numerous hotels in London, including the Dorchester and Claridges, we have settled into our London ""home"" of Browns.  Whilst the other hotels have their positives, they are all very large properties, and it is easy to get lost amongst the other guests. i.e. service is not so great at times.  Browns is a much smaller hotel, with a very personal and homely feel about it. Breakfast at Hix is fantastic, a great selection of produce and quality.  The hotel is quite often frequented by royals, who like to keep a low profile. The GM, Stuart Johnson, is an absolute professional and as you would expect, a proper Brit.  Highly recommended."
November 2014,Truly outstanding,"We had great experience at Brown's for my husband's B-day. We just had Afternoon tea with waiter Stefano. He is super super good, simply the best! Always smiling and friendly. The suite we have got was amazing. Very professional staff. The bartender Agnez was very friendly and helpful. Good location. We will definitely come back."
December 2014,Old-school London Luxury,"Just about everything about this hotel was excellent+, but especially the staff, who must see thousands of people but nevertheless make you feel as if you belong there. And are extraordinarily helpful.  Lovely room, plenty of space - just have to be careful on the front that the offices opposite don't see into your room as you can observe theirs.... Superb bathroom, (but slightly leaky shower (420)) One of the best breakfasts ever, and we 'only' had the continental which included smoked salmon, fresh strawberries, great croissants, etc etc. Position is brilliant - within 5 mins walk of the RA, 10-15 mins of theatreland and the National Gallery.  As for shopping, be very careful indeed....:-)"
December 2014,Excellent hotel!,"I had the pleasure of spending just one night here with my brother in early December.    We had a massive upgrade to one of the suites, which provided ample room for the two of us to get some separate space!   The bathrooms were the best part.  Heated towel racks, twin sinks, a full soaking tub and a steam shower.  Incredible luxury.  The beds couldn't have been more comfortable and we LOVED the robes & slippers provided for us.  The bar in the lobby was amazing.  Very dedicated barmen, who put on quite a show with each drink made.  Also, high tea at Brown's is an experience said not to be missed.  Sadly we are broke and couldn't afford to do it ourselves, but it looked very nice and all the guests seemed to be loving it.   The reception was also a massive highlight.  They had a…"
November 2014,A delightful place to stay,"Had afternoon tea and then stayed for one night. Tea was superb, particularly the healthy option. The room and the ensuite were charming, quiet and spacious although we would have preferred a separate shower rather than one over the bath. The public rooms, including the bar, were cosy rather than grand and the whole effect was one of homeliness. The service, helpfulness and friendliness of the staff were exemplary and they did all they could to make us feel ""at home"". We would happily return for that special occasion."
September 2014,Celebration Tea,"We celebrated our daughter's 18th birthday with Afternoon Tea. The occasion more than lived up to the high standards we hoped for and expected. The Tea was excellent (of course), the pace was relaxed, the service was exemplary and the whole event was topped off by a thoughtful 'birthday cake', complete with 'Happy 18th' in chocolate written on the plate. Our daughter was extremely pleased and it made the day.  Definitely a highly enjoyable and memorable experience - which was the whole point."
December 2014,Trapped in the bathroom was AOK,"Only stayed 2 days but Browns will stay with us as a highly recommended hotel. Remarkably friendly staff, excellent accomodation, wonderful location, it really couldn't have been better. Son Pat was trapped in his bathroom for an hour when the door handle failed. He managed to extricate himself like the Apollo 13 astronauts and frankly it couldn't have been funnier. Browns gave him a bottle of bubbles and we sat around laughing and I'm guessing so did the staff. A great hotel where you can 'feel' the history all around you. We'll certainly be back."
December 2014,Fabulous,An amazingly friendly hotel. Staff couldn't be too helpful. A surprise birthday cake too! Beautifully decorated for Christmas and ofcourse in an incredible location for access to the sights of London. We wanted a special hotel but not one that was too pretentious and that's just what we got. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.
December 2014,Good Old Fashioned Fantastic Service - What a Gem!,"We stayed for the weekend for a shopping and theatre going weekend.  Arrived on Friday lunchtime and from the moment we approached the hotel we could not fault the fantastic service we were given by all the staff.  They couldn't do enough for you but not in a pretencious way (which you can sometimes experience in luxury hotels).  We had a drink in Donovan's Bar - possibly the best Bloody Mary I have ever had.  Our room was very clean, and although not the largest of rooms, it was a good size for London!  The location is brilliant, easy access to all the West End shops and a lovely walk through the park to Knightsbridge and all it has to offer.  I have stayed in a lot of hotels in London but can honestly say I will definitely be heading back to Browns."
December 2014,Going 'the extra mile',"I booked Afternoon Tea for my wife's 65th birthday, and mentioned this when booking.  We were not disappointed - from the friendly reception (though we were more than half an hour early!) to the friendly and efficient service and the quality of the food.  The 'extra mile' was that my wife has many food intolerances, so was unable to eat the cakes, so without any notice they produced crumpets and teacakes - and even brought one of the crumpets with a candle in, and with 'Happy 65th Birthday' piped round the rim of the plate! Full marks for helping to make it such a very special occasion."
December 2014,A FREE night so whats not to like!,"As a member of the leading hotels of the world programme we had clocked up our Free Night stay. Neither the ritz or landmark could supply a room! So Browns it was.   Our welcome was very friendly and our allocated room excellent. The location of the hotel was great with lots of bars, pubs & restaurants in walking distance. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant but enjoyed a night cap in the Donovan Bar. The drinks were nicely prepared and the nibbles good. We had breakfast in the morning which was good. All be it my ""Irish"" bacon sandwich tasted greasy but my husband eggs Benedict was  excellent.   Next time we are in London we look forward to staying at Browns. Many thanks to all the team."
December 2014,Amazingly disappointing,"New to Browns and was looking forward to experiencing one of londons best 5 star hotels. Sadly for me it came nowhere close to our favourites of the firmdale group, savoy, W and the Corinthia.   We checked in early as had spa treatments booked so the rooms were not ready. Not a huge problem but no real assistance in getting ready ahead of our treatments. The spa was nice.   We had a room on the 4th floor, very average but with a lovely big bathroom. Our room had no double glazing so had the worst nights sleep, it was like there was no window at all between us and the outside.   The most disappointing thing about Browns for me is the staff and service. I never really felt welcome, if anything more an inconvience. People make a hotel and sadly for Browns this won't be a home from…"
February 2014,Surprise valentines evening,"My hubby booked this as a surprise valentines evening, ate in the restaurant was lovely & the bar was excellent food selection of cocktails & whisky. Well worth the money as it is quite costly but you definitely get what you pay for, great service, good food & drink & if you are very lucky you might see someone famous! Sadly we didn't! X"
November 2014,one of the best,"As a businessman I have to travel quite a lot back and forth to London and this time I had the opportunity to stay in this hotel. I can say that it has been a good stay from start to finish albeit a very short one. Unfortunately I only had the chance to have breakfast which was really good, with excellent service. Highly recommend this hotel as one of the top in London! Will visit again."
November 2014,"Wonderful, Welcoming Hotel","Brown`s is a wonderful, welcoming hotel which is highly recommended.  Our executive room was the largest we`ve had in London.  It included a bed, coffee table, couch and chair.  The furniture and decorating were comfortable, but not luxurious.  There was a separate hall which led to the large bathroom including separate tub and shower.  The room faced in inner courtyard which meant that it was very quiet.   We spent six nights there and were impressed by the level of attention put into making our stay comfortable.    There was a continual effort by the staff to ensure that we were comfortable and had everything that we needed.  Staying at Brown’s felt curiously like staying with relatives, as was remarked by Agatha Christie.  We will be back."
November 2014,What a fantastic anniversary!,"My wife and I like to celebrate our wedding anniversary every year by visiting Paris or London for a weekend without the children. We stayed at Browns hotel on the Saturday night, after spending the previous night at very large premium hotel near Kensington as part of a function. After having a very pleasant night at the previous hotel, we arrived at Browns around lunchtime and then really started to enjoy our weekend. On arrival the staff were genuinely friendly with a personal touch and from the moment that we arrived, their mission was to make sure we enjoyed our stay. I emailed the hotel earlier in the week to arrange some treats on arrival and mentioned it was our wedding anniversary -  I am so glad I did, as the hotel staff could not do enough for us. For a start we were…"
November 2014,Great stay at a chilled hotel in a great location,"Excellent hotel, chilled out and friendly, but with great service. The suite we had was fab, clean and very well laid out. Breakfast seems to be an institution, but Monday to Friday the restaurant is busy with suits rather than residents and as is the bast which gets very busy a the end of the day. Overall a great hotel, superb location and very good staff, the gins and cocktails are pretty good too!"
October 2014,Tea at the Browns,"Had tea at the Browns Hotel. Nice and relaxing experience. Great Service and good quality food.  Would not necessarily go again since there are better places for tea (check the Lanesborough which, for me, is on top of the list)"
November 2014,Wonderful stay,"Stayed here for one night on my birthday last week. A fabulous stay from arrival to departure. All the staff were so friendly and helpful and we were lucky to have our room upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. An executive room certainly fitted the occasion and was extremely comfortable especially the large bed with lovely crisp bedding and the bathroom was of a good size too. Breakfast was excellent and the choice superb….wanted it all! Although we didn't partake in full afternoon tea as we had dinner booked for later, the tea and scones were wonderful and the scones very fresh and warm. Thankyou Brown's for a wonderful stay and look forward to returning."
November 2014,"Great location, very nice hotel","We stayed in an Executive room for a couple of nights.  The room was nicely furnished and both it and the bathroom were very spacious by London standards. All staff with whom we interacted provided excellent service.  Breakfast was very good, both in variety and quality.  Two minor things stopped the experience being perfect for me, but I accept that these are completely subjective:  1) I like my rooms to be totally dark, but the curtains let in too much morning light. 2) The mattress was too soft - I like a firm bed.  Overall, however, we had a very enjoyable stay and I would be happy to recommend this hotel."
November 2014,A bit of class,"Afternoon tea at Browns was delightful. The building is traditional with décor to match. All the staff we spoke with were helpful, polite and friendly. The food; a selection of sandwiches, cakes and cream scones  was fresh and very tasty. A piping hot pot of tea was most welcome after walking around town. Definitely one to visit when in London."
November 2014,"Unique, elegant and impeccable service but Donovan bar getting busy and noisy","Brown's is the best hotel I have never stayed at, but I am a habitué at the Donovan Bar and it has become my de rigeur social meeting point when I am visiting London over the last 5 years or more and my premier entertaining bar of choice.   I can truly say I have never had a bad service experience at Browns and one cannot fail to be impressed with the standards and excellence displayed by the staff. The ultra professional greeting staff at the door manage to combine olde worlde formality with informal friendliness, impeccable manners and helpfulness and they set the standard for the hotel as soon as you arrive.   Everyone I have ever invited to the hotel for cocktails, drinks or dinner at Hix has relished the atmosphere, service levels and ambience of Browns and I've recommended…"
November 2014,Fabulous location and attention to detail,We stayed for one night at Brown's as we had to be in London to see clients.  Our experience was wonderful.  Upon check in we were upgraded to a superior room (I had read somewhere that this is more likely to happen if you book directly with the hotel rather than through a 'broker' website - and that seemed to pay off!)  The room was wonderful and the REN toiletries and selection of options in the mini bar were excellent. It was a Friday afternoon and the hotel bar was heaving - so we had afternoon tea and that was wonderful.   Great service and scones to die for! I was excited to see the water put out from us was from Blenheim Palace where we had been the week before!!  When we came to check out the following morning we saw a member of staff in the corridor who wished us a good…
September 2014,Excellent service in the cocktail bar,We arrived at Browns after a truly appalling experience at the Ritz Hotel Rivoli Bar.  (See separate review).   The manager and staff were welcoming and most efficient.  The manager quickly found us a secluded area to sit and our order was taken without fuss.  All in all an enjoyable experience
November 2014,The staff make it great!,"We have just spent 4 nights at Browns Hotel in a larger room on the 1st floor on the 'courtyard' side.  There was nothing to look at but some potted hedge plants but there was enough natural light and the huge advantage of a very quiet night.  The rooms are well tarted up and functional with everything you would expect bar tea/coffee making facilities. A great and proper hairdryer rather than one of those horrible wall mounted things though no plug in the bathroom as is standard in the UK and good lighting, makeup mirror, easy operating phone and TV etc.  Would love a bit more hanging space but there is a chest of drawers in the small wardrobe.  Bearing in mind this venerable old lady is just that, old, there are the obligatory squeaks and rattles and some sad paintwork on the…"
November 2014,Afternoon Tea - Very Refined...,"Usual fare for an afternoon tea, and the plates were refilled as often as we asked for them to be, so we left feeling very adequately fed and watered.  My tea was absolutely delicious (Cornish blend), and the staff's attentiveness was spot on for me.  The pianist was really really good - I was entranced by his range of music, and it added a lovely twist to the afternoon.  Highly recommended, and a lot of other people clearly thought so too, as they were full."
October 2014,Afternoon tea at Brown's,"I had afternoon tea here a few days ago, for a friend's 40th birthday and it was absolutely lovely.  They catered very well for vegetarians, and also took into account that I can't eat tomatoes or hazelnuts.  The service was fantastic, and even though it's obviously a very well-to-do place, they were still friendly and personable.  My friend had a great time, and we all had a great afternoon.  Lovely sandwiches (though I do wonder what they do with all the crusts?!), yummy scones, and petite cakes that were gorgeous.  Everything was well presented, a large selection of teas to choose from, and we left feeling very satisfied."
August 2014,Nice Way to End a Cruise!,Brown is a charming hotel centrally located in London. We found their staff to be very friendly and competent.  Enjoying afternoon tea at Brown is a beautiful way to experience  British tradition.  I would have liked our room to have been more traditional in keeping with the rest of Brown's ambiance.
September 2014,Wonderful stay in London!,We have returned to Brown's for one night or several days and never disappointed. We are usually upgraded and the staff is exceptional.  The location is central in London and wonderful just to take a walk around even after dinner.  The food at Brown's in delicious and the  tea time a must. I look forward to our next stay at Brown's.
September 2014,Excellent Service!,"We stayed one night celebrating our wedding anniversary and i must say this has been one of the best hotels i have stayed in London. On arrival we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a suit! On return from our dinner we were even more surprised when the room was nicely decorated with rose petals which just top off what was a fantastic day for us! The location was brilliant, we walked everywhere we needed, the staff were friendly, helpful and warm. The breakfast was amazing and i have been dreaming about it ever since! All in all, ill give this more than an excellent if there was such a rating! Will surely return!"
September 2014,Afternoon Tea - how it ought to be,"Just wonderful, from the food to the pianist. Just the right ambiance, refined and understated. I'm British but if I were a foreign tourist, I'd be delighted by the 'Britishness' of this place.  Fabulous sandwiches, small cakes, way too many scones (they brought five scones per person. Yes, five). Ample amount of Cornish clotted cream, and a choice of two cakes from the trolley. Food replenished discreetly, not that it's really required after all of that!  Definitely better than the afternoon tea I've had at Fortnum and Mason, just because it's cosier. The only thing I didn't like was that the chairs are very low - I prefer to eat at a normal height table; but it's no problem really."
September 2014,Recent stay at Brown's,"We just stayed 6 nights at Brown's.  The location is excellent, very close to Green Park, Green Park tube station, many art galleries and the fabulous shops on Bond Street and the surrounding back streets.  This was a very comfortable stay - the staff are very discrete, welcoming and unpretencious.  Afternoon tea with our friends was excellent, as always.  It's also very secure with footmen on the front door and 2 or 3 security guys on the back.  The food in the attached HIX Restaurant was very good, but there are many fabulous restaurants within a very short walking distance.  I was a bit disappointed with the executive level room that I booked - smaller than I had expected for the price and in need of an update compared to other hotels of this standard around the world.  I…"
September 2014,Exceptional service even better food.,"I held 2 training days here and the service was exceptional, really personalised. The refreshments were always on time and hot. The food was amazing, tasty, hot, cooked to perfection. I will be visiting here again for social as well as arranging further training here. "
September 2014,Consistently excellent,"I have stayed at Brown's hotel multiple times over the last year both for business and with family.  The experience is consistently excellent.  The rooms are very pleasant, boutique hotel rooms.  Good mid-size gym with plenty of equipment.  Outstanding restaurant.  The service is always first rate.  The concierge, front desk and outside staff go out of their way to be helpful under all sorts of conditions.  I highly recommend this hotel which is in a great location near Piccadilly Circus."
December 2013,Private room for afternoon tea,"Booked a private room for my two sons 13th birthdays. We booked over the internet, as we are from New Zealand and it was no hassle. It was an amazing birthday treat for them, the service was excellent and the food just kept coming. Replenishing our sandwiches and cakes all the time. The food was top notch and nice a fresh. Thanks for helping make such great memories."
September 2014,Afternoon tea,"Expensive, but exceptionally impressive. First class service, truly one hundred percent attentive staff. Comfortable decor , good variety and endless supply of sandwiches and cakes all accompanied by pianist tinkling away on the ivories. Can't wait to return   "
October 2014,Afternoon tea,"Cheery welcome, and shown to a table, which I thought was in a bit of a corridor area, but husband says was OK.  Table nicely laid with good quality linen.  Wide variety of teas available.  Usual afternoon tea selection - sandwiches, warm scones, mini cakes and Victoria sponge or apple/cranberry cake to finish.  Attentive service, pleasant atmosphere with the pianist tinkling away. Cost £41.50pp plus 12.5% service charge.  Other tables were given samples of the house tea to take away, but we were not.  Maybe next time we will try the Hix restaurant, as we had a fantastic meal at Number One in June. Hotel is well located for Green Park tube and all the best parts of London!"
October 2014,Luxury 5-star hotel in Mayfair on Albemarle Street,Brown's has been owned by Sir Rocco Forte and is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World. Located within walking distance of shopping streets like Bond Street and Regent Street. It also is in walking distance of Green Park and Hyde Park. The staff is very friendly and professional. The rooms combine modern features with traditional furnishing. This hotel can be highly recommended.
October 2014,Excellent Management response to a problem.,"On the 14th October I wrote a review about the disappointing Afternoon Tea experience which we had at this hotel.  The response by Nicholas Davies, the hotel Manager has been first class.  All businesses are susceptible to the occasional problem, but it is how they deal with criticism that makes the really good hotel stand out.  Thank you, Mr. Davies for the efficient and very courteous way in which you have responded.  We will return to Brown's when we are next in London."
October 2014,Excellent Rocco Forte hotel experience as usual,We stayed at Browns as a Leading Hotels reward for multiple stays but were treated as well as everyone else. The staff are really friendly and helpful (as we always find at a RF hotel) and the location is excellent. Used the bar which was really buzzy and great fun and breakfast was excellent. Great hotel
January 2014,"Amazing Hotel, fantastic location and great staff! Simply perfect","I stayed in this amazing hotel twice in the last 2 years. Service is amazing, position speech less, just in front of Ritz Hotel and 300 meters from Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Street. Underground station is just 150m from the hotel, Green Park station. Staying there you will have everything necessary in your pocket! Food is delicious and you MUST enjoy afternoon tea in the amazing Tea Room!  Rooms are very well decorated and equipped, Olga Polizzi really knows how to do her job! In conclusion, Brown's Hotel is probably the best hotel in London and not only"
October 2014,Afternoon Tea 12th October 2014,"Firstly a big thank you to the staff for an excellent day celebrating my 66th birthday. Everything was excellent including the service, the tea, the sandwiches, the scones and the final touch of a small birthday cake. I look forward a future visit when I can try out more of your teas. I must say that the Cornwall tea was a delighful surprise. Once again thank you all."
October 2014,"Quality, Class & Warmth","My boyfriend and I only spent one night in this hotel but neither of us wanted to leave!  Upon arrival (having walked past many designer shops on the way, much to my excitement) we found the reception staff polite and welcoming. We had tea in the lounge while waiting for our room (it was only minutes before it was ready but I was enjoying the tea too much) - loose leaf, served in silverware. When shown to our room the first thing that struck us was how bright and plush it was, the decor was fresh without being cold and our room looked out over the designer shops below, plus beautiful architecture opposite. We left to explore the city then on return I bathed in possibly the biggest bath I've ever encountered! For dinner we asked the concierge (Matteo I think) for a Thai…"
September 2014,The hotel is ok  but fire allarm kept ringing and waking everyone up!,I stayed there for 2 nights . One night i could not sleep for the fire allarm that kept on going  on. They did not even give me a discount ! From a hotel like that i would have expected a much better tretement!
October 2014,London at it's best,"London hotels just don't get much better than this. Elegant, surroundings in the heart of Mayfair. Contemporary and traditional furnishings blended perfectly. My room was beautifully traditional except where it counted. Very comfortable bed, beautifully appointed bathroom. I loved the pillow present with the turn down service. Day one after a long flight was perfect.....anti puff eye gel. Day two, a wonderful moisturiser ( it was so good that I bought a full size one). Day three a face pack! Staff couldn't help enough. Breakfast was sublime and my final afternoon was filled by their legendary afternoon tea. My friend told me it had been voted the best in London and I am not at all surprised. I was visiting my son. He had just started university. I must give a special mention to…"
September 2014,Afternoon tea.,"We've had afternoon tea several hotels in London, but Brown's tops our list.  It was relaxed yet elegant, attentive service but quick and discreet, and the scones and sandwiches and tea flowed effortlessly and relentlessly to our beautiful little table.  It was all delicious and beautifully English and was a highlight of our time in London."
September 2014,A 5 star hotel without pretension,"We had a lovely couple of days after flying in from the States - needed to get over the jet lag before going to a party in Surrey.  Lovely room even though it looked onto Albemarle Street, it was quiet. Big bathroom, walk in wardrobe and luxurious bedding. Very good breakfast, with vast choice. Waiting service were friendly and helpful. Donovan Bar - always a great spot to meet with friends for a cocktail or a bottle of Cloudy Bay. All in all a lovely break. This is a classy but unstuffy hotel. Perfect location. Can highly recommend."
August 2014,If only all hotels could be like this...,"We cannot enough positive things about our experience at Browns.   From the point of check-in to check-out, our experience was unforgettable.  The kids children loved the fact that they got to ""check-in"" as well and order ""cookies and milk"" for their bedtime. They upgraded us to a two bedroom suite with an huge living room.The kids room was set up with appropriately sized slippers and bath robes.  The beds were set up perfectly with fun duvets for kids. We had a friend visit who had a 18 month old child.  The hotel provided crib/babies toys and a DIAPER GENIE !!!  Room Service was prompt and of excellent quality. Our every need was taken care of without question with professionalism and courtesy.  We will definitely stay there again !!!!"
September 2014,Absolute Perfection,"I was reluctant to post this review as we would like to keep The Brown's our little secret, but as shown in prior reviews, the ""cat is out of the bag"".  We had the pleasure of staying at The Brown's for 7 nights this past week.  The room was lovely; amazingly quiet, spacious, and very comfortable overall.  We were so fortunate to not have any rain during our visit, however, what a lovely place to be if it had.  The staff, from the welcoming, helpful doorman, concierge, bellman, all wait staff, bartenders, housekeeping were exceptional, friendly, and really made us feel like a ""home away from home"".  The only thing we didn't get to experience was the spa, which we will try to experience on our next trip -- and there will be a next trip.  The location was outstanding and very…"
September 2014,"Afternoon Tea at Brown's Hotel, London, UK","What I sent to Brown's Hotel (English Tea Room) as regards a family gathering on 13th September 2014.  ""Last Saturday afternoon was superb.  My thanks to you and your staff for such a lovely afternoon tea.  Faultless!"""
September 2014,Hard to add to previous superlative reviews,"Mayfair, with easy walks to Piccadilly and Regent streets, this is a hotel that also has it all, as you would expect from previous reviews. We had a three night stay in a junior suite that was large, well appointed, and beautiful.  Whenever we left, it was straightened up, so we always felt we received ""special treatment"".  I am sure that the other guests did as well. Breakfast, in their beautiful dining room was a pleasure each morning, and returning to the hotel after a hard day of sightseeing was a welcome treat.  The hotel lives up to its 5 star rating."
September 2014,Perfection In Mayfair,"We stayed 6 nights at Brown's and we cannot rave enough! The staff is there at your beck and call to serve. The hotel is outfitted to your every wish and comfort. The rooms are beautifully appointed and equipped with a bathroom that is simply wonderful from its size, fixtures and amenities. In the restaurant the staff makes you feel recognized and special. The concierge staff is THE BEST I have ever experienced. You cannot miss HIGH TEA at Brown's! It is an eye opening and wonderful experience A Definite DON'T MISS!!!! Location Is Also The Best!  Mayfair is wonderful by itself but is close to everything else you may want to see and experience in London. Brown's Is At The Top Of Our List!"
August 2014,Amazing Experience,"We stayed at The Brown's Hotel in London for 3 nights.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was magnificent.  The rooms were very spacious.  Customer service was outstanding.  The concierge was very helpful with everything we asked for.  They take the time and have the patience. The hotel is well located in the Mayfair Area.  It was close to buses, and tube.  We walked to Piccadilly, was to far at all.   The staff was great, everything I asked for was looked after, with as smile. We had breakfast included, which was amazing, they have great Latte's.  Would definitely recommend The Brown's Hotel.  Barbara Montreal , Quebec"
August 2014,Perfect Location,"Beautiful hotel in the heart of Mayfair.........Perfect location for great restaurants and for shopping in London......Warm, professional and friendly service....very comfortable rooms......enjoy a nice treatment in the spa! "
September 2014,The best afternoon tea in London,Have stayed here a few times. But not recently. We had our wedding reception here in 2009. And stayed for our anniversary in 2010.   On Saturday we took overseas visitors for high tea.   Excellent as always. The pink champagne special at £220 for two is hardly in everyone's budget!  But. The quality and service and ambience are world class.   They will refill your cakes and scones till you beg for mercy.   I wouldn't go anywhere else for posh afternoon tea  
August 2014,Lovely old fashioned and homely tea,This was my third visit to Browns. As always the staff are lovely helpful and willing to chat but unobtrusive.  The sandwiches were delicious as ever. The scones with a lovely sheen and very tasty. The cakes were lovely - very homemade feel about them and absolutely gorgeous. Love this teA place and will go back. I love the seating so comfortable and homely.  Very relaxing.  Definitely recommend. 
July 2014,Hotel In Mayfair,"We recently traveled to London and spent two nights at the Brown Hotel. It is located in the heart of Mayfair, but on a side street so it is quiet.  We were pleasantly upgraded to a larger room and had a small sitting area as well as a beautiful bathroom.  The staff is extremely professional and answered any question with a smile on their face.  As a member of the Leading Hotels of the World we received complimentary breakfast each day which was an English buffet. It was more then enough and the smoked salmon was delicious.    With its great location touring and shopping was only a walk away.  We never had to take a cab except going to the Belgravia area for a walking tour.  Great hotel in great location with 5 star service."
July 2014,Great London hotel,"Stayed here recently and is a great London hotel. The hotel is made up of a series go old town houses and so has the typical charm of an English hotel. Location wise, it is great, just off of Piccadilly, it is a few minutes walk from Piccadilly Circus & Green park, although it's location on Dover Street means that it is nice & quiet - I had a room on the first floor & had very little noise.  The bar has a great cocktail menu - main problem is choosing a drink from the long menu, although the ""in house"" specialist cocktails are recommended "
July 2014,Afternoon Tea at 6:30pm - Perfect,"I felt the experience of an afternoon tea was a necessity for our family's first visit to England.  Time and research got away from me and I made the reservation the day of the seating - a Saturday (the last seating is earlier during the week).  I was right to feel lucky.  The servings there are unlimited but it's good to let your waiter know that you may be interested in another serving.  It was a proper tea with silver flatware and teapots (dripless), crisp white linens with intimate table arrangements.  The room was also visually perfect as I wanted more old english (think medium stained oak paneling/ wainscoting) - deep red, brown or taupe seats of suede or velvet with leather trim rather than crystals and shiny.  The lighting fixtures were a bit of a surprise - midcentury…"
July 2014,Great experience,We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our visit. The room (upgraded to deluxe) was large and had all of the amenities we wanted. The service everywhere was excellent. We had a late dinner at the hotel restaurant - Hix Mayfair - that was also excellent and had a wide variety of entrees. I had fish and chips and my wife had rack of lamb. The bar was busy and good and we loved that they rebuilt the entire holel but left the main room for afternoon tea as it was.It is probably the best location in London - almost everything was within a relatively short walk - 20 minutes. The buffet continental breakfast was very good. We highly recommend Brown's to everyone.
May 2014,Afternoon delight,"This was a 70th birthday gift from my niece - champagne afternoon tea in London. We chose Brown's as my brother recommended it and were not disappointed. The atmosphere was sophisticated yet welcoming. The staff were attentive and pleasant. They did not rush at all so we were able to relax and enjoy the delicious fare. Dress code stated smart, and we, along with the staff and most of the guests followed this code. However I was disappointed to see some sloppily dressed guests and this spoiled it a little. This was a special day for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
July 2014,Home away from home,"Just recently stayed in this hotel and it was amazing. Everything thing about it, service, room, staff... it was great and I will absolutely stay here again. Great location as to not a lot of road noise yet can walk to everything you may need or want. Really great area!"
April 2014,"Browns, Beautiful","When travelling, Our family have a tendency to move between two luxury hotel chains. One is the Shangri-la and the other Rocco Forte. We had chosen Browns as we had started our trip with the Charles in Munich and knew if we were to fly for 24 hours home, we would want to be pampered before hand. Browns certainly didn't disappoint. Arriving on a thursday afternoon, the service was swift from the Concerge and we were in the Hotel in matter of seconds. Served straight away for Check in the children were given their own welcome backs with special request forms for the children. We were personally escorted to our rooms by front desk staff. A Room opposite Tiffanys is always a delight! We were given tours of our room and shown how to use all the amenities. (I really like this as most…"
June 2014,A Memorable Return,"I've stayed at Brown's several times, and have experienced it in different stages of decor and repair. Though the interiors may change, there are constants that do not: Brown's is the quietest, roomiest, loveliest sleep in London. True to its history, it does not feel like a hotel. It feels like a stay in a lovely, highly attentive Mayfair home, with privacy and services. As always, the concierge staff at Brown's is absolutely superb and will do anything needed to help with your stay which they did plenty of for us. The tea service remains remarkable. Again, the best in London. Cozy, welcoming, fresh and delicious. So comfortable and easy to linger over. That said, there was a small stumble at check-in that was overcome. I cannot stress to hotels how important the check-in…"
July 2014,Fabulous Food & Friendly Place,"We visited the restaurant with friends to celebrate a birthday.  My son was the only non adult in attendance.  The restaurant made everyone feel welcome.  They even brought my son stuff to do at the table to keep him entertained.   The food was amazing.  I had a salmon starter, lamb main and most of us had the amazing chocolate pud with mint ice cream.  The food was really delicous. Would definitely go back."
June 2014,Stylish bar in the heart of Mayfair,I work locally so this is a great place to catchup with friends and colleagues when meeting space is booked out. The Donovan bar is quite dark and can be noisy but the seats are comfortable and the service good. Whilst the drinks prices are scary they are are in keeping with other similar establishments in the area. My martini was excellent and the nibbles more than compensated for the bill.
July 2014,Afternoon Tea?,"Welcoming, attentive, unobtrusive service, with a perfect selection of delectable offerings. Ruinart champangne completes the whole tea experience. This was my third visit and this time I brought along my sisters - high standards expected - and once again - delivered. Having previously tried afternoon tea at the Ritz, I'd suggest you take a short walk up Albemarle."
August 2013,First class in every respect,"When it was first suggested I stay at Brown's, I wa dubious. How could it possiby be worth the rates they were charging? I was wrong - it is worth every penny. From the moment you arrive at Brown.s, you are treated like royalty. Each room is unique. I have stayed at Brown's now 5 times - no two rooms have been the same. The rooms are spotlessly clean, well maintained and remarkably quiet. They are by no means opukent, but there is an understated elegance about them.  Breakfast at the hotel is a must. There is an extensive cold food buffet (smoked salmon, breads, yoghurts, fruits) and each guest also chooses one cooked to order dish from the menu. Afternoon tea is another highlight. A lovely dining room, superb food, attentive (whtout ever being intrusive) service. We travel to…"
June 2014,Fantastic location,"I stayed for 5 nights in mid-June.  I booked a deluxe king but did not like the room they had assigned to me.  It was a unique layout with the bedroom right when you walk in and a little sitting room/desk area that connected to the large bathroom.  The room itself was fine but it looked out directly to a brick wall so it felt very claustrophobic to me.  I stayed two nights and then asked to switch rooms and that was much better.  It faced out to the main street but I saw Tiffany's and that was fine.  I worried a little about excess noise preventing me from sleeping but I never heard much.  The bed was not as comfortable as I am used to with pillow top mattresses but it wasn't lumpy or anything like that.    The front desk staff, the bell staff and the concierge were very…"
April 2014,I loved it,"This hotel is out of the ordinary in that it shows it's age in a unique way.  The very first of it's kind in London, it has hosted most of the crowned heads of Europe & other notables down the centuries. Atmosphere is warm, friendly & welcoming & staff attentive.  Don't go for the views as there are none.  I went for a comfortable night & a good meal & I wasn't disappointed. Mark Hix's cuisine is to be recommended.  If you are looking for bland, corporate, don't bother, but if you fncy something with a history, a bit quirky - highly recommended."
June 2014,Amazing stay at the this upscale boutique hotel in Mayfair.,The staff at this hotel is wonderful and attentive. I love the location- quiet street. So easy to walk to  many key areas. Donovan Bar is very cool. Artsy photos on the walls. Old world with an edge. The rooms are the same...love the combination of the modern and old. Fabulous English breakfast. Great concierge. The hotel cannot do enough for you. I highly recommend this hotel if you like 5 star unpretentious luxury.
June 2014,"Go for drinks or a meal, not for the hotel","Excellent restaurant, tea room and bar. Disappointing as a hotel: - Very poor soundproofing: lots of noise from the street at night. The alternative is a courtyard view, but the courtyard looks sinister. - The blinds in the room were too short (!), allowing way too much daylight in the early morning. - Tiny spa, without any steam room or sauna. On the plus side, the hotel staff is charming. Will not go back to the hotel."
April 2014,My favourite hotel,"I have stayed at Brown's several times in the past years. It is my absolute favourite hotel with the perfect location, friendly staff, lovely afternoon tea and a great bar. My last stay this spring was perfect as always. I was with my husband and we stayed in a wonderful room (which is now our new favourite room). It was my birthday while we were there and when we came back to the hotel in the evening a beautiful birthday cake was waiting for us in our room. After a fantastic breakfast in the morning we left Brown's wishing to return as soon as possible."
June 2014,Very disappointing - not as good as other RF hotels,"We stayed at Browns Hotel for 2 nights having stayed at a couple of other Rocco Forte properties expecting the same standard. What a disappointment. Yes Browns has history and a good location but the rooms and many of the public areas were tired and in need of some tlc. Our room felt like an after thought - the minibar door couldn't open fully due to location against a table, the sofa was off to the side so to watch tv you had to move the tv ( not an a turntable ), you couldn't watch tv in bed unless you sat up as the bed end was to high, the bathroom was tired and when using the toilet you actually felt like it was going to pull off the timber wall. The corridors were in need of a refurb. Generally the room was not up to the RF standard one would expect especially when paying…"
June 2014,Afternoon tea with a sense of occasion,"We enjoyed afternoon tea sitting in comfortable arm chairs in a wood-panelled room with a pianist playing discretely in the background. The service was quietly efficient, the food generous and the highlight was the delicious scones, jam and clotted cream. It was expensive, but so very British, and a lovely way to spend the afternoon."
May 2014,So glad we gave Brown's a second chance,"My first stay at the hotel (with my daughter) had been a little underwhelming but at the hotel's request I was invited to give them a second chance and I'm so pleased I did. As a returning customer Brown's couldn't have welcomed hubby and I more warmly. We stayed in a junior suite and were delighted with the extra space. The hotel treated us to complimentary fruit, water, tea and coffee making facilities. Shortly after arrival we thoroughly enjoyed our champagne afternoon tea (which was on the house to make up for a previous disappointment). Last time, at the end of Afternoon Tea, I thought it was a nice touch that the hotel presented you with a sample of your tea to take home - this didn't happen this time and I wasn't going to complain about such a small oversight - simply to…"
April 2014,Fabulous hotel,"Spent 3 days at this wonderful hotel, loved the place, the service, wonderful breakfast and absolutely amazingly comfy beds. Wee had a spacious room #317 ..Hotel  Location is perfect..you can walk to most places and we did. Would highly recommend this lovely hotel and will stay there again when we return to London."
April 2014,"Great location, service and quality","My husband really likes staying in Rocco Forte properties and Browns fully met his expectation of the brand's excellence. The gym is rather small but you have Green, St. James and Hyde parks a few blocks away so my gym needs were more than met.   The afternoon tea service in the hotel is a must try. Easier to get a slot for this if you're staying at the hotel.   The hotel, while not completely memorable, was comfortable with no negative experience. The staff was friendly and helpful. Would stay here again."
April 2014,Great for families with babies ,Stayed here for Mother's Day with my four month old son and husband. The room  was beautiful and had truly catered for my baby with changing mat and a whole host of other baby essentials! Staff at the hotel realised that it was my first Mother's Day and I was presented with flowers in my room ... Such a lovely gesture. Hotel itself is well located with bond street and regent street just a walk away. Staff are friendly and go above and beyond. Will definitely be visiting again for my London fix. 
March 2014,incredible,"We had a fantastic experience, first class in all aspects!!! Service was impeccable, beds were unbelievably comfortable Food / room service was great The bar has an incredible photo collection , and the cocktails are amazing"
February 2014,excellence,"we stayed 2 nights here recently and cannot fault this London landmark from arrival to departure we received first class service. the room service was exceptional with great variety and wonderful extra 'touches'  Overall we really cannot get over how good the staff are, a special trip made even more special by them."
March 2014,Stayed at weekend,"Watched BOD S last match and it was wonderful. The match and the hotel. Decided on a last minute night here, from the moment we arrived everything top notch. Interesting i saw a trip advisor review which said don't stay in 206 , so instead of internet booking call the hotel to arrange. Very nice  lady on reservations when I said not that room and she explained that she felt the comment unfair , they have since made changes but either way I ended up with a really nice room. Hotel is a bit stiff but really excellent location and service."
March 2014,The Donovan Bar - Expensive Disappointment!,"I met friends for a drink here last night and was looking forward to a fabulous Mojito. At £15 a pop, you might expect a good cocktail but what I got was nothing short of a disaster! There are three things that I expect from a Mojito: Rum, mint and lime, but it was lacking in all regards. They couldn't be bothered to muddle the mint - leaving a small bushy sprig atop the tall glass, there was also some sort of carbonised lime slice with a cinnamon dusting as a garnish. Great venue, disappointing cocktails."
February 2014,Great location in Mayfair,"My husband and I have now stayed twice in this hotel for Christmas shopping in dec and again in February. The hotel is in a great location to walk to selfridges and also to fortnum & masons and of course right beside Bond Street.  The staff are very friendly and when we arrived back laden with shopping the doormen took our shopping and delivered it to our room. We have stayed previously at The Langam, The Sofitel St James, The Westbury and even Claridges and much prefer Brown's as it is smaller, less stuffy than Claridges and just seems to hit the mark."
March 2014,Stylish but expected more,"Stayed three night on a business trip, very stylish hotel, rooms are extremely big and convenient.  One major comment, too many steps between the elevator and the room, which make it really annoying if you're traveling light with trolley..."
May 2014,Birthday treat,"Having reached a special birthday I decided to celebrate by having a special afternoon with a friend. This was our first visit and first impressions were of a wonderful intimate room for afternoon tea with wonderful attention by all the staff. Nothing was too much trouble as we were plied with a delicious selection of sandwiches , tiny warm scones with clotted cream and home made jam followed by tiny cakes and a piece of Victoria sandwich or cherry and almond tart. We were offered many pots of tea - white nettle and many refills of the different food. It may seem expensive but is value for money when considering the amount of food on offer. Despite the menu stating that our table was available for 90 minutes, we were allowed to stay an hour longer without any pressure to leave.…"
May 2014,Lovely hotel with even lovelier staff!,"We had the pleasure of staying here for one night this weekend - our first visit to Browns.  Our welcome was great - excellent concierge who introduced himself to us(George) and good check in. We were taken to our room and left to settle into our Executive room. We then realised we were overlooking the inner workings of the hotel which was pretty grim. We asked to move and decided to upgrade to a more expensive Deluxe room (205) for a street outlook. It was great with plenty of light/windows. However we were a little disappointed (hence the 4 star and not 5) as on their web it says we would have a double sink, separate shower and walk in wardrobe. We didn't have any of those and the shower was not great and water was only warm not hot - bathroom needed an upgrade we thought. Bed…"
May 2014,First class in every way,"My daughter and I have just had one night at Brown's Hotel and could not fault our stay.  From arrival to departure with a wonderful afternoon tea inbetween everything was perfect....truly first class in every way.  The staff were so welcoming, warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  It really was a wonderful experience."
April 2014,Class Act,"Great location in central London. A London treasure.  You feel like you've been transported to another time....wonderful service from the entire staff.  The bar at the Hotel is wonderful and very comfortable, the restaurant at the Hotel has very fine food and a top notch breakfast that is equally efficient (buffet available) and high quality.  The room we had was very large and well appointed, we had a large walk-in closet and a room layout that made it seem like a one bedroom apartment.  The bathroom was large and very well appointed with towel warmer and beautiful clean lines (rare for such an old and grand hotel).  All in all, a treat. Brown's Hotel was a big part of our wonderful trip to London."
April 2014,Old School Class,I had the fortunate pleasure of staying at browns and relishing the old schol charm and art of serivice and hospitaility very hard to find these days. From the doorman to the chambermaid all our there to help make your life easier and smoother. Location is right bang in the centre of where you want to be in London. Great stay...
April 2014,Superb Lunch with friends.,"Friends staying here and visited for lunch. It was very good indeed. Love the new makeover, much brighter and fresher.  Terrific service from the landmark hotel and well cooked food, will return soon as told the sunday lunch is the best at the moment in London"
December 2013,Amazing afternoon tea!!!!!!,"We had read some of the reviews of afternoon tea and they were right - it is amazing!!!!!!!!!  We were seated near the fireplace and found the food, ambience and staff just amazing!!!  The food was unlimited and they were more than happy to cater for vegetarians and gluten free.  The minute we finished a plate we were offered another - non stop!!!  The selection of teas was amazing - staff were happy to let us try many different varieties.  We were there for over two hours - we never felt rushed at any stage.  There was a piano playing in the background which added to the atmosphere - to say we were impressed was an understatement!!!  Best afternoon tea we have ever experienced.  Highly recommended!!!"
March 2014,Consistently good ,"Stayed at Browns twice in March and was again very pleased with service from the front door to the bar, lounge and restaurant. However choice of rooms is key and even the slightest upgrade produces better results. Smaller internal rooms are to be avoided particularly for a weary traveller with too much time in planes. I travelled across Greater London extensively and the chauffeured cars arranged by concierge were efficient and friendly. With a couple of 4.30am starts the early morning tea and bakery were also very much appreciated. "
December 2013,Splendid London Mayfair Hotel oozing in history!,"We were fortunate enough to spend a few days in London just after the hustle and bustle of Christmas. The hotel is in a splendid location in Mayfair and it was still decked with all the Christmas decorations and this gave it a festive and cosy English home feel to it. Not that it needs Christmas decorations to make it feel homely! This historic hotel, reputed to be one of the first to open its doors in London, is warm and welcoming and the staff's attention to detail and courteous service make one feel very welcome indeed. The afternoon tea is legendary, the service impeccable but it does get slightly noisy as a result of the extreme popularity of this great British tradition here at Brown's! The food is very well prepared and very well served and the rooms comfortable and very…"
April 2014,Excellent and charming hotel in top location,"We spent a weekend at the Brown's and we're definitely satisfied about our stay. A few things can nevertheless be improved: keep the Dover entrance open all time (we had to tour around the block to use the other entrance in the evening and on the whole Sunday), make WIFI free and available from all rooms, get the air-con checked because it does too much noise. STAFF IS FANTASTIC AND ALWAYS AT YOUR SERVICE. good breakfast."
March 2014,Second stay since January,"Impromptu weekend escape back to Browns. Thank you for accommodating us very last minute on Friday night! Lovley room, stunning bed! Service as always was perfect. Thank you too for storing our shopping in the fridge! Please pass our good wishes to Johnny, we were sorry to have missed him and wish him well got a speedy recovery. So if you are staying in London you would be silly not to book yourselves into this stylish classic and perfect hotel "
November 2013,Fantastic food & service,"Popped in for a quick bite to eat and glass of wine, staff amazing very helpful and very professional.  We sat at the bar, great seats food was really good, great atmosphere and standards and service was faultless"
October 2013,"Just one night, but great experience","I satyed at the Brown´s for the 2nd time in October. Lovely spacious rrom, friendly staff and a bar you never want to leave again. Location is great, close to business and tourist areas. I will def go again."
November 2013,Fantastic Hotel,"This is the place to stay in London if you want to treat yourself to a touch of luxury, style, and service It is not your everyday hotel because a Double room cost in the region of £400 per night, which is expensive even by London standards.  I stayed here for two nights with my wife, and from beginning to end we were superbly looked after. We planned a shopping trip in London around a business function, and so arrived early for check in. No problem, our luggage was whisked away into storage, and our car valet parked. When we returned from shopping, to check in we were given a room upgrade and our luggage had already been taken to our room. The room was lovely with a truly King size bed. My only criticism was a lack of long hanging space in the wardrobe.Otherwise, everything…"
November 2013,Tea For Two,"We booked the afternoon tea at Browns and it was such a treat! We were warmly welcomed by the staff and shown to our comfortable armchairs, in the traditional, wood panelled lounge. The pianist was playing just a few yards away, yet was not intrusive as the staff helped with the choice from the tea menus.The service was efficient, friendly and informative; the ambience perfect. This place is classy rather than posh! The food itself was delicious and worthy of such a reputable, five star establishment.The sandwiches were mouth-wateringly good and we were duly brought a second round. After this, we started on the delectable scones-buttery, light and with an amazingly fresh strawberry jam and clotted cream! Wonderful! A cup of refreshing Darjeeling,(second flush), later and we…"
November 2013,Wonderful!!!,"What a wonderful experience!! From the moment the doorman opened the taxi door you felt you had arrived somewhere very special. I'd booked afternoon tea for my wife's 50th birthday and we certainly weren't disappointed. The atmosphere was fantastic with the pianist playing in the background and we were treated to lovely fresh sandwiches, tea, pastries and cakes all served by friendly, attentive and knowledgable staff. There was no hint of being rushed and we enjoyed 2 amazing hours being waited on. Even a small birthday cake with a candle was served on a plate inscribed with 'Happy Birthday' in chocolate - a lovely little touch. Thank you to a wonderful team that know how to treat guests - how refreshing to know that this high level of service still exists."
November 2013,its really very good,"I really recommend the Browns hotel for very good traditional service and excellent food . I have not actually had the high tea, however whilst I was having a late lunch I noticed most of the diners around us were enjoying afternoon tea and it looked delightful. We ordered a light bite from the bar menu and it was beautifully presented and delicious, we had the crab and trio of mini burgers that came with fries. Together with a few glasses of pink champagne and lovely comfortable surroundings and helpful discreet staff we had a lovely afternoon and didn't want to leave. I thoroughly enjoy this hotel and it never disappoints. Great if you want a break from shopping or for just meeting friends/clients."
October 2013,Best High Tea in London,"On our first day in London we enjoyed the high tea experience at Browns.  This set the tone for the rest of our wonderful trip.  The staff, the ambience and the tea with all the accompaniments was first rate.   The traditional service included an unlimited amount of the delicious tea sandwiches, pastries, scones and cake.  Our waiter Giuseppe was as gracious and welcoming as can be and was attentive to our every request, including taking our table picture.  The maître d' Andre also took time with us and attended to each beautiful detail.  I highly recommend Browns as the top choice for afternoon tea while in London."
November 2013,The Best Afternoon Tea in London!,"There can't be another better afternoon tea service offered by the ""best of the best"" in London, which already includes Brown's Hotel way up on the list.  The maitre d' and tea sommelier was so knowledgeable and helpful, and our waitperson, a lovely young woman named Anna, could not have been more pleasant and attentive.  The food was delicious and, unlike many other places, if you just loved those little crustless sandwiches to distraction, they would keep them coming.  And the strawberry jam made in their kitchen, without preservatives and therefore, unbelievably delicious, just makes those fabulous little scones something to write home about!  The setting is beautiful, the selection of teas and cakes terrific and if you are lucky enough to have Anna to take care of you, it's…"
October 2013,perfect treat,"such of beautiful moment to share with your family, something that you always remember, best present you can ever make, afternoon tea at the Brown's hotel. the atmosphere is great and Luxury, the piano player, the delicious food and the even more attentive service is what you already expect in a 5* Hotel, but in here everything is just amazing, and all team are there working in order to exceed your expectative. Only I can say, I went twice in one week I spent in London."
October 2013,"So British, so personal","I recently went to England on a girl's trip with my mother and sister-in-law, we spent the first few days in London and stayed at Brown's which was lovely.  We had beautifully spacious clean room, with all the modern conveniences.  We enjoyed the continental breakfast every day which was more than adequate and tasty, lunch was good as was afternoon tea.  The only complaint is the extra charge for wifi!  The concierge was friendly and helpful."
August 2014,Excellent service...and their lattes are THE BEST,"Browns hotel is a favorite in London. Perfect location, welcoming staff, stylish decorated and a georgeous breakfast. I do think the standard rooms are a bit too small for the price though and some with a pretty bad view."
September 2013,"Afternoon Tea, good but not great","I stayed here with my husband and our three kids.  We were able to get adjoining rooms, which we were thrilled to stay in an older historic hotel and still have adjoining rooms.  This hotel is centrally located, and is really quite nice.  The service is impeccable and the rooms were spacious and very clean.  The breakfast buffet was great with a variety of options for my kids and the lattes in the morning were some of the best I'd ever had.  Maybe it was the jet lag, but I'd go back just for the latte!"
August 2014,Fantastic Hotel,"Afternoon Tea is one of my real favourite treats & having tried many establishments in London and the home counties I feel that I can honestly report that although this was good, it really was not great & I have had better especially for the price!  The beautiful lounge area, split into three rooms with the pianist is unsurpassable. Spotless crisp linen, ticking every box visually. We had comfortable armchairs by the fireplace, but you may want to ask for a higher table as some are low coffee table styles & sofas which some people would not find easily accessible or comfortable.   There was a lovely welcome and the staff are all delightful. My friend treated me for my Birthday and we had chosen Browns specifically. The sandwiches are all freshly made and yes you can have more…"
August 2014,Cosy and central located hotel in London.,We stayed at hotel for 3 nights on a family vacation and the stay was great. The service at the hotel was outstanding. The location was perfect and it was truly enjoyed by the whole family. Keep up the great work!
August 2014,Classic Elegance in heart of London,"We stayed there 4 days. The hotel lies centrally in Mayfair, so due to dense traffic the taxi ride was about 45 min from the Eurostar station. It lies within walking distance of most shopping areas,historical landmarks and museums. Welcoming doormen and staff, reception lies at the end of the corridor. Check in was fast, we had luxury rooms. Rooms were not shown. Entrance of the rooms was with cardkeys,one to open door  another to put electricity on. The rooms were relatively large,one had inner courtyard view,the other view of Albemarle Street. Rooms have several windows,the one with inner courtyard view faces large walls of the tiny courtyard with on the ground large ventilation tubes somewhat masked by green vegetation in pots, the other one faced the roofs of surroundings.…"
August 2014,Quaint hotel and nice location,"I have just stayed at Browns Hotel on Albemarle Street in Mayfair for two nights). I was fortunate enough to be in a Junior Suite, which was extremely spacious and beautifully decorated. Upon arrival, there was a tray of petit fours, a fruit basket, bottles of highland water and a bottle of chilled white wine (always a good start!). The staff were particularly attentive (not always the case in 5* hotels) and could not have done more; I would particularly like to single out Stella and Lewis on Reception, James and John on the Concierge Desk and the very tall waiter at breakfast. The air of understated elegance pervades throughout the hotel and guests' requests are met efficiently and timely. The hotel is also in one of the best locations possible in London - in the heart of…"
July 2014,Disappointing guest rooms,"This was our first stay at Brown's and we both enjoyed it. We booked through American Express which got us an upgrade to an Executive room and an £85 food and beverage credit.  The room was well sized, on two levels and as with other older hotels in London it does have character (this is with regard to the floors which aren't all perfect!!)  Huge bathroom with a very powerful shower and deep bath. Good air conditioning in the room which helped as it was a hot weekend when we stayed. One minor point - we think the room would benefit from curtains with blackout backing as opposed to the roman blind which is currently there - this did leak through light into the room.  By using the £85 credit we booked a champagne tea (for 2 of us). It was a nice tea but not as good, in our…"
June 2014,Like home - but better!,"This review compares Brown's to the other ""five star"" hotels I've stayed at in London, including Claridges and The Savoy.  It does not compare.  The common areas are quite nice.  But the rooms are truly pedestrian.  I felt as if I were staying in a U.S. business-hotel chain.  At 300 pounds a night, I expected more."
May 2014,Charming Traditional-Style Hotel in Ideal Location,"This is an intimate, historic, beautiful hotel in an absolutely perfect location in London. My husband and I just returned and cannot wait to go back! The staff is welcoming, helpful, knowledgable and efficient. The bar and restaurant scene is fabulous, Donovan Bar is especially fun!  Our room was gorgeous, beautifully designed and well-appointed.  The vibe of this hotel is traditional, elegant and cozy. We would return in a heartbeat and hope to very soon."
May 2014,Nice hotel shame about the tea,"When my mother tried to convince me she was born in London centuries ago, rather than chide her, I took her there.  Well, she didn't recognize anything there, but we did have an interesting stay at Brown's Hotel.  The staff gave us impeccable service (Afternoon Tea is not to be missed).  The room was less than modern and did not have air conditioning, but we adjusted quite well.  Next time, I would stay in a more 21st Century-type of hotel, but for nostalgia, this place is excellent.  Ideal location as well..."
October 2013,Wonderful Hotel in Mayfair,"The hotel is located well, not far from Green Park and The Ritz. Staff were good and attentive. The doorman was particularly excellent. Rooms were well furnished with quality everything. The bed was so comfortable. The bar prices were very ""Mayfair"". Very. Where the hotel let my wife down was the total absence of in-room tea-making facilities, a usual feature of English hotels. She loves an early cup of tea, made to her exact liking. We supposed this was some strange hotel management belief making a perfect cup of tea was beneath their guests. Wrong Mr Manager."
May 2014,Very British,"Brown’s Hotel is very very good.  It is in a fantastic location in Mayfair, very close to Piccadilly, and surrounded by some excellent restaurants, shops and arcades. The service is excellent. We ate in HIX restaurant one night; the food, wine and service all very good. The room (we had an Executive King) was fairly plain, but quite spacious, comfortable and we enjoyed it. Bathroom was good but not luxurious. It is the oldest hotel in London and the owners have done a very good job in keeping it to a 5 star standard. The turndown service was excellent with little cards to tell us the weather for the next day and little samples of skin products: a nice touch compared to the usual chocolates. The doormen always ready with a warm welcome.  We felt quite at home at Browns; nothing…"
May 2014,Birthday Weekend Away,"I booked the Browne´s for my graduation from Business School in 2012 and stayed there for two nights. You quickly realize that the team is versed in their business. The service is experienced, when I asked for an iPod player, I got it - unfortunately, you have to ask. The building is old and a bit contorted, but in best shape. The interior is well designed, so you can feel comfortable. The hotel is ideally located in the heart of London. I experienced the high-end-restaurant in the ground floor, which offers a very English cuisine. At all, the Browne´s is very British; distinguished, professional, elegant. If you like that - book it; I decided to try other hotels in London, to feel more home."
June 2013,"Great hotel , great room ..... Terrible noise intrusion","I can not express how amazing Brown's hotel is, from the minute of checking inn, the staff had such a friendly and professional welcome for us,  i took my partner away for his birthday and upon entering our room we were pleasantly surprised with a beautiful chocolate birthday cake and bottle of bubbly chilled, the room was a perfect size and was just like being at home.  The concierge staff helped me with picking out nice restaurants and pubs in the area. The in room dining was so tasty and the staff very efficient.  All smiles from everyone and never did you feel out of place in any area of the hotel, Amazing location, great price and just a perfect weekend. Thank you for bringing back the friendly and caring hospitality to what it should be."
March 2014,afternoon tea,"What a fantastic location , easy access to west end shopping and restaurants and a fantastic atmosphere within the hotel , BUT oh room 206 ..... Under no circumstances accept this room on a sat night as you will hear , cars screeching , police sirens , drunken folk from the Dover st wine bar into the wee hours .... Such terrible awful noise , no double glazing and endless all night long loud traffic noise and shouting ... You have been warned !   Otherwise great hotel , superb restaurant , buzzy bar .... as ever though almost impossible to make ones self understood by room service ... Breakfast arrived in duplicate but hey .... Was too tired after the worst night s sleep in a 5 star for many a year !"
March 2014,Another wonderful stay,"four of us went here for a 60th birthday celebration, it was casual dress but smart. The setting was exactly the same very casual with settees and big comfy arm chairs. There was a good variety of sandwiches that kept being replemished as soon as the plate was empty. Then came the mini scones warm with cream and jam yum yum, then victoria sponge of coffee cake, to be followed by more mini cake selections, Tea to drink until you could drink no more, by the time we left we where stuffed to the brim. Staff where good and there for every little whim you may have. We have visted the ritz but preferred the relaxed atmosphere at Browns. Just be wary their is a 20% service charge included in the bill."
February 2014,You can't knock it,"We are never disappointed by this hotel.  Fabulous rooms, happy and helpful staff and the most comfortable beds.  Everything is immaculate with great attention to detail, can't recommend this hotel enough."
January 2014,"Lovely, however","We stayed over Christmas at this, my mother-in-law's favourite London hotel. The service as always was excellent, our rooms, spacious, comfortable and bright. Afternoon tea in our room was a joy and dinner in the restaurant impeccable. You pay a lot of money to stay at Brown's, but you know you can expect excellent, professional standards in everything they offer - we are never disappointed when we choose this hotel. Stay here, you will not be disappointed."
December 2013,Good location,"We stayed at Browns for the first time for my husband's birthday. The hotel is very start, the staff are extremely professional, as you would expect,  in particular John the doorman.  The evening ""turn- down"" service made us smile- slippers placed on a sheet, eye gel on the pillow etc. The bed was so comfortable but unfortunately we were kept awake from 5:30 as a result of a party in a nearby room. The night staff were aware of this because they delivered room service on several occasions but didn't appear to be concerned about the music & loud noise. The staff delivering the party food & drink spoke at normal volume even apologising to the party room because they'd had a delay in service! When we we t for breakfast the music was still on & I told reception at check-out. Johan…"
January 2014,Good choice,Location is very good. Hotel rooms are very good. Breakfast was also good. The only thing we were disappointed was the staff working in afternoon tea room. There where lots of staf but nothing happend. We had to wait an hour to get our lunch. The bar was exelent. The bartenders were great! Real professonals!
January 2014,Peonies better than at Chelsea Flower Show!,"Very good location,good service,breakfast is great .I like generally Rocco Forte Hotels.This one has a boutique hotel character.It is expensive as every good hotel in London.Corridors are narrow and ceilings are very low.This ıs ofcourse due to the character of the old building"
March 2014,Classy but unpretentious and friendly,"We had another lovely night's stay at Browns Hotel this week - as always there was a warm welcome from the doorman through to all the rest of the staff.  The big WOW on arrival was the stunning, stunning huge arrangements of beautiful peonies - better than I saw at Chelsea earlier in the week.  This stay lived up to our very high expectations from past visits - we enjoyed drinks and delicious eats in the buzzing bar before going out and a wonderful breakfast the following morning with the full works including gluten free toast for me.  The beds seem larger and more comfortable every stay guaranteeing the best of night's sleep.  We will be back!!"
April 2014,Classy but pricey Mayfair institution,"We had wanted to stay at Brown's for a number of years and in particular to have their much praised afternoon tea. My wife' special birthday gave us the excuse to book. Having made the booking we then angst a little on what to wear for afternoon tea and a dinner in Hix Mayfair, and weren't sure if we were going to feel underdressed or out of place. We needn't have worried on both counts as there was a mix of casual and smart dress and from the moment we arrived and jumped out of our cab all the staff were most welcoming and from the start made us feel at home.  Afternoon tea was the quintessential English experience that other reviews have summed up so well. Service was attentive and informative and an afternoon of gentle enjoyment of teas, sandwiches and fine cakes is not to be…"
May 2014,"An oasis of peace, serenity & luxurious Class !","Everything about Brown's is effortless. This is a confident 5 star establishment that knows its place in firmament of traditional London Hotels. Unlike places like the Ritz its not full of flash wannabes. It just oozes class and sophistication and has an easy charm that comes with confidence in everything they do. Location is second to none. If you choose to stay in a 5 star hotel, in the most expensive part of the most expensive city in Europe you know there will be a commensurate price tag. And it can be eye watering. Not helped by the fact that a service charge is added to everything it seems. I'd say the only minor disappointment is the Hix restaurant. In truth the food is average and a bit staid but you'll pay Michelin Star prices."
August 2014,Excellent but...........,"Brown's Hotel in the heart of Mayfair provided 5 star opulence balanced with friendly, professional staff. We had 2 nights in the hotel , everything from checking in to collecting our bags on departure was handled with great care. We visited with our 12 year old Daughter & 8 year old son, we enjoyed uninterrupted sleep on both nights ( a first for us in a City Hotel )! Having been fortunate to have stayed in most of the capitals top hotels, I feel that Brown's has hit the perfect balance. Congratulations to the management & staff."
July 2014,Lovely hotel in wonderful location,"I want to give this place 5 stars but I cannot.  Overall, this is a classy hotel with excellent service throughout.  Our room was well appointed and very comfortable.  BUT, for the price, there were several flaws.  The TV was old and the channel choices were not as extensive as they should have been.  WIFI service from the desk are of the room was fine but from the bed area it was not nearly what it should have been.  Thus, if you wished to use your IPAD or phone from bed, it was a problem.  Also, there was no coffee maker in the room.  I would certainly stay here again but only if these issues had been addressed.  Overall, I still have to say it is a wonderful hotel."
July 2014,Homely Luxury in English Tradition,"Good to finally check out London’s oldest 5-star hotel.  Behind old facades are modern rooms all luxuriously appointed, very spacious, and designed with attention to details. Above all the atmosphere is very homely, very English, with impeccable service. Rocco Forte is one of my most respected names in hotels and great that each hotel has its own individuality and character. I had stayed at Frankfurt and Florence years ago and when I checked in at Brown’s the reception had all my details including even my preferred newspaper.  The dining breakfast is very good with an extensive menu including an interesting Indian course.  A most pleasant stay right in city centre."
January 2014,really nice hortel in perfect location,"We have tried many hotels in London and we found the one suited to our tastes. We stayed for two nights in a standard room : very big for London, tastefully decorated with such a comfy large bed and a very nice big bathroom. Our room was also very quiet but with a view on the backyard (maybe not the best view but as a result, not a noise in the morning).  The breakfast was really good (try the hot chocolate and you wont have to have lunch afterwards!). The staff was charming and for us, had just the right attitude : smily, friendly and helpful. And of course, you cant beat the location : everything is in walking distance. We will go back."
January 2014,Still a first class Hotel Bar,"Donovan Bar is a bar that when we come to London, we always pop in for a couple of drinks. Great service in this long establish hotel. Maybe slightly pricier than other Park Lane Hotel bars. We always sit at the bar and chat to great bar staff."
December 2013,Wonderful Experience!,"Brown's is a boutique hotel with older architecture and more modern furnishings.  A really nice combination of the two!  The rooms are very large and nicely appointed.  Service was wonderful too.  The breakfast is servied in Hix Restaurant which is lovely.  The Bar is also spacious and modern if looking for an afternoon drink or cup of tea.  We did not go for High Tea although it seemed like it would have been a real experience!  The hotel is very well located near the Tube, high-end shopping and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and many other sights.  We had a wonderful experience and wouldn't hesitate to go back!"
June 2014,Afternoon Tea - excellent,Afternoon tea at Brown's is excellent - relaxed and friendly but effortlessly efficient service with traditional tea-time treats (proper clotted cream for the scones for example) and a great range of teas. We would definitely go again.
June 2014,Afternoon Tea - AMAZING!,"We visited the Brown's Hotel for afternoon tea as we knew it was near my husband's workplace and said it was a great hotel.  We were escorted to a table, next to a man playing popular music on a piano. Our tea was served to us or beautiful crockery. The tea itself was lovely, and they supplied us with more sandwiches, and would have supplied us with more scones and cake if we wanted it. The atmosphere was delightful and the staff were very helpful. It was worth the money, and we would definetly return. The best part was the cakes, they were AMAZING!!!!!!  Thank you!"
June 2014,Flying the flag of British hotels,"Stayed for 3 nights. Superb service, wonderful breakfasts & a truly lovely bed. A very quiet, relaxing & calming place to stay away from the hustle & bustle of West End London. Management obviously training their staff very well as they were ALL very helpful and charming. Can't wait to stay again."
June 2014,Fantastic Hotel,My husband and I stayed at the Browns Hotel for only one night as we had a lay over in London. I cannot wait to go back to the hotel and spend some time there. I cannot say enough about how well we were treated and how lovely the hotel is. It is in a wonderful location in the heart of Mayfair. There are great restaurants and shopping nearby and it is close to many attractions that London has to offer. Our room was on the fifth floor and had beautiful wood floors and was very well appointed. The bed was also very comfortable. The people who work there are very friendly and welcoming. We had a delicious breakfast too. We will plan a trip to London just to stay in this wonderful hotel.
April 2014,British style at it's best,"Rocco Forte really knows how to run hotels, and the Brown's it's a clear example. The hotel is in Mayfair, with an excellent location close to major attractions. Stayed in a junior suite and it was great, with lots of space, large sitting area, great walk-in closet and wonderful bath with rain shower and separate soaking tub.  The rooms are very modern and stylish, with lots of details that make them feel unique. Staff at the hotel is really nice and helpful; the girl at the reception even walked us to our suite and explained everything in detail. Breakfast was included in our rate, buffet style with a la carte main dishes, all very good quality. Afternoon tea is a must at the Brown's, you can't miss it. Finger sandwiches,cakes, cookies and chocolates to die for with an…"
May 2014,Worth the splurge.,My  late parents used to stay here 20 years ago so it was a sentimental journey for me. The hotel was Absolutely great in every way. All the staff were superb and friendly. Our room had an amazing bathtub. I am still dreaming of the raspberries and smoked salmon that we had for breakfast. Great location- we walked everywhere.
June 2014,"Great location, with quiet rooms","On occasion arrival and departure you can be missed if the doorman hasn't spotted your arrival/departure, so if this is the first time staying reception isn't  immediately obvious. However the ambiance is lively buzzing on entering.  The rooms are all spotlessly clean, and tastefully decorated with very comfortable beds. Staff are friendly and efficient.  I look forward to my return  "
May 2014,one of the best,"Our first stay at this Rocco Forte Hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed it, Staff were friendly and welcoming , the afternoon tea delicious as were the drinks and food in the bar. The location of the hotel makes it very convenient for shopping.Having a two year old we always try and find children friendly hotels and this was one of the best. They made every effort to accommodate us and feel very much at home. The room we had was spacious and very comfortable. Some previous comments say that some rooms are small but I think they are on par with other hotels and certainly not any smaller for the price. A lovely hotel and thoroughly recommended."
June 2014,Afternoon Tea Lounge,"Myself and three friends had a afternoon tea in this beautiful hotel as a farewell party for one. The staff Andrea and Jarek were great, very attentive and discreet. The quality of scones is doubtfully best in the whole UK and Cornish Tea (the only UK grown tea) very light for a pallet. We also had very tasty sandwiches and macaroons, which were toped up every time we consumed them. If you like to experience a proper English afternoon Tea- that is the best place to be."
May 2014,Magnificent.,"Very posh hotel in the Mayfair area, close to every sightseeing attraction. Staffs are incredible helpful and warm. Concierge even gave me the free pass to some great club nearby.  Even though breakfast menu never changes, it does taste great! But there is no great hallway or reception like other 5 star hotels. Anyhow, service is good for the price:)"
December 2013,Best Hotel in London,"For an authentic experience of the highest quality of British hospitality, service, accommodation and fine dining, nothing beats Browns Hotel. In the centre of the world's best shopping area, full of art galleries, and wonderful  Bond Street  shops, Browns is discreet and elegant. Afternoon tea- unlimited is London's best, while breakfasts are truly scrumptious, the salmon en croute on the trolley at lunch yesterday was sublime. Don't tell anyone,"
December 2013,afternoon tea at the Brown's,"Once again I choose the Brow's hotel for my Christmas afternoon tea with few friends, and as usual I call it top experience. This time I brough three new friends with me, and all of them they felt in love with the tea room. We loved the Christmas decoration, with the piano player, and of course the food and the service truly amazing. I am very glad when I discover a place which never disappoint me, especially when I bring new guests. Now even my friends say: afternoon tea in London, yes lets book at the Browns!!!"
October 2013,Amazing hotel and staff,"I was lucky enough to stay at the hotel for 2 nights recently. Was traveling with 2 friends, so we had a rollaway and they upgraded to a massive Jr suite for extra space. It was quite the treat. We arrived at the hotel around 10a and they told us our room would be ready in about 30 mins, however we were headed out for the day, so we didn't need early check in, but nice to know if we needed in the room it would be ready shortly. The hotel has so much amazing history and is so unique from building to building. Ask the staff, they are happy to indulge. Asked to see a few of the other room types since I will be returning again soon, and they had a few available to show - love how every room is so different. The views from all are very neat also. All of staff was amazing. We were…"
December 2013,best experience ever,"I was there last sunday with few friends of mine, their first day of the festive afternoon tea. nothing to compare with the other competitor in all Uk, and London. if you are someone just like me who does  not like to hear the word NO, when you spend a certain amount of money, this is the place where you need to go. Unlimited sandwiches, pastries, scones, cakes...but what gives a plus to this place is certenaly the service. truly attentive and friendly, and genuine, even the room was full, I felt like I was the most important customer. I would truly raccommand this place to all my friends."
January 2013,takes you back in time,"You may feel like you are paying for a Large luxury suite but dont get to excited to find that your room is nothing more than a nice average size bedroom full of old exquisite bedroom furniture, which is right up my alley. SUPER friendly and helpful staff, very nice and comfortable sleeping situation, always an answer to the best resturants and clubs and activities to do in and around London."
November 2013,"Nice, but perfection?","Staying in a very large suite recently showed again the mismatch of design and ergonomics as well as being userfriendly.  No sheers to block the view of the adjacent office workers, a desk that is not suitable for business (cluttered with menues, books and pictures), no international sockets...A masterswitch at the door and not next to the bed makes you hunt for light switches, a bath vanity that is full of products and trays but too small for own amenities - not thought through! The little gym is very nice, modern, light and well stocked with drinks and fruit, the Spa next door sadly does not have sauna or steam and seems to be an renovation-after thought. Full restaurants with very task-oriented staff, we did not get a pampered feeling during the meal, just very stern,…"
October 2013,sheer luxury,we went to browns as it was famous for its afternoon tea it was delicous we only stayed one night but all the staff where exceptional very well trained it was a great experience for my wife and i. the hotel is just the right size and in a perfect location also has a very good bar thanks to all the staff well done!!!!!!!!!!!!!
November 2013,Afternoon tea and Donovan's bar,"Had afternoon tea at Brown's hotel, lovely surroundings but uncomfortable, very low velour seating. We had a corner table, slight wait for service, but very friendly helpful staff. Extensive tea menu on offer. Finger sandwiches delicious and replenished. Warm scones, plain and fruit, plus fancies such as macaroons. Also offered specialists cake from trolley but we were so full we couldn't manage them. Pianist playing in the background which gave a nice ambience, not at all pretentious a very nice experience and a lovely birthday treat.  We also went to Donovan's bar and had cocktails to finish off our day out. Wonderful service, and lovely atmosphere. We had a great table and could see the mixologist do his thing. We thoroughly enjoyed it, we stayed for a couple of drinks, so…"
October 2013,Perfection,Only stayed for one night but difficult to find fault. The staff are clearly well trained to look after one 's every need. Very well furnished and comfortable room. Great bar quite lively later in the evening !
October 2013,Quintessential London,"Browns is famous for it's afternoon tea and is a perfect hotel in the middle of upscale shopping and walking distance to many of the tourist sites.  It's my ideal size, not too small but not one of those big chain hotels.  The service is special, the concierge staff wanting to take care of your every need.  When we got a smaller room with a view of a brick wall the hotel was quick to find us a more suitable one.  The bed was heaven, the marble bathrooms what you would expect from an upscale hotel.  London is pricey as is this hotel for Americans, but its worth it.  Plus you must have tea.  We had tea at 4 and didn't leave until 7:30, it ended up being our one meal of the day as the sandwiches and goodies are just divine."
September 2013,A tea session in Brown's is a real cultural experience,"I liked this place very much! A tea session here is a really joyful gastronomic and cultural experience that will make you learn and understand more about the tea as such and about the afternoon tea tradition. This is the right place to meet your friends, business partners and family! You can bring anybody here, it will satisfy all tastes, from the simple and modest ones - because they're discreet, they don't ""attack"" with too obvious luxuries, it's an understated refinement - to the most sophisticated - because behind this discretion everything, from the decoration and service to the tea and the food, is the finest English aristocratic taste and tradition. It has some intellectual atmosphere too. It is expensive, but the experience is worth of it!"
January 2014,Still not my London hotel...,"Over the past few years, my wife and I have attempted to find the perfect hotel in London. Well, this is still not it... Don't get me wrong, the Brown's is a nice hotel. But not perfect...   Our room, a Deluxe, was large by London standard. It was also well decorated and appointed. However, the air conditioning system basically had you choose between off - with a resulting unbearable heat in the room (in January!) - or on, which was fine, except for the jet turbine noise it was producing all night. Also, the TV was a small, first gen LCD, probably dating from the early 90s.  Service was a bit lacking, with us attempting three times to book a massage at the spa before finally succeeding.   On a more positive note, the location is fantastic.  To conclude, the Brown is a nice…"
January 2014,Amazing gem of a hotel,"Stayed at Brown's on NYE. Left for another hotel on new years day. Hated it so re booked back to browns. The service is impeccable, under stated pure class. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for. Mega thanks to Johnny the doorman for finding us a cab in the pouring rain on the morning of new years day and for walking us to it carrying his trusty umbrella! We had lunch two breakfasts and one dinner. The food is amazing. The rooms we had were both stunning and the beds to die for..so if you want to stay where you feel like family go to browns. If you want to stay were you feel like a paying guest? Stay somewhere else!"
December 2013,Superb Service,"Superb service and personal attention. My 7 year old loved the kids VIP card and the nightie cookie and gingerbread man - great attention to detail to make this a memorable stay for the hildren and not just the adult.  Very comfy rooms, good breakfast, exemplar and personalised service by the whole team from Doorman to Duty manager.  Still one of London;s best hotels"
December 2013,Made Christmas Magical,"Leaving our tradition of staying home in San Antonio for an international destination was not easy. Although no one balked at the idea of visiting London for Christmas, we wanted to make sure that the venue was one that would be well remembered. Having stayed at the Rocco Forte in Florence and Rome, we had a feeling that the Brown's could meet our intentions. What we weren't expecting, was a facility and staff that set this magnificent hotel apart from its Italian siblings.  From the moment we arrived, Samantha and the front desk staff went out of their way to assure our accommodations met our expectations. As each day went by, the staff took extra time to not only assure the quality of experience but they went out of the way to truly get to know our family. Whether in the…"
December 2013,An almost faultless stay,"We really enjoyed our stay at Browns in the Hellenic suite.  The suite was lovely and very quiet.  I provided feedback at the time - we had our two year old daughter with us and I commented that some books in the suite for her would have been good.  On checking out reception informed us that they had a children's library - it would have been good to know that on arrival!  Otherwise, service was excellent.  Food was very good - we ate breakfasts and dined in our room in the evening (because we had our toddler with us).  Concierge and restaurant staff were excellent.  I had a massage in the spa which was also very good - part of our package.  Location is fantastic and there are plenty of good restaurants nearby if you don't want to eat in the hotel. We tried the famous afternoon…"
December 2013,World-class afternoon tea,"We are a couple who love afternoon tea and visited Brown's on Christmas Day as a special treat.  They put on a special Christmas champagne afternoon tea at £60 with turkey & cranberry sandwiches, mini mince pies with cranberry scones, and festive themed cakes & pastries.  It was an absolute delight from the moment we walked through the door.  We had what we thought was the best table - two lovely big arm chairs right in front of an open fire, beautifully decorated for Christmas.  The staff were so warm, friendly and attentive.  I would highly recommend it and can't wait to go back."
December 2013,Another  wonderful pre-Christmas stay at Browns,We had another really special pre-Christmas stay at Browns on the 19th December - something of a tradition now and the perfect start to Christmas.  Stunning festive decorations inside and out  - I think by Lulu Guiness this year - it was its usual stylish fun place to be.  Every table was full with people enjoying a leisurely champagne tea when we arrived - we went straight for the champagne without the tea this time as we were having dinner in the Hix Restaurant with friends.  The room was spotless as always and they really are the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in.  From the super helpful friendly doorman on in all the staff were really helpful and pleasant.  Dinner in the Hix was a huge treat - super fresh ingredients and really reasonable prices for the quality and…
January 2013,We loved it,"We stayed at the Brown's in December 2012 and January 2013 for 3 and 4 nights.  Everything in the hotel is great, from its perfect location in Mayfair to the rooms (the first one was typically English style, the second one was more modern in the last floor). The staff was very nice and the restaurants were excellent. The afternoon tea is one of the best in London.  To summarize, the Brown's is a pure luxury London hotel which has been successfully refurbished in order to respect its long history while satisfying the most demanding modern guests."
September 2013,"Splendid Service, Classic Experience","Brown's Hotel was a wonderful place to stay when we visited London this September.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were updated and spotless, albeit not overly spacious. Breakfast was very nice, with a wide selection. The location was excellent.  We will definitely return on our next trip to London!"
December 2012,English style at it s best,"A Paul Smith decorated Christmas tree, a bar with atmosphere and a room to dance in. Superb, but not if you look for hip and trendy. This is a hotel where you feel very British! It is perfectly located in Mayfair, walking distance from what is the best"
September 2013,Understated luxury,"Friendly greeting, car whisked away without fuss, fast check in, quick coffee and off into London. The room was enormous. Enjoy having  the space in a bustling city. Location is great for fast access to many parts of the city whilst not being too busy."
September 2013,The Best Afternoon Tea In Town,When ever I go for afternoon tea at Brown's it is fabulous. The atmosphere is fantastic and the cakes and tea are second to none. I always leave feeling full and well relaxed.   Where ever else I go for afternoon tea this is the standard that I judge it by. I also love that you can have as much as you like.   A big thank you to you all at Brown's.
September 2013,Fabulous Brown's Hotel Afternoon High Tea Experience,"First time at Brown's Afternoon High Tea today. Did not disappoint. A few key things:  1. It's very relaxed but at the same time very high end and British.  2. Ask for Andrea (Male, Italian) who will walk you through the experience. He is the Assistant Manager and a very sweet guy. He will walk you through each tea he suggests for each course (sandwiches, scones, desserts and cake).  3. It's unlimited - you can ask for more of your favorite items (I wasnt able to finish everything I received on the first round) 4. You get a lot of food - so the value is great. Quality of food fabulous. The jam with the scones is homemade with huge strawberries. Delicious. 5. Lovely piano player plays while you eat. 6. So you get 3 tiers of delicious food. (8 1/2 Sandwiches, 4 Scones, 5 mini…"
July 2013,Browns once more is perfect,"I cannot fault this hotel at all! This time we were in a more modern spacious room, we were greated with respect in a professional manner. We had afternoon tea, which I rank top notch in London, we were even given our left over sandwiche's and scones on a silver tray in our room after becoming repleat. The toiletries are five star, in fact everything was. It is a lavish hotel, in lavish surround's and the staff are exactly how they ought to be at this level and all do their jobs very well. No complaint's and highly recommended."
August 2013,Great Location - Welcoming Staff,"I stayed at Brown's as a child 40 years ago and returning brings back wonderful memories although there have been a few changes.  The staff were so welcoming, particularly Johnny the doorman. Our room (Junior Suite) was spacious, comfortable and quiet. The light meals at Donovan's Bar were great. This was the second time we have stayed there over the past 3 years and we will most definitely be back!"
December 2012,Best Afternoon Tea,I think Brown's Hotel serves the best afternoon tea in the world.  There are other places that are more glitzy or elegant.  Brown's feels like you are in a Sherlock Holmes novel - cozy and warm.  I have been here for tea on three separate occasions with several years in between each visit and each time I feel like I've been welcomed home.
July 2013,English Tea,"We went for a high tea at Brown's Hotel in London and it was absolutely wonderful. We sat in plush comfortable club chairs, had impeccable service, fabulous tea, delicious tea sandwiches (salmon on brown bread, chicken salad, cucumber, etc.) beautiful cakes, and we lounged all afternoon. Very posh hotel in an old school way, it was definitely one of our favorite activities we did while in London. I highly recommend it. It was myself, my husband, my son (19) and daughter (14) and we had such wonderful conversation. Also surrounded by very very expensive shops which is fun for window shopping."
December 2012,Christmas at Browns,"Saved up to spend a 3 day break over Christmas somewhere special, after plenty of research we chose Browns hotel. It was dissappointing in several areas, for a 5* hotel staff looked scruffy & disinterested, no water when we got to our room, light fittings hanging from ceiling. Some good points - Location, Breakfast choice. I did get a positive response from the manager to listen to my views."
August 2013,Lovely Hotel,"Browns Hotel is situated in a perfect place. All the main attractions of London are in arms length. The styling of the hotel is very classy but has some traditional features at the same time. Staff are polite and helpful, when being served. All the dinner staff are trained to a high standard, this shows throughout your meal. Rooms at Browns are fairly expensive, for the prices they are you would expect things like WIFI to be free in the hotel. But, no. £15.00 for 24 hours. This is absolutely ridiculous on top of the prices your paying for the room. You would of thought that the hotel would of made it free as they are already taking a large sum of money from you. It feels very rude of them to put prices on everything. "
January 2013,"A beautiful hotel, restored and modernized","The location of the Brown's is perfect for shopping and wandering.  The Bar was lively and served interesting cocktails.  The rooms have been redone and are sleek, modern but still classic with a comfortable feeling.  All of the staff were helpful and friendly.  There is an excellent Indian restaurant right across the street."
September 2013,The location of the hotel is superb.,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great staff Staying at the Brown's Hotel was a wonderful experience, it has a great location and the food / service were superb. I would definitely choose to stay here again, I was on a walking stick at the time and the staff could not have been more helpful.  The location of the hotel is superb."
September 2013,AFTERNOON DE-LITE,"The elegance of afternoon tea at Brown's Hotel is a delightful experience.  Outstanding service without smothering the patron.  Delicious sandwiches and scones, wonderful clotted cream and jams and an ""all you care to eat"" replenishment guarantees a long and relaxing visit.  An intimate atmosphere of charm and grace with overstuffed chairs, fireplaces and piano music.  Not inexpensive but well worth the ""splurge""."
July 2013,afternoon tea,I didn't stay at the hotel but had the pleasure of enjoying afternoon tea in their salon. The service was very good and the food too. Totally worth it. And they refill your plates until you are done so you won't go hungry! I expected a bit more fuss but it was quite relaxed. Dress smart casual and it will be ok. Nice atmosphere.
October 2013,Wonderful experience,"Celebrated my big 3-0 birthday with an afternoon tea at Brown's.  The service was marvelous from the minute we walked in to the second we left. Stunning tea room,very quiet and peaceful,divine sandwiches and pastries ,lovely tea ,and fabulous Champagne. The hostess must have realised it was my birthday ,and surprised me with a divine truffle desert reading 'Happy Birthday' ,attentive and kind staff, superb service.  Highly recommended for both Londoners and visitors.  My new favourite place for an afternoon tea. "
October 2013,Hix Restaurant At Browns Mayfair,"Went to celebrate my granddads birthday,6.10.13  with the family had an amazing time, superb food excellent service. Antiono and his staff where great, My granddad left very happy like the rest of the family brilliant time will recommend to my friends had dinner at many other hotel restaurants but this was one of the best many thanks  K Taylor London"
July 2013,Perfect,"My husband, teenage daughter and I were fortunate enough to spend few days at Brown 's Hotel on London in July 2013. It was the quintessential London experience that I believe everyone hopes to have: excellent staff, very historic and elegant boutique hotel with the atmosphere of a private club, a beautiful room and fabulous dining with a very contemporary British focus (they even offer kedgeree on the menu), not to mention the perfect Mayfair location walking distance to so many tourist sights and fabulous shopping. The bar is atmospheric and fun, and the humorous but very professional doormen made it a point to memorise our names from the moment we checked in so 'Jonny' welcomed us back after each daily excursion by name as if we were returning to our private home. Every…"
September 2013,Top Notch Afternoon Tea,"Having had afternoon tea at Fortnum & Mason and not being impressed I was, after reading the reviews for Brown's ever hopeful, and I wasn't to be disappointed. From the minute we walked in to the trip to the powder room before leaving I could find no fault. I was in London with my sister for a special girls day out. We arrived a little early so had a cocktail in the bar, served with nibbles. We were informed by a member of staff from the tea room when our table was ready & no sooner had he moved away than the young lady who had served us our drinks was at our side with the bill. We were seated at a small round table, big enough for two in beautifully upholstered wing backed chairs, that were so comfortable I could have easily had a little nap after tea! The waiter came over to…"
August 2013,Good hotel Great size,"Browns hotel is a top of the line hotel located in a great area of London. Close to great pubs, restaurants and shopping. The staff was great and the rooms are huge compared to other hotels in Europe. They have good room service and a great little work out gym. The tv in the rooms is quite small but other than that. Browns is a great place to stay. The only drawback is that it is pricey. "
September 2013,Birthday Weekend,"We stayed at Brown's for my Birthday weekend & it was great from start to finish. The concierge are extremley courteous, as were the receptionists upon checking in. We were shown to our room, a very generous size with all the amenities you could wish for. The walk in wardrobe was just fantastic! The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was huge - toiletries replaced everyday and turn down service of an evening. My husband had ordered a birthday cake & a bottle of champagne for us, this was such a treat and the cake was delicious! We loved going down to the bar each evening before dinner- the atmosphere was very relaxed and it was very enjoyable to sit and have drinks and nibbles before dinner. All in all, an excellent weekend thanks to Brown's and we would definatley return!"
March 2013,Feels like home,"We visit London regularly, both for pleasure and business, and have been lucky enough to stay in a lot of London's top hotels. But Brown's is the one we will, from now on, always return to.  It is home away from home.    From the point of arrival my husband and I are greeted with such warmth and the service is always impeccable.  We are always very well looked after and nothing seems to be a problem in the slightest.  Each visit starts with a note from the manager which I think is such a nice touch.   We have eaten at Hix only once, for lunch, and it was excellent, both from a service and food point of view.  We arrived late, without a reservation, yet seated immediately without any fuss, or ""well let me see if we're still serving"".   We have experienced the Donovan Bar,…"
March 2013,"Excellent service, very friendly",Highly recommend this hotel. We went for the Easter holidays. The staff were excellent. Our daughter who is 6 got lots of special treats e.g. An Easter egg with her name on. We will definitely return! 
March 2013,Conducting business over tea at Brown's is relaxing and enjoyable,"Last week I went for tea at Brown's with a business associate.  This must the the 20th time in the last six months.  Always enjoyable, always relaxing, always quality.  What is it about Brown's that is so good?  Well, let's start with the service, the food, the atmosphere, the location, the general ambience.  Need more? The reaction of fiends when you say ""tea at Brown's"" is guaranteed to be positive and welcoming.  And when your guest starts in a good mood it is likely that your meeting will go well.    Prêt a manager it is not. Thankfully.  (I have not stayed at the hotel)"
March 2013,"""Afternoon Tea at Browns Hotel""","My daughter surprised me for my birthday with ""Afternoon Tea with a Twist"" at Brown's Hotel.... The twist being it was ""Tea Tox"".....a healthy version of afternoon tea. First off let me just explain, last year my daughter and i decided instead of presents we would take each other out for a ""birthday treat"", so last year i took her for afternoon tea at The Ritz... I must say my experience at Browns was so much better, maybe not as elegant as the Ritz but by far a much more relaxed atmosphere... Our waiter William was fantastic, explaining our menu to us, both food and teas....I chose the Blackcurrant & Hibiscus Fruit infusions which was lovely, my daughter had Lemon & something which she also enjoyed. William was very attentive, refilling our plates regularly.... The only…"
March 2013,Afternoon Tea,"I took my parents to afternoon tea at Brown's Hotel as a belated wedding anniversary present. I did a lot of research before deciding on Browns. We'd been to Claridge's and the Ritz previously but i had read such fantastic review about Browns, i booked us in there. We arrived early and asked the hotel staff if was ok to be seated in the bar(as we were very early for the time i had originally booked for) and we were shown through to a lovely bar. Once our table was ready, we were collected and then we were shown to our corner table. We selected the type of tea we wanted(we chose the traditional afternoon tea but the options included a lower calorie version and a champagne tea). We were then presented with the tea menu, two of us chose the Brown afternoon blend tea and 1 chose the…"
February 2013,Great experience,"We were fortunate enough to be treated to afternoon tea here and felt very out of place being four lads not dressed in suits. However our waiter was extremely professional and not in the least bit snobby, and although none of us had ever been for afternoon tea anywhere before he explained how it all worked. Having wandered down Oxford Street and enduring the usual hustle and bustle and constantly getting shoved around and dodging tourists, Brown's was such a nice escape from it and was a step into a calm tranquil environment where we felt pampered. The selection of teas is incredible, the sandwiches very tasty, the cakes very nice and the scones were just out of this world, especially with jam and clotted cream!! Remember this is four lads with big appetites and we were stuffed…"
March 2013,Great Concierge !,"I've rated Brown's a 5 instead of a 4 strictly because of the employees....My husband has stayed at Brown's several times and raved about about how charming it is. Since we were going to be there 8 nights , they offered us an upgraded room (at a price), which I understand from co-workers  this is general op procedure. Hubby said he'd been in much better rooms than the one we were offered. Is being on the street side worth 40pounds a night more? I really don't think so. I considered the room (#320)  shabby. The carpet was rolling and stretched in places and furnishings just weren't that nice. The King size bed is actually 2 twins pushed together which would of been ok - if a nice mattress pad had been used to smooth the area where the beds meet. However, the room was clean and…"
March 2013,Good afternoon tea at Brown's,"You certainly will not leave hungry, if you have afternoon tea here.  The hotel’s website gives a fairly accurate description of what to expect.  We had tea on 19th of March to celebrate a special birthday.  The English tea room was busy, but people’s arrival time was scattered. Although when you book ,you are told that you have the table for 90 minutes, no-one asked us to move after that time; the tables around us were also being very leisurely.  Service was good, but no mention of the price on the website indicated that 12.5% would be added to the cost  of afternoon tea in the form of a service charge.  There were only 2 of us in our party and there is not an option to serve yourself!  I think that the true cost should be published on the website.  I was also surprised and…"
March 2013,beautiful hotel in amazing location!,"I joined Leading Hotels of the World last year and have tried to stay exclusively in them in order to use the member benefits. Brown's was exceptional! Incredibly helpful and attentive staff, exquisite bed, spacious room, wonderful restaurant and bar and the location...wow! You couldn't ask for more. I will most certainly be back! Many thanks."
April 2012,Lovely hotel in a great location.,"This is a lovely hotel. It's quite quiet in comparison to some of the places we have stayed and I do feel that it is geared more towards maybe older couples. However I couldn't fault this hotel for what it was as the service, rooms, food were all excellent. The doorman was wonderful and very helpful.Browns is ideally located for shopping."
March 2013,Afternoon Tea!,"My friend and I had an amazing experience at Brown's Hotel today. Unbelievably good tastes, lovely atmosphere, piano playing, great service and smiles by everybody, and we feel lucky to have been so well-treated by Abi - it so changes your experience when people love their job! We were surprised and very pleased to get a tea sample of the tea we had there to enjoy at home :) I would definitely recommend it and it certainly deserves the title of being one of the best in London!"
February 2013,Weekend Break,Another fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel. A trip to London would not be complete without staying at Brown's. The staff are so warm and friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Faultless room with every luxury whilst still retaining a warm and cosy atmosphere. We stayed 2 nights and slept peacefully waking each day to a glorious breakfast. Can't wait to return and well done to all the staff!!
February 2013,Afternoon Tea service,"Went for champagne afternoon tea on Sunday 24th February, attended by a young man called William who had only been with the hotel for three weeks.  William is a credit to the hotel, smart, well spoken, polite, attentive and made a pleasant visit exceptional.  The rest of the restaurant staff were very efficient and all in all a very enjoyable experience and one we will partake of next time we visit London."
February 2013,Amazing Hotel in great location,Wow what a great stay me and my husband had at Brown's for my birthday weekend. They really know how to look after their guests. The room was one of the best Ive ever stayed in. We were treated to the most amazing cake made by the hotels pastry chef and champagne. All this within walking distance to the West End! Looking forward to the next stay.
February 2013,"Amazing hotel, I love it here","I love Brown's Hotel, this was our second visit (the first was 3 years ago) and I was really pleased to be back.  The Concierge was very helpful and accepted delivery of some parcels for me prior to my arrival, allowing me to surprise the Boyf with presents while we were there.   We stayed in an Executive King, the room was spacious the bathroom had a lovely bath and seperate ""rain fall"" shower and the bed and bedding were the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Breakfast is great, so many options and both the bar and room service also lived up to expectations. The staff are friendly and helpful and we were never made to feel out of place.  Highly recommended, I will be back as soon as I can afford it."
January 2013,Not as great as the name,"We stayed at Browns for several nights ( second time)  and enjoyed it overall. The staf is niche, friendly and well educated, the rooms are nicely decorated, the beds are perfect and the sleeping quality is very good. Still - except for the outstanding bar - it is not really excellent if you compare value for money. The tearoom is overrated and the floors and some of the rooms are shaped difficult.  With two entrances it is also a walk-through which irritates at first. The Hotel would not be our first choice again."
February 2013,An Exceptional Property in the Heart of It All....,"First time staying @ Brown's on the recommendation of American Express Centurion and certainly not disappointed:  A first class property with excellent location and superb service throughout the establishment accompanied by wonderfully appointed rooms with some of the finest sleep quality out there.  Most importantly, every member of the staff with special mention of both the concierge and front door attendant went beyond the call of duty to ensure that our five day London experience was enhanced as positively as humanly possible.  Simply, an impressive establishment!!!"
February 2013,Fantastic service,"We are so pleased we chose Brown's Hotel for our action packed 5 days in London. A brilliant central location, with cosy lounges, a beautiful wood pannelled restaurant with comfy yet contemporary furnishings and superb staff.  They are always there in the background, anticipating your every need.  Friendly yet efficient, just totally professional. The room was also smart and efficient though I would upgrade to a larger one next time.  We went for the entry level room. But having said that it was a good size and everything worked, great shower and cosmetics.  The rejuvenating cream at night was a lovely touch, as was the complimentary water and ice bucket replenished every day.  Shampoo was brilliant too.The bed was super comfy, just what you need after a long day and evening out…"
February 2013,Lived up to expectations,"We decided we would celebrate our 50th birthdays in style and chose our accomodation with that in mind. We took advantage of the hotels offer on a third night for free if you booked for two. From the moment you arrive the staff make you feel very welcome and comfortable. We were offered an upgrade on our booking at reduced rate which we accepted and weren't disappointed. The room was outstanding, modern with a huge comfortable bed large bathroom and well stocked (if expensive)mini bar. The breakfast was outstanding a wide and varied menu all excellently prepared and presented. We can also recommend the afternoon tea and the cocktails in Donovans Bar. We didn't have dinner in the restaurant so can't comment on that. All in all a top class establishment heartily recommended"
January 2013,"Classy, traditional, but yet modern.","The best location possible and with the old charm only colonial style hotels can offer. The very best of service, fantastic breakfast, to die for drinks, yummy afternoon tea and scones. Comfy and sleepy beds! Just first class - in style with the hotel de Russie in Rome - (Rocca Forte hotel). Probably not the most praiseworthy in London, but definitely a must stay one in a lifetime."
May 2013,truly british,"I spent a week at Brown`s and I really felt home in London quintessentially British, cosy, friendly servisse and of course amazing afternoon tea! great location, off Bond Street, walking distance from Green Park, perfect for both work and shopping. dont miss the Dover Sole available on the room service menu!"
July 2013,Brown's Hotel...perfect Afternoon Tea and excellent service!!!,"We were 3 Young Italian Ladies and arrived at Brown's hotel at 5 p.m.after booked a table for the famous afternoon tea. A kind doorman showed us the Tea room and said us good afternonoon. The atmosphere and location ware perfect. The music with the piano was very nice and relaxing. Andrea the maitre, showed us our fantastic table at the corner.  The salt and sweet food were fresh and delicious, the flute of Ruinart was at the correct temperature, and only one word for the service: PERFECT!!!! Andrea and all his staff were were polite, smiling and willing to satisfy our demands. Have given explanation on all tea chosen, in a precise and competent. The colors, the atmosphere and decor of the room we were so relaxed that we left after 3 hours with one word ..... this afternoon tea…"
July 2013,Amazing afternoon tea,"We arrived at Brown's hotel at 4 p.m. and a lovely doorman showed us the Tea room. The atmosphere was perfect. The pianist was playing and a  very nice gentleman, Andrea, took us to the table  It was by the window in the some room of the pianist. The food delicious and the service perfect, all the waiters were polite with a warm smile. This was a very relaxed and calm place, and I strongly encourage anyone to try the afternoon tea at Brown's becouse is a unique experience."
July 2013,Good experience,"Took afternoon tea at Browns. Was a fantastic experience if a little expensive. On the plus side, a great ambiance, great fresh tasting sandwiches, cakes, scones, jam, cream etc. Which just keeps coming, as soon as a plate is cleared, another appears, a constant flow of yummy food on an all you can eat basis! Wonderful! Would I do it again? Yes! So typically English, wonderful selection of teas! A must try for everyone!"
December 2012,Felt at home as soon as we arrived.,"We stayed at the hotel, as a family whilst my husband was in London for business. We travelled a long distance to reach London, but felt at home as soon as we arrived. Great location. Fabulous helpful, attentive staff. Attention to detail from the door man remembering our names and welcoming us,  to recommendations for activities with our children.  Nice, comfortable rooms. Our children had their own beautiful room complete with personal bed linen, Wii and children's amenities. Our children were delighted with the treats and cookies delivered to the room.  Yes, this is an expensive hotel, but we felt it was money well spent. Can't wait to return."
July 2013,Old World Charm,"This was my last stop in the U.K. so meeting the very charming and friendly staff on arrival was a great start.  The decent room size and location were a plus.  The doorman with his carnation and top hat, the concierge with his hand written recommendations and a lavish old world breakfast buffet made this a great choice."
July 2013,A Dream Hotel,"The helpful staff, city location, English tea, and attention to detail made our visit remarkable.  Once the young man at the desk learned we were celebrating our anniversary, we were given a room upgrade and were treated with candles and rose petals on our bed.  The breakfasts and afternoon tea were amazing.  The Donovan was a special drink prepared for us in the bar.  This hotel should be on everyone's bucket list!"
July 2013,Afternoon Tea for the ladies in waiting,"Having Afternoon Tea (not High Tea, as we were told by our Tea Sommelier) at Brown's Hotel was a wonderful experience.  We were quite fortunate to be seated, as we did not have a reservation.  I highly recommend that you make a reservation in advance if you want to experience this.  We actually got very lucky after we pleaded with the hostess and also mentioned that it was our last day in London.  We had a short wait in their beautiful bar which is also another great experience to have at Browns.  Once seated, we had outstanding service and enjoyed the piano music, teas, finger sandwiches and desserts.  Since Wimbledon was going on, we were surprisingly thrilled to see a green tennis ball decorated pastry.   Being unsophisticated as we are, we didn't realize that they keep…"
July 2013,A wonderful afternoon,"What a treat! high tea at the Brown's Hotel, lovely atmosphere and the hotel is gorgeous. The gluten free menu is delicious and the tea selection was top notch. All of the staff are very warm and friendly, and we were able take our time and enjoy the experience. A perfect way to spend an afternoon in London."
August 2013,What a delightful place,"I had taken my mother for tea at the Ritz and was a little disappointed so when I wanted to go somewhere for my family to take me for my birthday (!) this is where I chose. The setting is lovely. You are seated on comfortable seats in a lounge area so it feels as though you are in someone's ( rather large) front room rather a dining room. There was a great choice of teas and you could even have a 'healthy' afternoon tea which pleased my sportsman son who had said that he would only have a cup of tea!  The food, both healthy and traditional, was excellent although I was a little disappointed with the final piece so cake.  I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that at the start staff were very attentive but they then sort of disappeared. We were only offered the rather cute…"
April 2013,Lovely experience in London,"Brown's Hotel is a wonderful home base in London.  The staff is what truly makes the difference - we found every one of them (particularly the concierges) to be charming and helpful.  I really can't say enough about the staff and all that they did for us.  Simon and Ashley went above and beyond to help us plan our days and make the most of our holiday time in London.    The common areas of the hotel are very comfortable and stylish.  The rooms are very nice, although less charming than the common areas.    The location can't be beat, providing easy walking access to Buckingham Palace and many of the sights.  We were in town at the time of the London Marathon and truly felt like we were close to everything, but not caught up in the crowds.   I've stayed in a number of wonderful…"
August 2013,Tea for 2,"Splendid!  I knew an exceptional experience was ahead of us from the time we were greeted on the pavement when alighting from the taxi by the footman.  The champagne was excellent, tea recommendations spot on from a very knowledgable and attentive waiter Andreas.  The macaroons were the best ever.  I still don't understand the cucumber sandwich, however I took away more tea knowledge than I thought possible."
August 2013,Great to relax in good old fashioned surroundings,"In order to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Mayfair shoppers I often pop in to Brown's - their English Tea Room - for a coffee or tea with friends. Service is excellent and attentive (without being intrusive) and it's like stepping back in time when life was a little less hectic. If you've ODed on the hip and on-trend hotels, try Brown's. I find it hard to beat!"
August 2013,The Perfect Hotel,On a scale of 1 to 10 this hotel is a 20+++. We had 2 executive rooms which were large and spacious perfect for a short stay. The gracious doorman greets you wearing his top hat and long tailed coat. Reception after checking you in walks you to your room and shows you the rooms features. The bellmen deliver the bags quickly. No detail is overlooked. Everyone should stay at this hotel at least once in their life. Where else can you go and sit by the same fireplace as Winston Churchill or where Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call. This hotel is 175 years old but the rooms are perfect up to date with separate tub and shower.
July 2013,Excellence,"A very nice hotel ideally located for shopping in Mayfair and bond street.  Rooms are spacious, and decorated with a modern British style.  Staff is very helpful and dedicated to their clients.  My new London base !!"
August 2013,"The English Tea Room, A Perfect Haven Of Peace on a Special Day","It was our 50th Wedding Anniversary and we had spent day 2 of the weekend avoiding Boris's 'bike-athon' (or whatever it was meant to be). Not being allowed to cross the Mall anywhere from St Jame's Park we were obliged to trudge the length of Constitution Hill and most of Piccadilly to get to Brown's for our afternoon tea booking. We did not find Albemarle Street too inviting, but 'fell' into Brown's with relief and so escaped from the noise and crowds to be pampered immediately by attentive but discreet attendants. Our seating position was perfect, as was the fine table linen; all was a civilised ambience in complete contrast to the chaos around Westminster and the Mall. Outrageous prices, of course, for what is after all perfectly ordinary food, albeit freshly prepared, but…"
July 2013,Brown's London's oldest and finest boutique hotel,"Now celebrating its 175th anniversary, Brown’s Hotel is the oldest in London in a street across the road from the Ritz. It was founded by Lord Bryon’s butler with his final pay-off, cleverly timed from the great poet who must have been in a rare moment of solvency.  He bought four town houses and knocked them into one hotel. The modern Brown’s is up to 11 houses, though still has only 117 rooms of which 29 are suites. That gives it long, meandering hallways but also real character.  Fortunately houses in Mayfair were always fairly grand and so the room sizes are quite large for London. The Royal Suite is like a complete Mayfair apartment, except for the lack of a kitchen. The Rocco Forte chain owns and manages Brown’s today.  We loved the interior design by Sir Rocco Forte’s…"
June 2013,"Great, luxurious hotel","This is an exceptional hotel. The staff are excellent - helpful, knowledgeable. The room was really comfortable, probably the best bed we've ever slept in. Central location - a truly great hotel in central London. Whilst it's not cheap, it is worth splashing out for this hotel"
June 2013,"Hotel average, staff great",We vacationed at the Browns on our stay in London in June.  We found the hotel needing an uplift.  Beds were too soft and creeky bedroom floors.  Staff was amazing and the breakfast was good.  Would rather of stayed at the Ritz around the corner.
June 2013,Afternoon Tea,"I had afternoon tea at Brown's on my recent trip to London. The tea selection was fantastic. There were many different kinds to choose from. You would be hard pressed to find at least one you didn't like. The food was fantastic; the desserts were Wimbledon themed which were incredibly cute. Service was attentive, incredibly polite, and friendly.   I can't wait ti come back for tea again on my next trip!"
June 2013,Relaxing Afternoon Tea,"We had a wonderful time having afternoon tea at Brown's.  After being on the go sightseeing, it was nice to having a relaxing afternoon.  My niece and and I felt very refreshed afterwards. The service was outstanding!   We felt like Queens for the day. The food was delicious!  I would love to have some of their fresh, warm scones right now.  Afternoon Tea at Brown's was definitely a highlight of our trip.  I would highly recommend it.  The next time I am in London I will being going back."
June 2013,Delightful Afternoon Tea,"Booked a nice table for two for afternoon tea online and was given a nice table on arrival.  Had champagne with the goodies as well.  Great friendly knowledgeable staff, excellent service and delicious food which keeps on coming if you want it.  Superb atmosphere a touch of class in the middle of London. Thoroughly recommend it for a special treat."
June 2013,We only had a Great English Afternoon tea...,"The service was excellent every member of staff had a warm smile. The sandwiches were divine the salmon excellent and as we all agreed it was the temperature that the food was served at that enhanced the flavour. All too often sandwiches are chilled far too much. There was endless supply of anything that we required. My only slight negativity were the scones..a wee bit soft and spongy (as though had been warmed up in a microwave) . The jam was superb and tasted of strawberries and the clotted cream was heavenly.  However, on the whole the day was fabulous as we were celebrating our daughters birthday. The piano playing as an added highlight. After tea we moved to the Donavan bar and again the service was faultless. I cannot recommend Brown's more highly."
June 2013,Best English Tea,"A most delightful and delicious afternoon tea at this grand hotel.  The service was perfect, everything tasted yummy and looked beautiful.  A nice break from our hectic pace of touring England.  Highest recommendation."
June 2013,aftenoon tea- gluten free,"A wonderful traditional afternoon tea- great service (thank you Saliya) - nothing was too much trouble- high quality and delicate sandwiches, cakes and scones- frequently replenished and lots of tea.   One of our group needed a gluten free tea - this was exceptional and looked exactly like the standard tea- in fact, the rest of us were quite jealous of the cakes.  This was a very relaxed and calm place to meet up with old friends and catch up."
June 2013,Stylish oasis,"I took my wife for an overnighter without children - our first trip back to London after moving out of town. The arrival with lunch & drinks at Hix felt very appropriate indeed - stylish, civilized, calm. The next day we had breakfast at Hix, drinks in the Donovan bar and high tea in The English Tea Room - absolutely no complaints at any stage. Service was faultless and friendly. Our only complaints are that the decor in the room was was a bit out of shape here and there - everything is very high quality, but we had the feeling that some things had been done a bit quickly. The ventilation system was also very effective but also quite noisy. So, all in all, for the price we paid for the stay, we felt that the stay met our expectations (which it should!), but we did not have the…"
May 2013,Afternoon Tea in Browns Hotel,"My wife and I enjoyed Afternoon Tea at ""The English Tea Room"" in Browns Hotel, London.  It was the second time, after thirteen or fourteen years that we went there.  We originally thought that we may go to a new place for change.  We did not do so simply because our first excellent experience of so many years ago was like ""imprint"" in our mind.  Atmosphere was gentle and relaxing as before.  Service was excellent.  The quality of tea and food also was really good.  If we go to London again, we wish to go to Browns.  Only problem is that we are more than eleven hours flight away from London."
May 2013,comfortable luxury,"In London I normally stay at the Dorchester, Claridges, or the SoHo hotel.  Brown's is as nice as any top Mayfair hotel, but it's more relaxed and comfortable.  The service, cuisine, rooms, and flowers are all stunning and they all felt like they were there for me to enjoy.  I felt equally comfortable in the lobby in a suit as I did in jeans and this is why I might choose to stay here over the Dorchester.  If you want a haven that is there to support you rather than waiting to be impressed by you, this is a great choice."
June 2013,A perfect martini,"After a day out on Monday walking through Mayfair I decided to go to Brown's Hotel to The Donovan Bar for a drink as recommended to me from my close friend. When I arrived I was warmly greeted at the door of Brown's and pointed a way to the bar where I was welcomed likewise by a manager, I suppose. While sitting down at the bar, the bartender approached me with a smile on his face (I don't see this very often nowadays). I asked for a martini and had been recommended whole range of them whereupon I ordered one with this delicious apple gin. What a great choice! Throughout savoring the great drink and chit chatting with this Czech guy I enjoyed the atmosphere of the jazz-like bar decorated with black and white pictures on its walls.  Anyone who is seeking for a great experience…"
May 2013,"Fantastic, fantastic","Stayed for 2 nights. Was given a complimentary upgrade which was fantastic. From walking through the doors to being shown to our room, from the concierge addressing you by name to reception giving advice on places to go and things to do, from the hot chocolate being so amazing (must say best I have ever had and I know a thing or two about chocolates), turn down service, a little technical issue which was addressed immediately. Wish I could have tried out the restaurant but needless to say I enjoyed it so much I am back in June and will ensure I try out the restaurant. Compliments to the staff and management who continue to achieve excellence in 5 star service and quality. Fantastic "
May 2013,Afternoon Tea at Browns,"Had afternoon tea for my birthday last Sunday. It was a lovely experience. The sandwiches and cakes were plentiful, the ambience was perfect and the pianist excellent. Especially when he played happy Birthday for me. Even though it was busy, because it is two rooms it did not feel it and the service was excellent."
May 2013,Celebrate at Brown's!,"What a great experience seeing the celebration of 175 years at Brown's, the quintessential London hotel offering the charm of a period building with all the ""mod cons"" one expects of a first class hotel.  The staff were as charming and helpful as ever - a rare and valuable asset in today's world.   We had a most enjoyable stay and will no doubt be back soon!"
April 2013,Browns is where one ought to stay!,"It is a wonderful hotel, rich with history and character. The staff are very friendly and professional. The bedroom is small for the price but you basically pay for all of the services on offer and the name of where you are staying. The facilities are perfect, the restaurant is of the best standard and the decor is classy - all the way through the hotel. We only stayed one night, to test it out due to the cost, but my husband was smitten with this hotel, so we will return and look foward to it!"
August 2012,Perfect family short break,"Excellent service, very nice rooms, fantastic kids amenities in the room (baby products and equipment as well as lovely toys) and extremely friendly staff who made our stay truly special.   We had dinner at the Albemarle Restaurant each night with the kids. The food was delicious and again the service was very friendly especially with the children as well. The Donovan Bar offers a wonderful atmosphere and even better cocktails...really skilled bar staff, just tell them a little about what tastes you like and they make the perfect drink for you.  The Spa is excellent, too. My massage and luxury pedicure were heavenly and just what I needed at the end of a day with two small children."
May 2013,First Class hotel in a great location,"We stayed here for two nights this week (admittedly on a significantly discounted rate!) and came away very impressed with the whole experience. The location is very convenient for the West En, and easily accessed from Green Park tube station.  The building interior is wonderful, although we did not make use of most of the facilities due to other arrangements.  Our room was very comfortable with the only downside being the view - but what can you expect given the central location?  And the staff were very good and responsive. I hope we can afford to go back again and try out the restaurant, etc."
May 2013,Afternoon Tea,"Having visited Browns for Afternoon tea for a family member’s birthday I had to come on here to write a review.  I have visited several Hotels in London for afternoon tea and Browns is now by far my favorite. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive, the food, which included finger sandwiches, scones and cakes, was delicious and constantly replenished without us even having to ask.  There was even too much food for us all to eat. I suffer from a nut allergy and was provided with my own selection of food and the staff couldn’t have been more accommodating. I wouldn’t hesitate in recommending Browns to others."
May 2013,Nice hotel staff shame about the room,"My wife and I stayed here on our first night of our honeymoon.  The staff from checking to concierge were great. Donovan's cocktail bar is a must, try the signature martini.  However the room a 'executive king size' was poor.  The room had no view, was next to an air conditioning duct and was so dimly lit you couldn't see in the clothes hanging area.  We paid £475 for the night and we believe it is vastly overrated.  We have stayed in a number of good hotels in London, but would not recommend it purely because of the price to standard of room experienced. It's a shame because the staff are very good."
May 2013,Afternoon Tea,"A very relaxing couple of hours drinking as much tea as we wanted and eating as much as we wished of delicious finger sandwiches, melt in the mouth scones with jam and cream and a delectable assortment of cakes.  Our waiter Saliya  looked after us very well.   Afterwards, whilst admiring the floor tiles, we met Darren the hotel's engineer who took us through to show us the bar and told us very interesting facts about the hotel etc, he is obviously very passionate about his place of work and rounded our trip off nicely. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others."
May 2013,Felt like I was at home!,"When I arrived, I had a fantastic welcome by the friendly doormen.  The service in the tea room was excellent.  My room was great!  All the staff made me feel like I was at home.  Looking forward to my next stay."
May 2013,First Class,"We arrived exceptionally exhausted - and we were told our room was still occupied...but was offered an upgrade for a little more money..which was SO worth it.  Very large, quiet room, no view, but very comfortable bed and tremendous bathroom.  The staff warmed up to us after a few days.  Loved Mustafa, the evening concierge and Rita at the Front desk...both were exceptional! Lovely afternoon tea and great bar !!  Breakfast was sufficient..not as good as the other Rocco Forte Hotels.. (like Hotel de Rome in Berlin and Amigo in Brussels..those breakfast buffets are amazing).  Would definitely stay here again..You cannot beat the location !!!"
April 2013,Let down by missing touches,"This hotel is lovely but not perfect by any means.   My daughter and I stayed 3 nights.   Our room was on the small side but very comfortable and clean.   Highlights - the central location, the ambiance, Afternoon tea, and breakfast in the restaurant.   Downsides - It took a little while for the staff to get to know us as we were out and about most of the time. When I tried booking for afternoon tea the receptionist repeatedly suggested I book it online... I had to gently point out that we were guests of the hotel! Secondly the room wasn't prepared for 2 female guests, the turndown service laid out one male and one female pair of slippers and placed a treat (night cream/face wash etc) on one pillow only. You'd have thought that after the first day they could've adjusted things…"
April 2013,If only every London hotel was like Brown's!,"A group of us meet monthly for dinner and drinks at different London 5-star hotels, and out of the 42 we have experienced so far, I would rate Brown's the best. I was a little apprehensive at approaching them initially, as it has the reputation of being a very select establishment. I need not have worried, as from the first phone call, every member of Brown's was friendly, helpful and efficient.Two of us had dinner there in early April and enjoyed the food and the pleasant atmosphere. Later in the month, a large group of us had dinner at Brown's, followed by drinks in the bar afterwards, and everyone agreed that it had been an excellent, convivial and trouble-free evening, one of my colleagues writing the next day that ""the food was politely served, timely and excellent"". Though…"
April 2013,Second Stay as good as the First,"Had a deluxe room overlooking Dover Street. The room is spacious and comfortable and the feel of the place is very luxurious.  Didnt eat in any of the hotel's restaurants, but a sandwich from room service was very good and service was prompt.  Staff very good and check in/out was a breeze.  Will stay again!"
May 2012,I love Browns,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels all over Europe and the states but I love Browns. Is is truly a class act. From the momenet you walk in they remember your name and do everything they can to help. I stayed with my wife for three nights and could not have had a better time. The location is great. The staff could not be more helpful. The room , because of the high ceiling seemed huge. All and all a great place to stay in London."
October 2012,Best hotel in London!!,"One of the finest hotel in London: amazing service ( I had some issues w/my credit card and they deal w/that in such a gracious and elegant way...!). Rooms are gorgeous ( second floor has huge high ceilings)... I'd stay on deluxe and up ( regular rooms are very nice, however if you wanna add more charme to your stay, deluxe and up make a great difference!). Breakfast is delicious, not to mention afternoon tea... A real treat! My husband and I we always go for Frieze: it's a very, very busy period for the hotel, but the service, the quality and the general appeal never goes down a bit! So... Chapeau! The spa is also very good: clean and efficient, the space is nice and Sarah gives wonderful massages! A little plus: as Italian I must say it was a pleasure to share the hotel…"
June 2012,Wonderful for afternoon tea,"With a small child, we often go for afternoon tea on special occasions rather than going out for dinner, as it means we can involve the whole family and not have to worry about baby sitting. Brown's is our preferred venue. The afternoon tea is just fantastic. An array of different teas to choose from (with non-tea drinkers also well catered for), lovely finger sandwiches (and they'll do plain cheese for fussy children!), delicious scones and beautiful little cakes. And they'll refill the plates until you tell them to stop. And then you'll swear that you'll never need to eat again. We're going again for my birthday this year - can't wait!"
April 2013,Afternoon Tea,"What an amazing place to come for afternoon tea. I came with some friends without a booking, trying our luck knowing it is one the busiest and most renown place in London to have high tea. They welcomed us warmly, sat us on a lovely table and gave us a thorough explanation of the menu. My friend is actually gluten free, and it was not a problem at all! Two well presented stands arrived within minutes. The food was amazing from sandwiches to pastries (same for the gluten free) and everything was unlimited! The service is impeccable, friendly and non intrusive. We couldn't expect better. A place where I will definitely return. Brown’s :  a must for any Londoner!"
April 2013,Brown's is Gold.,"Rocco Forte has got it right. This Mayfair hotel on Albemarle Street is beautiful. I have visited this place for pre dinner drinks and dinner many times and it always impresses.   Last night I met a friend who is over from the U.S on business and we had a fantastic experience in the bar, the service from the moment you step into the room is top notch. Nothing is too much of a problem and the staff are all running a tight ship.  The bar itself is elegant, wood panelling and superbly rich furnishings surround you, everything feels luxurious.   The drinks themselves were as you would expect, executed perfectly. Glasses of wine expertly chilled and poured and my amaretto sour was great. I love the fact that you get plied with enough interesting salty snacks to keep you going before…"
April 2013,Superlative,"My husband a surprise for our 25th Wedding Anniversary which included a night's stay at Brown's. It was perfect. Of course it's very luxurious but what is much harder to get right is the gentle, friendly manner of the staff. The word ""welcome"" just doesn't seem adequate as a word for the perfectly judged way in which staff look you in the eye and make you feel you really, really are welcome and cared aobut. And when we got back to our suite at night to find beautiful deep pink rose petals strewn everywhere....welll!"
April 2013,Excellent Afternoon tea,"I would highly recommend Brown's for afternoon tea and also for anyone needing a gluten free diet. We took our mum for her 80th birthday, she has Coeliac disease and finds it difficult to find many places that cater for a gluten free diet. Her sandwiches looked the same as ours and she even had little cakes, as a surprise for her birthday the staff brought out a little cake on a plate with happy 80th birthday written in chocolate on the plate. We all had a lovely afternoon with more sanwiches being brought out as soon as our plates emptied and tea being poured for us as we emptied our cups. There's a wide selection of tea available and juice if tea isn't your choice of drink, all in all I would recommend Brown's to anyone looking for a treat or special occasion. The staff were…"
December 2012,Lovely place to stay in London,"A beautiful place. Quiet rooms with plush beds, spacious bathrooms, elegantly decorated, great customer service and good location.  The rooms leave nothing to be desired. Even the toiletries are delightful.  The tearoom is always warm and and animated without being overcrowded, a real treat."
January 2013,"A trendy high-end London 5-star, with service and little touches not quite to match.","The hotel is contemporary throughout with a hint of old world in places. There is little to suggest the hotel is the oldest in London. Service and those small special touches associated with hotels in its class were however lacking. More detail should you wish...  Guest Room Upgraded from an Executive to Deluxe Room (a benefit of LHW membership), it was plush but certainly not spacious as one would expect from a room a few levels above the entry level. The bed was not as reserved (a King) but in fact two single mattresses pushed together. Notifying reception, they arranged a change of rooms to another Deluxe - this time far more spacious with lounge seating area. Upon inquiring as to the significantly different size, I was advised this was due to the hotels age. A poor excuse,…"
December 2012,honestly the only place to stay in London if you can afford it,"Browns is as good as it gets in every respect. the whole experience is seemless, professional, special and uniquely memorable. we spent a few days in the hotel before Christmas. the little touches such as personalized gingerbread men for my daughters and stockings on Christmas eve with small gifts really impressed me - everyone was happy to go that extra mile to make sure that our stay was great. my daughter was ill during the stay and the team really couldn't help enough. I cannot complete the review without mentioning the concierge service - if you look up concierge in the dictionary i swear you will find a picture of Simon and his team - they know London better than anyone - and I am a true Londoner! not forgetting also the doormen who help, entertain and are the icing on the…"
January 2013,Lovely weekend celebrating my mum's birthday,"I was lucky enough to win a 2 night stay at The Brown's hotel, and used it to celebrate my mum's birthday. We stayed at room 119 - a delux suite.  The room was lovely, big and quiet. I personally prefer a harder bed, but saying that it was comfortable. The bathroom had one of the best showers I ever tried! The breakfast was plentiful, and I would recommend to try the apricot jam with yogurt!  The staff was lovely throughout our stay!   "
December 2012,Great hotel superb location,"Top class hotel with very warm decor and welcoming rooms. both bar and restaurant are excellent. Hot chocolate in the bar is one of the best I ever had made of real thick chocolate. Hotel located in Mayfair close to almost everything by foot both for top class shoping, museums galleries and restaurants. Highly recomended"
December 2012,A wonderful time,"We decided to see New Year in at Donovan's bar & stay overnight. We were very well looked after throughout by attentive staff & enjoyed a fun evening, followed by a good night's sleep and a tasty breakfast well served. We couldn't have asked for more."
December 2012,Outstanding,"After being unable to book in for afternoon tea , we decided we would book lunch . Everything was amaizing , from the  service , atmosphere , food to the temperature of the red wine , perfect .if you like good quality food and fancy a treat then I would recomend . Will be back next year but do want to have afternoon tea next time"
December 2012,A Great Place to Stay,"We stayed at this hotel for my husbands birthday (50th), the package that I secured had Champagne on arrival with fruit chocolate fondue and much more besides.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very special the hotel itself has a wonderful relaxed but very luxurious atmosphere. On check in the reception upgraded us to a junior suite free of charge which was a lovely touch.  The room was contemporary and very comfortable, breakfast the following morning in Hix was very good again the service was attentive but not over bearing.  Would definitely recommend this hotel I know it isn't cheap but for special treat well worth the money two happy customers hopefully to be returning at some point soon."
December 2012,Christmas afternoon tea,"When all the other grand hotels are full for bookings on afternoon tea, you can still book about one month ahead for Brown’s. They may even allow a few walk-ins. Festive tea brings unlimited sandwiches, scones, mince pies, Christmas cake/log, tea cakes and petits-fours. All very tasty and beautifully presented. Nice atmosphere. Expensive at £51 per head but worth it."
December 2012,Loved the Brown's experience so much stayed an extra night!,"I do not often write reviews but felt as I use this site regularly when booking hotels/restaurants  it was about time I gave something back.  I booked this hotel for a Christmas trip to London with my 3 children (2 of which are very young) after browsing on the Internet 'best places to stay in London with children'. I have stayed in London frequently over the years and had yet to find somewhere that was luxurious, atmospheric, stylish and ..... Amazing for the children. A combination that doesn't always go hand in hand.  I had previously booked another hotel for our trip and had no qualms about cancelling that after speaking with Alastair. Booking was easy & efficient, I felt assured that I was making the right choice.    Our 3 hour car journey turned into a 5 hour journey (not…"
August 2012,"Great Location, Lovely staff .","Loved the hotel from the minute we arrived . The staff were professional but never haughty and even laughed at my partner's attempt at humour. The bar was superb and I would like to give a very special mention to the delightful young lady who served us on two occassions. (saturday 25 August) I have stayed at some very prestigous hotels and including a highly acclaimed Michelin 2 star outside Oxford and I can truthfully say that Brown's staff and service is second to none. Only one gripe. The cooked full English breakfast was only passable, our toast tasted as though it had been cooked several hours before and the coffee was weak and cold. I ordered smoked salmon and scrambled egg which was excellent however. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
June 2012,Best hotel in London,"Browns hotel has that wonderful mix of being an nternational hotel, yet feeling very intimate and boutique like.  The staff are always friendly and remeber you. The rooms are light, spacious and decorated in a very chic manner.  The location is ideal and perfect for the business or tourise traveller.  The bar is always buzzing and Hix downstairs is the perfect start to anyday.  Great gym and always a wonderful experience."
August 2012,Not what I hoped,"My husband and I stayed at Browns for one night ten days ago - the hotel is wonderfully well-located and the interiors are stunning.  Our room, if a bit small, was everything we needed except for the layer of dust on the TV cabinet and on the floor at the bottom of the bed!   Breakfast was delicious with a lovely menu that had everything from eggs to bubble and squeak and lovely fresh carrot juice, but again, the service let it all down - we only managed to get the waiter's attention for the bill by actually getting up and preparing to leave - and the breakfast room is not that big!     I am in London regularly for overnight stays and generally stay at the Stafford or Dukes which are equally well-situated.  While I appreciate that our overnight experience may not be a true…"
August 2012,A sure thing,"I love this hotel.  The staff is professional and accommodating.  The rooms are tasteful and it is in a perfect location- close to tourist attractions and great shopping.  It is a ""go to "" spot for tea and cocktails but it is not as pretencious as other places which makes it appealing."
August 2012,A London Experience,"Brown's Hotel is an elegant hide-away off the main street of Piccadilly. A short walk to Buckingham Palace, White Hall, and Oxford Circus, it is perfectly located for those who enjoy walking around the city. It is a block from the tube station, so access to other parts of London is very easy as well.  We found all the staff to be very helpful and professional. The hotel has a quiet luxury about it. There is a nice bar, and sitting area for their famous afternoon tea, just off the entrance. The breakfast is a lovely cold buffet, with the option of hot menu items.  Our room was not the largest, but it was fine.  There was a nice sitting area, work desk, very large bathroom, small but separate closet/dressing area, and came with the robes, slippers, and other amenities you'd expect…"
August 2012,"Nice old world charm, but...","Old world charm in the the heart of London, a very nice hotel and the staff are almost over attentive.  However, it was significantly over priced when considering the size of the room the lack of effective air con, no coffee facilities, and the high price of the extras, i.e. internet.  In summary, nice experience, but next time for the price I will be shopping around."
August 2012,fabulous !,"We had lunch at Browns today, what a treat. The food was fautless, and, as always, the staff were attentive and friendly. We always try and stop off here when we`re in town and there is never anything to complain about. If you`re looking for an oasis of calm and old-world charm, try Browns. It`s a bit early yet, but if you`re in town Christmas shopping, you will get the best hot chocolate in the world here. Enjoy."
April 2012,Not the real Brown's,"I've been stopping at Brown's since I was just a kid, perhaps a dozen times scattered throughout the 70's, 80's and 90's.  It was the quintessential English country house hotel--just faintly shabby, but immaculate and authentically itself. The hotel always said the same thing:  You're in England now.  Since the ""renovation"" I've haven't had the heart to stay more than one night--I'd planned to stay 5 nights, but couldn't stand seeing what they'd done to the old pile.  If you never stayed at Brown's before the ""renovation"" I'm sure you think it's lovely and very trendy British modern, but the experience pales to the feel of its previous glory.  Yeah, yeah, I know things change and Brown's is a business, not a museum--but still they didn't have to extinguish all the things that…"
July 2012,"""The Donovan Bar""","Visited The Donovan Bar as an after dinner spot and was very pleased. The Donovan Bar is the perfect example of what a truly great bar should be. All in all an amazing ambience, great atmosphere, cocktails prepered by knowledge bartenders and served by friendly and attentive staff.This makes an excellent venue to relax and unwind or to get ready to hit the town further. I will definetely be making a return visit in the near future."
August 2012,Browns Hotel London,A great hotel. A friendly environment with efficient and helpful staff. Lovely decorations with a 1st class experience. Amazing food in the main dining room and great snacks in the bar. A famous tearoom with gorgous afternoon tea. A great location with great staff. A must go to hotel!!
December 2012,Where to start! Fabulous!,"I booked this as a combined 85th birthday and Christmas treat for my mother.   The hotel is gorgeous in any case - with decor that is modern, restrained, and restful whilst still in keeping with the history of the building - but it was the staff made our visit extra special. From the moment we stepped out of the cab we were made to feel so welcome. Reception were friendly, helpful, and efficient - the concierge likewise. There was one member of staff at breakfast who was a bit grumpy - but he was still attentive.  The birthday cake and champagne on ice for my mother in our room on arrival was a delightful touch. The room, including the bathroom, was lovely - and although overlooking the street was completely quiet thanks to the triple glazing. I'm quite fussy about hotel rooms -…"
November 2012,Excellent in every respect,It's years since I visited Brown's last and I should not have left it so long. Faultless service in every respects. There is nothing more to add except I will not being leaving it so long until the next time.
November 2012,Lovely Lunch,"Had super lunch  ... we arrived very late at 3pm but the waiting staff were fantastic, soup and pork gorgeous, puddings a little lack lustre but perfectly fine. My Friends dishes were equally as good. If you want old world charm this is the place."
November 2012,Superb,"Brown's Hotel is one of the best I've ever stayed in, beautiful room, excellent staff, very friendly atmosphere without feeling dowdy. Absolutely adored it, and if finances allow, would definitely return  Some very minor drawbacks were a lot if road noise (it is in the heart of London), and the room wasn't ready when we checked in - and when it was declared ready by the chamber staff, there was a lamp lacking a bulb requiring maintenance staff to come up. Minor stuff compared to the bottle of bubbly we got :)"
November 2012,EXCELLENT,"Me and my girlfreind stayed here for 2 nights over my birthday weekend and thought the hotel was fabulous. nicely appointed rooms and very clean throughout. We were upgraded i think because it was my birthday and the executive room we were given was great. Bathroom was spacious with a double sink, shower and large bath big enough for 2. The staff were very attentive throughout the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for them and a late check out was easily obtained. You must try the Donovan Bar it has great cocktails with talented barmen that really take pride in what they do. Also a must is the afternoon tea WOW the best i have had in london and they just keep bringing sandwiches, cakes and tea as you finish a plate another appears, all included in the one price so make sure…"
November 2012,A real shame...,"We spent the weekend at Browns, really looking forward to it! The staff and hotel where as promised, from the door man to to maids. The room, 4th floor, 427 was lovely, however... We didnt sleep at all. Watch out, there is a noise all night from the light well, some sort of extractor, a constant buzzing machinery noise all night! And to top it off, when I reported this at check out, nothing! No apology or refund, A real shame as the rest of the hotel lived up to all we where expecting, so just make sure you keep away from the rooms facing the light well!! And enjoy the rest of the hotel."
November 2012,'Secret hotel' con but still an excellent hotel!,"Booked Brown's using lastminute's 'secret hotel' which indicated we were booking a £600 per night room at a 50% discount.  The room we were allocated was a king size and we have not found any evidence on any booking site, or indeed Brown's own site, that such a room has a £600 tariff.  So beware the stated discount!  This was very disappointing/annoying particularly as the room we were allocated (Room 219) shook due to apparently being above the hotel's air conditioning unit.  By shook, I mean like being on a cross channel ferry....  When we complained, however, we were delighted to be upgraded to an amazing suite which turned our first stay at Brown's into a fantastic experience.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff are, without fail, warm, friendly and helpful.  A particular…"
November 2012,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"5 of us recently went to Brown's for my Nan's birthday. Wow what a warm welcome to arrive too.... The service was platinum and the food was delicious and did not stop coming.... we certanly did not leave hungary. I told them in advance it was my Nan's birthday and they had arranged a small cake with candle which they bought out to Happy Birthday being played on the piano. Well, thank you Brown's for making my Nan's birthday extra special.  We all shall recommend you to friends and family."
October 2012,yet another splendid birhtday lunch at browns,visited the restaurant for my birthday lunch and we weren't disappointed.  We had a lovely spacious table for the 7 of us. The service was excellent and coudlnt be faulted.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented.  the final topping on the cake was beign sung happy birthday by the staff and being presneted with a lovely cake!
October 2012,Consistently Good,"We are regular visitors to London and we always stay at Browns. The combination of modern rooms, excellent service - especially the concierge and bell staff - and a great location makes it tough to beat. The breakfasts are great and our only gripe is probably that the bar lacks a bit of soul and is always overcrowded. Otherwise however the hotel is great and we are always looked after superbly."
November 2011,Really wonderful,"We stayed here to visit the theatre and celebrate our anniversary. We could not have been more spoilt! The staff went out of their way to ensure we had a very happy and memorable stay, and filled our visit with small things that meant so much: the box of hand made chocolates to take to the theatre with us, the cake and champagne on our return, and the beautiful rose petals scattered on the bed with romantic candles lit in the bathroom and bedroom at turn down. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble, you get the impression that they go the extra mile here simply because it gives them pleasure.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a slice of purely spoiling luxury. The location is great for nipping out to the shops on Bond Street (and they do a great tea after…"
July 2012,Finally...a good London hotel,"Our plan was to stay at the Langham Hotel in London for 3 nights but after just 2 my claustrophobia got the better of me and we shifted over to the Rocco Forte Brown Hotel instead  The good: great location, super efficient and helpful staff, clean, modern decor, HUGE rooms (and I mean HUGE), beautifully presented breakfast, great children's program including a welcome cookie decorated with our daughter's name, a children's sized robe and slippers, candy, and more.  The bad: the tea room was gorgeous and the staff very nice but I wouldn't say the food selection/quality (at 40 pounds per person) was any better than tea rooms I've been to for 1/3 of the price.   Bottom Line: I will definitely stay here again. It's not the most reasonably priced hotel but for London it's the best…"
June 2012,Heaven in the afternoon tea room,"My friends and I decided to book for champagne afternoon tea and wanted to try Browns Tea Room and what a delightful afternoon and experience we had. We are all veterans to afternoon tea and I have to say this is the best afternoon tea I have had so far in my 38 years. The choice of teas on offer superb, the sandwiches are replenished until you have had enough and the cakes are to die for. The champagne is, well, all I can say 2 bottles later between 3 was awful, no it was lovely. The staff offer great service and are very professional and totally get what customer service should be. The pianist great and played our request. This was a one off."
June 2012,Subtle combination of tradition and modernism,"The Brown's is this subtle combination of tradition and modernism. Great room, spacious in size and ample room to separate your living space form work space. Spacious bed with high quality linen and pillows. Terrific bathroom and quiet place in the heart of London. Breakfast is in a gorgeous room and quality is outstanding and makes it a perfect place for your first meeting in the morning.  Service is good though I would have a small hesitation between discreet or distant.  TV set is below standard(quality of screen and reception), wifi is only at a cost. Sockets not well distributed.  Definitely a place to try."
June 2012,Staff that treat you with the utmost respect and facilities that deliver,"I have been recently incapacitated and I needed to be accomodated in a wheelchair in London`s West End. After trying to check in to 2 other high-end hotels that offer ""disabled accessible rooms"" and not being able to access a toilet, or indeed the lift, I found the sanctuary that was Browns Hotel, Albermarle St. Any discomfort at being confined to a wheelchair was mitigated by first class service from every single member of staff, from the greeting at the door through to room service and everything in between. I cannot recommend highly enough the facilities and staff for those who need the extra bit of tlc without being patronised. Nothing is too much trouble for these people and you will have a perfect Central London base from which to work/explore."
June 2012,"My new favorite Hotel in London, Best location!","i have stayed in many of the higher-end hotels in London. Brown's is in a great location ( shopping, park, ect). Our rate in high season June was half the price of the other hotels we like and our friends were staying in Claridges Hotel paying three times our rate and they loved our room! After a very warm welcome from front desk we were taken to a classic room. Small but great beds and bathrooms are really nice. We decided to upgrade to the next level of room and had a wonderful view of the street. Double windows so didn't hear anything!  Every staff member at this hotel are professional and very polite. They remember your name and are always offering to help in any way! Look for best options online and ask if they participate in any of the premium credit card company programs…"
June 2012,"Fantastic hotel, great experience","Browns is a fantastic hotel - a real British experience. It feels more like a boutique hotel with the level of service and personalised attention. The concierge welcomed my husband and I by name when we arrived - it was our first visit! The breakfasts are excellent and nothing is too much trouble to prepare. The rooms are fantastic, very spacious with equal size bathrooms. The concierge is so helpful offering great ideas for site seeing and restaurants. The highlight of the stay was definately the high tea - what an amazing experience but make sure you book well in advance.The only negative comment is that beware when they offer you a morning paper; it sounds like it is complimentary but it does show up on your bill. Other than that, I give this hotel 5 stars."
June 2012,Great Stay for a romantic weekend in London,"I had a lovely weekend here with my wife.  Service was typical British, efficient but not overly pandering and kept at a respectable distance so in my opinion just right.  We had a great suite which overlooked some boutique shops, large open room with very high ceilings and floor to ceiling windows which opened to a very small balcony.  The layout was a little quirky but in a charming character way rather than a inconvenience.   Breakfast was very good, cannot comment on food or the bar as we were out and about or ordered room service.  Overall I would certainly stay again, the cost would be the main driver in the future but if a opportunity to return which offered good value I would book immediately."
March 2012,"Location excellent, everything else on a par with price.","Brown's Hotel is situated right in the centre of the vibrant city of London. A few minutes walk from the shopping district of Old/New Bond Street, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus to name but a few. For the price, the rooms were as expected if not a little antiquated. Don't expect all the mod-cons as you pay more for the location than for the service. The ceilings were a little low, the front desk adequate, but it does have the celebrated afternoon tea hot spot. Bed was comfortable and spacious which is a definite plus!"
June 2012,Intimate and super deluxe,"Brown's keeps getting better and better with its highly polished professional staff welcoming each visitor as an honored guest. Perfect food by Hix. Lively bar scene. And maybe the world!s most comfortable beds, pillows and linens. Even seven gigantic bath towels in junior suite! Glamourous Italian and Braziilian clientele Our favorite hotel!"
July 2012,perfect location,"What a welcome awaits, all the staff were friendly and efficient. nothing seemed too much trouble. Our room was tastefully decorated with all the little extra's you need, my daughter forgot her tooth brush and one was sent straight up to the room. it was also very quiet, which is sometimes hard to get in bustling London.! Breakfast was absolutly delicious, best scrambled egg we've had in a hotel! Extreemly tempting shops right outside...if you can avoid them then more just a stroll away. We normally stay Knightbridge side of London, but this was a lovely change, we would definatley stay here again."
February 2012,Superior Service,"The Brown's Hotel will not disappoint you when it comes to service. It is unusual for us to say that one of the highlights of our trips was a hotel staff member. But in this case it was. Manuela is a front desk employee who is not only professional and lazer focused on customer experience, but she appeared to genuinly enjoy assisting us and seemed to have an innate ability to make us comfortable.  She was not stuffy in any manner and she had a very enjoyable sense of humor. We look forward to seeing her again.   Kevin M.  New york"
June 2012,Superb accommodation and first class staff and service,Well worth a visit. Really looked after by all the staff. The food was excellent in the main dining room with all staff constantly in attention. Lovely rooms equipped with a good library and an excellent selection of reading material. First class location for central London and its facilities
July 2012,A treat in Town,"This was a bit of a treat. Lovely charm of a vintage hotel combined with modern elegance. Our room overlooked the rear entrance to Tiffany's and wonderfully for a London Hotel, traffic and street noise was very minimal. We went for pre dinner drinks in The Donavon Bar. This was Lively with a good atmosphere. All types there. Some dressed for a night out others there were obviously winding down.  The champagne by the glass is Ruinart. I chose the Blanc de Blanc at £20.50, which although has quite lively bubbles does have quite a sickly aroma which I assume is an aquired one.  Since we had a fairly long wait for our drinks, i'm afraid I didn't have that opportunity as we had dinner booked elsewhere. Gorgeous looking clear bottle though.  Breakfast was a delight. I asked for…"
July 2012,Superb,"Excellent food in the Hix Albemarle restaurant, some great dishes the home smoked salmon was just lovely, the snails and black pudding a great combination. Cornish Barnsley chop with cucumber was crispy, tender and full of flavor and the chocolate mouse for desert had great texture all in all a brilliant meal."
October 2011,As expected,Fabulous hotel loved our stay will be back soon could find no fault with surprising extras and service
July 2012,Quintessential English afternoon tea experience,"For a very special birthday celebration tea party, we could not have chosen better than Browns Hotel. This is quintessentially English afternoon tea experience - sandwiches, melt-in-the-mouth scones, clotted cream and jam, pastries, Victoria sponge and fruit cake - but there is also a 'healthier' option they call Tea Tox Tea. The two members of our party of eight who chose this less calorific option described it as 'scrumptious'. There is a wide range of teas, including Browns own afternoon blend which was my choice (reviving and refreshing). An advance phone call by 'best friend' ensured there was a delicate one-person birthday cake - the plate was decorated with a personal message in chocolate - specially for the birthday girl. The staff were charming and attentive. Our table…"
July 2012,A Little Piece of Heaven in Central London,"Ahhhh, I love this place. It is everything a smart hotel should be. It may be über posh, über swish and über expensive, but it wears its status lightly, with a casual, relaxed air. It never feels imposing or stuffy, the staff are charm itself - everything is effortless.  When I die, and should I be lucky enough to go to heaven - please God let it be like Brown's."
May 2012,a gem,What a lovely experience. Understated elegance at its best. Stayed here while on a 3 day trip to London. Would stay again.
May 2012,Splurge in London,"Browns Hotel is all about understated elegance and comfort.  If you are prepared to splurge a bit, don't want to stay in a big, busy hotel, but want a classy hotel in a great location, this is it.  The building has been beautifully restored, and while the elevators are tiny and the hallways narrow and winding, our room was spacious and very comfortable.  Our room was interior facing, which made it extremely quiet at night.  The tearoom and bar, while a bit pricey, are excellent and great places to relax and people watch.  Located in Mayfair, the hotel is an easy walk to all the sights of central London, and near lots of restaurants.  For runners, it is an easy jog to several nearby parks, creating opportunities for a multitude of interesting runs.  The fitness center is not…"
February 2013,Afternoon tea at Browns - excellent value,From the minute we arrived until we left the staff were extremely attentive.  As soon as we had finished our plate of sandwiches we were asked if we would like another plate. Having spent the whole day exploring London we were hungry so we did have another plate. For the two of us we were given five small scones and then the plate was replaced with another five.  There were five fancy cakes on the top tier and then we were asked if we would like a slice of Victoria sandwich or chocolate cake.  All this with two pots of tea each.  Can anywhere else beat this for value? Probably not. The pianist played a tune for my husband that he likes and at the end of our tea our waiter came out with a small cake with candle in for my husband for his birthday.  We will be back to this…
December 2012,Fabulous.,"I treated my husband to a night at your fabulous hotel for his birthday as it is always tricky to find presents for someone whose birthday is 2 days before Christmas.  It was also a chance for us to have a 'night-off' from our 3 kids and dramas of building a house.  It was excellence all the way.  From the doorman to the lady at check-in who addressed me by name and not madam.  Our room was spacious beyond expectation and the views into the offices nearby were a reminder of what a compact city London is and what an oasis your hotel is.  They sent up a cake for my husband's birthday, unexpected, and we are already looking forward to coming back again for his next birthday.  Thank you again for a wonderful retreat in the middle of the most fabulous city in the world."
January 2013,A Wonderful Weekend,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Brown’s Hotel for two nights a couple weekends ago and the entire experience was just terrific.  We were celebrating a ‘big’ birthday and the staff at Browns were extremely helpful in making arrangements on booking for Champagne and flowers to be made available in the room on arrival.  We were though surprised and delighted to find a birthday cake and a hand signed card from the reception team there as well.  These were very thoughtful gestures.   The room was beautiful, the bed exceptional and the bathroom was ideal.   Overall the service from every member of staff we encountered was excellent and the ambience within the hotel both in our room and in the public rooms was superb. I frequently visit London – mainly on business and have…"
January 2013,High Tea at the Brown's Hotel,"It is our first trip to London and decided to have a ""tea experience"". As per our ""Eat London"" book, we booked the Brown's Hotel for our afternoon tea. It was delightful! Our server was as sweet as can be, the tea delicious and scones sublime. If you are interested in a real ""English"" experience, I would definitely recommend the Brown's Hotel."
September 2012,Clean and Contemporary Style,"I was recently at the hotel, I was very well treated. The front desk staff was very helpful and polite. My check-in and check-out were very rapids. As a leading member I received my upgrade, champagne, breakfast and free internet. The hotel is very well located, close to everything My suite was large and very well decorated. Room service was very good. The bathroom amenities were excelent. I will return for sure."
January 2013,Tranquility in Town,"From the uniformed doormen to the oak panelled entrance and English Tea Room, Brown's exudes the understated air of a Gentlemans Club . As befitting the oldest hotel in London the timeless elegance is complimented by first class staff with a 'here to please' attitude.The rooms are well appointed, with very comfortable beds and excellent bathrooms, our only gripe being the proximity of the offices opposite in Dover St and the absence of any privacy blinds. Afternoon tea is excellent,the Baby Grand Piano creating the perfect leisurely atmosphere, booking essential, whilst  Donovan's Bar has a jazzy atmosphere all of it's own with a great range of cocktails.         Breakfast in Hix's was nothing to write home about and doesn't compare to The Wolseley down the road in Piccadilly."
December 2012,"Great location, otherwise not all that impressive","I was honestly expecting better—this hotel's not particularly impressive. I stayed there with my family in late December, and it was mostly kind of average. The hotel's at a practical location, though—5-10 minutes' walk from both Green Park and Piccadilly Circus. There's only one elevator for all the guests, which makes it take a while sometimes. The rooms are fine, comfortable beds and all. The shower was a bit grimy. Internet access is charged. Breakfast is absolutely dreadful—if you stay here, make sure to get a room-only rate and have breakfast at the bakery just around the corner."
January 2013,Informal Atmosphere and Good Food,"We visited Browns for Afternoon Tea having been unable to book at The Ritz.  The selection of teas was impressive and the constantly replenished supply of food was impressive.  We were asked more than once if we would like more sandwiches, scones and cakes and were given fresh tea without having to ask.  The atmosphere was very informal and fun and I would definitely recommend the whole experience."
January 2013,"Beautiful hotel, great customer service","My husband and I stayed at the Brown's Hotel for a long weekend with our 7 month old baby.  The minute we entered the hotel, we were greeted with great service.  Check in was no problem and they upgraded us to a Junior Suite free of charge.  The lobby area is beautiful and elegant.  The room was very spacious with an area for sitting and area for the bed.  Bathroom was very spacious as well with a shower and separate large tub.  Everything was clean and looked well cared for.  Housekeeping came right away to set up a cot for our baby and the details put into making our baby comfortable was impeccable.  Not only did they set up a cot, they made it up with nice scented blankets, set up a mobile above the bed, brought in a bottle warmer, play mat, nappy trash can, and also left…"
December 2012,Excellent all round,"Brown's is a delightful blend of old-fashioned English and high-end contemporary. The public spaces have character and charm, while the rooms (or at least ours) was sleek in a ""minimalist luxury"" style. The bathroom was large and luxurious, and the room was well appointed.  We had breakfast in the restaurant, which is excellent although certainly not inexpensive. We also had dinner once, which was very good, with a creative menu including many traditional English dishes with a contemporary twist.  The bar is also a fun place to spend an hour or two. We did so several times! It's very lively, with a great buzz and great people watching. Also, excellent cocktails and a very personable barman (or should I say mixologist?), Adam. We chose to sit at the bar, rather than at a table,…"
June 2012,Fantastic location,Spent 4 days at this hotel. Location can't be beat. Very expensive but service was exceptional. Rooms were clean but somewhat dated. This hotel is in a location that's a shoppers dream. Every major player within walking distance. Many good restaurants in the area. Walking distance to Picadilly Circus and several major tourists attractions. Can't say enough about service. Would definitely stay again at thi property.
June 2012,"Great location, comfort and history!",We attended a business conference at this very old but modernized hotel.  I beliveve it is the oldest hotel in London.  The rooms of course are updated but the ceilings are a bit low.  Very comfortable beds and nice bathrooms.  Service was excellent.  Bar was nice and breakfast ok.  The afternoon tea is very special one of the best in London.  The hotel is just steps away from all the designer stores.  An expensive place in a great location with super service.
May 2012,High Tea,"While visiting London for my grand-daughters 21st she wonted to experience  High Tea, me being on a Gluten Free diet it was a matter of finding an establishment that catered for both normal food and Gluten.Grand-daughter came up with Browns Hotel they gave us first class treatment from the minute we stepped inside the door. The variety of food for both diets was exceptional in taste presentation and atmosphere (we were sat beside the open fire on a cold rainy day) sandwiches, cakes, scones, choice of wines, tea.I would recommend the High Tea at this hotel as 5 star and when we were to leave the hotel porter went to the end of the street in the rain to get us a taxi."
June 2012,Wonderful Staff,"Everyone was so kind, the hotel very clean, the food very good, the staff was helpful."
May 2012,Fine traditional betel and service,"Room was ready before scheduled check in time. We had a traditional English afternoon tea which was excellent. The concierge arranged for the Chef to make us an English specialty of pork pie which is not on the menu, they were excellent. The only complaint we had was that the heating was on in the bathroom which made the room warm, we had to request it be turned off. Location is close to the main shopping streets, bond street, Piccadilly street, Oxford street and the theatre district."
June 2012,Posh but relaxed afternoon tea,"Very nice welcoming, not snobbish, great pastry, finger sandwiches average. Waiters were attentive but made you feel at ease.  Only downside was that other guests were more casual than smart."
June 2012,Very nice but you pay for it...,"Very nice hotel and fun scene.  However, our room, not suite was $1,000 a night and they had the audacity to charge close close to $25 a day for internet service and automatically add $14 a day for a room service tip.  While the hotel was very nice I thought the internet charge was pushing it given we spent over $3500 for just one room over three nights."
May 2012,Great Location Some Drawbacks however.....,"We stayed in a deluxe room which was a the top of the hotel. Whilst the rooms were very clean, they do require some updating if they are to remain competitive- they are starting to look a little tatty in places and the b&o tv dated. The biggest let down for this hotel is the restaurant- Hix which was generally poor- not a great menu and the breakfast was sloppy- food ordered was just dumped on the plate- the sausages were not great etc. no doubt about it though, this is a great location but there are better options for the price. "
May 2012,The Best Experience - The Best Hotel,"I stayed at Browns Hotel the night before my wedding, and on my Wedding night. Both nights we were given an upgrade, to the most fabulous suite - this without any request or prompt from us. The staff were not only professional, efficient and courteous they were  warm, friendly and extremely kind. There is absolutely nothing to fault with this hotel, it has to be the best in London and it was by far the best hotel experience we have had anywhere in the World. Truly, truly outstanding !"
May 2012,Old English ambiance...comfortable in its own skin.,"Brown's is by no means stuffy.  Quite the contrary.  They seemed to have accomplished a fresh feeling with their warm service, simple but excellent kitchen, and their public rooms.  High tea is celebrated as an art form here.  The bar has an excellent selection of single malt scotch for the connoisseur.  And the bar tender was a artist, a mixologist of the highest order.   The owners are to be complimented.  Yes, I'd go back but I still need to check out some of the other excellent hotels before Browns makes my short list.  Above all, thank you for your kind hospitality."
July 2012,Afternoon Tea,"Had a champagne afternoon tea here with a friend, Saturday 28th July 2012. We had a wonderful time. The food was superb and the staff were very friendly and courteous. They made us extremely welcome and comfortable even though we stayed for hours chatting. Would love to come again."
September 2012,A fine afternoon for high tea.,"My friend treated me to afternoon tea for my birthday. We arrived a little early, and had a drink in the Donovan bar, which was very nice. Excellent choice of drinks, that were reasonably priced.  Afternoon tea was excellent and they catered to our every need.   Due to myself being a veggie, and my friend being vegan. If you are a strict veggie, make it clear, as they were serving jelly. However the staff were excellent at getting me a replacement dish.  It was quite busy when we visited, but the staff were excellent and very accommodating.  The only down side that I could find, was that the carpet were afternoon tea was served, was very grubby and the seating, where we were sat, had a lot of food stains on it. I think we visited before a deep clean was going to be performed. I…"
August 2012,Old World Charm with New World amenities,"Oh Brown's....such a lovely stay here! Rooms are amazingly appointed and the turndown service is lovely. Everything has been thought of here. They have kept the old world charm but strategically arranged modern art and modern touches throughout.  My room was on the 5th floor and I found no trouble from street noise at all, even with the window open. However, there are rooms located that look into a courtyard so request one of those if you are worried about noise. It's central London and there are a number of bars/pubs around and it can get rowdy.  Breakfast at Hix is lovely. the buffet for continental is divine...lovely fresh fruit and eggs, all locally sourced.  Located just around the corner from Green Park which was great, easy connections for the Jubille or Piccadilly and…"
September 2012,afternoon tea and donovan bar,"I went on sunday the 16th of september with my family to discover the english culture in the tea room of the Brown's hotel. it was actually my first afternoon tea experience, not only in London but in general and as I am not a big tea drinker, I am trully imprest by the quality of the food, he tea and the service we had during this experience provided by Marie, Marta and an Italian woman than unfortunalty I do not remember her name. I can say than they made this experience exceptionnal.  After this amazing experience we moved to the Donovan bar, which is a bit more what I usually fancy. This Donovan bar is not just a piece of storie, The welcoming provided by Paula makes you feel straight away like at home, and the cocktails made by Martin and Matt were for me one of the finest…"
September 2012,another great stay in our favourite London hotel,"Saturday night we stayed at Browns again as we were in London for a big family party.  Each time we return we remember why - the usual great welcome from the doorman, wonderful attentive service throughout the stay and the fantastically comfortable bed for a welcome good night's sleep after partying late.   Breakfast - full English for me with wheat free bread (nothing ever too much trouble here) and scrambled egg with smoked salmon for my husband went down very well after a wonderful selection of fruits etc from the buffet table!  With endless cups of frothy cappucinos (they bring a clean cup with every top up) we were well set up for the day."
November 2011,a shocker,expensive and noisy.well located yes but that is about it.i complained but never heard anything in response.lots of noise from the street made it impossible to sleep.the feedback form was a thesis.i cannot believe anyone has time to fill it all in.a night i never wish to repeat.
September 2012,Attentive staff; well-appointed room; great location,"A weekend visit in the city brought us to Brown's and we were very pleased with what we found. From the greeting at the door through the check-in process and subsequently, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating.  Our room, an executive king, was spacious and beautifully furnished; the bath was elegant and well-stocked. The public spaces are congested--partly because of the configuration of the old but charming building and partly from activity.  Afternoon tea draws a lot of visitors and we chose to bypass the crowds.  The hotel is well-situated to shopping, theater, and dining.  We had some small quibbles like finding the ""courtyard"" filled with air conditioning equipment and that the hotel still charges for Internet access in the age of wi-fi, but we enjoyed our stay…"
August 2012,BEST AFTERNOON TEA!,"We booked this at short notice and were lucky enough to be offered a cancellation at 4.00pm - perfect!  Stepping into Browns is like going back in time - it is classic and yet sympathetically modern at the same time.  We were greeted by the doorman and then made our way into the Library where tea was being served.  We were shown to a taller table - I think they looked at my husband and realised that he would not be comfortable at a low table and were very quickly waited on.  The waiting staff are superb - you never have to ask for anything really they are just there - not enough sweetner - it appears without being asked for.  The sandwiches were replenished continuously, as were the scones and the patisseries.  I am not going to say how many plates of sandwiches we ate but they…"
August 2012,excellent location,"A very pleasant hotel in one of the best areas in London, close to Bond Street, Picadilly, Burlington Arcade, and the best luxury stores and tailors London has to offer. The rooms are OK in size and the design is modern but warm. However, the rooms are rather bland, without a luxury feel, neither chic nor very tasteful and miss any charm. The TV was tiny and the remote grubby. We had a room on the inside with a rather depressing view of a light shaft. The bathroom was adequate but missed a separate shower. Service is excellent, however, very friendly and efficient, really above par. Breakfast is also far above the usual even what is to be expected in 5star luxury hotels. The hotel is well-known for its high tea and with good reason, it is worth it. All in all a very good hotel,…"
August 2012,Old time style in modern times,"My daughters and I had a sublime afternoon tea as a birthday treat for me.  Nothing was to much trouble, the serving staff were masters of their craft and shimmered round the room unobtrusively ensuring that not one request went unactioned.  Now, the food. If there is afternoon tea in heaven it would be like this. Our parties differing requirements ( Gluten free, vegetarian and normal ) caused not a ripple of difficulty with a special mention going to Andras who ensured the food didn't run out. It's the only afternoon tea I've had that could compare to Claridges for the sheer joy of the experience."
May 2012,Majestic in Mayfair,"Brown's may be my favorite hotel in the world.  It is charmingly relaxing with outstandingly friendly service delivered with such verve and style.  Afternoon Tea is a standout and one of the best in a city of superlatives.  My room was delightful, well appointed with soft as silk linens and pillows that made me want to forget my own (for domestic drivinn travel I usually take my own pillow).  Both breakfast (soft boiled egg done perfectly and toast soldiers) was the perfect start for a busy day and one lovely dinner rounded out my dining at Brown's.  All offerings were excellent and the deep fried asparagus stood out!  Brown's makes you feel comfortable, watches out for women travelers and is so very convenient to most London points.  I want to go back again and again!"
October 2012,Another fantastic experience,We were overwhelmed by the grandeur of the Kipling suite and could well see how Rudyard Kipling felt inspired to write The Jungle Book here. The perfect setting for intimate pre-dinner drinks with friends after a refreshing service of afternoon tea.  As always the facilities in the suite were of the highest standard and the bed was luxuriously comfortable. The staff in the hotel were friendly and helpful as ever without being obtrusive. Brown's has such a relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel one feels instantly at home. An unforgettable experience and we will be sure to return.
August 2012,Amazing,"Absolutely loved it here, was made to feel so special, the room was amazing and was such a nice place to stay. Everyone was kind and helpful, the spa was also amazing. Would love to go back here soon!"
June 2012,Great Afternoon Tea,"I highly recommend getting afternoon tea at Brown's. The tea offerings were great and you get as many tea sandwiches, scones, and pastries as you can eat! The service was great and the food was delicious. I was highly impressed and would definitely recommend going here!"
September 2012,Respite in central London,"My wife and I stayed at Brown's for five nights in late September of this year.  It was our first time at Brown's having stayed at probably a dozen hotels across Mayfair/St James/Knightsbridge over the years.  I was a delightful stay and we will definitely return.  We had a bright, spacious room on a top level floor overlooking the rooftops along Dover Street.  At first we were concerned that it would be noisy with street noise, but it was quiet, both from external noise and from any of the neighboring rooms.  It was also nice to be able to open the windows during the day.  At night, I would have preferred more or brighter lighting in the room, but it was not a problem.    Our room had a large bathroom, but rather than a walk in shower, had a bath with the traditional British…"
September 2012,A New Favorite - Highly Recommended,"We stayed at the Brown’s for two nights in September at the end of our vacation.  We had not stayed here before but will definitely be back!  We booked an Executive King room on an advance purchase rate.  Of the 6 hotels during our trip, Brown’s won as our favorite in several categories including:  best bed, best pillows, and best shower.  Our room was of good size with a walk in closet and nice sized bathroom (with separate tub and shower – yay no shower curtain!).  It was tucked away in sort of a corner and though it had no view it was very quiet.  The hotel layout is kind of funky – lots of little turns, hallways and stairs up and down.  I personally think these types of places have more character but make sure you remember how to get to your room.  My only minor complaint…"
October 2012,Tea with style with  mini scones !,"Brown's hotel is a great place to have tea, it has a club atmosphere. We always manage to get a table a short notice, specially if you choose to go at 6pm instead of the usual 5pm. It is also a nice place to come with a larger group, we were  eight. We were greeted by a very nice spanish maitre D who then took note of our choice of tea. Soon after,  our tea, lovely sandwiches, few small pastries, and mini scones !. What a shame !. Would it very difficult to serve scones warm and make them a bit larger than a small canapé ?"
October 2012,Top Class,"Have stayed at Browns many times now either on holiday or on business and it's always a stellar performer. Excellent, efficient staff, nicely equipped rooms and a superb location. If I had any gripes it would be an internally slow lift and pokey awkward corridors but those are small matters in the context of what is an excellent London Hotel. The cooked breakfast is fantastic also."
February 2012,Lovely Historic Hotel,I arrived here with my husband from Paris after catching the Eurostar to St Pancras Station.  We were checked in by a very friendly and helpful staff member who could even answer my questions about daily tube tickets.  After a couple of hours site seeing and with the weather getting chilly we returned to the hotel mid afternoon a mite peckish.  Luckily we were able to secure a table for the famous afternoon tea which really hit the spot; the room was cosy; the tea was piping hot and the sandwiches were fresh and dellicious.  The breakfast on the weekend was a very nice buffet with cooked items prepared to order.  The restaurant HIX where it is served is at pains to source Brittish farm produce (there were even duck eggs available).  The atmosphere on the weekend was peaceful…
January 2012,"Expensive, luxurious, a bit old-world","This place is expensive. We were in a standard room which was over £400 for a night. Admittedly, it was a large room by London standards, and an interesting layout and shape, as a result of the fact that the hotel is carved out a of row of 10 Georgian town houses. We certainly enjoyed our stay, and the service was excellent, but I'm not sure it was really worth over £400."
February 2012,Awesome service and location,We spent a couple of nights at the Browns on a trip to and from Venice through London.  The staff is very warm and accommodating and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious.  Loved the beds and eiderdowns!  A very nice touch was to leave a bottle of both still and sparkling water by the bedsides each evening as well as the fresh fruit in the room.  We also enjoyed the St. George bar and the bartender was a great mixologist.  Would definitely stay there again when in London.
January 2012,Old world charm and service,"I stayed her with my family for four nights, room was a much more generous size than London usual, staff were great and remembered us and our preferences leading to a good experience, cost was competitive."
December 2011,Browns spa and Hix restaurant,"Fantastic manicure at Browns by Jana Watson and lovely room to do treatment in.  Concierge very good when you enter the hotel and hotel has a lovely cosy feel. Had a meal afterwards in Hix restaurant.  Lovely dinner, staff excellent and food very good."
September 2012,A weekend of fun!,"We recently stayed at Browns for a family weekend, it was our first stay here and we were keen to find out what it was like. We were not to be disappointed! As our taxi pulled up outside, the door was swiftly opened and we were greeted like long lost friends by the doorman, our luggage disappeared and was not to be seen again until it promptly appeared in our rooms! It is a beautiful hotel, classic finishes of the era the building was constructed are everywhere, however they have very cleverly incorporated all the modern needs of todays traveller, the rooms are superb, huge beds and headboards, and virtually every conceivable item you could possibly need is in the room! from mini bar, to ice cubes, to dressing gowns, slippers, bottles of mineral water, you would struggle to find…"
September 2012,Pricey average experience,"I have been in London many times. So here is the summary for this hotel: Pros:  -Location (near Picadilly, shoopping stores on Old bond/Counduit street) -Clean facilities -Gym facilities - spa - Good/personalized service  Cons: - Overpriced compared to other hotels in the same category. - concierge's suggestions were not what we were looking for  - Food at the restaurant was not very good"
February 2012,The Donovan Bar,Recently stopped off at Brown's to celebrate my investiture.  We enjoyed a couple of bottles of fizz in The Donovan Bar.  The service was really excellent and the children in our Group were also made very welcome.  The bar staff were very attentive and kept the nibbles replnished. A very relaxing ambiance and a perfect way to celebrate a special occasion with a few drinks. We will definitely go back.
September 2011,Blues at Brown's,"We'd traveled to England on the Queen Mary II, had a grand touring trip of the Cotwolds and then headed for London for a couple of days to visit with cousins living there.  Over the year we've stayed in some wonderful -- and funky -- London hotel such as The Goring, Dukes, The Capital Hotel, Claridges, The Cadogan.   We will not make the mistake of staying at Brown's again.  In a nutshell:  overly-taxed and sometimes rude staff, smallish rooms with no character (the renovations in the last year or so are terrible to me; modern mess).  Several minor items in our room were not working properly (tv, closet light, etc., and hotel was very slow to fix). Breakfast was, of course grand, as was tea, but overall, there is a very rushed feeling.  I suppose it's all right for business, but…"
January 2012,Top tier,"I had a great stay at Browns.  The hotel conveys its 5-star status very well.  Rooms and common areas are well appointed.  Service is as you would expect.  I really liked the layout of my room.  I had the smallest room available, but there is still a separate desk area that would be great for stowing luggage.  It would work well for a longer stay.  I would put Browns in the same tier as the Savoy, Sofitel and Connaught.  I got a great rate due to the season.  Hopefully, I'll have the same luck in the future."
January 2012,Quintessentially English Afternoon Tea at Brown's Hotel London,"Yesterday I experienced my first Afternoon Tea and it was everything I had expected it to be, and every detail was highly polished! My friends and I were not sure which of the big London hotels to book into but then the advice came to ""go to Brown's"". If I could give a piece of advice on where to go for an Afternoon Tea experience you won't forget in a hurry it would be ""Go to Brown's!""  I had been led to believe that no-one comes out of Afternoon Tea feeling satisfied that they've had enough. I was slightly worried about the steep price of Brown's when I compared with it other equally well-known London hotels, but without hesitation I can say that the whole thing was worth the money.   I went with 2 of my friends from cookery school and our mission was to experience Afternoon…"
May 2012,"Great location, walking distance to tourist destinations, room service until late","Stayed here on busines for 3 nights in January and the service is impeccable. Checkout is 11:30 am, which was late enough if you woke up with a hangover but early enough that new clients will have their rooms ready in the early afternoon. If you checked in before your room is ready, ask to use their spa showers to freshen up and the hotel can accomodate you if they have a room free.  Room = very spacious. Ask for one in higher floors and one that are even numbered (facing the back of the building). The floorplan for room 510, for instance, seems slightly bigger than room 411. The rooms generally do not have a view, but it doesn't matter. If you do face the street, the street in front is a narrow one way street and you are likely to be staring into the back facade of Tiffany's…"
April 2012,A memorable afternoon - High Tea,"Organised as a surprise for my recent birthday, I was treated to a fantastic high tea at Brown's Hotel.  The tea room, housed within the beautifully appointed Hotel was warm and welcoming, even though we showed up 30 minutes early.  The selection of teas was interesting and the food was fresh and plentiful.  Highly suggest indulging with a glass of Champagne (albeit expensive).  A memorable experience that can be enjoyed by all ages."
April 2012,Enjoying a bit of history at Brown's,"I moved here from a dismal closet of a room by Victoria Station and felt as though I'd gone to Heaven.  London is SO expensive, and staying here was certainly no bargain but the quality of the experience was very high.  The single room I had was most comfortable and although the window stared right at a wall, what can you expect in a row of townhouses?  I wasn't able to get a rate that included breakfast and chose not to spend the $30+ but instead nipped out and got a good take-out breakfast just down the street.   My one complaint here is that despite all the amenities, you are charged extra for using wireless internet, a set fee per each day of useage.  This is an anomaly to me and one I've run into at other 5 star hotels.  While you can stay at any number of cheaper hotels…"
April 2012,Fantastic Hotel,"The is the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. The staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, and they upgraded us to a the Albermarle suite. The food was delicious - amazing smoked salmon. Perfect location. All round brilliant experience."
April 2012,Great Hotel,"Lately we have been travelling to London quite often and the highlight of our trips is the stay at the Brown's Hotel. It has the best location, and this helps, but what we love most is the staff. Everybody is extremely nice and helpful and every time the feeling is like coming back home. We also love the food, from the fantastic afternoon tea to a very good dinner, without forgetting the bar for a quick bite. Some rooms are on the small side, but we rather compromise some space for all the rest. We will definitely go back every time we are in London."
April 2012,The Best Hotel,"The Hotel did a marvelous job of making my eleven year old granddaughter feel like a princess. There were cookies and chocolate eggs with her name on it. There was a special tooth brush and tooth paste, and everyone was so helpful and kind. I have traveled many places in the world and I would say that this is the most outstanding hotel I have ever stayed in. The Browns in Number One in my book."
April 2012,Afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea at Brown's with a friend of mine 2 weeks a go and i was very impressed by the service and the quality of food. It was worth every penny and i strongly recommend the place . Also had a drink in the bar and the atmosphere and service was outstanding , and the selection of nibbles was great . i will definitely return again"
April 2012,To the last detail,"When you go to a 5-star hotel that you've heard is fabulous, your expectations tend to be very high.  To the point that you may be overly sensitive to the slightest imperfections.  At Brown's, it's as though they have thought about every possible thing the traveler might experience, and figured out how to make it effortless and pleasing.  It's hard to say even what makes it so special.  It's in every little detail.  The way you're always greeted, the way you're casually walked through the little elements of your room that other hotels often leave you to figure out on your own (like how the hot water in the shower comes on by pressing the little red button), like supplying an electrical converter on the desk so you can quickly plug in your computer.  I absolutely loved my…"
December 2011,Posh as Posh can be! Great with Children too.,"OVERALL This is we hear the oldest hotel in London. And, as our friends from the UK said, this is a ""very posh hotel"". And we totally agree. We were treated with great respect and all of our needs were pre-taking care of.  GREAT WITH KIDS We were particularly impressed with how well they took care of the children guests -- giving them a unique experience with the hotel with: - cookies made with their name on them - special treats left for them every day - gave them books to read and play with - unique bed trimmings for the kids - fun bathroom items - shampoos and toothpastes for kids (see pics)  WHAT WAS EXCELLENT - the beds and bedding were exquisite, like a soft fluffy pillow to lay in - bathrooms were large and luxurious - the staff thought of everything, and did not seem to…"
April 2012,"Great area, nice place","I stayed here for 2 nights in December 2011.  The concierge is great, and the setting is excellent, this part of Mayfair is the place to stay.  The lounge is the place to meet people, great vibe.  Concierge is excellent.  Room had a view on a quite boring courtyard."
April 2012,A special occasion hotel,"Brown’s is an individual top-end boutique type hotel located on a peaceful street but just 3 or 4 minutes walk away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street. The staff are incredibly polite and attentive. The reception is small but with attentive staff who once the formalities of registration are taken care of show you to your room.  I've rarely stayed at a hotel where registration and check-out was so pleasant, quick and easy - and individual.   We stayed in a classic room (bottom end room) which was very comfortable and tastefully decorated and with some nice touches including some interesting art, books and more unusual magazines including Wallpaper (on interior design) and School House (a scary magazine for pushy parents looking at private schools in the UK). The bed was…"
March 2012,David B,"My wife and I stayed two nights. Everything about the hotel was first class, modern but with plenty of character and very well located for shops and theatres. We had a standard room but it was very comfortable. The staff were attentive and friendly. We had lunch twice in Hix and it was excellent. Our only slight problem was that the only place in the afternoon to get a cup of tea, (rather than the formal afternoon tea) seemed to be the bar, which is fine in the evening but has no windows and is rather dark in the afternoon."
March 2012,Luxury,"A fantastic hotel where nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. An atmospheric, historic hotel with a lively bar."
March 2012,Simply Perfection,"I visited Browns on Friday for Afternoon Tea  as a treat for my birthday, and what a treat it was! I have to say the service, attention to detail and food was beyond what I expected. The property itself is a beautiful building and in a great location, the street is quiet but only a short walk from the hussle and bussle of Piccadilly, Mayfair or Oxford Street.  The warm greeting and atomosphere is followed up with exceptional service. Our waitress was personal and attentive without being intrusive. The beauty and elegance of the room is filled with delightful music from the pianist and sets perfectly the scene for a traditional afternoon tea.   We enjoyed a wide variety of fresh sandwiches which were refilled when we had finished them, along with hot scones, desserts and even a…"
March 2012,Sad to leave this piece of heaven,Stayed for my boyfriends 40th birthday. Everything about this property surpassed our expectations. Such a warm greeting from the doorman and an equally fond au revoir. Relaxed atmosphere class & elegance combined with everything you need for a contemporary feel without losing the tradition.that emanates from this 19th century building    Warm welcome and constant genuine smiles from all the staff . Nice touch of being shown around the property on check in with a brief insight into the history of the building. Magnificent Kipling suite - such high ceilings- where do you find that in a central London hotel  Divine chocolate cake & champagne for our special celebration. Beautifully renovated bathroom with all the trimmings expected in a luxury hotel. Only minor complaint the hot…
November 2011,Best service I have ever experienced,"My wife and I have been regular visitors to the Donovan bar and Hix restaurant over the years - our London favourite - but had never stayed in the hotel until now. We were celebrating my wife's 50th birthday, from start to finish the service and attention to detail from all of the staff was simply outstanding, my wife was overwhelmed. Exceeded our expectations in every respect. Wonderful, we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in London from now on."
March 2012,"Good enough for Lrd Byron, well then its good enough for me - I always say",Located in central london in the heart of the City. This is a uique hotel experience.. My favorite is the Lord Byron room. If you ever need to relax and be pampered for a fortnight or twom then Browns is indeed the place for you. Male sure to have high tea in the lobby. Its a hoot.
November 2011,"Elegant, great service, great location","Right in the heart of great shops and an easy walk to museums, the theatre and wonderful restaurants.  Lovely, comfortable room and the staff is very friendly and accommodating."
March 2012,My fav hotel,"My favourite hotel, it is perfect in everything, from locatiion to decoration, how much I miss to be there... but I am coming back with some of my girlfriends in May, so I am just counting the days for my champagne cocktail at the Donovan!"
March 2012,Outstanding. Simply the best London hotel we have ever stayed at.,"A classically beautiful hotel in the very heart of London. No grand intimidating entrance just a beautiful front door and a smiling doorman to greet you! Impeccable service, attention to detail and warm friendly staff.  We stayed for our 15 yr anniversary - what a treat! We stayed in  the impressive Dover Suite and were greeted by champagne and a gorgeous anniversary cake.  What followed was even more special - see photo - but don't look if u want a surprise!!! Fantastic spa too. Truly our best anniversary hotel stay yet. "
January 2012,Unique charming 5 star property,"I stayed at Brown's for a 2 day conference in March 2012 and was extremely impressed by the attentive but unobtrusive service, professionally run conference facilities and the uniqueness of the property which is 11 Georgian townhouses combined into one hotel. My room was very comfortable with a lot of period features with very tasteful contemporary feel. Would highly recommend Donovan's Bar which great cocktails and some really interesting photographs on the wall. "
January 2012,Brilliant,A luxurious home from home in Mayfair. A really comfortable hotel that feels intimate. Staff are wonderful. The restaurant; HIX by Mark Hix is outstanding. Buzzy bar. Brilliant afternoon teas.
January 2012,'Brilliant' experience,"On an overnight business trip to London and couldn't have made a better choice of where to stay. The room exceeded my expectations and in a nutshell, my entire experience was simply 'Brilliant' and would highly recommend to any 'trip' reader."
January 2012,Absolutely Superb!,"I stayed at Browns on Sunday 8th January. We had a junior suite on the 4th floor and I could not find one fault in the Hotel or service. Even the doormen and concierge were extremely polite and helpful! Our room was spacious with fresh fruit and everything in the mini bar you could possibly need! In the morning as we were catching an early train to Paris we ordered breakfast in our room and again the cooked breakfast was superb along with the service which was prompt. If you are after immaculate service, friendly atmosphere and great quality, you will not be disappointed in Browns!"
January 2012,Donovan Bar - real buzz,"Pre dinner drinks in Donovan Bar - fascinating mix of people. Lively. Cocktail waitresses very attentive, patient and friendly. Lively. Expensive."
December 2011,The Public has priority over hotel guests !,"I trawled through London's new and renovated hotel offerings on the internet and was very tempted by several of them, but having stayed at this hotel previously, I took the easy option and decided to return to it. As previously, I went down to the Tea Room  to have a cup of afternoon tea and read my book.  Unlike previous visits, I was refused and told that I could only go into the dimly lit bar !  The Tea Room was being kept for what appeared to be non hotel guests of principally Asian origin to take full afternoon tea !! Apparently, to be an hotel guest affords one no rights to reasonable use of the facilities ! Next time I trawl the internet offerings, I shall chose more wisely !"
December 2011,"Beautiful hotel, very attentive service","We stayed at Brown's for a 10 day stay over Christmas. Everything was perfect, the hotel is beautiful, nicely renovated and they gave us a big room as we were staying for such a long time. The service was really outstanding, everything was done very quickly. Whenever I called with an extra request, they were at the door 10 minutes later, delivering what we'd asked for. I complained once and they went out of their way to apologize and make things better. My go to hotel in London from now on!"
December 2011,Wonderful family experience,"We stayed at this amazing property right in the elegant Mayfair with all the family. My husband and I and my two boys of 7and 4 years. When we checked in in our wonderful and very spacious suite, Rooms 101 we found the most incredible welcome amenities such us champagne for us and all the most special pastries and toys for the kids. The staff was very friendly and professional and most of them are italian and for us it was perfect. We highly raccomend this property!"
November 2011,Fabulously opulent surroundings at bargain basement prices!,If you are looking for truly superb food in truly superb surroundings - and you are in London - visit Brown's in Mayfair. It's a real special place to take a loved one or to show off to business colleagues - but the great thing is the prices are really really good and the food - world class.You can usually get in at lunchtimewithout a reservation - but best to make one if you can. A great place.
November 2011,Outstanding!,"A fabulous example of how it should be done.  Seamless excellence in all aspects. Beginning with the doorman who opened our taxi's door to the genuinely fond farewell.An amazing start to a celebration week-end.  Brown's has it in spades.  Wonderfully comfy beds and the tv in the bathroom a real wow with our teenage daughter!  The staff were all welcoming, polite and helpful."
September 2011,Just Perfect!,"I recently travelled to London with my newly fiancé to celebrate our engagement. We chose Brown's Hotel as we heard it is one of the oldest hotel in London, because the location is great and because we are affectionate to Rocco Forte hotels. Our stay was just perfect, like a dream.. We informed the hotel that we were there to celebrate our engagement and they did their very best to make our stay memorable, starting from a warm welcome from the GM at check in to a room upgrade, a bottle of champagne in the room awaiting us with some fresh fruit and a lovely card. And it wasn't over.. at our return to the room in the evening we found rose petals and candles around bed, sofa and bathtub, it was so romantic. Next day we decided to make the most of our beautiful room and have…"
October 2011,aftrenoon tea,"very expensive !!the most expensive afternoon tean in town, and not really worth it!!! minimum charge per person and no alcohol charge was £47 !!and when we asked for a doggy bag they said that for health anbd safte reaosns they could not prepeare one,,, dont ever go, try the dorchester, it is much nicer and less epxesnive."
November 2011,"Lovely, modern British Hotel","Brown's Hotel is located in Mayfair and is convenient for most things in central London.  The hotel has been redesigned with care and attention, and brings a charming, modern British feel to a historic property.  Some rooms are small and face the courtyard, but you'll sleep soundly in a quiet room with a comfortable bed and a fine design aesthetic.  Expect service along the lines of most higher end London hotels, i.e. good but not fantastic."
August 2011,Stylish hotel in the heart of Mayfair,"Charming hotel in the heart of Mayfair. It has a lot of charm and the rooms are modern decor and mine had plenty of space. Breakfast menu is a bit difficult to decipher, but I asked for something off the menu and they were happy to oblige. Staff was very friendly and helpful."
November 2011,A farourite,"Staff is courteous and efficient, rooms are very nice, but above all, you know that you are in England. This is not the anonymous chain hotel, same room all around the world. This is what you would wish to find in every capital.  Bit expensive, but worth every penny. Excellent bar."
November 2011,great experience,"I was in Brown's with my wife this summer and I found it very nice. Services are in line with expectations, hotel structure is wery nice and location is wonderful maybe we was not very satisfide by morning breakfast, cause the hotel is used also for working activities and the overall morning atmosphere is not so ideal for relax said that, our room (classic king room) was ok if you not consider that our window looked directly to the front wall. Gym and spa were comfortable, nothing special Rates are pretty high  come scritto sopra buon albergo, ottima posizione grandi servizi ed ottima accoglienza. stnze pulitwe, belle ed ordinate, certo la visuale della nostra finestra sul muro antistante non era il massimo da dimenticarsi la colazione per chè ti innervosisce il brusio…"
November 2011,Oh dear,"I stayed here because my usual hite, Sofitel St Kames was full. I have has lunch at Browns but not stayed there before. Check in OK, staff keen to help but nervous, couldn't find my booking, got it eventually. Upstairs it's a bit of a maze of corridors buy the room was a good size, tasteful neutral decor. £15 for Internet is annoying qhen you are paying £390 a night and have just been told the hotel is not very busy. Room too warm, aircon wouldn't do any good. Bad nights sleep due too hot, bed OK. Had drink pre dinner in lounge adjacent to bar. Waitress had clearly missed the customer service course, quite aggressive and not attentive. Gave me Black Label JW with my whisky and ginger, £15, ridiculous ! Dinner at Hix in hotel poor, expensive, see separate review. I travel to good…"
November 2011,Brilliant,"I really enjoyed my stay there recently, the staff made me very welcome and the room was very well appointed. F&B was really good and value foe money in terms of service."
October 2011,Excellent Hotel With Good Service,"I have stayed at Brown's a number of times and as usual the hotel deliver's on what it is required from a Rocco Forte establishment, unassuming and informed service, excellent decor and high standards, busy but not overbearing, very high quality rooms, excellent bar, fantastic choice and rapid service at breakfast, my favourite hotel in London.  Room tip, see my tip below, tipping is discretionary but can a hefty charge based on spend so is a judgement., however the staff are very good and any tips go to them."
July 2011,Simply Perfect,"Bloody Marvellous  Least like a hotel more like a home. Except better everything.  Terrific bar with excellent martinis, sitting room. dining room food.. etc  It really isn't a hotel.  It is far better.  Simon on concierge is more powerful than super man and can leap any request we gave him.  It is very English, if you like that polite less officious functionary americano hotel feel, think that Like Winny Churchill even at war there is time to have afternoon tea or kippers for breakfast.  This is your hotel.  Hop skip and tube to just about he whole of the UK or a jog around Hyde park to make room for Lunch at Scotts  Cheerio then.."
June 2011,Style and Elegance,"What can I say about Browns hotel, I think elegance and style sum it up. Staff were attentive but not too imposing. They knew enough about us to make us feel comfortable and wanted at the hotel. So many 5 star hotels have the air that you are simply not good enough to cross the front door. Not so at Browns where you are welcomed with a genuine smile and nothing is too much to make your stay a good one. Our room was simply gorgeous, classically styled without a floral bedspread, carpet or curtain insight thank goodness. The bed was divine and so comfortable I didn’t want to get out. My favourite part of a hotel room is always the bathroom, so many hotels over look the real reason we go away is to be pampered. Browns bathrooms are second to none. Full of lovely toiletries you…"
July 2011,Prime location in London,"A great hotel just a few steps away from Bond and Regent Street - ideal for this on a shopping trip. Very friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is well known for it's afternoon tea, though I haven't tried during my past stays. The bar is always bursting after office hours and servers and is specialized in all kind of Martinis. Don't miss it. A word of caution: The rooms, even in the same category, differ greatly, du to the structural nature of the building. If the hotel is not fully booked upon your arrival. let them show you what is available. But I can only recommend this hotel."
June 2011,I can only thank my travel agent,"I tend to do a bit of 'hotel hopping' but after this stay at Brown's I will most certainly make it my home in London.  There was a buz around the hotel, one could feel how busy the place was, Paul the Doorman welcomed me as if I was the only guest he was expecting that day, showed me to the Reception and introduced me to a smily Receptionist who showed me to an immaculatly clean  and large room.  The decor was pleasant and calming unlike the common 'in your face' typical design patterns of most luxury hotels.  The Concierge managed at least two miracles during the 3 days I was around and the restaurant serves the best 'spotted dick' (traditional British desert for those who think I am being naughty) in Mayfair.  Needless to say the location is perfect for anyone on business or…"
May 2011,"Classic hotel, brilliant location","Stayed here on the last night of a trip to London, and loved it. Located on a quiet street just off Piccadilly, the hotel is conveniently located in central London (see picture from Albermarle St).   The room allocated (see pictures) was large and spacious, as was the bathroom. We had a third floor room which looked onto an internal courtyard, but the room was still quite light, and was very quiet. The room had an updated classic feel to it, and had some interesting art (as did the corridor outside). I'd not expected the rooms to be so large. The bathroom was light and airy.   The hotel is well-located for shopping, eating and cultural pursuits. The Royal Academy of Arts is literally less than five minutes' walk, and further afield is the National Gallery and the National…"
May 2011,"JUST AWFUL, not a 5-star hotel, DREADFUL, DISGUSTING place","I stayed at Brown's for a six night period in June of 2011. THIS HOTEL IS A JOKE. IT IS A DISGUSTING, DANK HELL HOLE. It was by far, one of the very, very worst hotel experience that I have had in a very long time. I travel perhaps 3-4 months out of the year for both business and pleasure. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, and this one is really  the very bottom of the barrel. For the $1000 per night I was charged, the owners should be arrested and jailed for fraud and deceptive marketing practices. I would have moved hotels immediately upon checking in, but it was the week of Wimbelton and London was booked solid.  Where to begin, it was all so bad. I arrived late and was directed, not escorted, to my room. It was a dank, ground- floor room that reeked of body odor…"
May 2011,Excellent Location - especially for gallery hopping / Prefer the St. Regis,"Overall:  A well run business / leisure hotel with great location and solid service, but at these prices I'd go with the Lanesborough, St. Regis.  Brown's just feels weird to me - the rooms are nice, however, a bit sterile - as is the staff.  Location:  Excellent location right in the middle of london.  Perfect if you want to visit art galleries, shop, eat or do the usual tourist thing.  Very close to all transportation hubs.  Common Areas/Lounges:  While the rooms are super modern, the common areas are more traditional.  The building's bones are very old - so you weave left/right and up and down throught the hallways - it doesn't have a big foyer like modern hotels - rather a number of lounges / restaurants and common areas.  If it's your first time staying there its a good…"
May 2011,"Hix Restaurant...........very good indeed.... recommended for quality, service and comfort","I dined at Hix Restaurant at Browns Hotel last week with two close friends, really not expecting anything special. All three of us have separately dined at every top restaurant in London over the years.   Browns Hotel offer a choice of bars for pre-dinner drinks…we chose the bar at Hix. Pre-dinner nibbles were perfect (cashews; beetroot crisps; terrific olives….just what I wanted). One needs to rate Hix alongside places such as Wolesley/Scotts and not La Gavroche….it is a comfortable restaurant for everyday eating… and not supposed to be a two Michelin place. As such, the quality of food, service and comfort way surpassed both Scotts and Wolesley however Hix is nowhere near as trendy. Also, one gets the feeling that you can stay as long as you wish at Hix…..they don’t try to…"
May 2011,"Could not be faulted in any way , pure luxury","My husband and I have just returned from an overnight stay in London to attend a business function. We selected Browns for its central location in Mayfair and its renown reputation. We were not disappointed, easy access  from Paddington, fantastic location in the heart of Mayfair yet amazingly quiet for a central London hotel. From the moment we arrived  until we left every member of staff  we encountered welcomed us warmly  all with a smile  and offered every assistance to ensure we had a memorable experience . Our suite accommodation was spotlessly clean with  such attention to detail , huge  super king bed with crisp white linen. Our bedroom had an abundance of extra touches , including a dressing area , a gentlemen's valet stand and freah orchid , The sitting room overlooked…"
April 2011,Fantastic weekend,"Brown's hotel is very well located especially for theatres, museums, galleries etc. The room was very well appointed and the bathroom was wonderful. Everyone made us feel very special as we were there for our anniversary, staff have a genuine warmth..nothing was too much trouble.  Definately worth a visit, we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. A must and certainly very memorable.  Go and enjoy!!"
September 2011,Perfect hideaway in Central London,"The best place to stay in London if you are looking for something central, yet quiet. Just off the Bond street and close to park, so you can have the best of both. Very elegant and understated."
August 2011,WONDERFUL STAY,"The location of the hotel is something special, in the middle of Mayfair, good for shopping and walk. The hotel is traditional, very comfortable, big room and bath, staff very friendly. If you can afford their rates it is a very good option."
August 2011,"A luxorious ,splendid hotel,yet in a calm and tranquil surrounding","I stayed in this hotel actually nine years ago...It has been renovated after that...but yet the style is the same. A luxury hotel in Mayfair,great location,and yet not too big...a stylish boutique kind of hotel. And all so modern,yet lovely English.wonderful five a clock tea and after a nite out,it was just wonderful to sit in rhe lobby in front of the fireplace. The service was excellent as was everything about this hotel.The location is just right,near everything..the theatres, Oxfordstreet..The atmosphere was so amazing,from years gone bye..and yet with all the modern facilities.."
August 2011,Nice but Way Overpriced,"Checked in on 8/17 and was taken to a room smaller than my closet at home and overlooking an interior lightwell.  For over $800 per night, not the kind of accommodations one would expect, but since we were tired from a 12 hour flight from Los Angeles we waited until the next day to complain.  We were shown two different rooms - both very nice, but one which cost an addition $120/night, the other $250/night additional.  We took the lower priced upgrade which was very nice and reasonably spacious - by London standards - and had three windows overlooking the street.  Because I had stayed here many times years ago, before the Forte group took it over, I was disappointed by the excessive charges.  That being said, the included breakfast was very good as was dinner in the restaurant. …"
June 2011,We loved it and we'll be b a ck,"I had the most pleasant stay at Brown's Hotel in Mayfair, London, England recently.  It was the most comfortable sleeping in years with gorgeous soft, fluffy pillows.  It has the dignity and reserve of days gone by.  The staff were were courteous and and friendly.  Brown's is a  small hotel without the noise and bustle of the larger hotels.  So if you are looking for a quiet hideaway yet close enough to other swinging emporiums for an exciting night out., this is the place."
July 2011,Personalized very professional service,"The staff was responsive and handled any issues with grace and poise. The hotel is perfect for its location, great  restaurant and tea room. We had a lovely bedroom, Very comfortable bed. Concierge services were great.  Highly recommend and the area is superb and shopping outstanding. Great experience and would rebook again. Personalized very professional service."
July 2011,50th Anniversary High Tea,"We were in London for our 50th Anniversary.  Our son was with us & suggested ""High Tea"" at Brown's.      We came. We saw. We ate. We enjoyed. They conquered.  It's a ""Once-in -a-Lifetime"" experience that I'd like to repeat!!   And right across the street from Tiffany's!!       ""Tea at Brown's/Tiffany's"".  That sounds like a great movie title.      We arrived about 5:00 p.m. Had reservations & were seated immediately -- at a table by the window. At my request, the pianist played ""Moonglow"" to surprise my wife!  It worked. She almost cried as she said ""Thank You."" Pianist had an excellent repertoire.     From there we went to the theater & saw ""Billy Elliott.""  A great day."
July 2011,They spoiled us,"We stayed at Brown's four nights with our daughter age 10.Large room 40 sq.m in the fifth floor.King size bed for us, extra bed for my daughter. Room made and cleaned twice a day. New quilt cover for our beds every day, my daughter's with childish decorating. Home made cookies by her bedside with her name written upon them.Small things that make a big hotel. Superb location didn't need taxi for our walks to the center. Breakfast from a rich buffet,     excellent  dinner with junior menu, we liked it wasn't so formal, waiters calling you by your name. Everybody friendly and willing to help. As a result they spoiled us."
April 2011,Afternoon tea - what a fantastic experience,"Arrived at Browns Hotel yesterday for afternoon tea to celebrate my daughter's birthday. What a wonderful experience! Staff very attentive, truly impressive tearoom, and the tea itself was beautifully presented. The pianist played ""happy birthday"" tune and a member of staff presented my daughter with a tiny cake, topped with a lit candle! Thank you very much Brown's Hotel, for making this a very special day for myself and daughter."
July 2011,great hotel,"We love this hotel, especially the afternoon tea.  In the tea room the helpful chinese girl with the pretty smile has left  - thats a shame, but the rest of the staff are still great!"
November 2011,Very nice hotel in convenient location,"The Brown's Hotel London is truly a nice experience. The hotel provides very nice rooms, good service, excellent breakfast, a nice bar and famous afternoon tea. We have been very lucky and received a complimentary upgrade to one of the larger accommodations. The design of the hotel is nice mixture of modernity, coziness and elegance. We have booked afternoon tea on one of the days of our stay. Surprising and disappointing: their herbal infusion was not available on that day, even though we had pre-booked the Tea Tox. Also the service during afternoon tea could have been a little bit more friendly-warm as it was a bit too professional, blasé. Overall still a nice experience."
October 2011,Simply the Best Hotel in London,I sent a loong weekend in London and Just could not get the level of service this hotel has to offer. The Front Office Staff are amazing and could not do enough for us from the moment we arrived.  The Beds are so comfortable I had the best nights sleep in a hotel ever.   If you go there have Afternoon Tea the whole experience is just out of this world.  And the Location is perfect
October 2011,gluten free tea to die for!,"A friend and I took our daughters to Browns Hotel yesterday for afternoon tea as a treat for doing so well in their exams and they had an amazing time, fabulous sandwiches, divine scones with cream and jam and beautiful, delicious cakes with the customary excellent Browns service AND a wonderful pianist to boot!  The place was buzzing and everyone else seemed to be having as good a time as we were.  The icing on the cake for me was the absolutely scrumtious GLUTEN FREE tea - I had been dreaming of egg sandwiches but cannot eat wheat so it was such a treat to have a plate full of all my favourite sandwiches from salmon to beef (and of course the yummy egg ones!) with light as air gluten free bread followed by  scones and finished off with a death by chocolate cake!  EXCELLENT!!"
October 2011,Great hotel and great location,"When in London we love to stay at the Brown's Hotel. It is the perfect location for shopping, just off Bond Street. After shopping you can enjoy a delicious afternoon tea. Service is very good and attentive, breakfast is also excellent. Room, even if not particularly big, are nice and very quiete."
October 2011,Elegance and Style!,"What can I say about Browns hotel, I think elegance and style sum it up. Staff were attentive but not too imposing.

August 2011,Oh so comfortable and wonderful staff,"Browns Hotel in London was a superb choice.Great location, best night's sleep and attentive,charming staff."
September 2011,Our opinion about the Brown's Hotel,"My wife and I , over the past few years , are constant clients in the hotel Rocco forte in Berlin , and the wonderful staying in this hotel has served as basis to stay in the Brown’s Hotel in London .We are very pleased by the atmosphere of the hotel and by the work of the staff . We would like to highlight the work of the manager Vincent Rais (?) , which professionally and kindly resolves all the problems that would arise in front of the clients . We would also like to highlight the great work of the administrators on the breakfast and on the afternoon tea . The quality of the breakfast and the large choice of food is consistent with the high level of the hotel . The afternoon tea is one of the best in London .  The quality of the cleaning is good . Special thanks to the staff…"
September 2011,Not Rocco Forte at its best...,"Yes, as many say, location is very central - but so it is for most LHW hotels in London (the Ritz and the Dukes are just a stone's throw away...). For everything else I was slightly disappointed. This is a 'good' hotel, but it is not up to the Rocco Forte (RF) standards. Having tried the Hotel De Rome in Berlin, the Hotel De Russie in Rome, the Savoy in Florence, and others of the same chain, I would have expected the Brown's to be of comparable standard - or even better, being it located on RF's own turf... This is not the case: service is rather rude, rooms are noisy (I was in room 111 and could hear what was happening next-door), the bed is not too comfortable, etc. Just take breakfast: it is OK, but cannot be compared with the incredible buffets offered by most of the other…"
September 2011,Surpassed all expectations,"Wonderful recommendation from my travel advisor hidden gem in the midst of action, still very quiet and refined Upon arrival we had an upgraded room head of client relations personally  came out to greet us at the reception. since we arrived early room was not ready we asked about nearby places to have coffee and we were sent to their own wonderful lobby/ lounge room where we were enjoying our complimentary coffees until the room was ready. wonderful staff very accommodating and friendly we happened to be in London while Hurricane hit our home land in Us everyone was very understanding and willing to extend our stay, if necessary. Thankfully it did not happen Breakfast is great service impeccable, you feel like royalty the way you are treated in Brown's will come back!!!"
December 2010,"Location, location, location","As central London's streets all seem to be torn up for the 2012 Olympics, Brown's is a great location in the center of everything where you can walk and avoid the jams. No need to walk from the hotel restaurant, the Albemarle, which rivals Le Caprice and Ivy for great food and a lively clientel.  Italian in spirit but with all the wood  and fireplaces in the lounges and chic gray bar, Brown's is one of the world's best hotels."
April 2011,Understated hotel in a good location,"I stayed here at the beginning of September for my Birthday weekend and chose Brown's because I wanted a hotel in a good location and somewhere to retreat after a day of walking / shopping etc. The hotel cant be beaten on location, on a reasonably quiet road in Mayfair the shops are just a hop skip and a jump away and the area has lots of very good restaurants. We had a trip booked around Buckingham Palace on the Sunday morning and it was great to just walk there through Green Park. From arriving at the hotel we were warmly greeted by a very friendly gentleman and the bags were taken care of without delay, after being escorted to reception we were greted by warm and welcoming staff who sorted out check in for us promptly and advised us that because it was my birthday we had…"
March 2011,"Classic, gentleman's tea","This review is regarding the  English Tea Room at Brown's Hotel.  The ambiance, wood, fabric, lighting and clientele all British made for a unique Tea.  We had a lovely experience having Afternoon Tea there.  DH chose the traditional tea and I chose the healthy tea.  Both had good items.  The Healthy tea had fresh cooked salmon vs. the traditional smoked. The dessert were very good and kept coming to our table.  All sorts of delicious goodies, slices of cake, sorbet's.  DH thought the table crowded but I didn't mind."
March 2011,Everything I'd hoped for and more!,"Myself and my husband stayed here in early December so the hotel was decorated for Christmas. It was heavenly to walk through the door and be greeted by the delicious scent of pine. The decorations were so tastefully done and served only to enhance the already beautiful hotel. We both felt instantly at home which is rare. My husband is a permanent wheelchair user and although there was a small step at the entrance the concierge were quick to deploy the ramp with minimum fuss. This was the same throughout our stay, my husband was never left waiting. Our room had an adapted bathroom with a roll in shower and also one with a bath and walk in shower. A bathroom each...great!!  The bed was extremely comfortable and we awoke thoroughly refreshed. The location of Brown's is excellent.…"
March 2011,excellent,"i really enjoyed staying in this hotel.. perfect location, everything is near by either shop or best restaurants.. the conceirge were very helpful..  i wish to stay again in the hotel.."
March 2011,Very good service,"I love this hotel. It is the third time I come, and everytime I like it more. Staff is super friendly, location unbeatable, and the rooms are classic and modern at the same time. Also, rooms are big for a city like london!! I highly recommend this hotel!"
February 2011,"Great staff,fabolous location","I would like to take this opportunity to express our thanks and appreciation  to the entire staff of Brown’s hotel for the courtesy and professionalism  exhibited during our stay this month. Front desk staff  and housekeeping staff in particular were a joy to deal with. We  couldn't be more pleased.  In particular, the dealings my wife and I had with Manuela at the front desk  were friendly and very professional. I wish I had someone like Manuela  working for me. She is a true asset to this hotel. She is a large part of  why we enjoyed your hotel so much. She simply brightened our days. In short,  she is a fine, lovely, professional young lady.  .We would love to stay at Brown’s again some day."
February 2011,"""For me this is the Hotel all others need to be,it's simply perfect""","I use Browns lounge a lot for meetings, but have never stayed here before. I stayed on sunday the 13th (room 311). Browns is just off Piccadilly and not far from Park Lane, so in the middle of the West End hotel district. But it's a stand alone and stand out property. It's not flash, brash or full of Tourists. It's understated but a real connoisseurs dream. Check in was fast and easy, the excellent door men had my bags in my room before I go there, the check in staff insisted on showing me my room and how everything worked. The room was beautifully clean and well decorated, it was not large, but ample size.   They left a fresh fruit platter and some ice in the room and undertook an evening turn down. The Bathroom was a good size and well laid out, the REN products they use are a…"
February 2011,Beautiful Hotel that went the extra mile to make out stay extra special,"We arrived at Browns Hotel as a last minute booking due to our booked hotel proving very disappointing.  As my husband and I were on our honeymoon we were looking for a hotel that was extra special.  My husband explained our ordeal to the night receptionist who tried his upmost to rectify our disappointing evening at the previous hotel.  After congratulating us on our marriage (something missing from the previous hotel) we were given a free upgrade to a suite (upon arrival were given a tour of those available in order to make our selection).  Whilst the room was being turned down and our luggage delivered, we were given complimentary champagne in the hotel bar. One the second night the suite had been prepared with candles and rose petals, which made our stay feel special. I…"
January 2011,Oppulence,"I was fortunate enough to stay at Browns Hotel with my Partner.  As it was my Birthday we were upgraded to an Executive room (we'd bookeda classic).  Not sure what the difference is between the rooms,but the room we got was lovely. A very large bathroom with shower and bathroom, great REN cosmetics (nice touch), beautiful larecomfy bed, which wasdecorated with rose petals in the evening, there were also night lights around the room.  Service was 5*** .  Went Donovans bar - and had a cocktail @ £14.00 - it was delicious though, my partner had a Japanese whiskey @ £18.00.  We then went for dinner and I had the best Lemon Sole Dinner I have EVER tasted - it was so tasty.  We had a starter each and deinner and 2 bottles of wine - the bill (inc the cocktails) was £182 - so yes itwas…"
September 2010,Great hotel however freezing room disappointed,"I would certainly recommend a stay at Brown's however I we were unfortunate to be given a room where the heating did not work and therefore found ourselves having to phone reception for a plug-in heater after asking them to check the heating previously. We were offered a room change however at 12pm midnight this was the last thing we wanted to do.  All in all the hotel was good, bed was very comfortable and staff were very helpful. We had the English tea and whilst the quality of the food and service was very good there was something lacking."
August 2010,Fabulous Luxury and attentive service,"Browns Hotel is beautifully decorated, luxurious without being stuffy.  Our room was very well planned and immaculate.  All the staff are really helpful without being obsequious and the food at Hix Restaurant was all delicious.  Browns is by far the best London hotel we have stayed in and I couldn't recommend it more."
July 2010,"Luxury and superb service, great location for shops and culture","We stayed for 4 nights as a special treat for my wife's birthday. We couldn't fault anything. The service levels are superb, the room was large (we had an executive king) as was the bathroom which was very spacious and had a large bath and walk-in shower. The breakfasts were the best we have ever had in the UK - superb choice, size and freshness (top marks for the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs!). We also had a very enjoyable meal one evening in Hix at the Albermarle. We didn't use the gym or spa facilities so can't comment on those, and didn't have room for afternoon tea! On top of this, the hotel is extremely well located in a side street off Piccadilly that runs parallel to Bond Street. The setting is much quieter than the Ritz which is a few hundred yards away but Brown's…"
June 2010,Browns is now perhaps the best hotel in the world.,"The George V may have better flowers and the Shanghai Peninsula a better building, but Browns is I think the best hotel in the world because it combines a perfect location for walking and shopping, a consistent professional staff. luxurious accomodations with huge bathrooms, super comfortable beds and air conditioning that works, a smart bar, great club like restaurant (better than Marks or George) and of course that famous tea room with an elegant clientel of glamorous Latins and a sprinkling of well heeled Americans."
July 2010,Splendid afternoon tea. Best afternoon tea in London.,"We did not stay at this hotel.  My boyfriend and I made a booking for afternoon tea. There is a grand piano quietly playing in the background of what they claim is the oldest hotel in London. Superb service and delicious sandwiches (egg, beef, salmon and cucumber, tomato and cheese, and another meat that I don't remember because I'm vegetarian and my boyfriend ate all three of the meat sandwiches). They were all good. The scones and petit fours were good and after all of that, they serve you a slice of cake. Make sure to skip lunch -- it's a lot of food and they keep replacing what you eat.  The teas all looked good and my boyfriend and I were both happy with our choices.  This is an expensive afternoon tea, but it's worth it. It was a lovely afternoon, and even though they said…"
July 2010,The quintessential afternoon tea...,"After visiting Brown's Hotel I felt compelled to share my experience so others can enjoy.The afternoon tea was fantastic and serves up to its prestige among the top in London. I chose the traditional afternoon tea with a selection of finely cut sandwiches and sweets. With a price tag that suits its location, every penny is worth it as you can select up to 17 different varieties of teas and enjoy a selection of sandwiches, all of which are replenished at no extra charge so you wont be leaving hungry. The service was just as good as the tea, discreet but attentive. An overall excellent experience and one not to be missed with friends, family or colleges."
July 2010,Perfection on a Plate,"My Canadian cousin and I decided to treat ourselves to Afternoon tea at Browns during a day's hard shopping. I have been before and knew she would like it. From the moment we arrived, we couldn't fault a thing. The service was impeccable.  Our tea and cakes arrived swiflty and were delicious, so much so that we didn't leave enough room for the cake trolley which came round a little later!  We loved the wide selection of teas and had a delightful chat with the tea 'sommelier'.  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive without being intrusive, and skilfully anticipated our needs, asking us if we wished more tea or sandwiches (which of course we did!).  We each tried a different tea the second time round, having spoken to the tea sommelier for ideas.  We were struck by the way in…"
July 2010,delightful delicious and dreamy,"what a afternoon to be had! the taste of warm buttery scones and the automatic indulgent teas were a absolute treat!the tea room was the perfect setting and all staff were helpful, friendly and accomindating.    a wonderful experience that will be repeated shortly!"
July 2010,The best place to celebrate a birthday,"I have recently stayed at browns to celebrate a friend’s 30th birthday, and staying at Browns really was the best way we could have celebrated. First of all the location is perfect, right next to all the best shops, restaurants, clubs and bars and the concierge were great in suggesting and organising fun venues for us to visit. From the moment we walked through the door, nothing was too much trouble. The staff were extremely welcoming and looked after us very well through out the course of our stay. Afternoon tea was a real treat, and for those not wanting to indulge too much they offer a ‘healthier’ option for tea, still every bit as delicious! The rooms were so comfortable, and not being a particularly good sleeper myself, I had one of the best night sleeps I have ever had! I…"
June 2010,Afternoon tea is a real treat         Buzzybee of Beaconsfield,"An oasis in the centre of London. The afternoon tea was a fabulously indulgent treat. The service was attentive, but discreet. The scones were light and delicious. We hadn't booked, and all the tables seemed to be reserved or occupied, but the staff were helpful and accommodating, and a table was found for the three of us. The relaxed and comfortable atmosphere added to the treat of a wonderful tea. Definitely worth another visit - will book ahead next time."
January 2011,Best afternoon tea,Went for afternoon tea and plumped for the champagne tea. I know It may look expensive on the out set but in this tight aberdonians opinion it was worth every penny and a must for anyone visiting london for a short while. atmosphere staff food tea all first class as you would expect.. well worth making a booking to avoid dissapointment..
January 2011,Friendly and extremely comfortable  stay,"We encountered  very good service nothing was too much trouble, the concierge was extremely efficient and quick. The room was spacious and comfortable no complaints at all. The location is just great very central for theatres, restaurants, places of interest to visit and of course the fabulous shopping!! You can certainly spend, spend, spend. We loved the Donovan Bar especially the older teenagers, the nights we spent there it had a real buzz. We also thoroughly enjoyed afternoon tea a must when in London and especially after a hard days shopping! We did book as it does get rather busy."
November 2010,The Best Hotel in London without a doubt,"When you walk into Browns, you are walking into your home from home!  From the moment you drive in, the door is opened with a smile and a welcome. Shortly after you are taken to reception without lifting a finger and again welcomed by a polite receptionists, were everything was taken care of.  The receptionist then took me to my room again with confidence and a smile; it made me feel right at home. When I entered the room my bags were already there, I didn't want to leave it I loved it!"
November 2010,"Incredibly comfortable luxurious treat, perfect location","As Always the service was second to none, the beds are without a doubt the most comfortable we have ever slept on and everyone from the doorman in provided their usual friendly impeccable service"
November 2010,Fantastic experience,"We fancied being away for New Year and picked Browns.  We've been in for drinks to the Donovan Bar many times, but never stayed for dinner or an overnight.  So we decided to treat ourselves and what a treat it was!  The service, rooms, dinner and overall experience was fab. The hotel isn't too big and this brings a really relaxed and friendly approach from everyone you meet.  No one can do more for you, whether it's the concierge arranging a rather last minute hair appointment to the barman looking after your champagne while you headed off for a dance it was a wonderful experience. Our bedroom was super.  It was modern, contemporary, with all the gadgets and a fab shower and bathroom. We would definitely recommend it to anyone who fancies a treat while in London at somewhere…"
November 2010,A wonderful hotel combining five star luxuries with quintessential British charm.,"Brown's Hotel is an absolute gem. The staff are wonderfully responsive and approachable (no request too big or too small), the vibe is luxurious yet maintaining comfort (very difficult balance to strike) and the location is tremendous. As a frequent business traveler, it is rare to find a hotel that exceeds my expectations and a place I would recommend to friends, family and colleagues alike."
October 2010,Quintessential Afternoon Tea,"Plan the whole afternoon and soak up the atmosphere, the lovely service, music and excellent food.  We went for my mother's 80th birthday  and were very well looked after."
September 2010,Great stay with just one minor grumble,"We booked one of their Romantic Break packages which was expensive (£395 plus VAT per night B&B) but we wanted to push the boat out for out anniversary. We couldn't fault the room, breakfast, housekeeping, etc. Also, we ate in their Hix At The Albermarle restaurant one night and had afternoon tea the following day and both were excellent. The only slight disappointment was the doormen who were falling over each other to assist people who were obviously extremely wealthy while we were left to fend for ourselves. This was a special treat for us but we felt as though our money was not as good as other peoples'. But it's only a minor grumble and apart from that, we had a great stay."
October 2010,Amazing hotel!,"I have just returned from spending a weekend at browns- I would most definitely return. The breakfast was included in the rate and you had the opportunity to dine in your room, which was much appreciated. We received a room upgrade and the room, especially the bathroom, was perfect- not too fussy, very modern and clean. The beds were incredibly comfortable and I loved the big shower head. We dined in the restaurant on the Saturday evening. It wasn't particularly busy, and although the service was excellent, the range of food was just satisfactory. My only complaint would be that the entrance was not always manned and so there was not always a doormen available to help with shopping/hold the doors open! We also visited the spa and the treatments were ok, but did not completely…"
July 2010,An experience to savour,"We arrived late, having spent the day with our family and were instantly made to feel at ease and shown to our room which was sumptuous, spacious and splendidly welcoming.  After an amazingly comfortable night's sleep, the next few leisurely  hours were spent in luxurious pampering and sprucing in the well equipped bathroom which felt like a private spa experience. Every possible potion and lotion to suit every need was to hand -  truly spoiling.  A delicious breakfast followed with attentive and helpful staff at hand without being over fussy striking the right balance between casual atmosphere and professional service.  The food was of a high standard and what one would expect of a top class hotel. Perfectly located, Brown's is surely one of the best places to stay in London…"
December 2009,Superb and truly Extraordinary,"I have traveled the world and stayed in thousands of hotels.  Browns is in the top one or two or three in terms of service, quality and value.  For many reasons, it is, in fact, my number one favorite! You should know that the spirits of Miss Marple (Agatha Christie), Rudyard Kipling and Alexander Graham Belll roam the place at night....."
December 2009,Poor Service and very worrying finds,"I found bloodstains on my pillow that were not mine! My guests found their underwear had been removed from a heated towel radiator and had a unremovable yellow stain on them! The concierge service was pathetic, I asked on 2 occassions for my car to be brought to the hotel and gave what i thought was polite and helpful advance notice to concierge only to find that when i got to concierge I had to ask again and wait a further 10 minutes?! I asked for a bag i dropped off at concierge to be delivered to my room, an hour later the bag was still there so I took it myself. My friend had a delivery from a local shop for a expensive jumper, this was not delivered to the room, it was kept and only delivered on our last day as I remebered that this item was missing, it makes me very…"
December 2009,Tea at Brown's is fabulous!!,"This was my third time for tea here and it did not disappoint. I brought a British friend and she was impressed and delighted. DO NOTeat beforehand and plan a long walk afterwrds to work off your sugar high. Expensive but worth every penny. wonderful, friendly service. we tried to book online in the morning and could not. Decided to wing it and drop in with positive results. they saiad the online booking system was not working!!  So don't give up!!!!!!!!!!!!  One of the best experiences in London without a doubt."
October 2009,superb on all levels,"fabulously comfortable beds, best bed linen ever, room spacious, chic and very well appointed (as was bathroom).  Service in the hotel is second to none, friendly and very efficient.  Delicious dinner in the restaurant and excellent cooked breakfast the following morning.  Definitely a huge treat to stay there."
November 2009,Excellent but expensive,"Brown's is well located 2 minutes off Piccadilly and well positioned for most of the West End. The room we had was excellent having upgraded to a Deluxe although it is possible to hear movements in the corridor and the room above. Staff were welcoming and generally efficient throughout except for the breakfast service which was average. So, a very comfortable place to experience London but I still cannot shrug off the feeling that the hotel is overpriced. Afternoon Tea at £37 per person is on the high side as is £12 for a single malt whisky and if you only want some fruit and a croissant for breakfast then £20 feels a bit steep. That said, we will be going back."
October 2009,Incredibly Impressed,"This was my first trip to Brown's. And I thought this hotel was just wonderful. I arrived early, a few hours before the alloted check-in time, and not only was my room ready but I was also given a free upgrade. The room itself was beautiful - and the bathroom was large, light and airy - everything you could want. The service I received from the check-in and Concierge staff was efficient and friendly. I really felt welcomed and valued. I would definitely return to Brown's."
November 2009,Perfect for 'second wedding' night with our boys staying too,"Browns is a perfect balance of luxury and style in a beautiful hotel and at the same time a very relaxing place to stay. We stayed for our wedding night, after a second wedding for both of us, so wanted to incude our teenage sons, so we had dinner in the Donovan bar which was really special and suited everyone. We could have happi;y stayed all weekend had we not had to deliver 2 boys to a school rugby match. A total haven in the middle of London and would highly recommend it in every way."
November 2009,Great hotel let down by poor service,"This a great hotel in the heart of Mayfair, well refurbished (if not to everyone's taste!). However, the hotel is let down by the really poor standard of service. Badly trained juniors abound. This carries through to the restaurant where good (though expensive) food is let down by the chaotic service that turned meals into a nervous disaster. Eat out."
February 2007,"Comfortable, homely and friendly","On first entering Browns Hotel you are greeted by a friendly helpful doorman. Your bags are then whisked away and you just walk through to the bar. Jazz music and comfortable seats then greet you as a waitor takes your order. The Browns club sandwich is the best sandwich I have ever tasted. The rooms are very homely and the beds very comfortable. The shower is like a waterfall lined with marble.    On leaving Browns, a taxi is called for you by the doorman and you are taken away in style.  So any downsides with browns? One-the heating in the rooms is up too high and it is very hard to turn it to an ideal temperature and the food is a little pricey. Other than that, Browns is a luxury."
September 2009,English posh with a modern edge...great!,"This was my first stay at Browns and it was excellent.  I checked in early from a US flight, they had been notified and had a room ready in 30 minutes.  Staff was very accommodating and could not have been friendlier.  Very international group works there and many languages were being spoken all around.  Concierges worked miracles with travel reservations as well as restaurants and shows. They never said no.   Location of this hotel was excellent and walking distance to Picadilly, Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street.  Starbucks was close by as were sandwich shops Pret a Mange and EAT in case you did not want to have the $$ breakfast.  Breakfast was in excess of 30 pounds so I grabbed food at the sandwich shops right next door.  Could not have asked for a better…"
November 2007,"Tasteful, with character","It's rare for me to go somewhere relatively expensive and find it to be a bargain. Our room wasn't just designed, it had character and felt homely. It was full of thoughtful touches and came with a fantastic bed. The bathroom was bigger than some hotel rooms I've stayed at. Staff were charming and made that extra effort. Great breakfast as well - it set me up for the day. I'm trying really hard to think of a negative (I only trust tripadvisor reviews with some criticism) and I think it was possible the toast was overbrowned.....But if I'd have frowned at the toast they'd have whisked it away and replaced it."
December 2007,Classy hotel in the middle of Mayfair,"Stayed here for 4 nights. We arrived late due to a delayed flight. Staff were on hand to quickly check us in so we could get some sleep. Breakfast the next morning was excellent. I noticed that the waiters seemed nervous, and almost too eager.  Rooms are very tastefully decorated. The water pressure in the bathroom was surprisingly low, but I think that this is a general problem in central London. Did not get to try high tea, something this hotel is famous for. One normally has to book. The concierge was very helpful in managing to find tickets for sell-out musical. Bar is stylish, and the bartender knows how to mix a mean caiprinha. All in all a great hotel"
November 2007,Best Afternoon tea in London.,"I have enjoyed Afternoon tea here about 10 times – it is with out compartment my favourite afternoon tea place in London.  Delicious, well prepared, good location, and most important of all…. Excellent service!  They only charge ½ price for children.  Worth every penny, and I will look forward to my next afternoon tea here."
November 2007,"Not a 1 star, Not a 5 star, somewhere in between","I recently stayed at Browns for business - it is a preferred provider for my company.  After coming in very late on a Sunday, I was unable to utilize the dry cleaning service to press my shirts. I asked for an iron. Low and behold I use the iron on my white shirt and rust marks appear on it. Now I don't want to sound like a cocky foreigner, but shouldn't a 5 star hotel have top of the line irons - e.g. Stainless Steel Rowentas? If you're wondering if I don't know how to iron or not, I assure you being raised by my mother, I do. If you're also wondering if this iron was special circumstance, it wasn't, I asked for another one and had an even WORSE problem.  But wait, the story gets better. So the next day I submit my custom shirt for dry cleaning (and go to my meeting in a…"
November 2007,Brown Sugar Fantastic,"Our stay was a delight from the moment we arrived with the smell of christmas from candles and the subtle smells of lunchtime food. The attentiveness was measured but not overdone and the balance of old and new in the architecture and ambience made the atmosphere. We have stayed in many hotels around the world but we both said how we enjoyed the brief stay. Great rooms, great comfortable beds ,a massage that my wife (who is an expert) thoght was great) excellent service and good value -we have already booked again!!"
October 2007,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Having stayed at the Ritz in the summer, it was an amazing contrast to see how the Fortes have revamped 'the oldest hotel in London.'  From the moment of arrival, the courtesy and service was of a level never experienced at the Ritz or any other 5 star plus hotel.  The Staff were amazing: remembering your name, genuine and eager to please - no stuffy, unsmiling personnel here. The ethos of Browns, must be  - The Guest is King - as that it is the way we were treated!  The beds were fantastic with the most wonderful pillows ever.  The decor designed by Olga Polizzi, is contemporary but classy.  Books and magazines are arranged as if you were in your own home, with an almost constant supply of water, both still and sparkling, generously provided.  A fresh bowl of fruit was…"
September 2007,Great Hotel,This is great boutique hotel. Great check in and concierge service. The rates are usually high but you should look for specials rocco forte is having. I never had high tea here but had drinks at the bar and they were great. really great location. Rooms were spacious and well appointed. Check this hotel out you will not be disappointed.
September 2007,Great,"Even not as trendy as a Hempel or a Blake's, the Brown's is a nearly perfect place to stay in London. The staff is very helpful and friendly, the rooms are decorated with taste and sophistication. The location is great is if you like to stay near Picadilly and Bond St. Good breakfast too. I will return with pleasure. Of course, it's not cheap. But where do you think you are? Still It worthes every penny."
July 2007,Slightly disappointed by Brown's,"I stayed at Brown's early Oct, and was slightly disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much. However, given the 5 stars and price, I think I was entitled to expect something good!  Check-In: There was no record of my reservation when i arrived, even though my company travel agent assured me it was booked. There was a definite sense from the check-in staff that it was most definitely my mistake and not theirs (and tough luck there were no more rooms anyway). In the end, the managed to find the reservation and gave me a room.   Room: The room was good - nice comfy bed, sofas and table, good size bathroom and walk in wardrobe. It was a slightly strange L shape, but was good and nicely furnished  Noise: My room was above the bar and there was loud music going on all evening (a…"
June 2007,Better than expected,After some of the reviews here i was a little apprehensive about my hotel choice but overall it was a good experience. The check in was quick and professional- our room was ready early as requested which was quite a plus-  the rooms were nice and large with nice bathrooms- no complaints about the room decor- though one of our rooms faced a back alley with the air conditioner units below- was quiet but for the price not quite the view i expected- the staff were very helpful offering to help pack and unpack and take our shopping bags up for us-  fresh bottles of water every night bedside-  bar was busy every night - nice breakfast buffet (not included)-   great location near tube and short walk to buckingham palace and  shopping right outside the door. Only complaint  no wi-fi and…
May 2010,"Good, but not quite 5 star","Stayed here last week and while the stay was enjoyable, there were little touches that just didn't feel right.  1 -  We had a bottle of wine in our room on arrival and drank it before going out to a concert that night. When we came back, despite Housekeeping having been in the room and tidied, the empty bottle, glasses and tray remained until Morning  2 - Bathrooms - Firstly, the toilets don't flush properly. They do the job, but only after flushing twice, which is annoying. Also, the bath seemed to be shaped perfectly to make you slide down and drown, which, coupled with the lack of properly hot water, meant that when I wanted to relax with a soak, I just couldn't.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fine hotel, with a perfect location, but if you're expecting a true five star…"
September 2009,Great in many ways,"My wife and I stayed at Brown's in late July and found the young staff very helpful.  The location is excellent (the Green Park tube is very near).  We had a very nice room that was off the street and found it to be very quite.  My wife enjoyed the spa and I used the excerise room.  The restaurant was being refurbished while we were there, so we did not eat at the hotel, but found several small/ resonable eating establishments nearby.  The only problem at this time is the pound to dollar relationship set our room rate at around $650.00 a night- ugh. "
May 2010,Very dissappointing,"Although the location is great and the hotel exterior is very charming and the interior is modern, the staff are friendly, yet completely inept. It seems that the whole place is run entirely by entry level staff who are not well trained or supervised. For example, the conceriege does not know where basic sites are/ or how to get there (it seems much of the staff are new to the UK). They don't even know to anticipate how to get taxi cabs on busy days. The restaurant staff bring cold food to your table. Bell boys are very obviously only looking for tips rather than focusing on service. Where is top management?  Also, the rooms are very small. We got an upgrade and it was still extremely tiny. For the price, it's a sham. "
May 2010,Not Impressed,"This is meant to be one of london's finest hotel and when it comes to afternoon tea it truly is. However the room we stayed in had a ridge down the center of the bed, as it was two twins patched together, not a real king. The lounge chair had a rather large stain on it, which initially didn't bother me. One of the light switch's had cracked faceplate. There was no outlet for the hair dryer anywhere near the mirror. Antiquated in room entertainment system, not a concern for me but some people might be bothered by this. The finish in the bathroom was just not at the level one would expect of a hotel with rooms starting at nearly $700 dollars a night. Further to this I did fill in the customer survey upon leaving with all these issues listed out and didn't hear back. I'll stick to…"
May 2010,Elegant and very well located.,"You may say that this is a luxury hotel. Yes, you are right and it is not cheap. So ? If you decided to stay at the Brown's you won't be disappointed.  The welcome already at the front door clearly sets the picture. You are a a guest of the Brown's and treated as such. After a quick check-in, my wife and I went straight to our room. And what a room ! Excellent choice in terms of furniture and decoration. The bathroom ? (yes we are quite demanding for this space even if you only spend a minimum time in it). One of the best bathrooms with the one of a resort in Grenada (Spice Island Beach Resort - see review). Large and with daylight (not always the case). In the shower you could shower in one go your quintiplets easely just to say that it is roomy. Again, it was a well provided…"
March 2010,World Class operation,"We stayed on the 9th May for our Wedding Anniversary. The suite was fabulous, service throughout was outstanding. Attention to detail was exemplary. We didn't have dinner,  but having experienced an excellent breakfast, next time we will."
February 2010,Mediocre afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea at Brown's and found it to be a mediocre experience.   The room where the tea was served was small and cramped. It also felt well travelled, as if it were a rat run for large numbers of staff.  The strawberry jam was good as were some of the sandwiches. However, the rest of the food was average. The victoria sponge cake was dense and tasteless, The sweets were unpleasant and tasted like they had been sitting around a while.   There was live piano music but the piano was too large for the room. I couldn't hear the conversation at the table very well when the piano was being played.  Not worth the £40+ per head. You'd get better results if you went home, made a Victoria sponge cake yourself, and brewed some tea you bought from the grocery store."
January 2010,Bad experience,Stay at Browns was disappointing.  jewelry in an inner pocket of a handbag and was stolen out of my room and the cleaning staff helped themselves to chocolates I had bought the previous night. Service is stuffy and in some cases downright rude.  There is only one small downstairs lounge you can use as a hotel client.  The staff have the audacity to kick you out of the lounge as they book tea for outside clients in the afternoon and you are forced into a dingy bar in the back of the hotel.  Service is strange and in my experience dodgy.  Got woken up in the middle of the night by a staff member claiming to wan to do a turn down service. Rooms are very small and decor is basic. Hotel management was mildly apologetic but basically said there is nothing they can do about the thefts…
January 2010,"Location, Location, Location with an iconic hotel run by the Maestro Rocca","Located on one of London's swankiest streets right at the heart of Mayfair, this iconic hotel welcomes you like family from the moment you step from your car. A celebrity doorman, a smiling receptionist and in 10 minutes we were totally relaxed in one of their opulent oversized rooms overlooking Dover Street and sipping on delicious afternoon tea (A Browns must have !) The hushed grays and browns of the decor recently done by Rocco's sister fit seamlessly with the original art and furniture pieces. The bed is just huge and as comfortable as anyone could wish for. The 'Pillow Menu' promises whatever type of pillow you desire. The bathroom in cream marble is a sight to behold. After freshening up we wandered down to the infamous Donovan's bar for a couple of their signature…"
January 2010,Old Style Elegance,"Brown's is a beautiful old-London style hotel. The Mayfair location can't be beaten, the rooms are luxurious though vary widely in size (all have the same amenities) and the staff are extremely attentive. Most rooms have sofas/sitting areas, spa-style bathrooms and great finishing touches. It's an expensive hotel but worth it's cost and a great location for a business traveller. Tea or drinks in the bar is a definite must if time permits."
February 2009,"Very Nice Experience, not great for business travelers","We spent three nights at Brown's during a business trip and found it to be a great experience.  Having had tea at Brown's many times in the past and loved it, we enjoyed experiencing other dimensions of the hotel's services.    As with many hotels, the doorman is great and quickly begins to recognize guests.  The front desk is located outside of view from the front (very little in the way of a public lobby which isn't a bad thing in our opinion) though the concierge is right at the front door and was also very helpful in securing reservations, Van Gogh tickets, etc...  Our room was on a high floor but very small...rooms at Brown's have always had that reputation and when traveling for business it's nice to have space to spread things out.  Further, they do not have WiFi so if…"
December 2008,Good Hotel,"Stayed here with my husband for the weekend to do some shopping (we expected good things of this hotel because we stay at the Tresanton, which is another hotel within the group.  Didn't   do much shopping because we ended up spending most of our time in the bar drinking  champagne!!!  This is a lovely hotel, very buzzy and very friendly with charming and very competent staff.  Only down side was that the room we were given (£300 per night) was too hot and we could not open the window because the smell of the food in the kitchen was overwhelming.  Other than that, a well earned pat on the back  Olga - another triumph."
December 2008,understated elegance,Arrived at 8.30pm after checking out of another hotel that was awful! The staff are very pleasant and accommodating. Food lovely and lots of variety. Rooms spacious and modern  with big bathrooms and lots of areas for clothes and work areas. Stayed with my 12 year old daughter who loved the ambience of the hotel. I would wholly recommend this hotel for a convenient location and classy english atmosphere.
November 2008,"Luxurious experience, will be back soon","Browns has an ideal location tucked away in Mayfair. The staff are efficient and very welcoming. My bedroom was very comfortable, beautiful bed linen and ample toiletries.  Doyble glazing meant had a grreat nights sleep. Great breakfast too."
November 2008,Lovely Hotel with Excellent staff,"We stayed on the 'Romantic Package' to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The telephone booking directly with the hotel was very efficient and friendly, and having visited the restaurant many years ago before the refurbishment we were looking forward to seeing the new decor.  The changes did not disappoint and the hotel has a serene atmosphere.  The doorman was welcoming and walked us to reception where the young lady was equally as nice.  We did book in at 2pm so our room was ready and after a tour of the public rooms (which are gorgeous) we were shown to our room on the 2nd floor.  Don't ask me why but I was disappointed, it was beautifully furnished but despite asking for a quiet room it overlooked Dover Street with lots of passing traffic, however good for people watching…"
October 2008,5 Star,"Stayed at Browns for 1 night as part of the Romantic retreat package. It was a special occassion as I planned to propose to my girlfriend. Prior to the trip I was in contact with Guest Relations to organise various things to make the proposal more special. Maria who I dealt with was superb and could not be more helpful. In addition to the various request I made, Maria was there on arrival to meet us, the icing on the cake was that she managed to uprage our room from a junior suite to a classic suite....thanks. The room was very large 80 square metres...a lounge with 3 seater couch a bang and oulufson plasma, a separate massive bedroom with another B&O tv and a huge bathroom with you have guessed it another B&O Tv in the bath... Decor is contemporary but yet classical. The whole…"
September 2008,Five Star with a caveat,"The most important thing about Brown's is that they are true to their reputation: They are one of the most welcoming and friendly hotels in the world.  The thing that will strike you is that everyone there is really nice and customer oriented.  It doesn't have the air of pretentiousness you find in some 5-star hotels (I say this as someone who stays almost exclusively in 5-star hotels) - instead it feels like you are at home and with friends.  The more you stay there the more striking this becomes.  The hotel itself is also excellent:  Rooms: The rooms including many of the standard rooms are spacious, comfortable and well appointed.  Many of the rooms have high pressure rain-showers which are absolutely fantastic.  The beds are probably the best hotel beds I have slept on in…"
October 2008,Good but with flaws,"Stayed with my wife for a ""Romantic Retreat"" week-end, after a nice week-end earlier this year at Sir Rocco Forte's Hotel de Rome in Berlin, Germany.  The good:  Location is excellent Staff is very friendly and professionel English break-fast is as it should be (fresh, plenty,...) Room was luxurious (received as part of our package upgrade to an executive room), spacious and silent. Bed was very good. The spa treatments were heavenly they make their Manhattan cocktail just ""perfect""  The ""bad"":  our ""bottle of Champagne, fresh fruit and chocolate strawberries upon arrival in your room"" arrived the second (!) day and only after asking ourselves twice. The fruit were 3 basis apples and the strawberries just never arrived.  temperature in the public spaces is too high and also in…"
September 2007,Amazing Stay,"I was impressed with everything. The rooms were tastefully decorated, the bed extremely comfortable and the service impeccable, the concierge extremely helpful and well-informed. I requested a SIM card and was provided with one within 15minutes. It was an amazing stay in all its aspects. I usually stay at the intercontinental hotel and stayed at the Browns due its excellent location near Bond Street. Will stay there again, there is no doubt about this."
August 2008,Fine but overrated,"Brown hotel has a good location if you want to go to the theatres and shop. Nevertheless the service comes short of what you would expect of a five star hotel.   The design is good, contemporary which we enjoy , but a little cheap and quickly put together with lots of black and white phtographs but nothing much more.   The problem is that in London you cannot find many contemporary hotels with good locations. In that respect it has an advantage. We used it once for lunch and once for afternoon tea. Both experiences were fine but nothing you cannot find in many more places in London.   Would I go back. Maybe if the price was right. You can find great discounts on the hotel through some websites. I woul make sure I discuss the room with the reservation girl on the phone as it also…"
May 2009,A Great Treat,"The hotel is outstanding, a definate 5 Star.   We had room service which was amazing. They set up a full table which had its own hot cupboard.  The spa treatments were very good and relaxing, I had the Jet Lag Treatment which was very much needed.  Breakfast was perfect with a great buffet and lovely menu. All the staff were fantastic.   The location of this hotel is perfect for shopping."
February 2009,Pretty close to superb,"If your are into style its your hotel. everything which belongs to design is pretty classy and nice. the service was ok (the front desk made it lose a bit). the rooms was nice but a bit small. the location is great. overall, i would stay there again, but its also not a fault to keep your eyes open for other hotels..."
August 2009,A lovely hotel to stay at,"My daughter and I just returned from a week at Brown's and found it to be a really nice hotel overall.  We had a suite with plenty of room (what a nice luxury in London!), very comfy beds (I actually miss mine!) and great service. The breakfasts were good too (try the cappucino-and all that delicious fresh fruit) although I didn't have the stomach for the heavy English breakfast like my daughter did. My only caveat would be the tea there; we found the food not that good for the  $$ price and the seats were uncomfortable for anybody over 5'2"" (at 5'8"" my legs had nowhere to go!) That being said, I would stay at Brown's anytime-one of the best!"
July 2009,Afternoon Tea,"We booked afternoon tea at Brown's after my daughter's graduation. It was really first class, we had a great table in the window and they were ready for us. I had pre-advised them that two of our party were gluten free and they had gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that they missed out on nothing! There were separate plates of gluten free versions of everything that everyone else had and they were as delicious as the ordinary fare. The service was charming and unobtrusive and the whole experience memorable and special and worth every penny. No wonder Brown's came top in a poll of 'best afternoon tea' - I think this was in TimeOut and was well deserved. We would always think of Brown's in the future for a special occasion tea."
May 2009,loved it,Stayed here whilst attending a conference at another hotel. It was amazing! Staff were very slick and it felt like they knew what you were thinking before you did! Had a lovely room and great service from the bar staff when we came back late at night. Will definitely come back for a treat!
April 2009,There are better options,"There is nothing technically wrong with Brown's Hotel, but there are plenty of hotels in the same (high) price category which are far, far superior (One Aldwych! Claridge's! Connaught!). The room I was first taken to was awful. It was terribly claustrophobic with empty walls, everything grey and beige and with a brick wall right outside my window! I asked for a different room and was given a better one. But it was truly nothing special. I also asked to see rooms in higher categories and suites and decided that I will not return to this hotel. The elegance at Brown's is very understated, the entrance and the lobby are very small, the restaurant decor borders on the boring and you are charged for every little thing (I asked for some cutlery to be brought to my room and was charged…"
April 2009,5-Star DELUXE...,"When you walk through the doors of Brown's, you know you've arrived at somewhere very special.   From the discreet, but hugely helpful staff, to the elegant decor. This place is a gem. We stayed in a junior suite which, although it didn't have a fantastic view, still ticked all the boxes. Huge bathroom - with ALL the extras including aromatherapy oils and very good quality soaps, oh-so-fluffy robes and posh slippers (not the usual Hilton & Co rubbish). Fantastically comfortable bed and just about everything you could wish for.  Some nice touches included an iPod dock, decent TV and good AC.  Nice breakfast and top service.  Would love to go back soon!"
April 2009,Very impressed,"My wife and I stayed at Browns, 1st to 3rd May, 09. Good, decent sized, comfortable rooms. All the staff were very well trained, helpful and friendly. All service was first class. We decided to stay in one evening and ate in the main restaurant. Food and service was of a high standard and we were very impressed with that as many hotel restaurants disappoint. Not cheap at around 300GBP/night inc b'fast but all things considered not bad value. We have both stayed in other 5* hotels in London but Browns is by far the best."
March 2009,Home away from home,"I have stayed many times at the Browns.  The staff is amazing, food excellent, and the rooms are perfect.  Seriously, there is only one thing that the Brown needs to work on and thats breakfast!!  Buffet is ok, but needs some work.  The hotel is not cheap and thats good, cause I want them to maintain the type of people that visit the hotel. I have stayed in most of the london hotels including the Dorchester, Mandarin, Hulkins, Berkley, Ritz, and the Landsborough.  All of them are either too ""ritzy, old style"" or too ""cold, no cozziness what so ever and dull.""  The Browns is just the right style.  The Apple Crumble Pie is out of this world!!!  A MUST HAVE!!! Victorian sponge cake offered at tea time is ufffffff DELICIOUS!! My wife left the safe opened once and we had a few 1,000…"
December 2008,Friendly Hotel in Great Location,"While it is not cheap Brown's offers the traveler a great location, professional service, and a variety of food and shopping establishments within feet of the hotel. Despite its central location it is surprisingly quiet.  I found Londoners eager to come to Brown's for meetings."
August 2008,"Great staff, location, breakfast, not cheap, but overall worth it.","We had the romanic retreat package, as that offered an upgrade to the room.  We ended up taking a junior suite (i.e. one larger than average room with a sofa, coffee table etc.) for £500 + VAT. First night included bottle of Taittinger Champagne, strewn rose petals (of limited utility) and chocolates.  The staff are excellent, they give it a small hotel feel.  Full breakfast in the room  (£32 each, but included in the package) was very good.  It is, of course a wonderful location if you fancy wandering around Bond Street/St James' and pretending to be uber rich.  Speaking as a Londoner, it gave me a new perspective on that part of town.  Only disappointments were that the in-room entertainment was weak (poor choice of movies, problem with sound on DVD player, radio on the blink)…"
May 2008,Relaxed and welcoming,"Having stayed in so called four star hotels in London before, this five star hotel was a real treat - but it is very expensive. We liked everything about Browns: the manageable size, interesting boutique style decor, the huge choice of cocktails in the bar, the charming and approachable staff, the good breakfast and the lovely room.   We we in London for my husband's birthday and to use a voucher for dinner at the Dorchester on Park Lane. The Dorchester dinner was dreadful (in the Grill restaurant: boring menu, staff who didn't make eye contact, slow service, food unexceptional). In contrast, we had dinner the following night in Browns' Albemarle restaurant, which was excellent. Interesting range of dishes and beautifully cooked. Pricey though at £150 for two - without pudding. …"
May 2008,Worth the wait,"Just stayed at this hotel for one night to celebrate twentieth wedding anniversary. Had booked the ""Romantic Retreats"" package directly with the hotel. Check-in was from 2pm and true to the package description my wife, as we were arriving seperately due to work commitments, was offered an upgrade  from an Executive King to an Executive Deluxe. She was given the further option to wait a bit longer and upgrade even further to a Classic Suite and after some telephone consulatation we chose to wait for the Suite! My wife was shown to the Donovan Bar, read her book, people watched, and drank tea, coffee and a gin and tonic. Unfortunely the wait dragged on as the hotel was having a problem extracting the previous guest. The wait ended up being just under three hours but because we, I…"
March 2008,From Mayfair with Love,"The name’s Trott ..., Charles Trott... well, it might not sound quite as thrilling as Bond’s familiar greeting, but seeing as I was checking in on a ‘For Your Eyes Only’ 007 style break at Brown’s Hotel in Mayfair, I thought it only appropriate to break the ice in time honoured fashion. Fans of Ian Fleming’s sophisticated secret serviceman may already know that 2008 is the 100th anniversary of the author’s birth. To commemorate the occasion The Imperial War Museum in Lambeth is running a special Ian Fleming exhibition documenting the great man’s life and featuring the fictional world of his legendary hero. Brown’s hit upon the idea of running a Bond break during which fans could take in the exhibition and experience a little of the glamour and excitement that life in Bond’s fast…"
February 2008,not bad,Stayed at the Browns for one night in May.The front desk was very efficient and helpful.I had a very large and spacious room. I don't find the bathrooms very 5 star.Somehow  the shower and floor looked very used.The bed is definitely one of the most comfortable ones I have slept in.Great quilt. Overall a good but expensive experience.
January 2008,Meh,"MOLD IN THE SHOWERS!!!   Need I say more?   I used to love this hotel, but post renovation is just a complete flop. Browns used to have charm now all they have, are bad post modern semi comfortable rooms. It is rather unfortunate as this used to be a regular stop for me, but now I will be looking at alternative hotels for my stays in London.   If you're looking for a well situated luxury hotel, you have found it. If you're looking for a well priced luxury hotel that is appealing to the eye as well this is the wrong place for you."
February 2007,Classic British Hotel in a great location,"I just spent a night on a business trips in Brown's a hotel by the Rocco Forte Hotels.  This is a classic London Hotel in a great Mayfair location, so great for business and luxury shopping.  The rooms are huge and well equipped, although I would have liked a separate shower, and the lack of Wi-Fi connection is an issue at this price range in my opinion.   Staff are helpful and efficient.  The two small issues are: they have refurbished the hotel recently and I beleive the new furniture added does not match the period features of the hotel, it is neither modern and minimal nor classic- it is just not classy in my opinion. The another-the breakfast: I ordered an English breakfast and thankfully arrived fairly early, because it arrived 25 minutes after my order. I think that is…"
December 2007,'No nonsense' luxury with competence,"Having stayed at several great 5* hotels in London it was with some hesitation that I took my secretary's advice and booked my first stay at Brown's. I had a very good week as a guest at the hotel.  Location: smack in the middle of Mayfair with Bond St around the corner. St James's just down the road, Piccadilly and Soho very near. In other words a very central location.  Room: Fresh and modern without being arty minimalist. Wooden floors, white walls. Large bathroom. Views will never be great as it is on a Mayfair street and all houses incl hotel are low rise (5-6 floors I think). Bathroom is spacious and comfortable. Good shower pressure.   The feeling of the hotel is quite unique for London I think. I find hotels like Lanesborough and Claridges be old and stuffy - one can…"
November 2007,Pretty good,"my family and i stayed there for 9 days and it was overall very nice. The concierge was very helpful and friendly but not always correct. the rooms were nice but certain amentidies altough were requested before our stay were not met until mid-week. the tea-room is very nice and the staff was so polite and understanding. it was a cozy hotel and very comfortable. i, being a ""child"" was not repremanded about being in the hallways at 1:00 am in the morning even though a staff member saw me. that was very undeerstanding of him. the room service for breakfeast was quite nice. i would recommend the resturaunt in the hotel. All the staff down to even the doorman was very curtious. i also loved the bathrooms. perfect for taking a bath! Great place to stay!!!!"
January 2008,Great Dining Experience,"We dined in the restaurant at Browns in the week before Christmas and enjoyed a superb evening.  To begin, we sampled some cocktails in the bar before going through to eat. The maitre d' (David) welcomed us warmly and ensured that we had excellent service.  The staff were charming and utterly professional, with that rare combination of being attentive without being intrusive.  I had the scallops which were delicious, and the treacle tart with clotted cream was to die for.  The ambience in the restaurant was just right: elegant, buzzy (but not noisy) and with a sense that you were at the heart of things.  For us it was a perfect mix of great food and great atmosphere and we would certainly recommend."
July 2006,Best of London,Browns is great hotel for visiting London. Perfectly situated near to everything including the three Parks for morning runs. Staff is friendly and charming making things happen looks so easy. The concierge desk is great - with good connections and well organised service. Have stayed in three - four different rooms and all are of the best standard with very comfortable beds. Have become our preferred hotel in London without any competition.  Clearly pricey but value for what you pay for.
June 2006,Just perfect,Couldn't fault anything. It was perfect. Was given an upgrade to the deluxe rooms on our arrival. Our expectations were exceeded in every way.
December 2005,Afternoon Tea,"Me and another 2 friends of mine went to Browns on a Monday aternoon to try their new service. We had been already in other London´s hotel having Afternoon Tea, but this one is far form a 5* service Eventhough we new that it was quite late, they didn´t have any problems into allocated us in a nice table and offeref us their champagne tea option. Well, everything seemed to go ok until we realised that no member of staff was taking care of us as our cups there not filled up, our asthray was not exchange for a new one (we are heavy smokers) and our selection of sandwiches and pastries were not replaced neither... On top of that and after been more than 45 minutes waiting for any waiter to come to our table, they realised that we were completely ignored so we decided to make a…"
February 2006,A True 5-Star Hotel,"This hotel is pure class.  We stayed for two nights. First of all, the thing that really stood out for me was how friendly and happy the staff members were.  This friendliness definitely set the mood for the hotel. Our room was very comfortable.  The bedding was very nice, and the furniture was very comfortable to sit in.  Many hotels nowadays opt for a minimalist approach in guest rooms which often means that the furniture is not very comfortable.   This was definitely not the case here.  The bathroom was large with a large tub, separate shower stall, and well-appointed with very nice toiletries.  My only complaint about the room was that a recycling truck came by at 4:21 a.m. and emptied the bins on the street right outside our room.  But, I guess that the hotel can't really…"
January 2004,We felt like celebrities,We loved Browns.  We spent Christmas Day and Christmas Evening there.  The renovations were one week old when we stayed and we are pretty sure we were using some of their cutlery for the first time ever!  The staff were lovely.  They knew exactly who we were from the moment we walked in.  I highly reccomend room service - such production value! 
June 2007,Totally refurbished and back to being a gem in London,"We stayed at Brown's for 2 nights last weekend. The hotel has just come out of a major refurbishment and is now part of the 5* Rocco Forte collection. At check-in we were upgraded from a Classic Queen to an Executive King. The room was very spacious with a huge comfy bed complete with Frette linen as well as a flat screen TV. The furniture & interiors were beautiful, with a comfy chaise long. The bathroom was almost the same size as the room! The room was adjacent to the front of the hotel in Albemarle Street which made it slightly noisy but not significantly enough to affect sleep.  The best thing about the hotel is the service from the staff - they acknowledged us everywhere we went and were always on hand to answer any questions or direct.   If you're visiting then you must…"
June 2006,"Good hotel, needs some TLC","While the Brown had that quintessential English shabby-chic (I hate that phrase!) there is definitely room for improvment. Good points: We stayed there for our honeymoon in January due to a really great price on a travel package. Great central location and very close to the tube. Our room was a good size, comprised of a small sitting room and bedroom and a large bathroom. I wasn't expecting much from a British hotel bathroom, having stayed at many over a three month period years before, however, I thought the victorian marble bathroom was quaint and inviting--the shower worked well and we had plenty of hot water. The soaps and toiletries were superb (Italian)! Unfortunately we blew a fuse twice in the bathroom which was an annoying inconvienince to have to let in the repair man.…"
May 2007,"refined, traditional but overlooked the wear and tear","Very lovely, quaint hotel in an upscale area. Serice was very good.  Beds and bath were just fine. It Definitely takes you back to the 19th century. Tea is a highlight for $200 bucks. Rooms and hotel in general need some work but if you don't look real close it is overall a very nice hotel and certainly british."
April 2007,"Tea nice, but needs a facelift","Reasonable post-xmas rate thru expedia booking ($244/night). Salon rooms very cosy, afternoon tea v. good. Central location convenient for shops (Piccadilly, Fortnum's etc). Comfortable beds, but hotel needs renovating, especially the 1950's bathrooms and elevators - I gather the new owners (Rocco Forte) will do this by 2005. Hotel a bit jumbled as made up of five different houses put together. Food is very expensive, only afternoon tea (you need to book) is really worth it. Note that if you're taking a taxi to the airport, taxi driver will pay bellhop 5 GBP for the intro."
March 2007,Not a 5 star,"While the hotel is quite nice in an antique English fashion, the only real high point was afternoon tea. It was very good . However, service in the rest of the hotel was at about a 2 star level, thus removing it from the same rating level as the Dorchester, the Savoy and the Ritz. It was not good value for the money, but it's central lcation is hard to beat. I will definitely stay elsewhere next time."
March 2007,"Lovely & posh, but very traditional & conservative","Very lovely, posh hotel in a beautiful part of London. I stayed in a standard double room, and while it was nice, the room itself was a bit dark. Beds were comfortable and linens crisp and clean. It is very much a traditional English establishment with excellent service, although I felt it a bit ""stuffy"" at times. Good for the business excecutive or a slightly more conservative traveler."
October 2006,A really nice hotel,"Very nice hotel. Very pricy. Suggest that you not use room service, although server was very nice, the price of the food was outrageous.  Never found the exercise room. Room was very well turned out. Very clean and well stocked. No view. Close to shops and just a short hop to Buckingham Palace. Concierge was very courteous as was the front desk staff. Recieved substantial discount via Expedia.com and was very happy with the stay."
September 2006,"Stylish, welcoming - our favourite London hotel so far","Stayed with teenage daughters for some shopping and shows. Felt at home from the moment the doorman took our bags. Lovely bright large room - perfect temperature and so quiet despite being busy and such a central location. Very comfortable beds, good turn down service. The bathroom was large with lots of little extras. They didn't forget anything. Enjoyed breakfast each morning - both from the buffet and the a la carte selection. Concierge charged my mobile as I'd forgotten my charger, and wrapped and sent a package home for me.  Will definitely stay again and hope to visit one of the other hotels in the collection."
August 2006,very expensive,"Very disappointed with the hotel experience. Have stayed in Claridges, Barclay and Dorchester so do have some experience in luxury and attention to detail. On arrival at 11pm at night even though booked a King bed room for 7 nights was shown to 1st floor way out the back room looking on to internal ugly venting and of course no King bed seen. Was then told they had no other rooms. That night as it was late we accepted this and went to sleep. We were assured it would be attended to the next day. The next day no one contacted us we contacted them twice and finally we were given some attention. We were shown 2 other rooms both looking out on to the internal view with 1 small window finally they put us into a room with the street view still with no King bed, then an arguement…"
September 2006,"Beautiful hotel, old-London atmosphere","Brown's is a beautiful old-London style hotel that has been wonderfully renovated within the last few years.  The Mayfair location can't be beat, the rooms are luxurious though vary widely in size (all have the same amenities) and the staff is the definition of excellence.  Most rooms have sofas/sitting areas, spa-style bathrooms and great finishing touches.  It's an expensive hotel but worth it's cost and a great location for a business traveller.  Tea or drinks in the bar is a definite must if time permits. "
November 2023,"Great Hotel, Great Service, in the Center of London","This is one of the top hotels for servie and location.    Location:  Onle block from Piccadilly St, between Bond and Dover.  Five minute walk from Shepherds Market if you are up for good food.  Five minutes walk in the opposite direction to Trafalgar Sq.  Rooms:  I saw criticism of their rooms in previous comments and I find this criticism unfounded.  While the room size will depend on the rate you pay, all romms I stayed at were comfortable and reasonable size.  See pictures of the room I am staying in now.    Beds:  Heavenly.  Soft, perfect beds.  Thick, clean-smelling goose down blankets and poillows.  Blankets are in duvets instead of sheets.  Thick, snow-white cotton sheets.    Cleanliness:  Pristine, The turn-down service actually includes room cleaning.    Service:…"
November 2023,Unexpectedly Average,"We stayed at Brown's for three nights. While the neighborhood is convenient, the hotel was unexpectedly average.   The room decor was a bit understated and lacked personality. The highlight of the room was the bed, which was heaven to sleep in. Breakfast was average and we were over charged for items and brought incorrect items as well. My partner's massage booking was bungled and he didn't receive the services he'd initially booked.   I asked for an voltage converter, and received an archaic looking piece of equipment which promptly blew a fuse in our room. A replacement or more modern converter was not procured.   I see no reason to stay here again, nor would I suggest it to friends. "
November 2023,Great hotel,"A great night in luxury. We were upgraded because as the rather indiscreet receptionist told us the hotel was only at 17% occupancy and last month was 'even worse'. Anyway,  whether it was the rarity of guests or not, our stay could not have been better. An amazing suite, wonderful surroundings, friendly but not casual staff who went the extra mile in all respects. Highly recommended. "
November 2023,London Gem,"Stayed at the Brown's for one night. Was greeted warmly at the entrance and shown the way to reception. Staff was very friendly and informative. We were given a short tour of the hotel before being shown to our rooms. The staff member showed me all ammenities of the room before leaving. I attempted to give him a tip but was told that this was not neccesary. Classy.. Room was on the 5th floorand was very nicely decorated. Bathrooms was roomy and nely refurbished. Comfortable bed with down comforters. Very good service through our entire stay from the doorman to the maids. Only small thing that could have been better was breakfast. The breakfast buffet was a little ""thin"". It was possible to order from the a lacarte grill menu, something we did, but I personally prefer a buffet.…"
November 2023,Our new favorite hotel,"We have been traveling to London for some time, and had the luxury of staying in many of London's better hotels. We have never had a true favorite, until we decided to stay at Brown's.  The hotel is  well located near Oxford street and easy to catch the tube at Bond st or a taxi. The hotel spans 2 streets Albermarle and Dover streets, while in a busy part of London, these 2 streets are realitively quiet and peaceful. The hotel itself upon entering it is very understated, with reception being located near the center of the hotel. The staff was personable and professional, while our room wasnt quite ready (they never are). The front desk took my mobile # and called me when the room was ready. Our room was on the 4th floor on the Dover St side of the building. We like our space, I…"
November 2023,Warm Hospitality with Style,"Upon arrival we received a very warm welcome, and appreciated good hospitality throughout from the management and staff during our entire stay. Our suite was magnificent, with a bathroom to die for. We had a wonderful traditional dining experience, including smoked salmon (carved at the table) and particularly enjoyed the potted shrimps together with some interesting dishes from the grill. To sum up, this is a great hotel and we would recommend it due to all the above mentioned points, and of course it's fabulous location for Bond Street Shopping! "
November 2023,Minimalist designer fails to provide storage,"We stayed at Browns Hotel in August 2006, anxious to experience the much advertised makeover.  We found the public areas delightful, well staffed, with a sprinkling of celebrities coming and going to tea in the afternoons.  The glitz and glamour of traditional London in the public areas is complemented in the rooms by a very stylish minimalist decor.  On first viewing the room is outstanding in its appearance.  Once you are inside with two suitcases and a couple of pieces of hand luggage, it is very apparent that there is virtually no storage.  I measured height of the four drawer cabinet, and found that each drawer was two inches high..........i.e, a folded pair of jeans just fits.  Add a couple of  T shirts and the drawer is full.  We put one of our suitcases in the wardrobe. …"
November 2023,"timeless style, pure quality","This is simple, timeless style for intelligent people. During my 24-hour stay,  I quickly felt at home, could find what was were. The bedroom light switches are  simply switches, not complicated electronic panels. I found and could work the  safe, the shower controls. At the desk, broadband was instant, light was good.  The timeless effect of antiques, serious hardback books as well as current top  international glossy magazines was mentally elevating. Dinner was that rare  classic, proper historic English food - but with designer ingredients (Temple  Farm chicken from Hatfield, crab from Dorset), perfectly cooked and served. The  breakfast buffet is sheer quality - rather than gargantuan quantity - and  coffee best anywhere, for months. The gym is fine, and I also borrowed a…"

November 2023,Delicious food and cosy and elegant environment ,"I have spent a lovely afternoon yesterday at the tearoom of the hotel. I went there for a business meeting and I couldn’t have chosen a better place where to bring my colleague. The setting is amazing and staff is a 5+ *.  We had the pleasure to meet Rocco at the tearoom, who professionally suggested a nice drink after explaining our tastes. After the drink, we had the pleasure to meet Antonello, who told us the story of the hotel and highly recommended to visit the hotel again in order to taste the lovely dinner menu.
