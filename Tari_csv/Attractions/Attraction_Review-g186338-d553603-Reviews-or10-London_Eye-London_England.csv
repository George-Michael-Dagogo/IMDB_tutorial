"Written February 16, 2020",Great at night time ,As pass holders we didn’t need to queue but at 8pm the queue is minimal anyway. Took my 4 year old up and he loved it. A great view over London at night with the lights shining. Definitely worth it 
"Written February 22, 2020",Views of London,The London Eye is good for viewing the skyline of London but the length of the queues makes it almost not worth it. Getting a few pictures of the Eye itself from a distance is great but it's really just a once off trip. Consider investing in the fast pass of it's busy or you may spend more time in line than on the Eye.
"Written March 20, 2020",6 stars,"I would give six stars if I could! I booked fast track for an evening view of London, and I was not disappointed. While fast track did cost more, me and my boyfriend were straight past the long line, searched and into a pod within six minutes of arriving. Well worth the extra money in my opinion. But the views? Simply breathtaking. Seriously, the pictures and videos don't do justice. It's so peaceful being that high up, yet you see the city still bustling below. The pod has so many clear windows for excellent photo opportunities and is spacious enough for many people inside without feeling claustrophobic. The pace was just right and not once did I feel uncomfortable. I've seen people saying this is a ""tourist trap"", but I couldn't disagree more. As a Brit myself, I can't recommend you do this attraction enough and hopefully it will shine a light onto why I'm raving about it so much.  A truly unforgettable, spectacular experience."
"Written February 27, 2020",View in the sky,"Surprised how quick we accessed the Eye.  We were booked in at 4.30pm and had arrived early because of possible queues but got on the ride within 5 minutes and had actually finished our rotation before our allotted time.Superb views over the city, so many sights to try and identify.  The Eye will always be a popular tourist attraction, next time I want to see the city by night."
"Written December 1, 2021","The Shard has better views, but this is a great attraction","Had an enjoyable dusk/night time ride on the London Eye. The queue moved slowly as not all pods were being loaded, plus you have to navigate the usual Merlin green screen photo opp, but once on board it was a great experience. Not too many people in the pod, although not much in the way of mask wearing. The views were spectacular. Highly recommend a night time ride but probably not for your first/only ride because it can be difficult to pinpoint specific landmarks as it's a carpet of lights below (which is truly spectacular). No problem with glare or visibility and taking photos even with my smartphone was easy.The ride itself is beautiful - you can tell it was a passion project for the architects. Even though it's been beaten in terms of height, it's still the most beautiful. It's extremely smooth, and you can't feel when it starts/stops to load disabled people.I feel the Shard offers far better views (it's almost surreal looking down on London Bridge) plus not time-limited like the London Eye is, however the London Eye is still great, easy to do and a great icon for London."
"Written February 18, 2023",Nice family flight,"It is what it is.  A big Ferris style wheel above London.  The organisation here is at least well polished and professional (compared to, well, nearly everything else we did this week) and you feel safe and secure.  We had a 5:45pm slot, which was the last slot of the day and as a result the man loading the pods placed out family of five in our own pod.  This made for a really special time as a family enjoying the flight and views of London and allowed a nice calm chilled experience.  I would definitely recommend booking later on in the day as when we arrived at the Southbank around 10am it looked fairly busy then."
"Written February 26, 2020",Amazing views,Such a unique experience. Costly but worth every bit. The movement of the eye is slow and steady so your elevation is not a sudden jarring one. Fortunately we had a clear afternoon with little wind so there were no disappointments with our ability to see the view. Easy to book online (we booked before our trip to ensure a spot because it was half term in London) and fast check in. Photo opportunity at the start of the ride and a great souvenir at the end. Each compartment contains around 15 guests so you don’t feel claustrophobic. Truly a fantastic experience.
"Written March 1, 2020",London Eye,"Went on the London Eye on Friday as part of a school trip. Participated in a workshop in the pod as we went round.  Great thanks goes to Will, who was one of the Eye’s workshop leaders. He took time with the students, engaging their attention, and bringing the experience to life. I’d really recommend this experience."
"Written January 16, 2020","Nice, but for the price I preferred The Shard","The London Eye became famous after the entry in the new millennium, and stayed after its success, for years to come (while we visit, it's celebrating its 20th anniversary).The views are very good, but you'll find more or less the same impact in the Tate Modern museum, which is free, or the top of the dome in St.Paul's Cathedral.Also, the queues can be huge, and if you choose fast track, then the price is not worthwhile. I would prefer to pay more to go to the top of The Shard, which at least gives you a unique perspective, and where you can stay as long as you want while drinking and sitting.The wheel will rotate only once for about 30 minutes. that's it.I'll let you decide for yourself, of course, but take into account the alternatives."
"Written February 19, 2020","Disappointing experience, great view ","London Eye delivers the view it promises; however it’s very disorganised. We purchased our tickets via website, with the binoculars. The queue has groups, families and general public all mixed up. We had a group of 30+ people skipping the line numerous times. Our binoculars were not given to us, and we realised this when we were ready to board the cabin. When we asked for the binoculars, we were told they are given at the entrance (where the person admitting us never told us) and that we should  “try get the ladies attention” so she handed it over to us. When we complained the experience was being terrible, we were just told “so sorry. Please step to the side” and there we were left trying to get the binoculars lady attention.With the groups, our kids were constantly bumped into and walked over. Very disappointed q the overall experience. "
"Written October 18, 2022",Placed in a crowded pod while others were practically empty,This was my second time on the Eye.  Don't pay for the extra stuff--just purchase a regular ticket and plan to queue.  We were disappointed that we were put into a pod with about 7 rambunctious kids whose parents did not supervise them while the other pods were practically empty.  Cool views the weather was exceptional.  
"Written September 6, 2020",Now is the time to fly,This was a great time to fly the eye  for the wrong reasons   Covid 19 is keeping tourists away such a pity .as the safety measures put in place are brilliant with a temperature check and swift cleaning of the pods between  customers making you feel really safe.The upside to this  no long queues and less people per pod  meaning great views and photo opportunities
"Written May 10, 2022",Pub Car!!!,"We took our first trip on the Eye in the Pub Car, which for one of us was highly necessary, as a drink helps with the fear of heights!Shout out to Dan and Harry, our guides and bartenders, who were absolutely lovely with their stories about the landmarks we could see, and for providing a truly fun atmosphere. In addition, the reduced number of occupants in the Pub Car made for a likely more enjoyable experience than the usual. Thanks Dan and Harry!"
"Written March 21, 2020",Even better than anticipated,"London Eye obviously was a much see. Was a bit higher than i thought and was concern about my fear of height. Overall experience is extremely stable, except slight jerks when it stops and go sometimes. but you won't feel it much. the experience is amazing and so is the view!!! Great 30 minutes experience not just the view to be in the highest ferris wheel is quite amazing!!"
"Written August 21, 2022",Magical views of London,"We booked a Champagne flight as part of a wedding anniversary trip to London. Pushed the boat out to celebrate with a Champagne tour. Reception really slick, lively room with great view of the Eye and across the river. Fast track escorted access limited to 16 people. Wow experience and view mind blowing - not to be missed. Would have been a 5* if not for the the tour guide who seemed intent on being the main attraction"
"Written January 6, 2020",Must visit ,Third visit Bussiness as usual entertaining and busy . 3D experience was good. It’s obviously a must see attraction if in london one enjoys it every time though it is nothing out of the world.
"Written November 20, 2021",Love this,Great way to see London. In the daytime and when the lights are coming on are both  great times to see the city.Small dislike is the pink advertising all over the eye. We did a river trip also in conjunction with the eye and the guide was superb. 
"Written June 28, 2022",Best done as a group.,"Do not bother unless you are part of a group.  Our pod had 33 people but the next pod had only 15 ( yes, I counted).  Because the walkway to enter the pods is stationary but the pods continue to move, the person next to me panicked and I was physically pushed and blocked from entering the pod, almost falling as this person back stepped into my spot rather than entering the pod.  In our pod, the many young people stayed in place at the windows taking selfies.  At one point, someone asked if the rest of us could have a turn.  Most grudgingly comply, but one couple refused to move from the prime spot.  They took selfies the entire ride, never once looking at the view!  Obviously, the view is great but not worth the hassle."
"Written November 9, 2020",Private pod,"Had a private pod and it was amazing. We had a good day, took in the views and I would recommend. I would also suggest either going mid week or getting a private pod like we did and then you get to cur junk and not be stuck with strangers!"
"Written January 13, 2022",Champagne with a view!,"We did the champagne experience and had a fantastic guide (Archie) who was so informative and funny. There were only 2 other couples in the pod so you felt very safe. The views are staggering, you see London from a completely different aspect - a must do experience!"
"Written June 3, 2020",Nice view but nothing special,"I visited the London Eye with my boyfriend, as it was his first time in London and we had purchased the London Explorer Pass, which we could use for plenty of sights in London. We got very excited, as I had never entered the London Eye either. However, we had to wait in a really long queue (it can be endless, especially at the weekend or on special days) which was quite annoying. The view is impressive, indeed, but I think the whole thing is a bit overrated (and overpriced). If you are willing to pay for it, maybe you should pay a little more, so that you get a skip-the-line ticket."
"Written September 13, 2021","A trip highlight, all thanks to great customer service. ","We purchased tickets for the pub pod experience but stupidly, I had gotten my dates confused and had booked the previous weekend. I somehow did not realise this until we attempted to enter the VIP area and the attendant, Drew, kindly informed me of my mistake.It was at this point that I was resigned to losing our tickets and felt that was a fair punishment for making such a mistake.Of his volition, Drew said not to worry and he went to double check with his manager if there were any free spaces available on our selected experience which thankfully there was.I would like to highlight how impressed we were with Drew's customer service as he had no need to do what he did for us.The pub pod experience itself was really fun and it was made more enjoyable by our host Arnie who managed to make 16 drinks in 30 minutes and still found time to make jokes and take pictures. "
"Written December 20, 2020",WOW,"I went into London with my friends and decided to see the London eye and I don’t regret it. The views we’re STUNNING and it slowed me to get a new perspective in London as a city. At night, the London Eye is lit up into different colours and it was breathtakingly beautiful. It made me proud to be a Londoner.I would recommend this to anyone( even people who are scared of heights)."
"Written June 27, 2021",Pub pod - great!,"We did the Pub Pod pop up with Beefeater Gin. Great experience with 2 drinks across the rotation. Our host AJ was very welcoming, friendly and great fun to have on the trip! The decoration of the pod as a pub with seats, plants and a dart board was very fun"
"Written January 1, 2020",Sightseeing ,"Bought the fast track  from the adjacent  booth - quicker than the main office (plenty of queues) wish we’d booked a package. Well directed and on the eye in 5 mins beating the queues, so well worth it on a Cold Sunday. Would be good if there were maps on board to pick out landmarks.  Good security checks. Don’t like having to have my photo taken twice however.  "
"Written February 23, 2020",Not worth the money,"You definitely don't need a fast pass as the queue times aren't massive. We were there at half term and waited around 10 minutes to get on. They search you before you get on, which is definitely the right thing to do. However, there needs to be a nicer, more humane way of doing it. A certain security guard was horrible, his attitude was disgusting and the way he was treating people just wasn't on. It completely ruined the whole experience for me and my family. The actual ride itself is good. The views over london are fantastic, and my kids loved it. But it is a total rip off, and I definitely would not do it again."
"Written April 4, 2023",Easy iconic London experience,We had a great experience with the London eye. Booking online was easy and its allowed to change your time booking if your plans change. We were very lucky that the day we went we had clear blue skys so very good views. We booked Tuesday at 11.15am and despite it being half term only had to que for 13mins before getting on. Process is very efficient. We were on the eye for 25mins.
"Written February 18, 2020",Inconsistent pooling of people in pods.,"I got rammed into a pod with some 25 other folks. The next few pods had 7-12 people in each so photos were hard to take.The queues weren't too bad. They have a fast pass if you want to pay more to wait a shorter period of time.I combined my ticket with a river tour and enjoyed that immensely.It felt like a cash grab to do green screen touristy photos, but to each their own for memories.I would do this again in nicer weather but only if someone came with me. It feels uneventful as a solo traveler.I also live in a city where there are lots of skyscrapers. So I would have access to many different city vantage points."
"Written March 17, 2020",Happy 20th Year London Eye,"Pleased we did this attraction well worth the views although at times our pod was quiet, enjoyed it very much. Queues were well organised and kept moving well, pods cleaned between each set of people. Cannot believe it's 20 years old."
"Written September 27, 2020",I take all my visitors here!,"As a Londoner, I take anyone who visits on the London Eye.  I've been so many times now, but still don't tire of it.  Worth doing anything you can to pre-book and beat the queues however, because it can be a bit of a long wait...."
"Written January 14, 2020",Great attraction to get full view of the city ,"My son loved the ride, and was so enthusiastic to find  all the monuments all around the city. Lines can get real long, it was pretty long even on a very cold weekday early morning. Early as in early even before they open. Its  worth splurging for fast track "
"Written August 27, 2022",The Eye,The London Eye is a ferris wheel that is along the Thames and gives you a view up and down the river. The lines were long and it cost you $35 per person to do the ride. If you got there early to beat the lines it might be worth it.
"Written June 7, 2022",Great city views,"A great way to get city views.  I was relieved that they limit the number of people in each pod and our fellow riders were good about sharing the good viewing spots.  Not a cheap attraction though so probably a once in a life time experience.  We spent extra for a Fast Track  ticket which did avoid the very long Standard Ticket line, but there is still a queue.  Thankfully it didn't take too long to get to the front of the line."
"Written July 15, 2022",Seems to Poke Out of the Horizon Everywhere You Go!,"I didn’t actually ride on the London Eye, but I admired its presence along the peaceful Thames and loved that its height let me take little glimpses of it seemingly everywhere I traveled within London. Recognize that the Eye is among the most touristy endeavors you could possibly do here—that’s not necessarily a negative thing, but with the common notion in people’s minds that the Eye is quintessential London, there WILL be hoards of people wanting to get on, probably even during off seasons. So expect to dedicate at least an hour standing in line if you really wish to ride it over the summer. Despite not going up on the Eye, seeing it up close and catching it poking out of the city skyline was enough of an experience for me to walk away satisfied. Make sure you really weigh your options and priorities before choosing to actually ride the Eye or not."
"Written March 1, 2020",Beautiful views of London,"My friend was visiting London from Australia and wanted to do ""London things"". She suggested the London Eye and despite being a Londoner for over 6 years of never actually tried it. We bought tickets on the day from the office and went straight onto the eye without having to queue which was great. I was a little apprehensive about the experience as I've recently developed a bit of a fear of heights nothing paralysing but enough to feel a bit panicky. That being said I absolutely loved the experience, we were lucky enough to have timed it at sunset and saw London in its most beautiful light. The information in the pods is very helpful in explaining what all the different buildings are and the pods are big enough to not feel claustrophobic even with a few people in. But I'm glad to say they tend not to overcrowd the pods leaving enough space for everyone to take nice photographs and to feel comfortable. I'd definitely recommend it to visitors and Londoners alike. "
"Written February 14, 2020",Great views,We pre-booked tickets purchased using Tesco Clubcard vouchers. Otherwise quite expensive at £27 per adult.However the wheel provides an amazing view of London in all directions. It was not too busy and so there was no waiting. There's an encouragement to have photos whilst in the queue and also on the pod. We resisted that!There was also a short 4D film which was quite clever and worth a visit if not too much of a wait.
"Written September 8, 2020",Single pods ,Having worked all the way through this horrible pandemic we had managed to get some time off together so came to London for a few days. Bought a 3 attraction ticket for 45.00 really good value for money. We arrived at the eye about fifteen minutes early so partner asked if we could queue up early no problem at all. What was nice was due to covid they where only letting people go in in their own groups so we got a pod all to ourselves. Wonderful views over London. As we were waiting to get off there was a group of cleaners ready to board the empty capsules all masked and gloved up to wipe ever where over. Would recommend for a lovely half hour 
"Written February 26, 2020",A lovely farewell,I’m not a fan of heights but it feels very secure and stable the whole way. A very smooth ride. It is quite expensive (30 pound for an adult or 40 pound for a fast track ticket) but it’s beautiful. A lovely view. I recommend doing it towards the end of your trip. A nice way to farewell London. 
"Written January 4, 2020",Not that exciting or worth the money.,"My kids had been dreaming of going on the London Eye.  It was fine, but way overpriced for a pretty average experience.  There was no guide on the eye that told you what buildings you were seeing, or even a recorded voice to guide you where to look.  It was pretty crowded and I felt like we were jockeying for places at the window to look out of.  Wasn’t a highlight for me at all."
"Written July 31, 2022",Dual ticket with Madame Tussards online so saving.  Booked times for both online,There were 4 of us and we wanted to do Madame Tussards as well and so purchased online the dual ticket which saves money.  Booked a time slot for London Eye the late afternoon the day we arrived in London and Madame Tussards for the morning soon after it opened to give us time to get to it on the tube.  We didnt queue for long and got in our pod and it was a clear day and dry so that was good.  As 2 of us had been about 12 or so years ago being our first time and it was a rainy overcast day so the views had not been great on that occasion.  We had good views and good pictures and enjoyed it.
"Written October 29, 2020",Really lovely visit,"Our 6 year old daughter had been asking to go for sometime and she was not disappointed. We booked a 5pm boarding and arrived just after, we walked straight through the checks and boarded quite quickly. Everything was very Covid friendly! The skyline was all lit up and we had a clear day which meant you could see a lot. Toilet facilities etc inside the booking hall were very clean and more than enough available. Staff were friendly and chatty with our daughter. "
"Written January 15, 2020",Big wheel,"Second time we’ve been out, we have Merlin premium so we can fast track which is good. We ended up in a pod with a family who liked to take photos, my god, they were so loud and Instagrammable it just ruined the whole experience. Great views over London, was very annoyed at the end when it tells you to stand in the photo zone my daughter did and this group of plastic Kardashians clapped their hands at her and told her to move, I was in a gap behind and made sure I had the most awful face 😂 hope I ruined your picture because I couldn’t be cropped out. It’s a good thing to do in London just hope your get nice people in your pod. "
"Written August 30, 2020",Always a good experience ,Been on here a few times over the years but has been a long time and our youngest had never been on. The queue was short as I imagine it’s hit by coronavirus. Very impressed with the speedy cleaning between use and the fact that the pods were not rammed as they can be. If you haven’t been on this is a fab attraction to see right across London. I’d definitely recommend you go on. Even if you hate heights like me! 
"Written March 13, 2023",Ok,"Treated my 6 year old to a weekend in London for her birthday. She couldn't wait to get on the London eye. Ended up being a tad disappointed because the capsule we were in was full of adults who hogged the one end (the main view over London) I get that everyone wants to see the view but there's plenty of time for the wheel to spin around for everyone to get a good view and move around. Unfortunately we were unlucky that day and those who were on with us wouldn't let the children onboard get to the main part... Even despite asking politely. So we ended up spending most of our time watching some 20 year old and her boyfriend create their romantic tiktoc or Instagram content.Anyway Would i still recommend it if visiting London... yes absolutely. Hope when we're back in December with the rest of the family, that we can get a better look."
"Written January 7, 2020",Make sure you book ,"Expensive, long queues but one of the must-do things when visiting London. Great views in the sunshine or at sunset but pretty grim if it's a miserable rainy day. Go to Alexandra Palace instead.. Great views across London, free and you can go ice skating there too. "
"Written September 18, 2021",Another great ferris wheel journey,"Came here with a friend on 241 tickets on merlinfun.comThe staff were welcoming and helpful, the weather was good with a bit of cloud  its situated right next to the London Thames and it takes around half an hour.The views and photo opportunities are amazing and its well worth a visit with other activities nearby like shrek adventure , sea life centre, London dungeon and can have a good walk alongside the river ThamesJust a shame big Ben is covered in scaffolding at the moment.Well worth a visit at this time and I have been to a ferris wheel in Paris and Vegas "
"Written January 30, 2020",Nice Experience ,"I wasn't sure how I felt about going on the Eye of London, but I don't regret doing it. It literally does what it says, gives you an eye of London. We had the opportunity to visit it on a nice sunny day. It is perfect for pictures, and aerial sight seeing. I bought fast track tickets, which I recommend as it helps you to skip the line. They fit about 10 to 25 people in a pod; mine only had 10. I honestly think more than 10, would be too much, especially since they put you with random strangers. The staff was friendly and helpful. They do check your bags before you get on, so be aware of that. No alcohol is allowed on either. Would I recommend? YesWould I go back? If I was with a different group whose never been on ot before."
"Written July 15, 2022",VIP Experience (Jubilee Pub Pod) Well Worth the Money,"I surprised my fiance we a trip on the eye in the special Jubilee Pub Pod in honor of Her Majesty's Platinum Jubilee. He actually said that it was his favorite activity of our entire trip to London. The staff were amazing, personable, knowledgeable and overall really added to the experience. They specialty cocktails were both absolutely delicious and the theming and decoration of the pod really added something special to what otherwise could be considered a standard attraction. The price may seem a bit steep for some but in my opinion, the experience and memory were well worth the price paid. I wish it wasn't a limited time event but I'm excited to see what VIP Experience they come up with next."
"Written March 7, 2023",Amazing tourist attraction,"i went with my grandmother who has lived in london for over ten years and we had an amazing time going on the london eye. if you aren't a fan of heights i wouldn't recommend. it takes around 45 minutes for it to go round once. the pods are very big and you can book one out for yourself but if you don't then you will share the pod with other people. if you have a wheelchair, the staff are more than happy to assist. one thing that i didn't like was this one staff lady who pushed me in the pod and almost trapped my foot in the door! apart from that it was a lovely experience and i would go again."
"Written December 10, 2020",Lovely family visit,We visited the London Eye on the 4th December. The staff were fantastic! Really friendly and helpful. My Dad is disabled so they stopped it completely so that he could step in safely. It was lovely and quiet too which meant we had a pod almost to ourselves! 
"Written August 15, 2020",Disappointing ,"Due to COVID they had removed the four panoramic boards that allow you to identify the various London landmarks. As a result, we really had no idea what to look out for, and therefore we got a lot less out of the visit than we should have. It surely cannot be that difficult to put the boards back and give them a quick wipe with disinfectant between each group? I certainly wouldn’t go back until they replace these boards."
"Written February 14, 2020",Valentines Day Visit,"Went to the Eye as part of Valentine’s Day, it was good. The queue was managed quickly and I was soon on without delays. It is an incredible view and I would recommend it. I got tickets as part of a package where I get to do the Eye, Dungeons, Sherk and Sea Life which i would recommend as it is a lot cheaper and they are all next to each other in a line so get to do them all in a day. "
"Written November 1, 2023","Amazing nighttime views of London, no crowds","Wanted to end my London trip on a ""high note"" (get it, since you go up pretty high 😜) and managed to get one of the last times available on the London Eye before it closed.Since this is the first time I'm doing this, I cannot compare it to a daytime experience but this was lovely. No crowds, I was able to get a ticket and get right on. There were only about 12 people in our cabin so all of us got some quality photo time. London is still beautiful at night so I didn't feel like I missed out on anything.Tickets were £45 which is the regular price, the fast pass was £60 but I didn't buy that. The purchasing system was designed to upsell you so that was a bit annoying, just clicking through so many options. I had to help the guy next to me since it was so confusing.But now that I know what the nighttime view is like, I'll likely go back during the day next time."
"Written February 10, 2020","a bit boring, but got what I paid for","you can have some lovely views of the river and the novelty is all very exciting at first, but we were up there for such a long time. It's obviously not a fair ground ride. I wouldn't call it fun, but I will give it 5 green dots anyway, because no one told me it would be fun and I think for someone who properly considered how much time it would take to come back down again and still wanted to do it, this would be ideal."
"Written February 28, 2020",BIGGER than any in the U.S.,"Wow!  You could have a party in one of those pods.  So much better and bigger then the similar ones in the U.S. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but worth it at least one time.  You might not can see too far on a cloudy day, but still very much enjoyable."
"Written February 20, 2020",30 Minute Ride,This is a great way to see the London skyline and the ride last about 30 minutes. You can take the tube to Waterloo and walk over in 5 minutes. Only downside is that you may have to wait a bit even with advance tickets but the line moves quickly. 
"Written August 24, 2020",Great experience,"This was my second or third time doing the London eye. It’s great to see it open again. It wasn’t busy at all when we went and we had pre booked our experience online which was very handy.They are faking social distancing very seriously and are limiting the amount of people in the pod at any one time, you must wear a face mask and after every visitor they wipe and spray down the pod. "
"Written August 30, 2020","Lovely experience, something u can not miss in London","It was absolutelly amazing. Such a lovely experience which u can not skip if u are visiting or living in London. We had tickets for more attractions, we bought all of those when entering the aquarium. It is very helpfull if u got tickets pre-paid, as that will skip u all the queues for each attraction. I will go for it any time again. Just love it."
"Written March 19, 2022",First time,"We pre-booked our timeslot but arrived 20 mins early. As it was quiet, and not much of a queue, they let us on straight away. As it was a lovely sunny morning the views were excellent and the wheel moved at a pace that you could really take your time with the photo opportunities. "
"Written September 1, 2022",Champagne Experience,"I have a cousin visiting from abroad and this was the 1st place he wanted to go. We did the Champagne ride. The host was fab( forgotten his name but he is from Brazil) very knowledgeable pointing out all the places of interest while we were up there and kept us all entertained. He found out a bit about everyone and made us feel special, which added to the overall experience.  I would highly recommend the ride on the Eye"
"Written February 21, 2020",Great VIEWS,Perfect place to see all of London. Coca Cola did it right. The pods are deceiving from pictures. They actually fit upward to 20+ people in them. Line ups are quick and the entire adventure took 45-50 minutes. Kids loved it!
"Written February 26, 2022",Great views of London ,"We are visiting London for the half term break, we used the coupons off the Christmas selection boxes which allows children on free.. we absolutely loved it, first timers so wasn’t sure what to expect but we all were amazed at the views. Only down side was the queue, he had booked to be on at 4pm it was about 4:30 by the time we reached the front, luckily it wasn’t raining but we did enjoyed it "
"Written March 17, 2022",WOW! What a view.,"All I'm going to say is I can tell why it's such a big tourist attraction, defiantly worth the journey to go and see it in person, it's amazing to watch at night too. When I went on the eye the skies were blue so I got some good views of the city. I could see Buckingham palace from the top!- Great experience."
"Written August 2, 2023",Commemorative Mugs Are Poor Quality,"I enjoy visiting the London Eye when I am in London and their views are lovely.However, during my latest visit in June 2023, I purchased 3 commemorative mugs. I have several generations of the mugs and these ones are simply poor quality. After just one wash, the mug is chipped and ceramic embossed design cracking.I contacted the Guest Services over a month ago and they are incredibly slow to respond. Each email has had a 5-10 day lag in between.They offered to send a new mug, which was appreciated, but can’t send to an international destination (only UK and some Europe). I opted to have one mug sent to a European address for forwarding but wanted to purchase another mug so it wasn’t a dreadfully expensive exercise. They simply have no means of any remote purchasing and can only offer a refund. We reached this point after a month or so of discussion.Terrible product, terrible customer service. Incredibly disappoints."
"Written July 22, 2022",Naked Eye of Attraction,"Based in the heart of London, South Bank, if you've never been to London, I would recommend the opportunity to see it from a different perspective. Slowly travelling up the wheel, taking over an hour to complete a 360, this iconic feature allows many to absorb and admire London today. The pods have a central seating area, so should you get tried at any stage, you are more than welcome to rest your feet before popping back up to gaze over the city once you reach the peak.Unlike many wheel go rounds and rides, this tourist attraction essentially never stops moving. As a result, visitors are advised to to hop on (and off when you leave) promptly to avoid missing your booth. The continuous rotation also means when you are securely locked in, one can experience a seamlessly smooth ride climbing up 443 feet.If you have a fear of height, I can only say depending on your anxiety, that you are safe from falling. And because you are safely locked in, I would suggest you not go if you are highly likely of a panic attack. Having that said, regardless, this is an attraction not to miss out on and you can always stay in the centre of the pod when you feel a little light headed."
"Written December 3, 2021","Pub pod @ The London Eye, absolutely amazing","I just had to come & review our experience on Sunday 28th November. We booked the pub pod experience at 3pm. We were asked to arrive 15mins beforehand & were directed inside to the bookings office to the VIP desk. On arrival we were met by 3 friendly members of staff. We were given a goody bag & asked to take a seat while we waited for the pod to come round. The staff were all so friendly & chatted to us while we waited. When it was time to go, Arnie led us to the front of the queue & after a few minutes the pod arrived. It was decorated with a Christmas theme & it looked fantastic. We were given a passion fruit martini, which was lovely. There was two of us plus another 3 people in the pod, it was great to have room to move around freely & take some amazing pics. Arnie pointed out landmarks, took pictures & really made the whole experience great for us. I cannot rave about him enough, he was fab. 😊Then we had another drink, absolut passion fruit vodka & lemonade. Again this was lovely.The whole 30 minutes was full of laughing & chatting & I dont think it could have been any better. Thank you to the whole team for a great time & especially to Arnie. We will definitely be back for more pod themes."
"Written February 21, 2020",Enjoyable,We have Merlin premium passes and pre-booked a slot for £1. We were able to use the fast pass qqueue though both queues moved quickly. Great views on a reasonably cloudy day and we all enjoyed it. Visited the 4d cinema after which was ok too. Next to Sealife and Shrek so ideal for Merlin pass holders 
"Written February 10, 2020",Well Maintained ,Not the best view in London and a bit of a tourist trap. The area around the eye is dirty and busy. The eye itself is well managed and maintained but better views can be obtained free in Parliament Hill and Royal Greenwich Park or head to Monument it St. Paul’s for good views of the city.The Eye is managed by Merlin Group and is over commercialised so expect theme park up sells of ride photos and loads of Coke branding everywhere. 
"Written February 16, 2020",Overpriced Save your Money,Where to start?? Massive queues so paid £40 each for fast track. One revolution of the London skyline over the Thames in a pod full of people!! If you want to treat your partner bring them to bar one instead for food and drinks because that’s at least reasonably priced and you get something for your money. The reason it’s even getting the 1 star is the 4D experience was entertaining 
"Written March 7, 2020",A Special Experience,"I do not like ferris wheels.  I don't do well with heights.  But this was something different.  First of all, buy your tickets ahead of time.  We ordered online for a specific time and had no problem getting onto the ride.  Each capsule is closed, with a wide bench in the middle for those who wish to sit.  There is a railing all around the inside for those who stand. The wheel movers verrrrry slowly.  it took over 40 minutes to go around.  So I didn't feel fear and actually enjoyed the scenery.  it was a clear evening and you could see all of London from the Eye.  There is a also a short film about the Eye and the places you can recognize from above.  Truly a positive experience. "
"Written January 18, 2020",An experience,I’m not going to say I loved it but that is personal preference because I’m petrified of heights and sat in the middle the whole time. My husband loved it great views our pod was not overcrowded.I’m glad I done it.
"Written October 30, 2020",Amazing views.,"Always love doing the London Eye, although if we didn't have Merlin passes I'm not sure it's as value for money as it could be. I appreciate why they've done it but I preferred it when the tablets were in the pods to tell you about the buildings etc. Still a great way to pass an hour though!"
"Written August 21, 2021",Very beautiful!,"One you get on the London eye it's beautiful, now words, just breath taking. Home, in order to enjoy such beauty I had to be in a queue time of 1 hour, and with small kids that's a bit hard. Nonetheless, it was very nice!"
"Written August 7, 2021",Wonderful experience,"Went to buy tickets for the London Eye and the greeter offered me a golden envelope with a card inside that said “Congratulations you’ve received a Wow moment. A private pod for up to six people” Wow indeed! What a wonderful prize. The staff were brilliant and treated us like VIPs as we were led to the head of the queue. The views were amazing, you hardly felt you were moving. Highly recommend the trip."
"Written August 19, 2021",Good but not great,"Second visit to the London Eye, I would only recommend this attraction of you can get discounted tickets. As it just not simply worth full ticket price.Great views and well organised, however Zero social distancing being applied. And the security checks before you get are a joke and looks ridiculous as you watch some teenagers with a mirror walk in talking to each other and then walk out talking to each other without once looking at the mirror and the cleaning crew are only marginally better 😬"
"Written October 20, 2020",Fabulous experience,"We were a bit concerned to go as the lockdown restrictions had just been eased and the London Eye hadn’t been re-open for very long. We didn’t need to worry as the staff were very professional, and the whole process went smoothly. There were 7 of us in total in our pod which made the experience really special as we could see so much without being in the way of others. Our kids loved every minute and we’re so sad when the 30 minutes was up. What a fabulous experience!"
"Written February 9, 2023",An interesting London attraction,"The building is home to the famous London Eye and offers spectacular views of the River Thames and the surrounding area. The building itself is beautiful, with its iconic architecture and stunning interiors. Inside, you can find many shops, restaurants, and attractions to explore. With its historical and cultural significance, London Eye Riverside Building is a must-see for any traveler."
"Written November 5, 2022",Very Touristy but You have to do it,"This was a great experience.  I hate ferris wheels but this was great.  It moves soooo slow that you can barely tell it is moving.  But, you get amazing views of London from this vantage point.  Also, in the general area, there are several shops and places to eat as well as people watch. "
"Written October 19, 2023",Great,I know people disagree on whether the London Eye is worth it or not. We visited with teenagers and they would very much have the experience - and they were thrilled and thereby I’m happy. Wouldn’t go there next time visiting London as it’s kind of a ‘do it once’-thing. But it was a great visit. Visited at 8PM and there were no people. Great
"Written June 10, 2022",Pub experience- keep your money.,"We paid for the VIP pub capsule trip - very expensive, but thought it would be worth it. Wrong. The VIP area to meet was a dingy little corner area, cannot be called a room or lounge, expecting to be given our first of two cocktail drinks, prior to boarding the Eye. Orders for cocktails were taken, but no drinks appeared, as we were suddenly rushed off to board. The guide/attendant rushed off into the crowds waiting beside the Eye, (must have been a few hundred people queuing to board on Standard tickets). We had to somehow follow him pushing passed the crowds of people, who obviously gave us some looks as to who are these people pushing passed us. There is no separate entrance for VIP ticket holders, just squeeze by those waiting patiently to board. With much pushing and smiling to placate people we arrived at the front of the queue to board the designated pub pod.  There were 10 of us in total who managed to keep together to reach the pod.  It was only then that we received our first drink, though it suggests you have that  before boarding. This was in plastic cups not glass!!. Then the 2nd drink quickly followed as the entire trip is only 30 minutes long. When leaving, we could not take our unfinished drinks with us ( who knows why not) but either had to down it in one or leave it behind. All in all a very, very expensive poorly organized  rip off."
"Written July 24, 2022",Never felt so unsafe!!,"My young grandson and I went on the London Eye this week and I have never felt so unsafe since COVID began. Having been 2 years ago and experienced the crowds, I wrongly expected, in the midst of a pandemic, that there would be a substantial reduction of the numbers allowed in each pod. Not so!  Even though our tickets were timed, the queue was long and no social distancing. No reduction in the numbers in each pod and despite a couple of small signs to wear a face covering, I was the only person doing so!I realise I could have refused to travel but as I was with an excited 9 year old and did not see the lack of masks until too late, we went ahead. Going into the shop to collect our photos, it was so crowded that they were asking people to leave if they weren’t picking up their photos.  We got out of there as soon as we could!Obviously money means more to this company than people’s safety and I will boycott anything they are associated with in future!Shame on you!!"
"Written August 13, 2021",Chaotic Organisation!!,Appalling queues despite booking time slot which incidentally only allows you to start queuing so you book for say 3pm and if you are lucky get on around 4pm. Incredibly unhelpful staff who were far more interested in getting peoples photos taken than assisting.We were 2 pensioners with a helper to little girls of 7 and 5 and a 1 year old in a pushchair. The ride of course was spectacular but absolutely not worth the cash or hassle to get on!!
"Written July 30, 2022",Always amaze’s me,"Went for a weekend up in London before it all went into lockdown for the corona virus and the place was empty.We had merlin passes anyway but didn’t have to use to fast track que. walked straight on with out stopping, the team were whipping everything before and after people got into a pod while also keeping numbers low in each pod.Want to go back at night and when it is a clear day, we went with it being cloudy . However, could still see a lot of London and shows everything around London in the pod"
"Written March 24, 2020",First time up high,"Three of us went on a sunny Saturday 28,28 & 4 years old. While me and my wife had been before our girl had seen the “big wheel” and wanted to go happily oblige. It’s good to see her little reactions to going round and seeing the different sites of London & the staff again really good with her given the situation with Covid. Only thing I’d say is for two adults and a child it was £87 and felt it was expensive for what it was BUT if you want to do these things obviously have to pay and so that being said her little face made it worth while.

"Written August 9, 2020",Champagne Experience,"3rd time on the eye , first for a few years and the best yet. This time we went for the VIP champagne experience with the host and also had a wheelchair user in our party. We couldn't have been better looked after with a host escorting us to the wheel so we didn't have to navigate the long queues with the wheelchair and were able to wait at boarding area for rest of group booked in same time slot as us for the Champagne experience. Staff were very helpful, friendly and patient when boarding and disembarking which they provide a ramp for to make it easier.As for the actual ride, just as amazing as ever, always new buildings to see in the ever changing London Skyline!! Enjoying a drink as we went round and having the pod host only enhanced the experience even more!!!!"
"Written February 17, 2020",Coca Cola London Eye,"Walking further up from National Theatre, we reached the London Eye, or Millennium Wheel, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of River Thames. It is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually. We saw a long queue of tourists to go up the wheel. We just walked past and took photos. "
"Written January 26, 2020",Great VIEWS,Perfect place to see all of London. Coca Cola did it right. The pods are deceiving from pictures. They actually fit upward to 20+ people in them. Line ups are quick and the entire adventure took 45-50 minutes. Kids loved it!
"Written February 21, 2020",Great views of London ,"We are visiting London for the half term break, we used the coupons off the Christmas selection boxes which allows children on free.. we absolutely loved it, first timers so wasn’t sure what to expect but we all were amazed at the views.

"Written March 17, 2022",An attraction on our London attraction itinerary,Booked on line. No long queues and got on the attraction very quickly. The pods were being cleaned and sanitised before anyone was allowed on. The pod was clean and the views for brilliant. The ride lasted around 45 mins and was worth the price. In a brilliant location and easy to get to
"Written September 12, 2021",Great Views ,"You get some great views of London from both sides of the pod you're in. Considering the amount of people that use the Eye it is quite expensive, the best thing to do is log on to 'Days out London' and get buy one get one free, which makes the trip £30 for 2 people, a lot better than £60 for 2. You also get to see the 4D show, it lasts for about 5 minutes and is well worth it. Would recommend but only 2 4 1."
"Written March 7, 2020",2 attraction ticket,"Wheelchairs are catered for and staff in ticket office were very helpful. Making our way through the roped queue system we found ourselves faced with uphill ramp to get to the pods. 2 members of staff saw us as we started up the ramp. There were some stands and rope providing 2 access routes. However neither were wide enough for the wheelchair. As my husband pushed me and the chair up the ramp I had to lean and try to move each bollard so we could get passed. The 2 staff just watched, smiling at us. Neither had any sense of moving to assist us get to the top. Once at the top my husband and bag were checked. I wasn't!! So if anyone had been watching it's clear how to get a device onto a pod. Everyone needs to be checked. Enjoyed the ride but personally was a bit underwhelmed. "
"Written March 11, 2020",Great experience!,The London Eye was a fantastic experience. We were so impressed with how well organised it was. The wait time was 10 mins from start to finish and that was in peak half term time! We had our 5 year old with us and he just loved it too. Plenty of room in the capsule to move around and get great views. My only issue is the cost of the photos. We loved our photo but The packages were so pricey.
"Written October 29, 2022",A must do!!!!,"We absolutely enjoyed the London Eye. Family of 4, 2 adults & 1 teen, 1 tween. Make sure you get there early during opening times or you'll be lined up forever! Although the line does move.There were about 15 of us in one gondola which made it easy to move around & take pics.  There's also an option to watch the Virtual Tour, we did it & found it amazing! Great memories!!"
"Written January 30, 2020",Pub pod is a must!,"After previously going on the with a standard ticket I wanted to take my guests on a slightly different experience. After the champagne experience was fully booked a member of staff suggested we tried the ""Pub Pod"". (Which we had never heard of, thought was not really advertised and hard to find) We definitely were not disappointed. In our pod was just us four and couple. Pretty much a private pod! Our Server, or in this case pub landlord, Sam made our experience one to remember. He was friendly, informative and had a good sense of humour.  We drank whiskey, payed some games, and we won some limited edition merchandise.  It was so good we wanted to do two rotations. This experience is a real must if you want an almost private pod with a few drinks and great customer service. Thank you Sam, we really felt like VIP's."
"Written March 25, 2022",Good with friends,If you are from London its a good way to see the whole city as on a good day you can see from Stratford to Heathrow. I definetly feel the more people you know you have in a capsule the better as its a more enjoyable experience. The only down side is the price of the tickets. 
"Written August 31, 2021",Kids love it,"For me, as I’ve been a few times the novelty has worn off.... after all its static, the view doesn’t change.... just time of day or weather buts it’s definitely a crowd pleaser for when it’s your first time.

"Written January 19, 2020",Lastminute.con,I have never been on the London Eye but I would like to but unfortunately today in the newspaper I noticed it is sponsored by one of the worst and dishonest travel company I have ever had the displeasure to have had dealings with. Please read about them especially on trustpilot and other travel sites. At one point they were goingvto be taken to Court by the government. How they have the nerve to sponsor anyone when they owe people millions in cancelled flights. They are a dusgracecto the travel industry.  Hence the London Eye will have to wait for me until they disappear as sponsors. Sorry but rant over. Nothing personal re tge London Eye itself.
"Written July 10, 2021",Weekend Tourists,"First stop after flight into London city. Easy to self book, quick thru security and a great ride in the view pods. A good experience and clean environment. Would visit again but take the deal on 2 or more attractions, £40 for this isn't cheap. "
"Written February 26, 2020","Good, but is it priced too high? ","Myself and my partner visited London on a mini break and decided we would go on the London Eye. It was my second time being on it so I don’t know if that made it less exciting for me or not but to me it does seem over priced for what you actually receive. You are also put into a pod with other people but I think there is an option to have an exclusive pod at a higher price.For us the cost definitely overshadowed the experience and would really only recommend if there is an option to do it at night, I think this would help with the wow factor and help justify the price, on a standard day it was lacking something for us. Staff were very helpful and pleasant, and good covid 19 protocols in place."
"Written August 15, 2023","Excellent view, but expensive","Great view and experience in the cabin- there is plenty of time to look around and take pictures.The 4D cinema 4 minute movie is also great and worth doing (quick to do).However... victim of its own success, look at the picture of the standard queue (even if part is the passing foot traffic). I couldn’t face it and we took fast track, where there was also a wait, but its okay (less than 10 min roughly when we were there). And most of all, fast track or not, its very expensive! Around 80 pounds for two for a total of 25 minutes capsule time (fast track).On balance, it’s one of those things to do as part of the London tourist trail that you can’t get elsewhere. It’s down to what you are ready to pay.."
"Written August 19, 2020",Eye got a bargain...,On my visit to Madame Tussauds I was given the opportunity to buy a reduced price ticket for the London Eye. The ticket was only £4 so was an absolute bargain. I visited during October half term. I was early for my pre-booked slot but was able to make my visit earlier. The queue wait was only about 10 minutes. Due to social distancing there were only very small groups in the capsules which meant there were lots of opportunities to take great photographs. I visited due to the bargain ticket but I do feel that there are better places to get views of London now. I particularly like the Sky Garden which is completely free. 
"Written January 3, 2020",Great view - expensive and a long queue,"One of the main attraction in London, and you should definitely view it. However, I recommend booking a slot online in advance, so you are able to skip the queue. It offers a variety of premium options, that may also be of interest. Overall it is a pleasant experience, with an amazing view. Although it states that the ride is 45 minutes is it 20-25 mins in total."
"Written November 17, 2020",a must do,"would highly recommend doing this. isn't too expensive, your on it for a decent amount of time so not too short but not so long it gets boring. can get fab pics, would deffo recommend going just before the sun sets so you get daytime and nighttime pictures. "
"Written October 4, 2020",All experience,Very good experience all in all. The pre booked ticket allows you to join the line and there were no issues with that. Staff very friendly and helpful. The queue was very long but was constantly moving so it didn’t feel like we were there very long before we were getting into the pod. The pod was rather busy and getting to the best spots to see stuff was a bit challenging at times. The adults in the party had a great time and the kids started out with enjoying it but after 25mins of looking at everything they soon burnt out. I’d advise just bringing a little toy for young kids just in case. All in all a good experience
"Written July 1, 2020",The most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom,"The London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is an observation wheel that offers amazing views of the city from above.  It is also the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom and over 3 million people visit it every year. But this time it was completely empty and the area deserted due to the coronavirus lockdown. I have to say that it is definitely worth visiting. During this unusual time, you have time to stop and enjoy the beauty of what surrounds you. Especially if you are lucky to be there when the sun is shining."
"Written August 25, 2021",Good experience but pod seemed like too many people,"The queue was extremely long, but as my sons have a nimbus card we were allowed to use the accessibility line which really helped. The staff members we met were all friendly, helpful and polite. I do think they put too many people into a pod, (but can understand why) as wasn't able to move freely round as everyone was crowded in the same area and my children couldn't always see out.  However it was a good experience and they enjoyed going so high up."
"Written July 2, 2020",Do At Least Once,"On a clear day, this is a really fun way to see London from ""up top."" Given the cost, don't bother when it's terrifically cloudy. Also try to book online even at the last minute. We booked 15 minutes before going in and skipped the ""fast track"" charge. Do buy the guide that shows you what you're looking at, otherwise, you aren't getting the full experience."
"Written September 18, 2022","Good experience, pretty pricey and overcrowded","We visited around 4.30pm. The views from the pod are amazing, it takes around 30 minutes and personally found it a little underwhelming. There were around 22/23 people in our pod, which made it difficult to get images. People kind of settled in a spot and didn't move. It was a good experience, unlikely to do it again.  "

"Written June 9, 2022",Great view!,"Very expensive, but I suppose you have to expect that these days. We didn’t feel the need to pay extra for fast track, and to be honest, the queue moved quite quickly. There weren’t many people packed in our pod, so that was nice.   Views, as you would expect are amazing, we were lucky to go on a clear day.  The photo taking is a bit of a joke really, £20 for a photo of you super imposed by the Eye is ridiculous, our own selfies were much better, if the prices were lowered they would sell a lot more and be more profitable. We didn’t see the one taken in the pod. The experience itself is worth 5 stars, but because so expensive (£36 each on the day, couldn’t pre-book as didn’t know when or if we could do it) and the ridiculous cost of the photo, I have rated as 4 stars overall.

We sat next to a nice couple from Wales and she was celebrating her birthday. We learned a lot from the guide. I think you can get good views by going to other places, like tall buildings with cafes on the upper floors, for less money."

First, I had purchased a tour that included the cruise, but even after checking the times of the last tour, I found out that the schedule had changed, thus, I missed that part of the experience.

There is a fee, a bit steep but worth the experience. This a great place to see a sunset (if you're able to get tickets), first date, selfies, and to just take it all in.

I wanted to take advantage of it's fast track perk to skip the line. VIP came in handy during my visit because the London Eye line was very long (Saturday morning). Beautiful London views paired with a glass of champagne was a awesome experience. Our VIP host was down to earth and knowledgeable.

"Written June 20, 2022",👌👌,"The views of the city from the London Eye are breathtaking, and time inside the capsule flies by as you take in the sights. The Ferris wheel's movement is nearly imperceptible, so you won't feel it if you have vertigo. Point against the photo prices: they take wonderful images of you inside the capsule, and when they charge you, a photo costs almost as much as the admission fee, which seemed a little excessive."
"Written August 15, 2020",Great veiws,"We visited here using merlin passes so I'm unsure of the entrance fee.Covid restrictions were in place, which was reassuring and didn't restrict or visit.The pods have air conditioning and seats to make them comfortable.Fantastic views of London"
"Written February 7, 2020",Must Do,Well you cant miss this icon when you are in London..Its an Observation wheel on the South Bank of River Thames and is beautifully lit at night..Crowded most of the times...The capsules are air conditioned and offer spectacular views of the great city..
"Written January 8, 2020",Big whell goes round and round,When we were in London on holiday in 1999 we actually saw the 'eye' being raised upright into position. It was now good to see the attraction in operation.However on our most recent visit to London it was a miserable cold windy day and as there was a long queue and we hadn't booked tickets in advance we couldn't go on it. Something to do the next time we are in the capital?
"Written August 21, 2021",A slightly awkward visit but later it was very memorable and interesting!,"Me and my friend arrived into London Euston Railway Station at around 10:35am. We were previously advised that this would be ok, by the company as we had a 11:45am booking for the London Eye's River Cruise, and the main London Eye Attraction at 2pm later that day. Now this bit was mostly my fault, but I need to explain some of it for the rest to make sense.Me and my friend decided to go 1 stop on the Northern line on the tube, to drop off our luggage at my friend's hotel, but her hotel had a wrong address all over the internet (It was actually in Covent Garden), so then we went to get the tube to Waterloo station, to get the Jubilee line one stop to Westminster. We somehow managed to get on a wrong train, which was heading on the bank branch. So we then had to amend our plan, and get the victoria line to green park and then get the Jubilee line.When we finally arrived at Westminster station, we then only had around 5 to 10 minutes before our 11:45am River Cruise booking. We then went to the station side of the river, where pretty much all of the other Thames cruises or boats go from, not realising that the London Eye River Cruise has its own pier, or piers. When we arrived to where we needed to be, the boat was already leaving. So yes, that bit before this sentence was pretty much all my fault.But here comes the bit that happened later. We tried to find several members of staff to help us, to see if we could either have a refund or get a later River Cruise. They kept sending us from person to person, staff to staff. We kept ending up in very long queues just to speak to someone, and me and my friend were getting quite annoyed. We were eventually sent to a customer services centre, near to where the gift shop and toilets are, and we managed to finally sort out our issue.It wasn't the best of an expierience at first, but once we went on the London Eye itself, we had a lot of fun, but before that we had some food, which was very nice from the local outlets. We saw much of London, including London Waterloo, Tower Bridge, London Bridge, the Shard, Canary Wharf, the Gherkin and the Houses of Parliament.Overall a good expierience, but on the points of the London Eye Staff, we felt that they could possibly have been a bit more sympathetic and understanding, as we were new to the area, and we hadn't been on those specific attractions for quite a long time each."
"Written August 22, 2022",Rip off,"Can I just say, I think the eye is a con. With so, so many visitors the audacity of thinking its okay to charge what they do is just unmatched. I had a voucher, one of those cereal box ones that you just have to present. No code or anything. I was told I had to have booked in advance despite the voucher stating more than once it was only valid on 'on the day' tickets. I asked if I could quickly book online now and was told no it had to be in advance. Yet I could have walked over to the machines and paid £60+ for me and my one child and got on pretty much immediately? They agreed the voucher was not good (in need of an update) but despite it not being my fault or misunderstanding they just sort of shrugged. What I ended up doing was booking a river tour down to tower Bridge (<£20) and finding a rooftop garden. Incredible views, without the queueing, rude staff and FREE. A more beautiful setting, with fresh air, similar views, no time limit and I'm glad it worked out that way but I'm still fuming that the eye is such a waste of space."
"Written December 9, 2020",Good view but it might rain,Pretty good view of London. I’d recommend buying a posh ticket so you can go and sit in a bar and have a drink beforehand and then have a glass of champagne on your way around... would be a bit boring otherwise I’d have thought
"Written August 22, 2020",Great experience ,First time visiting the London Eye and had a great experience.No queue at the minute which was great. Temperature taken before going in and lots of sanitising station around. Each pod is cleaned before you get in and face coverings must be worn. Only allowing a few people per pod at the moment which was lovely. Made for a lovely calm quiet experience.Only about a half an hour round trip so is a little costly but if you book multiple attractions at the same time it works out decent value.Very much enjoyed it. 
"Written March 25, 2022",London Eye Cupid Pod - Disappointing,"Booked the cupid-pod to propose my partner and was really looking forward to the day. I had planned a day out with my partner and had quite a few surprises for her, culminating with the proposal at the top of London Eye. I wanted to capture the moment on camera and hired a photographer for the day. Unfortunately, despite multiple requests before the event, London-Eye did not agree to allow the photographer on board to take pictures, saying the experience was designed only for ""couples"". This was disappointing, as a standard capsule carries anywhere from 20-50 people, and with the Cupid Pod you pay £500+ and an additional person to take photos would have made no difference. Most importantly, there was nothing in the experience, that would have made the presence of the photographer a problem.The whole idea behind something like this, should be to help the couple make their day special and when it comes to such events, some degree of customization goes a long way. Having said that, I respect that this is their policy and accepted that as part of the package.But then, you would expect them to have some sort of technology to help you capture those key moments. Unfortunately, they don't. There is zero tech (aka cameras) to help you take some nice shots while you make your proposal. I think they fundamentally forget that at that price point they are selling an experience, not a joyride. They said the host would help us with the pictures and videos and the host was indeed very nice and accommodating, unfortunately his camera skills were not great. He was being polite and wanted to offer us privacy so took all shots from a fair distance with ""Zoom"" and the shots didn't turn out well at all and we really couldn't capture our best moments the way we would have liked.There is so much more they can do to make the experience a little bit more memorable, but the sheer lack of creativity and flexibility was disappointing indeed. I feel, the idea behind the Cupid Pod was to make it a memorable experience for couples, but it is being sold as a premium ""ride""."
"Written October 11, 2022",Had to do it!,We purchased the skip the line tickets and the extra cost was well worth it.  We had the earliest tickets available and the line for the on site purchased tickets was already quite long.  There is a separate line for the special tickets.  Fantastic view of London from the top.  Takes about 40 minutes for the full rotation and it moves slowly as each pod is emptied and loaded.  No effort required.
"Written July 27, 2022",Don't waste your money,"I am still really annoyed about this attraction. It costs a FORTUNE, the queues are ridiculous, it's badly organised and it's boring. You see everything after the first 5 minutes, then all the kids start climbing around inside and you're ready to get off. So much money and so not worth it. The are other ways to see London."
"Written January 4, 2023",Best View of London,"A must do while in London, especially with kids (4 and 5 at the time). They loved it, although those we shared our carriage with had some unruly kids, it was still a great experience and made for some great photo opportunities. We booked a package so we also go tour Big Bus tickets with this and saved a little money. The lines were very long in early May so recommend booking tickets ahead of time if possible.  "
"Written February 20, 2020",Staff were great,"Had a voucher that required pre booking yet the website wasn’t playing ball. We decided to wait in line and see if this could be honoured at the admissions desk. Despite it being busy, Ultee at the desk was great! She explained why they were having a problem, apologised and processed our voucher tickets herself in a positive friendly manner. The experience itself was good. Great addition to a London visit. "
"Written October 15, 2020",Trip ruined by other person in bubble who refused to wear mask ,"I took a trip on The London Eye with my 7 year old grandson.  We were both excited as it was a lovely day and I hadn’t been on the Eye for some time. As the doors closed, an announcement was made asking people to ensure they were wearing masks. It was then I noticed that the woman of the other young family who joined us in the bubble was not wearing a mask. I very politely asked her if she could please put her mask on. She said she wouldn’t wear one as she had asthma and then she and her husband proceeded to shout and hurl insults at me for the duration of the ride- 40 minutes.It was a horrendous experience and completely ruined the lovely views and enjoyment of looking out over London. I was also trying to keep my grandson calm as it was frightening for him to have these people shouting the whole time - even their own young children asked their parents to stop!Afterwards I went to the box office to tell them and they kindly offered me a refund but in retrospect it was NOT a good idea to go as London Eye don’t enforce their rules adequately and if you’re concerned about being in an enclosed space with strangers not wearing masks, this isn’t the ride for you!"
"Written March 5, 2020",Such Fun and a great evening view,This was one of the most fun things that I did while traveling in London for ten days.  I took the River Thames Cruise first and was up on the eye just as it began to get dark and therefore saw daytime and nighttime views. A definite for London tourists.
"Written May 7, 2020",Fantastic views of London in good weather,"My kids loved this, one of whom is scared of heights and bridges!  I couldn't move from the central seat because I felt sick, but I get sick in pretty much anything that moves.  I'm not great with heights either but I could enjoy the views as long as I didn't go near the edge!  The queues are long, but it's a London hot spot.  Buying your tickets beforehand will be time saved."
"Written July 1, 2020",Really recommend going on a day trip to London!,"We went on a day trip to London. We had a lot of fun on this trip and I thought it was a good idea to write a review so that you all know why you should go on this trip as well. First of all, we went to quite some places and we thought that all the places were beautiful. We went to the London eye, we saw the Buckingham palace to see the change of guards, we walked over the London bridge, we visited the St Paul's Cathedral and we saw Westminster. I liked the change of guards the most, but it was quite long. The whole ceremony took about 45 minutes. It was nice but a bit long and quite busy. I thought the London Eye ride was really beautiful and it was a nice beginning of the trip, because you could see the whole city. We saw Westminster from the London eye. So, we decided not to visit it separately because it was clearly visible from the London eye. The London bridge was very pretty but there was not anything special to do. I really enjoyed visiting the St Paul’s Cathedral! It was so so pretty! Overall I thought the day trip to London was extremely interesting, educational and beautiful. It was really well organised and just amazing. I really recommend it!"
"Written January 9, 2020","Pretty cool, typical touristy attraction","You can't travel to a city like London and not do some touristy things.We were super lucky to have a clear summer day, and the views were great. Each unit has aircon and a large bench, so it didn't feel cramped. Wasn't rushed at all. Remember to stand in the photo spot when prompted at the end of the ride to get the photo of you inside. A lot of people missed it.Just an FYI, it doesn't stop. So you have to jump a little to get on and off. "
"Written September 23, 2023",Well worth doing once,"Well worth doing when the weather cooperates. We were there on a beautiful sunny  Sunday afternoon and had a great view.  It was very crowded, but they did a pretty good job of organizing the lines.  As others have mentioned, the time on your ticket is the time you are ""allowed"" to get in line.  Because it was so crowded, they were sending different time groups to separate roped off areas to queue. Ultimately that worked well. I was a little jealous of the fast track people, and it may be worth it if you're solo or maybe a couple., but it gets very expensive for a family.  I think they say they put 25 people in each pod, but we had 30.  It looked like the fast track groups had under 20.  Even with 30 people we were able to easily move around the pod and get all of the photos we wanted.We were there on an extremely hot day, and I was concerned that inside the pod would feel like an oven despite the claims of air conditioning.  Happy to say that wasn't the case.  If you stand on either side of the pod you can be in the direct AC flow, but even at the ends it was cool enough.Within my group, we had one person who is afraid of heights and another who suffers from motion sickness. I'm happy to say neither had any problems on the London Eye.  The wheel moves so slowly that motion wasn't a problem (the pods don't move freely), and no problem with the height."
"Written May 26, 2020",A bird's eye view of london,As long as you don't have a fear of heights then the Eye shouldn't be too daunting for you; once you get through the waiting line you simply jump on the moving cars and soon you rise above the whole city of London. From the top of the huge wheel you can see Big Ben and Westminster palace and other sights like the headquarters of MI6. On a clear sunny day you'll see London for miles and it's a good way to plan out your trips since you can see where everything is.
"Written May 12, 2020",Amazing view of London!,"We loved this ride, it was calming and breathtaking. The kids enjoyed the break from walking and I could get all the photos I wanted of the city. Must go and buy tickets online ahead of time to avoid the lines."
"Written July 9, 2021",Good attraction spools by poor Covid measures,"We choose a trip on the Eye in advance of the recent rising infection rates, however their website suggested good Covid measures and reduced capacity. This translated for is reality to a non socially distanced queue for more than 40 mins, where by we were put into a cabin where by a group in there preferred the selfie taking pleasures rather than masks. There were 12 in the pod which is a reduced from the normal 28 however they only chose to fill less than half of the pods meaning there were at least half of them empty. Over all the Eye is a great experience but the Covid measures in place means there is no internal monitoring  of the cabins, no mask enforcement and you have more people in the pods then there needs to be, a great experience negatively impacted by poor Covid safety measures. "
"Written March 18, 2020",Eye really liked it!,"My wife, teen son, and I found this to be a great attraction.  It was our son's idea, and our first activity of the day.  We had a skip the line ticket.  Still, all riders need to pass through security, and be careful - the Eye does not stop.  You need to step into/out of the pods while they are moving, but they move slowly.  Potential participants with mobility concerns may want to think this through ahead of time.  Once aboard, the pod is spacious, and has seating.  Many London icons are visible from the glass-in enclosure, and the Eye moves slowly enough to take pictures.  At the end, you are offered pictures of your family and souvenir items, which we chose.  We got a book about the Eye, and it included two photos, a magnet, a key chain, and other items.  Souvenir shops await you at the base, and this attraction is convenient to the Hop on Hop of Bus, which stops here."
"Written October 27, 2021",Memories for a lifetime ,"As Merlin pass holders, this was our first time and Wow! What an epic experience.We were happy that we were let on at 10.30am even though our time slot was 11am, and more than happy to be put into the fast track queue, we didn't expect that.The views were clear and it really is a memorable experience.The pods are clean, and are being cleaned for covid every time a pod is emptied.I feel there could be a few more facts around the pod, a book perhaps of what you can see or audio description would be cool.Thankfully we went early as it looked super busy towards lunch time. "
"Written February 26, 2020",Needs Commentary,"No doubt it’s iconic and I guess you kind of have to do it if you’re in London but I reckon that if you have to wait for more than 30 minutes to be able to get on the Eye, it’s not worth it. The view is great but there are better vantage points of the city, such as The Shard. The full trip around lasts just under 30 minutes. I was disappointed that there weren’t any graphics or commentary in the capsule talking about London or the buildings/landmarks you were seeing. I think that would markedly improved the experience. "
"Written June 30, 2020",Amazing views!,"We had an incredible time on the London Eye.   Our pod was not very full so we had plenty of room to move around and take pictures of all the spectacular views.  We went in the evening and seeing the city in lights was from the Eye was stunning.  The ride does one full circle and took about a half hour.  So glad we did this, well worth it!"
"Written March 8, 2020",A MUST SEE,"I've been on the london eye many times, purely because I've lived and grown up in London. Everything some of my friends from abroad come over it's always exciting to show them around d london and take them to the london attractions. The views on the london eye are splendid, especially in the evening (I recommend this) as the whole of london is lit up like a crystal ball. It's amazing "
"Written January 5, 2020",Amazing view,"The view was just amazing. There is only one tour but it is more than enough to take all the pictures yo u want. To avoid long long queues, it is better to go at opening (Before 12 preferably). Unforgettable experience !"
"Written February 23, 2020",Standard tickets are all you need ,Don’t book fast track! The queue and ticket buying process is extremely efficient and even though the queue looks long you get on very quickly with standard tickets. The experience is fabulous and views tremendous. Enjoy!
"Written January 26, 2020",Side activity,"The cabins move very slow so you will have time to get in and out, cabins are size you would expect but it is little fight over place to take pics in the cabin. The view is good, I recomend visiting at night. If you buy tickets through internet, dont forget to go to the building and watch 4D cinema. "
"Written June 13, 2023",Champagne experience ,"The london eye is terribly crowded and noisy.  Expect an hour of waiting at least in general admission. We got an entry in 15 minutes due to champagne experience ticket. (Same applies to fast track tickets). Air-conditioning in the pod switched off in a few minutes.  The views are excellent. However the staff inside does not really give you any information. They are there just to give you champagne. IMHO, there is no point in shelling 7 £ extra for a glass of champagne.  "
"Written April 20, 2023",First of the Eyes,"The London Eye was the first in a long line of Eyes, and by far the best in our history of travel. The Eye gives a marvelous view of the Palace of Westminster and the City of London, headquarters of the world's financial giants. Of course, the view over the River Thames is inspiring. The Las Vegas Eye may be more scenic, but nothing can match the beauty of London."
"Written August 12, 2022",Not impressed,If you decide to visit the London Eye I suggest you purchase the fast track ticket as the queues are horrendous. Only when your pod reached the top was there a good view of London. The top of the rock observation deck - Rockerfeller centre is much better and with panoramic photo plaques highlighting the landmarks of NY.

"Written December 20, 2022",Last minute cancellation for dubious reasons,"We booked a London Eye Champaign experience we’ll in advance of our trip from the US to London. We were very disappointed that the booking was cancelled the day before citing some sort of technical difficulty.  We were automatically offered a full refund, but we’re not offered any sort of alternative booking.  Worse yet, we could clearly see the Eye was in full operation with passengers while out and about that day.  We just wish we could have been on it.  We’re left to speculate that the reason provided for the cancellation was a poor excuse for overbooking the ride."

There doesn’t really seem to be an efficient system in place.Fantastic views and we’re glad we’ve ticked it off the bucket list."
"Written January 30, 2020",Great Visit ,"I was taken on a champagne VIP trip and thoroughly enjoyed it. We started with cocktails in the Eye Lounge, followed by an escorted trip on the Eye with more champagne. This was an expensive option but worth it for a special occasion, and you don’t get stuck in any queues!We were lucky with the weather and enjoyed splendid views over London. "
"Written August 22, 2022","fantastic views, even on a hazy day.","pre -booked a timeslot for our ride, and only a short time queueing to get on. Quick scan of the metal detector, and wait behind the barrier to be called forward for boarding. Be aware, it doesn't actually stop for getting on or off (except for wheelchair users), so check before you book. but it moves so slowly, it's no worse than stepping on or off an escalator. The views are fantastic, although you may want to get a guidebook to find out exactly what you're viewing. The ride is so smooth, and the pods so stable, you hardly feel any movement or appreciate how high you are (unless you look directly down)."
"Written February 17, 2020",The Eye in London ,The London Eye is visible as Dublin fights turn to approach the runway for Heathrow landing. On the side of the Thames it is a massive structure holding the pods in its circle. I hate heights so I have never gone around on it but my daughter tells me it amazing and her photos from The Eye were fabulous.This time when I was there you could have got straight on without a booking but advance booking is recommended.
"Written January 1, 2020",Amazing experience,"We rode the eye twice. Once at sunset and again in the dark. It is definitely worth doing in both the light and the dark, as they are two totally different experiences. Be warned, the queues are horrendous. Book a time slot in advance online, or at the ticket office on arrival, the be prepared to wait. You don’t board at your given time slot, this is only the time you are able to join the queue. Go mid week term time, or pay for the fast track to limit waiting time. Or, if your planning to visit all the attractions, get a Merlin pass instead!"
"Written January 10, 2020",love the view and it stunning just to stand by!!!,"My friend and I, spend a little extra to skip the line so we bought Champagne Package. The experience was great, we were ask to waiting in the lounge upstairs and when it's your time, the guide tour will ask to see ticket and walk you to the giant wheel of London eye on fast track lane. The view was stunning and really smooth ride. Totally worth it. "

We do not believe that is worthy to spend money for fast track. The speed was acceptable , hence we spent about 30 minutes on the air . The view was incredible even the short showers. My children were really enjoying picturing London from top. The height is long for some of us a bit scary but it’s worthy to do it"
"Written August 13, 2021",Lovely experience!,Lovely experience although it was cloudy. We had prebooked so you queue at your time slot and just present your barcode or ticket. As it's August and we have just come out of lockdown it was very crowded! Hand sanitiser available before and after  the experience. It was good to see the pods being cleaned before we got in. Aircon inside pods. Some pods were fuller than others ours had around 12 people but easy to stay apart and move around. 
"Written May 16, 2023",Not worth the time or money,"My Wife and I did the London eye. We basically did it just because we didn't know if we'd regret not having done it if we didn't .

We didn't have a very long line at all and what line we had moved quickly. I really would have not been happy  if  we had spent a long time in line and spent $100.

"Written February 2, 2020",AMAZING!,Second time on the London eye but this time at night and it didn’t disappoint. The view is incredible and even though the que was long it went down very fast. The booth was fairly full but still managed to see everything and enjoy the experience. You get your bags checked which I think is essential when visiting a tourist attraction especially in London. I was with 2 young children and they thoroughly enjoyed it too. Great experience and one I Highly recommend. To me it is a key thing to experience if you are visiting London. Definitely a highlight of my trip!
"Written August 23, 2021",Great view,So we booked for the last ride of the day and it was still super busy I would say no matter what time you booked get there about 20mins + before you come so your the front of the line .The eye is wheelchair friendly just make sure a staff member knows while in the line so they can stop the ride and put a ramp on . They still let quite a few people on a pod which can be ok if your with polite people who take it in turns to take photos etc … we weren’t and it was madness! That really spoiled it for us as there was a screaming kid who’s mother didn’t care about and was too busy taking selfie’s etc .Now the things that I was shocked about was one they don’t stop the ride when you get on or off it’s still moving so you have to be quick and the other is staff go in and quickly wipe things down ready for the next lot .The view is fantastic and definitely worth going if your in the area
"Written August 18, 2021","Great views, a little pricey.","Visited at the weekend and the queue was constantly moving. We were on the London eye within 10 minutes of joint the queue.As you join the queue to get your tickets checked, then scanned, then security scan/check and then bag scan before boarding. Despite the wheel being back at full capacity, people wore masks and kept there distance as best they could inside the capsule.The views on the wheel are great, especially on a clear day.The cost however is a little high especially when paying for a family of 4."
"Written January 5, 2020",Champagne Experience,"Would highly recommend the Champagne/VIP experience to anyone. The price difference over a standard ticket isn't that much, but you get a better experience overall. We arrived early and headed upstairs to the Eye Lounge. Staff greated us and allowed us to sit down and enjoy the bar despite being early. We had a quick drink and enjoyed the views from the window of the bustling streets. When our time arrived a member of staff gathered everyone together and guided us to the Eye. We cut out all the queues and were straight on in less than 5 minutes. Once moving the champagne trolley was opened and we were all given a glass. We also had a 360 view piece of card with all the sites on so you knew what you were looking at. Pod wasnt crammed with people so we could get nice photos and the staff onboard were knowledgable and gave us some history on London. Would recommend and visit again."
"Written January 3, 2020",New Years Eve Champagne experience ,"Outstanding experience! The entire Champagne experience is about an hour.  Spend the extra money and add the predeparture cocktail to your package it was well worth it.  If your going to London , the London Eye should be on the top of your list of things to do"
"Written February 25, 2023",You should try it !!!,"The most famous tourist attraction in London after Big Ben.The London Eye is a location that everyone should visit in UK.It's in the center of London and easy to find. Located next to Westminster's Underground station.The price of visiting it , it's between 27-30euros per person for 30mins.The staff is really helpful and kind.The view is the best part of that attraction.Definitely the best photos should be taken in there....."
"Written November 24, 2022",definitely worths a ride,"My boyfriend (now fiancé) proposed to me at the London Eye last Monday, 14th November 2022. He booked a private pod at 5:30pm. It was amazing and unforgettable! We sincerely want to thank all the London Eye team members who helped us during 5:00-6:00pm on that day.My fiancé and I met in Hong Kong and have been dating for seven years. This was our first time coming to London together and the proposal was truly surprising!  He said that without the help from the London Eye team members, the proposal wouldn't have been that successful.Your members tried their best to help my fiancé to hide the truth for bringing me to the car (until one of them said a warm ""good luck"" to us before entering the car, which made me start suspecting haha)! When we finished our ride, the team members at the ground also congratulated us cheerfully.London eye definitely worths a ride! Thank you so much again."
"Written December 19, 2020",Not COVID safe,"We were hoping to enjoy a trip on the Eye for our daughter’s birthday and having read the website we felt confident that the COVID safety measures in place would mean we were able to do it without worrying. Unfortunately, beyond the temperature check at the entrance, there seemed to be few safety measures actually taking place. Staff members were wearing masks incorrectly, telling people to take their masks off for photos and not encouraging people to put masks on or wear them appropriately. I don’t remember seeing any hand sanitising stations in the queue and although there were markings to encourage social distancing on the floor, no one appeared to use them. We were ushered into a pod with three couples (so 10 people in total), which felt like a large number of individual groups in a relatively small space where we were supposed to stay a safe distance apart. Sadly, while we would’ve loved to have been able to enjoy the trip we were too preoccupied trying to keep ourselves and the people around us safe. Definitely a one and done experience for us! "
"Written August 29, 2020","Well organised, covid friendly!","Went to the London Eye this week, two adults and four children, ages 3-11. Arrived well before our prebooked time slot and just sat and watched the Eye going round for a while. We asked if we were allowed on before our time slot as it wasn’t very busy, and they said yes. We went through security (bag search) and then went up to join a very short queue. There were hand sanitizer pumps all around, which were being used by the majority of people. Before we entered the capsule, four people quickly went in and did security checks with long handled mirrors and wiped all the handrails down.Then onto the Eye capsule with two other people, so eight of us in all in one capsule, which we felt comfortable with. Adults and over 12s had to wear masks, which is normal now!I felt really comfortable and secure on the ride, and although it was slightly cloudy on the day we went, the views were amazing, we all thoroughly enjoyed it and the 30 minutes went really quickly. We opted not to have the “official” photograph taken as we took plenty of our own.Great experience!!"
"Written March 9, 2020",Overpriced ,Great views but way overpriced.30 pounds per adult and 24 pounds for kids is way too much.15 pounds per adult and 10 pound per child is more than adequate 
"Written February 22, 2020",Awesome experience ,"Never thought I'd get onto this as I hate heights bit my ten year old convinced me to so we did. Absolutely incredible views, went on at half 5 so was perfect so seeing the sunset and the views of the London lights.. Was very spacious and there was no wobbling or anything so it didn't make me nervous about the height. It's worth it. "
"Written July 7, 2021",Ridiculously Overpriced,"Passing the Eye whilst strolling along South Bank we decided to give the Eye a go. The ticket office during the day was closed and the only way to obtain a ticket was using the booking system on-line. Adult prices were a whopping £31 each. The queue was not that long in numbers but it was slow in boarding. The ""kids"" that decided who got on board didn't seem to follow a fixed Covid friendly numbers game so some cabins had 3, some 6 but mine 12 or possibly more. Sometimes a cabin passed with no-one admitted. As for the experience - worth it if you haven't already been up the free Sky Gardens but it really hurts the wallet to pay these supercharged ticket prices. Even if they charged £10 a ticket that might be high for what you get."
"Written May 25, 2023",Skip,"Visited with a fast pass that included any time of day entrance.  While that definitely saved us time, the actual experience was not enjoyable. You are crammed in with other people and when one of them is screaming to get off as employees watch the doors close, you wonder what they are possibly thinking.  So because they ignored the screaming woman we all had to experience the London Eye while she had a full blown panic attack the entire time."
"Written August 2, 2021",Amazing service considering we were so late!!,"We had booked for the London Eye for 1.45pm, after struggling to find parking in London, we didn’t get to the Eye till around 5.15pm. We thought we’d try our luck, expecting to be turned away as we were so late. Spoke to a lady and she said that we were able to still get on! My little girls were so happy and so were we, especially as it’s so expensive. The lady reassured us, and then within 5 minutes came back with some London Eye Binoculars for the little ones. Such lovely customer service, she literally went above and beyond!"
"Written February 11, 2020",Better than expected! ,"The missus has been on about visiting the London Eye for years, so we had the opportunity and went. As we arrived, so did about 100 French kids and I nearly binned it, however, a staff member took us both aside and moved us into the fast track queue so we didn’t have to be with screaming 10 year olds which I though was a very nice thing to do. Really appreciated that gesture, so kudos to the staff. Views were better than I expected too! All in all, a decent trip and recommended. "
"Written August 16, 2022",Amazing time on the London Eye and River Cruise,"We had a lovely time on the joint London Eye/River Cruise experiences. Both were always going to be great, but what lifted it even further was the wonderfully informative and humorous commentary by Elliot on our cruise (Saturday 13th August). We thoroughly enjoyed our day."
"Written March 1, 2020",If you want views a trip to Tate Modern is better,It really isn’t worth it for the money. Better off going to Tate Modern level 10 Viewing Platform for a great view of London skyline and it’s free entry. You could couple this with a river boat ride
"Written January 7, 2020",Fantastic views,"Visited as a family of 2 adults, 9yr and 13 yr old. We got there just after 10 on a Saturday and luckily there was barely a queue. We walked past a few hours later and we couldn’t believe the queues.I think you can have up to 25 in one capsule but we had about 12 and felt that that was just about enough. The views are spectacular! What I liked was that you can sit or walk around the capsule which makes the 30 mins literally flyby.Yes it’s a bit pricy but I would definitely recommend it. I’m hoping I can persuade the family to visit again at night.The only negative was that no one informed us of the 4d experience, I only stumbled across this when looking for a toilet. "
"Written March 22, 2023",Loved the views,"We had a great time on our London Eye Champagne Experience. Arnie, the VIP concierge was super helpful in explaining what we were to expect in the capsule, helping us bypass the long line, and explaining what we were seeing throughout the beautiful city and it’s views. Those views! Cannot imagine a better place to get pictures and a 360 degree vista of London. We were in the capsule with approx 12 people and enjoyed the champagne and conversation. Arnie even gave me hints on how to take portrait photos on my iPhone and on how to edit them. I believe that all those aboard enjoyed themselves and the champagne experience. My only complaint is that we only had enough champagne for one glass per person which seems to be a company policy. Other than that, it was a wonderful experience and we highly recommend this tour."
"Written April 30, 2023",Total rip off! Not worth it at all!,Really not worth the money. A maximum of £15 might have been ok. Totally underwhelming and feel robbed!! We paid for the fast track to avoid queues but that wasn’t worth it…the standard ticket queue was only twice the length of ours. Would NOT recommend this attraction in London with all the things there are to do in London!
"Written August 12, 2022",Too Expensive  -  Closes to early,I decided to take my nephew to the London Eye on the spur of the moment as we were  already in the area.  Well blow me down with a feather the prices has sky rocketed.  After recovering we still decided to go on it only to find out when we go there it was closed.  It close at 6pm - WHY.  A beautiful sunny day and it is closed at 6pm.  This is terrible how can you have a major attraction closing at 6pm.  There where hundreds of tourist about.  This makes no sense at all.  Lastminute really needs to rethink their strategy or lack there of.  Such a waste.  On the bright side saved myself £60+.  I have in the past been on the London Eye and have enjoyed it.  The the price increase does not make it worth it anymore.
"Written January 3, 2022",Always a Treat,"We booked for sunset time on NYE. It was beautiful, a nice slow turn where you can see everything. Not the fault of the staff because they are not in the pod, but too many stupid people took off their masks immediately, putting everyone in a confined area at risk. Again, that was on them, not the London Eye. "
"Written March 8, 2022",Excellent views,"This must be the best view in London! Really good experience. Normally I am quite nervous of heights, but once in the capsules you feel very secure. Definitely worth a visit, when visiting the London sites.  "
"Written April 9, 2023",Amazing views,"Went on the eye as part of a multi ticket for a family four. It's very expensive without a deal. We had the first ride of the day at 10am. We got in the queue 9.40am and was on the ride at 10.05am. This was Saturday 8th April. As the queues were not massively busy they didn't over fill the pod with people and we had plenty of room to move around all of the pod to see views from every angle. The weather was beautiful which helps, we had clear sky's and sunshine so got to see wonderful views of london. The pod did get quite hot as the sun was shining. It moves slowly and our ride lasted around 25 minutes. It was a great experience."
"Written October 28, 2023",A wonderful view of the London skyline,"Have wanted to go on the london eye for many years but never got round to it. Visited on a sunny October day and I am so glad I did, wonderful views from the top of the wheel. The pods have plenty of room so you can move about and look at the views from both sides. The queue didn’t take long at all to board and the whole process was very smooth and efficient.An excellent experience that leaves you with a fabulous visual memory of the London skyline"
"Written June 7, 2022",Beautiful but tedious,"Yes, the views are incredible, but the ride is super long. Make sure you hit the toilet beforehand because once the ride starts, you're committed to the end. It's also a little frustrating because people cluster to the best view(s) and it's hard for you to really see anything for more than a few seconds. "
"Written October 11, 2022",Customer services just lie!,Tried to book using club card points but last minute London eye website crashes constantly. Ran them to book who then told me Tesco controlled the site which I found strange so ran Tesco who confirmed it is London eye web page and they have no control over it as it is their booking system. So I called back and was lied to again saying was tescos and they can do anything for the booking. I bet they could if I was paying full price. Since cancelled voucher and the attraction will never have my business. I hope Tesco cancel the partnership.
"Written August 28, 2021",London Eye VIP Pod,"Fancy seeing London in style? Then you must try the London Eye VIP Pod!This was my first time on the London Eye and my experience was incredible. This package enabled us to wait in the VIP lounge before boarding the London Eye. Thus, avoiding the rain and long queue!Aj was our host and he was absolutely fabulous! He made our experience extra special with his great hospitality and charm.The pod had a mini bar and was decorated beautifully. We made the most of this setting by taking lots of pictures! I would definately recommend this package.Thank you for a wonderful experience!"
"Written October 28, 2021",Great visit ….,"This visit was made super special by a particular member of staff . I hope we have his correct name, so thanks loads kishan . We were skipped towards the front of the que and had the pod to ourselves. Having done a river tour and also other sightseeing, it was nice to pick out landmarks, including ones we’d been to .  High as , great sights , nice sunny day…  highly recommend "
"Written April 7, 2020",A REALLY FUN RIDE!,This was not something we would normally do but we had our grandchild with. It was orgnized and easy to understand. Getting on to the London Eye was easy but you have to hurry! Our Tour guide Sam (or Max?) was delightful and worth the extra we paid for him. it was not like a Ferris wheel but more like riding on a cloud! It has a great view !
"Written October 29, 2020",Brilliant - but be Covid aware,This was excellent - great views and a lot of time to look across the skyline.  I was surprised that we (me and partner) were in the same pod as 2 other families - 6 adults and 5 kids in total - 3 bubbles.  The pods in front and behind us only had 1 family bubble in each.  
"Written November 11, 2022",Very rude staff spoiled the day,"Visited the London eye yesterday around 1pm. The guy checking the luggage was very rude, there were some medicine in small glass bottle which came up in the scan and the guy started shouting - what do you have in the glass bottles, don't play games with me, I know you are hiding something...Another staff came, checked our bag and said we are free to go and then when we were walking to board the London eye, they were doing gestures to each other and making fun of us saying ""oh they are medicines""Ruined the entire day"
"Written May 3, 2023","Great view, but not on a rainy day","The line moved relatively quickly which was nice as it was raining.  Which brings us to the drawback of our visit.  Because it was raining it was very hard to see out of the pod and taking good pictures was practically impossible.  Again, not recommended to visit during a holiday as we did for Easter."
"Written March 17, 2023",Great time,I had booked 2 adults tickets using the kellogs snack pack voucher where you buy one ticket and get another ticket free. I was told to bring the packaging with me when I present the tickets. Anyway when we were on the way we had some issues with the tubes and got there an hour late. Luckily we did manage to get on the London Eye which was great. We nearly didn't bother going as we got really late but glad we did. The only thing was nobody asked us about the packaging so I thought that was annoying because I brought it all the way from Manchester but i don't think its a big deal. Other than that we had a great time.
"Written April 27, 2023","1st trip to London, London Eye was fun","Very smooth operation.   Can't really see the whole city, it's basically hovering over Big Ben and Parliament.  You can see some other things like the Shard.   But it moves really really slow, about 30 minutes to get all the way around.  Lots of time to take photos.   However, be aware if you are with a group, there is an AUTO PHOTO shortly before you come in for a landing.   It's on the left side of the car, if you want to get all your folks together and be ready for this photo.  I had a large family in my pod and they were not aware of this and were upset they did not get a group photo on the pod.      BILL S, Savannah, GA, USA"
"Written June 22, 2022",Better than expected,"Sure it is a tourist trap of sorts but it does provide an excellent view of the City.In addition, the South Bank area is a lot of fun, so the walk there was great and afterwards you are close to many other things.Takes just over 20 minutes to do a cycle and felt it was worth it for the views and the curiosity of going on a big wheel!"
"Written February 15, 2020",Ideal to See All of London,"A must see while in London. Highly recommend buying tickets in advance. Seamless to get into (we entered half an hour before our selected time slot). Anticipate about 30 minutes of slow movement as the eye (Ferris wheel) turns. Was pleasantly surprised by how smooth it felt-did not feel the movement and took incredible pictures and saw the sights. Very close to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and the SeaLife Aquarium."
"Written July 29, 2022",OK.,"We had so looked forward to this visit but it was so disappointing. The woman on security , checking the bags, was abrupt and officious to the point of rudeness, and this spoiled things at the start!Then, on the ‘flight’, the Eye came to a halt when our pod was two thirds of the way to the top. There was a twenty minute delay while engineers fixed the problem.This will be our last visit to the Eye !!!!"
"Written February 16, 2020",Up up and away!!,"A must do in London! The queue moved super quickly, wouldn’t bother with the fast pass. Went around 12pm and had ticket booked for 12:30pm, they didn’t say anything so it was fine! Doesn’t feel like you’re up there that long but it’s a good half hour! The pics at the end were funny and cute if you want a keepsake. Staff were lovely, which is always great to see when dealing with largely tourists. So well done to them!!"
"Written August 8, 2020",2nd visit ,"Visited here on a recent stay in London. I unfortunately  had to use a crutch to support myself, but this was not a barrier to enjoying the experience.  Indeed, I booked standard tickets  online, but I  assume because  of needing to use a crutch, we were fast tracked at no additional cost. The covid precautions were very good and the London eye itself was very good."
"Written April 8, 2023",Ivan Van Der Westhuzien - employee of the year,Birthday treat to the London Eye today. Had a standard ticket and whilst waiting in the queue the fabulous Ivan Van Der Westhuzien greeted us took us to the fast track queue! He was vibrant and we really enjoyed chatting with him.
"Written August 10, 2020",First post Covid Trip,"We've been on the Eye 4 times and every time it has been great, This was our first visit after social distancing. The staff were superb in everything they did and our party of 6 were provided with a pod on our own. Each pod is thoroughly cleaned between rotations. Great experience. Thanks"
"Written February 20, 2020",My teenager liked it,My teenage daughter really enjoyed the ride and the views even though she is not very comfortable with the heights.Very well organized business. I would suggest to purchase tickets online so you don’t need to stay in a queue to buy them at the London eye.
"Written January 1, 2020",Well worth a visit on a clear day,"Really loved this, the views were great, the queue wasn’t too long, although it is a bit of a strange spilt queue system. The inclusive 4D was good fun too, kids would love it. I would suggest trying to plan your visit for a clear day though or it’ll be a waste of money."
"Written October 18, 2021",Extra time,"A must do for first time visitors to London.  The pods are airy and bright,  with plenty of space.  On our trip we were fortunate enough to have extra time at the top as there was a slight technical hitch.  This was calmly and promptly dealt with.   A great memory. "
"Written January 20, 2022",Great Experience,"I would highly recommend going on the London Eye, absolutely fantastic views of London. What a great experience, we booked the fast track tickets so we didn't have much of a wait time. Would definitely recommend."
"Written February 19, 2023",Never fails.,"This is a London classic. I might have visited the London Eye multiple times over the last 10 years, and can never get bored of it.Try it at evening to see the London lights. It's a breathtaking experience."
"Written July 4, 2022",Even Better than We Thought!,"London Eye was our first day ""outting"" - we were hoping to keep the kids up to stave off jet lag and had low expectations.  Boy were we wrong!  Great views, a very slow relaxing ride (even for those with motion sickness like our little guy, you would likely be fine - it goes that gently) and a great sense of place for all of London.  Truly a showcase of London at its finest.  Loved it - great for all ages.  "
"Written December 3, 2022",Great experience for kids and first visit to London,This was my third time on the eye. The first time taking my daughters. We bought the advanced entry tickets which was so worth it because our day was jam packed with other activities. I love seeing the whole city.
"Written January 27, 2020",So so ...,"Been here a few times and it's very much depending on weather what experience you have there . On a clear day you get good views ,but not many clear days I London.  Huge numbers of people everyday ,make sure you book ticket in advance   . Nothing special but more a money machine ."
"Written April 11, 2023",if you have time to spare,"a nice view of the city with a good amount of time on the ride. iconic, and generic. for all the hype, its.....a ferris wheel. and a very pricey one at that, with long lines. not to mention, there are some strangers you dont want to be locked in a box with for half an hour"
"Written December 31, 2022",It's not worth it!,The crowd ruins the experience. They left every other cubicle empty and they squeezed us in with 25 other people. It was literally ruined the experience as not everyone had space near the window. Way too expensive for a medium experience.
"Written November 2, 2020",London’s best ,Of course if you’re in London you have to visit the London eye. The views of the London eye is even better when you go on it. A clear day you will see some breathtaking views across London city. Highly recommended. 
"Written August 21, 2022",GREAT,"My husband got the London Eye for the 'Champagne Experience', for my birthday. From the moment we arrived, we just saw smiles and kindness from the staff. Dan welcomed us warmly, we went up to the lounge to have a drink, one of the staff members was a gentle girl from Bolivia, excellent service!  Our London Eye guide, Dan was very funny, kind, and cheered the group during the 30 min ride, a fantastic view, and experience with a champagne glass.  5 STARS FOR DAN!Highly recommended (August 13th)"
"Written February 23, 2020",Pre booked trip,Booked this trip prior to visiting london for my partner who wanted to go on it .I am petrified of heights and wasnt looking forward to the experience in the least .Had been to London on previous trip to go on it but couldn't when got there due to enormous size.This time as I had pre booked fast track tickets knew I was more likely to get on the ride.Well what can I say all my fears were un warranted it was amazing cant Express how much I enjoyed it.no movement in large 25 capacity pods and goes so slow dont realise you are climbing. The views are amazing. This attraction is a must I cant believe how much I enjoyed it .
"Written September 19, 2021",Pub Pod - Great host and experience,"We did the pub pod experience today. Right from the start the service was brilliant ! We were greeted by Arnie and another lovely chap at the reception and given our gift bag. We waited about 10 minutes for the pod to come round and throughout we were updated. Once in the pod Arnie was brilliant, his knowledge of London and the skyline we could see was amazing  ! He was a great host and really made the experience ! Great experience and would 100% recommend if visiting London."
"Written February 27, 2022",Great overview of `London in an attraction,Depending on the time stamp there wille be a que. but well worth it. A good overview of London from the Thames. Enough time to t are pictures of different angles of London form different heights and yourself and accompany.
"Written February 19, 2020",Amazing,Visited Sunday evening of the 16th. No we walked straight on and had an amazing ride. Kids loved it and the views accross the city were amazing.  Booked this trip as part of the five attraction  package. Great  value
"Written February 5, 2022",Great views!,A great way to see the London skyline. You can see almost every major landmark. Bought this ticket in a deal with other London attractions to get good value for money. Bags are searched by security before boarding which is reassuring also.
"Written July 20, 2022",The view is breathtaking. Also the que-it is worth to get priority!,"It is a logistic nightmare to get on board, especially if you have a simple ticket. So we quickly upgraded to priority, that saves at least 1 hour. It matters if you are with small children...The cabins are comfortable size, provide good view. The sight is breathtaking."
"Written February 13, 2022","Fabulous, Worth a visit - fun & nice views","Great experience, wonderful view, takes 30  minutes to spin around once. Great photo oportunities. Go early in the day. Suitable for groups big or small"
"Written July 15, 2022",The London circle,"From the outside this iconic landmark displays a perfect circle. A full 365 degrees (according to my wife Sienna) However upon experience I realised that I am scared of heights which made my stomach hurt. Also I’m also visually impaired so I cannot guarantee that it is a perfect circle. My question to londerners, why is it called an eye? It is a pressing question which my life depends on. Kind regards, Bernardo"
"Written September 26, 2022",Not worth it,"It was, to be blunt, rather underwhelming.  I suppose I built it up but for the cost it was definitely not worth it and I've already shared with my family and advised them not to go. Not that my 2 you gest would have gone anyway as they really don't like heights."
"Written February 24, 2020",Definitely do the champagne experience ,"Great way to see London sites from up high, but the line ups tend to be quite long. The champagne experience gets you like bypass, and a guided vip tour inside the cabin where you all get to enjoy a glass of champagne. Great experience "
"Written October 28, 2022",Nice ride,Nice little ride for the money. You can see lots! Be nice to have some commentary telling you where buildings were or what to look out for etc. but it’s fine. Queue wasn’t too bad either. Booked slots. Would he lush at sunset!
"Written February 4, 2022",A must do  experience,"London Eye Champagne pod . Hosted by Claudia was Brilliant, both in knowledge and attention to detail. This was part of our wedding anniversary and will live long in the memory.  The views are amazing , and this is a must do experience when in the capital ."
"Written January 5, 2022",Organisation could have been better,"Went to London Eye today for 11am slot. Arrived at 10.45, and was still queuing to get on at 11.15. Staff were standing around chatting, and queue was not moving at all. Experience itself was fab. The views were spectacular, helped by the lovely bright sunshine today. I’m usually scared of heights but didn’t feel afraid in this at all. "
"Written November 8, 2022","Perfect attraction, for adults and children","You have to climb at least once in your life. Tickets are around £39 per pardon but well worth it. I went in September and did not expect a long queue. Spectacular views across London. I have vertigo and it didn't scare me, it goes very slowly. I recommend it. Spacious cabins. Too bad Big Ben was under repair."
"Written November 22, 2022",Great views of the city,Great views of the city. We did it at night so was great to see London lit up. Bit pricey to go on a big wheel but it’s one of those experiences that you will remember. I would visit again during the day to see more landmarks and a different perspective.
"Written October 5, 2020",Great attraction for all ages!,"The London Eye is a fascinating place to go if you are by tourism at London City . The view from the top is amazing and you can see the Big Bang and many other interesting places from there. This is a good tour because it's attractive for all ages, adults, teenagers, kids... One thing that I think is important to say about this ride is that near the entry of the London Eye  there are some places to buy ice cream and that's really nice , but there are not other restaurants there , so you need to plan to go to another place to eat or have lunch.  However it's a fantastic place and I really wanted everybody to have an opportunity to go visit there . I went there in June 2018 with my family, and we saw the sunset, it was amazing!"
"Written March 7, 2020",Best view in London,"We went as a school group so we were able to fit 25 of us into one pod. Best views in London by far, you can see Big Ben (currently under construction), googles office, Buckingham palace, and so much more. Book your tickets a head of time for a time slot. It was not very busy in February when we visited. "
"Written February 18, 2023",Fast Track is the One,"Been on here many times before but never with Fast Track. It was so good. Tickets and Fast Track inclusive in our Merlin passes and it’s so easy. Fast Track was… Fast! We were on in less than five minutes. Obviously some people can’t afford to pay the walk up prices for Fast Track, but if you can then definitely do it. Man I said Fast Track a lot!"
"Written August 2, 2022",But is it worth it?,"I'm not sure. Our tickets said 15:15, and we go there around 15:00. It turns out that the time on the ticket is not the time to get on the Eye, it is the time to be allowed to stand on line. Got on at 16:05. The view, indeed, is spectacular. But two days later took the boat (public transport) to Greenwich, and the view from the observatory is no less impressive. An experience? Perhaps. A Must? No"
"Written May 2, 2023",Brilliant VIP experience!,"I booked the VIP champagne experience for myself and my husband and once the coronation was announced we were upgraded to the coronation capsule! We got to sit on the throne and wear the crown in the capsule while taking in breathtaking panoramic views of London. The standout was our host Arnie - he was amazing! A great sense of humour, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and a brilliant photographer. He made sure everyone was included and had brilliant memories to take away with them. I absolutely recommend this experience to anyone visiting London."
"Written March 3, 2020",Wonderful Attraction!,"Everything went smoothly. We arrived about 45 minutes earlier and were told to join the queue 30 minutes prior to our ticket time. We did so and were directed to our capsule, which had a bunch of lovely tourists whom took turns to take one another's photographs. We loved every minute. Just a bit disappointed that the Big Ben was scaffolded. The 4D cinema afterwards was an added bonus, the kids had a blast with the special effects. I highly recommend."
"Written September 26, 2020",Amazing Service,Had booked as a package deal but couldn’t book online for an extra experience at the time so we’re advised to go to customer service on the day to upgrade.Annoyingly that was not the case on arrival as fully booked ( gutted ) but the manager did arrange for a private pod at no extra cost!!! So kind and much appreciated and all the staff from start to finish were so so friendly especially  as we had a nervous passenger lol.The views were amazing and even though really high winds the pod felt safe. Only issue was the half and hour seemed like 5 minutes!!!!!!Can’t wait to return for a trip at a different time of day.Highly recommend and many thanks to all the staff - great experience- we loved it!!!!
"Written February 11, 2020",😤,"Great attraction for a family with kids.We had to give us the tickets we pre-booked for the Big Bass tour attraction and didn't give, that's why we lost an attraction.You are being photographed without your knowledge and at the exit trying to sell you expensive products."
"Written March 13, 2023",One of the best views,"The whole experience takes about 30 minutes. I viewed the city from the Shard, Skyview Garden, and the London Eye.  The due to the location, the London eye provided the best views of London's attractions."
"Written November 21, 2021",Good lockdown visit,Went over lockdown - had a really good time with a pod to our self. If there was 20 people in one I think it wouldn't be a great experience. Takes you to a good height and is great to see around the area from that perspective.
"Written September 7, 2023",london eye experience,"busines trip to london according my schedule was amazing. the view from the top of London Eye , that was something unforgettable. SKip the line is best option as fast track tickets avoid long queue. Thank you!"
"Written January 27, 2020",Truly a disappointment.,So expensive and so over-valued experience. Boring journey up and down seeing a lot of ugly buildings from the top (as they never were planned to be seen by their architectors). No particularly nice views in any direction.Truly disappointment.Impressive structure though.
"Written January 9, 2020",A must do if you're in London!,I've visited london many times but had never been on the london eye. My friend convinced me to do it and in the end I'm glad I did. The views are really good you can literally see every part of London. For someone who is not a big fan of heights it was even a really good experience for me! Even though the queues look massive they dont actually take that long to go down. Be warned though as when you get on the wheel doesn't stop each time. Definitely worth doing though! 
"Written March 13, 2020",Well worth it,This is something you should do when in London. There is plenty time to get a good look around the city when on here. Some great views. Only waited about 10-15 mins to get on and was definitely worth the wait. It’s high and noisy when windy but it’s worth the views. You will enjoy. 
"Written April 23, 2023",Average experience ,"If you are doing this you should go here on your first day and as early as possible as the lines get really long. I'd say the London eye is overrated, but that is because I had already taken photos of the landmarks while on ground. It is a great place to take photos but after a while the photos start to look repetitive. If you are tired it is a good thing to do as there is a bench in the pod where you can sit for 30 minutes. I would recommend going here, however I personally don't feel the need to go back."
"Written March 18, 2023",Arnie for the VIP experience win,"We booked the VIP experience earlier this week. Unfortunately, it was the same day as an underground strike. Because of all the traffic , we were 7 minutes late and missed our 3:30 time. When we arrived Arnie was generous enough to rebook us on the next experience at 4:30. He went with us and made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed!it was a very nice experience. We were up there for 30 minutes and saw all the major sights around while enjoying champagne. Thanks Arnie!"
"Written October 2, 2023","Excellent experience , a must do in London","Easy access, very nice experience, beautiful views.. we had a very good time, reached before time with pre booked tickets. Could access from the faster line and were allowed to enter before time which saved us a lot of time. The pace was good and the sights were spectacular. Number of people per pod was also optimum. "
"Written February 19, 2023",London eye,Went on this today and it was well worth the money. We went late in the day and was only in the que for about 10 minutes total. The views of London in the earl evening was awesome.  Plenty of room to move around the pod to take photos. Staff was very helpful and nice.  The pods were very clean and inspected after each group departed 
"Written October 3, 2023",Expense but good view,Expensive but good view of the city.  It moves so slowly you can’t tell you are moving.  We did it on the first day of our trip and it gave a nice view of the city.  I think slightly overpriced for a 25-30 min ride.
"Written August 10, 2020",Part of the landscape.,"Just has to be done if you are sight seeing in London. Que is usually massive. Would always book on line and pay for fast track to make things easier, or go later in the evenings.Beautiful views of the city."
"Written March 4, 2020",Wheely high!,"Only gave this 5 because my husband was so pleased to be here! The view was stunning to be fair 😀. The staff were very helpful to me, as I walk with two crutches. They made getting on and off easy for me.  They also clean all surfaces between parties and check under the seats for ?bombs. "
"Written January 5, 2020",Nice day to visit!,"Purchased tickets online beforehand so had a very short wait. Nice clear day so the view was brilliant. Capsule not too crowded. Nice photograph at the end in presentation book, great keepsake. Thankyou!"
"Written June 30, 2021",London Eye Pub Pod,"I treated my husband and I to the London Eye Pub Pod experience which was fantastic and well worth the money. Our host and Barman AJ was brilliant and the goody bag was a lovely gift. The views were great, I would definitely recommend this experience."
"Written September 3, 2021","Pub expert... Don't think, just do it!","The pub experience! Can't recommend enough! Right from arrival, your sat in a waiting room which feels professional and slick! Our host, AJ, who was fantastic. Lead us out and fast tracked us well in time for the pub pod arrival. Once inside, it literally felt like been stood by the bar at your local but with the best view in Britain... Absolutely stunning. Again, AJ, his bartending and general hosting were top notch. Do this! You won't regret it! 6 stars!"
"Written January 11, 2020",Experience the city in a bubble,"Very interesting concept. To be looking at the world around us. From above, in a capsule. Which is a little world of its own. People from all over the planet. All visiting London. Living without any differences. Good to do early in the day. Or late in the afternoon. As the city seems more alive under low light. Or in mid day. I have experience of all these parts of the day. As I have been on The Eye four times. And it’s not going to be my last experience of this phenomenal idea."
"Written July 19, 2021",STILL AMAZING,We've done the London Eye a number of times and it never gets boring.  London is an amazing city and looks even better from the height of the Eye itself.  Book in advance and avoid the queues.
"Written January 26, 2020",View to London upperair,"Nice views over London in the air. Queus were quite long, but it goes however smoothly. Possibility to get two kind of picture for nice memory of the visit! Recommended and one of the must sees in London IMO. "
"Written July 26, 2022",One of the highlights,We finished our London stay by booking the pub pod on the London Eye.  It was so much fun.  Not overcrowded.  A couple of fun drinks and of course a great view.  Sam was our bartender/guide and he just made sure all of us had fun.  He took pictures and made sure we had our drinks.   All the staff we met were friendly and helpful.  Although it isn't cheap it was well worth it.  Thanks so much Sam.
"Written February 14, 2020",18th birthday present,"18th birthday experience for my son who has autism, I got the Access card before travelling to London which was very useful and meant we could skip the queues.  Bought the river cruise and eye tickets together and with a carer ticket it brought the price down a bit.We all enjoyed the experience and my son can now stop nagging me to take him! We also did the cable car at Greenwhich, cheap and also a fun experience :)"
"Written November 8, 2022",Ok,"Don’t expect earth-shattering views, but was good for our 1st visit to London. And online ticketing was so easy too. The car gets quite full so expect to have to “fight” your way to a good viewing spot. For my son it was a great time to spend with his UK mates, so worth the spend."
"Written January 11, 2020",OK if you can get 2 for 1 deal,Slightly underwhelmed by this. Seemed to be a wee bit shorter of an experience than I thought it would be. Views are good - just make sure it ain't too crowed.  Wouldn't go if you have to pay full fare.
"Written March 4, 2020",Eyeing the Capital ,"We pre-booked tickets online and were a few minutes early for our time slot, but the staff were happy to let us on following security checks. The views were stunning, and the weather was kind enough to let us see for miles. This is well worth the experience. "
"Written August 1, 2023",Amazing ,"Worth every penny, feels safe and gives amazing views. Can see all across London. Staff are friendly and positive. Fast track definitely sped up our wait. Amazing experience and would recommend to all!"
"Written February 21, 2020",Five star to Staff Only,The staff are amazing on this attraction. Their support and attention to care was unbelievable.  I have a son with learning disabilities. They actually stopped the wheel to ensure my son got on safely. I will say the wheel it’s self was not so brilliant. I would be so nice if there was a speaker to explain what we are seeing. Don’t think it’s worth the money but I could not fault the staff. Thank you for caring x
"Written July 23, 2021",Glad I made it to the London Eye this time around,It was my first time on the London Eye and the views were amazing.  I opted for the Fast Track ticket but in mid-September the regular queues seemed manageable.  Each car on the London Eye allow you to walk around and see different views with bench seating in the middle.  The entire ride was probably around 30 minutes or so.
"Written October 15, 2023",Beautiful at day n lit at night ,"London eye is beautiful at day, check timings before you go there if you want to get on it.view is beautiful at night too with lights on the London eye n the Parliament House. You can view it from the Shard building as well."
"Written February 14, 2020",Champagne Was The Go,First hour in London and I did the Eye with some friends. We chose the Champagne Experience and got away from the crowds. Fast track the ticket area. A private VIP champagne lounge. And then fast tracked the boarding. Small number group allowed plenty of room to view the London skyline. Great start to the London adventure. 
"Written March 7, 2020",Great view,"Really great view, especially in December. Great family event. Recommended for anyone who likes heights or thrills. Near Southbank Market, and Southbank Wagamama. Also have a crazily high ride and buskers"
"Written April 21, 2020",Bird's Eye View,Taking in the London Eye is an excellent way to see the city. Be mindful it is not for those who can't take heights. The engineering is impressive and the ability to see everything in a 360 degree manner is superb. It travels slow enough around to take London. Well worth the wait in line!
"Written January 15, 2020",Overcame my fear - well nearly,Waited years to go on the eye. I was brave and did it. Really enjoyed it. The views were phenomenal.Access was well organised.The 4D cinema experience was a good added extra too. 
"Written April 24, 2020",Great view of London,Fantastic ride at sunset. Great view. Saw House of Parliament. Depending on the day the queue is long but worth it . Nice surrounding area for a stroll. China is nearby can reach there by foot . West end is also nearby. 
"Written April 3, 2022",Jameson’s Pub Experience,"My husband and I purchased the Pub Experience with Jameson’s. This was absolutely great! Our tour guide was called AJ, and he was fantastic. AJ really made the trip fun, informative and his cocktails were lovely! I would really recommend."
"Written August 3, 2021",Lovely views,This was a lovely way to see London. Lovely views and photo opportunities. Wouldn't visit again as once you've done it you've done it. Definitely worth a visit if never done before.
"Written February 29, 2020",Great views,"Great views over the London skyline, but only if you get a good day.  Yay but staff are efficient getting you through security and onto the pods. Small kids might get bored, and remember there are no toilets on board!!!"
"Written February 12, 2020",Great tourist attraction ,Had a fantastic time at the london eye with my 11 year old. He loved it! We did decide to pay for the que jump as we would have been waiting a long while in the cold.. but I think even if I had to wait I wouldnt have been disappointed.. great views and would reccomend to anyone visiting london!
"Written August 10, 2020",A revisit after 20 years,"Still a fantastic attraction and even better as there are no queues courtesy of an awful disease. The views were fantastic as ever and we were blessed with fantastic cleat weather. The first, the biggest and still the best."
"Written March 30, 2023",Go early in the morning to beat the crowds,A wonderful way to take London in and appreciate the views of all of London's spectacular sites. The staff is friendly and we felt very safe the whole time.  The ticket booth is across the path from the eye so don't stand in line until you have your ticket.
"Written August 22, 2022",Overall good,Albeit a little expensive was really pleased we went on this attraction.  Was quite busy even with booking in advance but that was expected during summer holidays.  Got over my fear of heights !!!   Found green screen photo was rushed and not good quality and couldn't find our photo which was taken during the ride.  
"Written February 12, 2020",Finally got to see this in person - very nice!,My wife and I spent our 10th wedding anniversary in London (first time). One of the bucket list items she wanted to do was to ride the London Eye to take in all the sights. We purchased the VIP experience package. The package included 2 free drinks before the ride as well as a fast pass to the London Eye itself - we bypassed a long line and had less than a 5 minute wait. We had our own private host (Adriana was excellent!) and there only 6 of us total in the pod. It holds up to 28 people! The ride lasted about 30 minutes and we were treated with champagne and a visual tour of the London skyline. Great time! 
"Written January 3, 2020",Amazing attraction,"I have been with my fiancee over the london eye. The staff was professional, helpful and kind.We really enjoyed the attraction and we loved the 4d experience.On the dark side the eye's windows needed a good polish( that ruined on bit of the experience).Anyway we definitively advise it to everyone who wants to have a romantic/family experience on top of london"
"Written April 6, 2023",View of London,"If you want to see the sheer mass of London, then this ride is a must. The line went fast.. Was able to get a ticked just a few yards from the Eye. Carry your binoculars! There is alot to see, but far off!."
"Written October 15, 2023",Worthwhile Wheel Ride,"We found the London Eye to be a very worthwhile endeavor during our stay in London. From above, the views are stunning, it gives you a better idea for the lay of the land, and it moves slow enough; which makes it not at all scary.  My only criticism is... I wish less people were in each pod that goes round.  Other than that, great views!!"
"Written January 30, 2020",No need to panic - it’s smooth as silk,"No need to panic - it’s smooth as silk.  Fabulous views over the north and south of the river, panoramic photo opportunities and memories you will never forget.  Excellent time of the year to go as there are no queues."
"Written February 28, 2020",Amazing views at the correct time,"I booked the tickets for my brother,  sister in law and myself again :-) The time was perfect between sunset and early evening. It was perfect experience for them. The sky was clear and the views was incredible. Lovely time with family."
"Written September 12, 2020",Sight seeing ,Would recommend to book on line as cheaper and you get time slot.Temperature check before entering. Staff were friendly. Pods are spacious and limited amount people per pod.Views are spectacular. Takes about 30 minutes to go round.After leaving pod they cleaned. Worth a visit 
"Written March 1, 2020",One of the most popular checkin points,"Takes a long time waiting in line for the tickets (booking on the web in advance is available) and the riding, but really worth it. See sunset shines the riverbank on top is a nice memory. Never miss it for first time visiting."
"Written August 7, 2021",Good views,"Pre booked a visit, as we were a group of ten, got this as a deal with a river cruise. Well worth doing as there was no waiting to purchase tickets and didn’t have to queue for long at all. Great views of London at a nice slow pace."
"Written November 4, 2022",Rather disappointing,"As someone who grew up near Disneyland, I suppose I expected more from The London Eye. Yes, I know it's slow moving, but I found myself pretty bored. Great views, but I could have been happy not going on it though my grown son liked it a lot. "
"Written March 15, 2020",Fun for the first time visitor!,"The views are terrific and we enjoyed the ride.  Maybe a bit expensive but if you're in London, you have do it at least once.  Highly recommend booking ahead and getting the flex ticket.  We avoided a VERY long line.  "
"Written October 6, 2020",Great time on the eye.,"We were given a pod to ourselves as it was so quiet, no queuing just went straight on, luckily we had great weather so amazing views across London, great for taking photos. If you want a good time to go now would be the best time. Book before you go for the best price. "
"Written February 16, 2020",Beautiful views of London,"Beautiful 30 minute round trip of the city views. However, expensive. Advised to use any buy 1 get 1 free tickets, or alternatively book Free Sky Garden tickets, its actually more impressive. "
"Written May 10, 2020",Great views of London.,"I'd agree with the other reviews in that if you have the time and are able to wait for a clear day, definitely do it. Having said that, I've also been on the London Eye on a grey day, and also at night, and it's still worth the visit. It's worth seeing London from above! :) "
"Written August 4, 2021",No waiting as we had a Fast Pass Entry.,Great time and fantastic view of London. Highly recommend this to everyone. As we had fast passes we did not have to hang around and straight onto the London eye. Even though we were an hour early this was not a problem. 
"Written October 13, 2022",Good trip,"We must have timed it just right, no queue and pretty much straight on.  Slightly cloudy but still a good trip and lots of photos taken.  Seemed to be pushing their photos but I guess they’re a brilliant money maker."
"Written August 22, 2020",Amazing views,Came down to london for 4 days with my 2 teenage girls and we did the london eye on the Thursday which happened to be  glorious sunny day. The views were spectacular and the staff have implied all government guidelines due to covid 19 you have a temperature check and must wear a face covering. Highly recommended especially on a clear day.
"Written March 30, 2023",Birthday Surprise. wonderful experience,What a fabulous day. Dennis from Iconic  whom we met in the gift shop was a wonderful kind man. As it was a birthday present he went out of his way to make sure we were looked after and spoilt. Well done to him and the rest of the staff for making this trip so memorable. Thank you
"Written September 24, 2023",Well worth it,"My family, including two teenage daughters, did this on our first day in London and loved it. Great views over the city. An opportunity to see lots of the familiar landmarks and a nice pace too. Wasn’t sure if I should splash out on this but it was well worth it. Recommended."
"Written August 29, 2023","Must do, must do in London. What a view.",We didn't have to queue for too long as pre-booked. Staff were kind and helpful. It was busy but ok. The view from the eye is pretty amazing and this is one of those must do attractions in the United Kingdom. I find the price pretty good for what it is.
"Written July 11, 2022",Great experience with brilliant views.,My friends and I did the pub experience for my 50th birthday.  We had a great time which was make extra special by Dan who really looked after us.Would certainly recommend it if your in London.The views were spectacular and there were information sheets which pointed out the landmarks.
"Written April 11, 2023",Nice ride,"I purchase the flexible fast track and was great!No huge line to wait and easy access, the employees try to make people faster and in a very amicable way.The views are great, nice place to take pictures!"
"Written July 31, 2020",Touristy but a fun must do ,It’s definitely what one would consider a tourist trap. But if you are vacationing in London I think it is a must do! The little museum for it was cute. And the views are definitely spectacular. The shard is also good for views as well. I’m a sucker for a view so both were nice 
"Written October 26, 2023",Yes it's a tourist trap but it's worth it,I was a little skeptical of this one since it seems like such a tourist trap - but it was really cool! Great views of the city and a very smooth ride. One of our party is generally scared of heights but she was fine on the Eye. We got some great photos despite the rain. I also appreciate the customer service - we had accidentally bought an extra ticket that wasn't used and they refunded it for us. Thank you!
"Written January 1, 2023",Helpful staff and an iconic attraction,"Our Christmas holiday started with visit to this iconic attraction. Even though we visited London Eye previously, it is the first time in night light. Very much enjoyed our visit. Very helpful staff at the ticket counter!"
"Written September 11, 2020",Welcome back,Excellent visit. No queues went straight on board. Due to fewer visitors we had a pod to ourselves which made the visit so special. The staff seemed genuinely pleased to be welcoming visitors back on the Eye. Sunny day so we had brilliant views.
"Written May 18, 2022",Nice view!!,First time in Westminster and we tried this outstanding wheel Today. Perfect for a tourist like me! Astonishing view of the city. Nothing else to say. A memorable experience. I would definitely recommend it!
"Written April 29, 2019",Some nice sites of London ,"From the comfort your pod you can see many great sites of London such as Buckingham palace, st James park and big Ben. Most do in you are visiting London "
"Written February 26, 2006",Take the Kids,"Okay, it's expensive. So is everything else in London. But it's really cool and the kids will love it. One revolution of the wheel took about 20 minutes (moves very slow)and the wheel never stopped, you literally hop on and off the capsule while it is moving. Each capsule can hold around 20-30 people. If you get there early about 0930 you will have no problem getting the 1000 ride. Do not prebook a specific date and time to ride this on the BA online website unless you have a very good and reliable weather forecast for London. Have a great ride and take your camera."
"Written July 17, 2011",How long did it take us?,"This was my experience, which I documented with timestamped photos: The date was Saturday July 2, 2011. I did not pre-book. I arrived at 3:08pm, got on the indoor line to buy tickets. At around 3:30, we bought a ticket which was stamped for 4:30 time. My son played in the playground for about a half hour while I took photos of the street performers around the Eye. We were allowed to enter the queue for the Eye at 4pm. We waited on line from 4pm to 5:30; we boarded the Eye around 5:30 and the ride lasted until 5:55.The whole experience from arrival to finish was 3 hours; time waiting on the outdoor line was 1.5 hours. Note that while you're waiting on line, you can leave the line for bathroom/food breaks, if there's someone to hold your spot for you. You can also let your kids play in the playground, if you have someone to watch them."
"Written May 13, 2020",Fantastic views from atop the Millennium Wheel,"Although very nice in many ways, and said by many to be an iconic symbol of London, it is sort of another Ferris Wheel. The floating capsules are beautiful and each can hold 25 riders."
"Written March 6, 2016",Not worth the bother.,"A long queue and overpriced. We had always wanted to go, so at least we can say we have been.  However, the pods were very crowded and the view was not that breath-taking."
"Written October 28, 2018",Worth Doing Once,Worth a go. Great views and a good experience. Takes a while to go around though and after a while we were waiting to finish and go and have a pint.
"Written June 25, 2005",Must do!,"On our recent trip to London, we debated over taking a trip on the London Eye. My husband thought it wasn't worth the 12.50 pounds for the half hour ride. However, the rest of our group wanted to go, so we did. It was well worth it! The views from this colossal ferris wheel are amazing. I actually thought about going again at night, so I could get the full Peter Pan ""Off to Neverland!"" effect! I would recommend going on a clear day or at night when the city is all lit up. For those who are scared:this is not a high speed thrill ride. You can hardly tell you are moving. There is no swinging action. I felt completely safe. You definitely should go! It was beautiful. Make sure you take your camera!"
"Written December 28, 2019",Expensive but it’s London. ,We opted for the fast track tickets. From arrival to embarkation was 25 mins and this was peak time at Christmas. Great views and we caught the sunset. 
"Written September 2, 2007",Breathtaking views--BUT reserve in advance!,"Once you are able to board your pod in the London eye, it is a wonderful 30-minute experience!  Amazing views of the Houses of Parliament, Thames River, St. Paul's, etc.  To make the most of the experience, we recommend that you try to minimize your time in line and in the ticketing/boarding area--very badly organized, crowded and chaotic!  Tips:  You can book tickets online up to 2 hours in advance of your ""flight.""  You need to be there at least a half hour before your flight time to pick up tickets.  The ""fast track"" ticket options avoid the lines, but are much more expensive.  A good mid-price choice we found was to choose the ""guided"" flight, where you have a staff member in your capsule who explains the sights.  It is a few more pounds per person, but you get to wait in a separate boarding area and are escorted right to boarding without waiting in the really long line forever.  The ticketing area is very confusing, crowded and loud, and the traffic flow inside is terribly planned.  If you have reserved tickets online with a credit card, we found that you can pick them up/have them printed out simply by inserting your credit card into one of the machines directly inside the doorway to the right.  No sign or person will tell you this, but if you have a ""guided"" flight, you can then go to the back entrance of the ticketing office, where there is a waiting lounge for guided flights.  The movement of the wheel is very slow, and did not bother someone in our party who was afraid of heights.  There is a bench in each pod and they are air-conditioned.  At the end of your flight, they offer to take your picture--for 10 pounds, you get a photo of your party in your pod, and a photo fridge magnet & key chain.  Yeah, touristy and like Disneyland, but unique.  Be sure to get close to the glass and spread out so you can see everyone, and smile--the guides do tell you in advance, but don't bunch up!!!Outside on the riverfront between the Eye and Waterloo station, there are many street performers on the weekend if the weather is nice, who are glad to pose for photos with people or kids.  There is also a small cafe selling drinks and snacks while you are waiting.  If you have regular flight tickets--be forewarned--this is one of the most popular attractions in London and the lines are LONG!  If you have kids in tow, just be prepared for the wait."
"Written August 16, 2005",Book the Discovery Flight! Well worth the money,"I booked a discovery flight on the BA London Eye website, which at GBP 13.50 costs one pound more than the normal ticket. The only small disadvantage of this is you have to fix the date and time (six times a day, every hour from 11.30 to 16.30) beforehand. Once you have your e-ticket, you can show up just 10-15 minutes before the flight and bypass the long queue in front of the ticket office and go to the innermost counter to get your proper ticket. Then you'll be escorted to the capsule (no queue here either) by your guide who will point out famous landmarks and give you some interesting London history. At the time we went, there were 13 people having booked this flight. Even though they can accommodate upto 15 people for a discovery flight, they devided us into two capsules. As such, in our capsule, there were our family of four, a mom and her daughter, and the guide. Towards the end of the flight, there will be two cameras to capture you from outside. Our guide instructed each family to go the each end of the capsule where the cameras would be zooming and as a result we had a wonderful photo of only our family in the capsule.I highly recommend this for a worthwhile London Eye visit, especially if you plan to go during summer or public holidays."
"Written June 26, 2005",Book an escorted visit!,"I have just visited London and the London Eye. I booked beforehand on the internet. If you book for an escorted visit (ie someone to tell you what you're looking at) it costs an extra £2.50 but is worth it because you go straight to the front of the queue, and there is a good chance that the visit will not be booked up so you will have more room in your capsule. If you choose to take your chances when you get to London, don't be put off by the size of the queue as it goes down pretty quickly!"
"Written March 24, 2005",Wonderful experience,"Really great ride. It takes 30 mins to go round slowly, so you get to see everything. The views of London are fantastic, and I'm really pleased i did it! Oh and there's a really great crepe and juice stall a 5 min walk from it outside Westminster tube!!"
"Written February 26, 2006",Breathtaking,just got back from London and the Eye was one of our fisrts stops.. it is great we had prebooked an early flight(10am) and had a capsule to ourselves so our party of five had a good view all the time..just stunning as it was a clear day. worth every penny.
"Written March 11, 2005",So good I've done it twice,"I would implore anybody going to London to do this at least once. It is better to buy tickets in advance, especially in peak season, but what I like about this is that the pods are surprisingly spacious and you have plenty of space to move around and take photos from all angles. Buy the book before you go so you know what direction to look in and what you are seeing, so are obvious; Buckinham Palace, the Gherkin, but others aren't. As they say in the song, on a clear day you can see forever and old father Thames winds and winds into the distance.  Just amazing.  I cannot recommend this highly enough."
"Written April 28, 2016",Family Trip before the Marathon,We pre-booked tickets to this attraction and changed the visit date on the day the staff were excellent and it only cost £10 to change all the tickets. It was a fantastic experience I would defiantly recommend doing this at dusk when all the buildings are light up. The views were spectacular. I would definitely recommend going at this time I personally don't think the views would be as spectacular during the daytime
"Written November 1, 2005",One of the best attractions in London,"As a born and bred Londoner, I like to take advantage of the sights and museums every now and again and I also have a lot of foreign relatives who I show around. Having been to have ridiculous amount of attractions in London, I can safely say the London Eye in one of the best things to do... as long as you have a head for heights. Those who are worried about being sick, shouldn't be. It moves v v slowly and its a gentle 30 min ride. I've been on the Eye about 4/5 times over the years and I can recommend sunset as the best time. Sunset and sunrise near the Thames is a stunning sight and London looks beautiful as all the lights come on. As long as the weather is clear, you can see the dome, Harrow on the Hill, basically parts of London from 10 miles away. The queues may look scary, but they're v fast moving and if you spend more than 30 mins max (and that's just in June-Aug peak time) I'd be v surprised. Well worth the money. Afterwards take a walk down (east directon) the river to Gabriel's Wharf for some cute boutiques, great restaurents or rent some rollerblades or a bicycle."
"Written January 4, 2020",My 9-year-old squealed with delight!,"Despite the inevitable long queue, my family loved the London Eye. The views are stunning and the service is very slick so you know that the staff are doing everything to keep things moving along. Will be back again - maybe at night next time. "

"Written April 8, 2023","Easy, smooth ride 😎","Walked by and saw no line so we got tix and hopped on. Wonderful. Half hour ride gives you the best view of town, Parliament and Big Ben.  We do this every time we go to London. A Must Do for visitors."
"Written February 27, 2023",First Stop,"This was the first stop on our trip to London and it was the best way to start.  We got a birds eye view of Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and the lovely skyline above the Thames.  The queue moved quickly and we took some amazing pictures. "
"Written September 6, 2021",Worth a visit,Visited 4th September.  Bought a joint ticket for this and madame tussauds which made the price a little kinder. This is something to go on once. It is pleasant but not something I would do twice. It is in a good place though for walks after along the river Thames or a boat ride
"Written January 9, 2020",Breath taking,"I would recommend the London eye. My friend and went early because we didn’t want to stand in the queue for London eye.The queue went really quickly.

We thought it would be nice to try the London Eye, so got american express to arrange it for us.We arrived at the London Eye, and whitin minutes we were walking in to one of the pods, and of we whent, it revolves very slowly so really get a chance to take in the views, and what views you can take in, truly amazing. What makes it seem so surreal is the silence, it is something you will never forget, views of London for miles and miles in silence.We will definitely be doing this again, as one time is not possible for you to take it all in. "
"Written August 17, 2022",Fun.,"Never had the desire on my past trips, but came with the 5th grader, so this was top of our list.  Didn't disappoint.  Our ship could have been a little less crowded, but overall stunning views.  Look for Kensington Palace was off in distance over/across river Thames.  "
"Written January 2, 2023",Looks like a tourist trap at first but riding it changed my mind,"Honestly I was skeptical at first. The opinions are pretty split with this attraction. But at the same time, I got a packaged vacation and that included timed entry to the London Eye. I guess I have no choice but to get in it.As we went up the London Eye that sunny day, the views of the Westminster and Big Ben on one side and The Shard on the other side totally blew my mind away. Wow. I regret being skeptical now. If you're a repeat visitor or a local, then I understand how it would not be recommended, but as a first-timer, this is a must-do."
"Written July 18, 2015",Book tickets online to Save time.,We enjoyed a lot. The weather was good when we visited there. Got a very nice view of London. We had booked the ticket online so we saved time there.
"Written August 25, 2012",1 word to describe it: Beautiful,"I have been on the London Eye with my family many times and have absolutely loved it! If you ever visit London you must go on the Eye, it is a great experience with absolutely fantastic views! It is a great way to admire the whole of London. NOTE: the tickets are quite expensive and there usually is a big queue, my family got it for free because we had special passes. It is deffinitely worth it. The ride is beautiful.I hope you found this review useful :)Thank you for reading. :D"
"Written July 15, 2011",What a con,"Ok, pre book, queue for a ticket, queue to get on.....for many hoursIf you have a deisre to stand in a queue with no idea as to how long then enjoy, the queue is long so you pay on top of what you have already paid to jump it, in our case an adult and 2 children paid nearly £50, why so much????"
"Written July 17, 2005",Great views,Great views up there but you need to stay at the top for a bit longer so you can absorb it all from such a height. The que can be quite long but it did move rather fast. Go up on a clear day you get to see more this way. I went up during the day but apparently a night time flight is wonderful. They have a camera towards the end where you can have a picture taken and buy it if you desire. A fantastic time. Do Not leave London without going on!
"Written July 11, 2005",Great views,"We went July/05.  I booked the ticket online and just picked them up the day of the flight.  I avoided the lineups.  I also booked the early flights, there are far less people early in the morning than later in the morning or afternoon.  We only had 7 people in our capsule, which is great because you can move about freely!"
"Written July 8, 2005",Well worth the money,"The London Eye gives a really unique view of London and is well worth the time and effort.As a previous reviewer said, dont be put off by the large queue as they sell tickets at a frantic rate and this queue soon goes down even at peak times. Also as each capsule can take up to 30 people, boarding also moves at a fair pace.The best thing about the Eye is that not only can you see a large percentage of the City but you also get a real appreciation of the history as the aerial view shows the 'rings' of development over the ages.I have done the Eye during the day and it is excellent but for me the best way to see it is at sunset.  I would recommend checking the sunset time for the day and then booking a flight that starts 15 mins before.  That way you get dusk photos on the way up, sunset at the top and night shots on the way down .. you cant beat it!  We had some excellent photos but unfortunately I dont have them digitally to add to this review."
"Written October 13, 2015",HOTEL CHOCOLAT TASTING EXPERIENCE REVIEW,"Words will not be able to express the value for money nor how truly amazing this London attraction was, but I will give it a try. Out of all the places I seen and all the tours I went on while in the capital city, this had to have been my favorite.For a mere 50₤ (that's approximately 77USD), you will receive a box of chocolates to take home with you, priority boarding, two complete revolutions on the London Eye, all the champagne you can drink (even though the online description says 2 glasses, they kept pouring us all we wanted), about 15 different types of chocolates and truffles onboard to sample, and a personal chocolatier to teach you all there is to know about chocolate.As far as the price, if you compare the costs for the different types of tickets you will see how much of a bargain this is. An online booking discount saves you anywhere from 15 to 20% on tickets depending on the tour you choose. The prices I quote are with that discount. A standard ticket costs 19₤ (about 29USD). That includes one complete revolution (1 revolution = 30 minutes) with no priority boarding. No onboard goodies either. Fast Track tickets cost 29₤ (about 43USD). Same as standard tickets, but here you get priority boarding. Champagne Experience tickets also cost 29₤ (about 43USD). Same as Fast Track tickets, but here you get 1 glass of wine to enjoy while on the ride. For 21₤ more (about 31USD), the Hotel Chocolat Tasting Experience tickets include everything in the Champagne Experience, but the chocolate experience tickets include more wine, an extra revolution (that's one hour as opposed to the regular 30 minutes), chocolates chocolates and more chocolates. Even a box of chocolates to take home! That extra cost alone covers the additional revolution if you were buying tickets separately! For the extra money you are not only getting that extra revolution, but you are getting so much more in return. Well worth the extra money! There is limited space on the specialty tickets, so try to book well in advance. Now as far as the memories you will forever be able to keep, when you arrive at the London Eye you will proceed to the Priority Desk for collection of your tickets. This building is located to the left of the general admission booth. They will give you a Hotel Chocolat goodie bag while they are printing your tickets. Then, you will wait in a private area located inside the café until your tour begins. When that time does arrive, a London Eye staff member will greet you in the café and take you on your journey. You will go around the huge lines directly up to a capsule bypassing everyone else. As you go around two complete revolutions, you will learn about chocolates, samples chocolates, enjoy some champagne, all while taking in the breathtaking London skyline. It's something you will cherish forever.In Paris, I will never forget the Eiffel Tower. Rome, the Colosseum. Budapest, the baths. But in London, it unquestionably will be the time I had on the London Eye!! I highly recommend it (even if you don't go on the chocolate tour)."
"Written July 14, 2011",Shambles!!!,"As we were visiting friends near london we decided to visit the london eye, BIG MISTAKE!  All I can say is that it was an utter shambles.  when we first arrived the queue was huge but as it was early we decided to give it a go.  30 mins later it broke down, not one of the many staff said a thing but another visitor gave us a number we could ring later in the day to see if it was up and running.We continued with our day and after ringing we returned at 3pm.  One of the staff told us it would be a 35 min wait so we were quite happy with that.  2 and a half hours later we actually got on the eye!!!!  The queuing system was a shambles and the staff who were supposed to be controlling it could not of cared less.  It really was awful and an embarassment to anyone english.  The ride itself was ok but ruined by the marathon wait.  Never again!!"
"Written January 5, 2007",Go see the view from St. Paul's instead,"We thought about seeing the London Eye in Aug.'06, but the long lines (2, in fact -- one to buy tickets; one to get on the Eye) and the high price dissuaded us. One can get a far better view of London (and a larger overall view), by going to St. Paul's Cathedral. Admission to the cathedral is about 1/4 the price. After viewing the interior and the Whispering Gallery, one can take stairs up inside the dome to 2 different exterior levels.One caveat is that one has to climb a lot of stairs, but the views are fabulous, and well worth the effort. Unlike the Eye, where one can only see a small part of London from across the Thames from Parliament, from atop St. Paul's, one can see the whole sweep of London. Being in the centre of the old City of London, one can see all of the original city, with views across the Thames to the Tate Modern and the Globe.This is a real bargain!"
"Written September 16, 2006",Buy the timed entry ticket,"The queues can be horribly long at times so be aware of that before you go.  You can purchase a ""timed"" ticket which lets you show up at a specified time and bypass the horribly long ""standard"" line.  Yes, the timed ticket is a little more expensive,  but if you have access to the internet you can buy your tickets directly from their website and save 10%. The eye is built on the banks of the Thames right at the Marriott County Hall Hotel which can be rather overpriced.  There are some good deals to be had on the weekend rates.  Savvy and budget travelers will probably want to stay in the Premier Travel Inn London County Hall...same building as the Marriott but at 1/2 the price!  hint:  there is an internet cafe directly across the street from the entrance door to the Premier Travel Inn County Hall where you can purchase your timed tickets at 10% savings."

"Written March 1, 2020",Great views of London,We have been on the London Eye a few times and always good to do during the day and also evening when you see all the lights and London by night.It never gets boring and is great to see the London skyline change every few years.Not a cheap 15 minutes but worth it.

"Written May 13, 2022",Making memories…..,My second visit and second champagne car on the eye. This time I was with my sister from Tasmania and my nephew. So 3 of us and another couple from America who were celebrating their first wedding anniversary. Which had to be celebrated by us all with champagne but also for being such enjoyable company. The reduced number in the car definitely made for a very enjoyable experience which was enhanced by our hosts Arnie and Gerda. They were very knowledgeable and also entertaining which enhanced our trip. A great experience enjoyed by all.
"Written January 1, 2022",Evening Visit to see the Christmas Lights,"I have done the eye several times, but always in the day and during warmer weather.  Wanted to see London at night. It was spectacular.  We'd book the last time of the day, but arrived early and were allowed on without any problem. Shared our pod with 4 other adults and 3 children. It was very comfortable and safe. Lovely ride as always. And beautiful views across London. "

It was amazing to have the VIP treatment and would come back and do it again. Great for celebrations and an amazing experience "
"Written August 25, 2020",Was nice in the past,Sadly with the pandemic I took friends to London to enjoy the experience which I cannot complain I've enjoyed in the past. Sadly this time the London eye was not running which is a pity as it's such a nice attraction..I do understand that due to the pandemic it's difficult to fill the cars..
"Written September 14, 2021",Good value for money!,"We did the London Eye, Sea Life Centre and Madam Tussauds as a combo ticket - excellent value for money. It all worked off if one barcode. No queuing to speak of and the staff at each venue were all helpful and friendly"
"Written March 17, 2005",Loved the Eye!,"My husband and I went to the Eye on our second day there.  We took our first trip on the tube to get there and what a neat experience it was!  We were coming from the Hyde Park area and had no idea what we were doing but learned fast.  It was fun just learning how to get there.  The Eye is amazing as it really gives you an overview of the whole London area.  It was a bit overcast that day, yet you could still see the many landmarks that London is so famous for.  Plus that, it is a good focal point.  When we were at other locations around town, we could always look for the Eye and kind of figure out where we were.  It is a must see when you are there!  I have heard it is better to buy tickets before hand, however we didn't do that.  I think it cost around $20-$25 USD and the only discounts they were giving were for seniors.  Whatever, definately worth it!  Jolly good fun!"
"Written November 4, 2004",Excellent experience,If you get chance to go on the London eye do. Don't be put off by the large boarding queue you seem to be on in no time and the whole experience is first class.

"Written April 2, 2006","Yes, a must do on your London vacation","Just came back from an 8-night vacation in London. The Eye was the very first tourist spot we hit. There are approximately 32 pods on the HUGE wheel. It takes approximately 28 minutes to go around - very slowly. The views are breathtaking. My sister, 18 month old nephew & I started right at sunset - BREATHTAKING. Yes, the fare is a little expensive, but so is all of London for vacationers from the United States. If you are not afraid of heights and want a breathtaking experience, take the ride on The British Airways London Eye."
"Written June 13, 2019","With the colorful lights in night, London Eye is incomparable","London Eye: 'London Eye' is a huge hammock located on the banks of the River Thames, whose height is 135 meters and the diameter is 120 meters. It was built at the time when the world was going to enter the 21st century in 2000 so that the new century can be welcomed with enthusiasm. Even after 12 years of entry into the 21st century, there is a lot of crowd of people wishing to take a walk on 'London Eye'  'London Eye' is like a big swing but in this, there are oval bins of transparent substances in which tourists sit  When the swing runs, the viewers are visible to go and see far away. With the colorful lights in the night, the shade of 'London Eye' becomes incomparable."
"Written February 26, 2011",Vertigo sufferers do not attempt,I decided to brave this as I really wanted to be able to say I did it with my family and didnt want to let them down . OOOOO it was awful I felt very ill although I was able to stop myself t from having a full panic attack !! The pods are a great size and if it wasnt for the seating area in the middle I probably would of attempted to jump out I was that scared ! The queue was over an hour long but I will say if it wasnt for my fear I do think it would be a very good thing to do :) The views are awesome ( so I heared people saying ) !!!
"Written May 19, 2006",No vertigo,"I had some very serious doubts about taking a 'flight' on the London Eye. The reason for this is my fear of heights. But I am glad that I did: as you are in a totaly enclosed environment you don't get ANY vertigo.I opted for a flight with a guide, that I booked via the internet: it's not very expensive and you don't need to stand in a queue (your flight time is specified on your ticket and there is a dedicated waiting room). The explanations of the guide make it a very worthwile experience."
"Written January 23, 2006",A world-class attraction.  Don't miss it.,"The Eye is a wonderful experience.  Each car on the wheel is an enclosed gondola, as in a ski lift, with a comfortable and stylish wooden bench in the center.  The cars are never too full, so you always have the choice of either sitting or moving about the car.  It takes half an hour to make the full circuit, and the views are breathtaking.I went in January, and there was no need to book ahead. We waited in line for about 15 minutes to buy a ticket, and no more than 5 minutes to board our car.  In fact, we were glad we didn't book ahead because the weather was terrible at the time we had originally planned for our flight.  We came back later on a sunny afternoon and had a wonderful experience.  At times of heavier tourist traffic it may be advisable to book ahead, but then in the warmer months it's less likely that the weather will be bad.  Use the weather forecast or whatever you can to plan your trip, but make sure not to miss the Eye."

The service was pretty good, priority boarding and chaperone for the duration. The major let down was the capsule itself. I expected it to be decorated to create a lovely romantic atmosphere, it didn't have so much as a rose in it! The capsule was the same as all the others so it appears I paid in excess of £300 for an empty capsule!"
"Written March 20, 2006",Wow!!!,"On a clear day the views were breathtaking, it was London at it's best.We went for my brother's birthday so paid extra for the ""champagne flight"", no queues, only 6 of us in the pod and alcohol to calm my nerves!! It was just over £100 for the 4 of us which initially I thought was a bit expensive but after the trip I thought it was well worth it, an experience not to be missed.Also, if it's a warm day take time to sit by the river, listen to the buskers and watch the world (and the eye) go by, it makes you realise what a fantastic city London is."

"Written October 25, 2004",The London Eye,"I chose to see The London Eye in the evening. We caught the 9.00 train from Salisbury’s Platform 4. Went through Andover, Crewkern, Basingstoke Wimbledon, and Vauxhall & Clapham Junction. We stopped at Waterloo (named after the famous battle) where Euro-Star is, & walked along South Bank to the Millennium Bridge, there was a chilly wind off the river. Saw “Damage” the pop group filming for their latest video, they were on skateboards & a group of girls had to run screaming towards them. It was quite loud, as we were standing beneath a rail line, trains going over every 10mins. Went up Fleet St where all the media like The Mirror used to be. There is a big building with pillars made of sandstone, I’m not sure if this is where the printing offices used to be. We came to Covent Garden which I was quite amazed at; I thought Covent Garden was a park like Regents or Victoria. The London Transport Museum is in Covent Garden, we watched an entertainer juggle knives over a boy who was lying down on the floor. He also did tricks with a unicycle & fire; there were quite a number of people watching him. There is a merry-go-round at Covent Garden & lots of little shops, & a restaurant; there is also a enclosed roof so it’s good for when it rains. We stopped off at Starbucks café on the way to the Eye; you can have a free mint with your drink or a mince pie & drink for £1.25. There’s always a queue to get on the Eye, they test your baggage before you get on lest you try & blow it up. Once on the light’s dim so you can see the whole of London under nightfall, there is a wood slatted seat in the centre to sit on if you get tired. The cars move really slowly & stop to let wheelchairs on & off. Saw The Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, Post Office Tower all lit up, you can also see where the river bends round the corners. When we got off we walked through an avenue of trees lit up with blue lights, The Eye is a truly must to see; lets hope the government don’t decide to pull it down."
"Written March 19, 2022",Captivating views,"You really can’t beat the views available once you get to the top the views all around are amazing from Horseguards Parade & Buckingham Palace to Battersea, we were so lucky as the weather was incredible with bright blue skies, the pods weren’t crammed with tourists, handrails had a quick wipe between guests, my only reservation was the cost I felt it was expensive for the 30minute jaunt at £33.50 & £25 would be more realistic, anyway I’ve done it now & so pleased I did for the memories, images & birds eye view we got, 10/10."

These provided a reference for points of interest. You can even choose a night mode if required. These were great and my eldest enjoyed spotting the many places.  My son just wanted to play on them but did keep him entertained. The experience is about 30 mins and the capsule isnt overly crammed with people so its comfortable.  Price is expensive so i would consider the passes as these last a year and include lots of venues throughout the uk. We also visited the Sea Life, Tussauds and the Dungeons are also near the eye if you wish to visit. The Shrek attraction will be open in the summer with entry included for premium pass holders from Sept 3015. Use the waterloo station as only 300 yards from the London Eye. "
"Written February 20, 2005",A must visit spot,Just visited the London eye. It's a great place to start your London holiday. Yes there lines seem to be super long but it is actually a fast line considering the number of people. I spent about 25 minutes and it's a great place to hear different accents going on all around you. The wheel takes about 25 minutes to go all around where you get a great view of the capital. Well worth the price and time spent. Give it a chance.
"Written September 5, 2003",Not a good thing for London,"It certainly does not do London a favor. It lets you see all the architecture, good and bad, and what a mess it has become. St. Pauls is now only a small spot and you really have to look to find it. I believe the building code has gotten out of hand. But then, you say, where do you put all the businesses? They could live without so many. The Londoners that we talked to do not like the ""Eye"" either. It looks out of place, but since it is making money off the tourists, I suppose it will stay."
"Written January 21, 2006",Good thing to do,"I booked my flight before I left for England. I had heard from friends that doing it at night was awesome. So I went with that. When I went on a Monday evening in January it was pretty empty. My capsule was just me and a couple. Anyway at 6PM the views of the city all lit up were amazing. I would do this it doesn't take much time 30 minutes plus some waiting if it's busy and it's not too expensive, only about 12 pounds. I would pass on the panoramic guidebook though as it's pretty useless. It costs 3 pounds and you can pick out the buildings that it tells you about."
"Written August 14, 2005",Bargain prices this time of year,"At the moment, a certain website that contains the words last and minute are doing a great deal.  Yesterday, I went on the London Eye and also the London Eye Riverboat Cruise for a grand sum of just over £11.  The cruise is 40mins and comfortable and interesting.  Really don't think I need to comment on the London Eye!  Book it ASAP!"
"Written September 20, 2003",Birds Eye View,"The only disappointing thing about this ""Wheel of London"" or ""London Wheel"" as it used to be called and is now known as ""The London Eye"" is that it truly does not seem to fit with the scenery around it. But then again, neither do any of the modern buildings that have replaced some of the more beautful classical ones. The wheel at least does have a history here and has been around in some shape or form for over 100 years. It is a part of the city's history and it has an incredible view of the city from it. You can see all the historical landmarks from one central location. Some of the best pictures you will be able to take of the city will be from your 40 minute turn around the wheel. It's definitely well worth it and I would recommend it to anyone who is visiting London."
"Written October 17, 2021",Saddly no champagne,"We were set on the champagne experience, however when we walked up to the Visitor Center at 11 AM on a weekday to buy tickets from the terminal there, it appeared that the only time slots at 3 and 4 PM  were all filled up. We bought standard tickets, still pricey, and waited in slow moving line for about 30 minutes. Before you board your pod, the crew checks it for any gross dirt or objects left behind, sweeps if necessary, but they do not spray or wipe anything. We had about 10 people in our pod, some were sitting on the bench in the center, most were standing and admiring the view for 30 minutes. We were lucky to have a clear day so it was exciting to see the Buckingham Palace and such from the Eye. Restrooms are available at the Visitor Center and Fish and Chips restaurant is nearby."

We managed a fast track which enabled us to fit more into our day with not having to queue.The staff really are full of enthusiasm and very friendly.This was quite possibly my favourite part of the day.The pod was not over filled, giving everyone an opportunity to get great pictures in all directions.We were lucky enough to experience a rainbow in the distance as shown in my pictures.The weather wasn’t the best but the lighting was great for some dramatic shots.It’s my third time on the London Eye but this was the best for pictures.I’m sure I will be visiting again."
"Written July 10, 2018","expensive, touristy, but definitely worthwhile","We have been to London several times And tend to avoid the commercial sites. However we did make an effort to go to the London eye and it was very worthwhile. The view cannot be seen this anywhere  else in London. Experience is lot of fun. And it is a great way to start your trip To London. You can orient yourself to the city With a very unique view.  Is something everyone should experience once.   We were there in June  and the line was short!,"
"Written May 19, 2018",Great Views,Always wanted to have a trip on the London Eye. Had a two for one deal in conjunction with our train ticket so did not work out too expensive. Great views across London with new iconic buildings filling the skyline. The wheels travels at a leisurely pace so plenty of time for photo opportunities. You only need to do this once. 
"Written March 7, 2018",Execellent!,By any means you ca not miss Londoneye when you visite London! The best is to let you inform by tripadvisor and the voucher from tpad is more cheaper through viator than to buy it on place.
"Written January 1, 2018",An ariel view of London City,London Eye is a must try experience. Fast track ticket will save your time from queuing. Try to stand on the designated areas to get your photos taken toward the end of the circle. There are two cameras on both sides but only the one next to the door was working during our visit. So stay there and remember to smile.
"Written July 31, 2010",London eye - a nightmare trip for parents of young children !!,"We visited the London eye today, we've been before so thought we knew what to expect, only this time we had a young baby with us in a buggy. What a horrible experience due to poor management and more than one staff member with an attitude problem. The issue, you are made to dismantle or fold your pram before entering the line (or you can leave the long queue and leave all your baby bags and pram with customer service we were told rudely). So with an 8 year-old, and carrying one baby, we tried to lug 3 bags,  and drag one folded buggy in a 30  minute queue. I gave up after 15 minutes and put my baby back in his buggy, only to spoken to rudely by the same member of staff. I asked her to consider the safety of me leaving all these bags and buggy on the floor of the pod plus me having to juggle an active baby, she just looked at me blankly. Needless to say once in the pod I put the buggy up again and there was plenty of room for fellow passengers as my bags were all stored in one place. I was not the only irate parent in the queue that day as new born babies had to be woken and had to be held for the queue duration. The staff attitude was far from sympathetic and very impersonal. Management of the the London Eye need to change the rule, one pram can easily fit in a pod or at the very least let people stand in the queue and fold the pram as they get to the top of the queue."
"Written December 14, 2019",Londra🇬🇧,Wonderful and magic the city of London. Walking in Westminster area suddenly you could appreciate the London Eye. 
"Written June 10, 2008","Great experience, totally worth it","I've lived in London for two years now and frankly speaking, the idea of spending 30 minutes on a giant Ferris wheel somehow didn't appeal to me at all (I also have a fear of heights). Was dragged along by some visiting relatives (yes, I did thank them for it afterwards). We'd gone on a weekend in April, a little before dusk. Fortunately, there was almost no queue, so we got on quick fast. I must say that being in a pod that moves so slowly is quite nice and I wasn't uncomfortable despite the height. The views of the city are simply breath-taking and by the time the ""flight"" was over, the city lights were being switched on, which was an added bonus - a very memorable experience.On the whole, TOTALLY WORTH IT."
"Written March 27, 2005",A definite must,"I had very little time in London -- was on an 18 hour layover en route to New York and had pre-booked a flight on the London Eye. Keep in mind, you should book online at the London Eye's web site, which will save you both money and time standing in line. Before boarding, invest the three pounds in the small oval shape guidebook which explains what you will see during your time on the Eye. I spent about 30 minutes waiting in line to board for a 30 minute flight on the Eye; definitely worth it and would do it again for a night time flight."
"Written November 2, 2018",Great eye-catching views from the peak,"There are many large rotating upright Ferris wheels, and to my surprise, they keep making them. They are becoming more hi-tech in their features, and I guess this is what draws people. At 443 feet in height, the London Eye ranks fourth tallest in the world. At present, the 550-foot tall High Roller Ferris wheel, Las Vegas, is the world’s tallest. Second largest is the Singapore Flyer at 541 feet, and third, the Star of Nanchang at 525 feet. When I first saw it under construction, and when it first opened, this Ferris wheel was called the Millennium Wheel. This time I just passed by. On two previous trips, I went around it one of its 32 capsules, which each hold up to 25 passengers. A single round trip, i.e., one rotation, takes about 30 minutes. It averages carrying about 10,000 passengers per day, and thus, is one of London’s top tourist attractions."
"Written December 9, 2002",Important Fact,"Riding the eye gives you a scenic view of London.  Parliament and Big Ben in particular.  It takes approximately 1/2 an hour to complete the rotation.  Very Important Fact!:  When they tell you to go to either side of your cubicle to take your picture...make sure you FACE OUT...there is NO camera ""in"" the cubicle.  Face the side where you will soon pass a sprial staircase. This is where the camera is.  We found this out the hardway, when after smiling at nothing for a minute...the camera went off 2 minutes later and took a picture of our backsides  :)Also..we went at night before closing. No lines!!!!  Great View!!!  Enjoy!!"
"Written April 4, 2018",No refunds!!!,"Our flight was canceled due to a snowstorm so we weren't able to fly out until the next day.  We had bought this ticket ahead of time for our first day in London but we arrived a day late due to the storm so we were unable to make it.  Since we knew we weren't going to make it, we called trip advisor and asked if we could change the date.  They said no and that all sales are final.  I'd understand if we were trying to cancel it but we only wanted to move it to two days later, they would still be getting their money. And it wasn't our fault our flight was canceled. We ended up just buying a ticket when we were there because it was still something we wanted to do.  However, do not buy this voucher if you aren't positive you will be able to make it because you will lose your money!!!"
"Written May 1, 2012",The 4D Experience was very good!,"We booked online, but had to collect our tickets. To collect our tickets there was about a 30 - 40 minute queue.  But we also got free entry into their 4D experience!  This was a fantastic little presentation showing the eye and London and just made me really appreciate where I was. We were curious as to why it was 4D? We of course expected the 3D glasses and things to pop out at you!  Well, I won't spoil the surprise of why its called 4D, but it was really awesome :)The trip up the eye itself was pretty good. About 20 minutes wait to jump into one of the pods.  There is a quick bag search before you get on. Then you just quickly get on it. I was expecting a bit more narration whilst inside the pod. But infact there really wasn't any.  There are some terminals you can use to have a look at what the sights are that you are seeing. But other than that, its pretty much up to yourself to just look out and enjoy.It was really nice to see that they don't stuff the pods too. These pods are big, and there was plenty of opportunity to walk around, take a seat without feeling like there was too many people in there. The views, as expected are pretty spectacular looking all over London. Gives you a better feeling of the geometry of the place. Looking at Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and Waterloo at the same time is not something you feel like you can do, when you explore london via the underground!"

"Written October 2, 2017","Nice, relaxing way to view London from above","Great way to view London from above. The wheel takes about 30 minutes to fully complete a revolution, and moves so slowly and smoothly that it is hard to tell it is moving. Great photo opportunities. Too bad the Thames river is such an ugly brown color, though!!"
"Written August 1, 2016",Eye hope to go back...when it's sunny!,"As a family of 4 we visited London and had pre-booked the London Eye and River Cruise package (£28 per person), just a pity we couldn't pre-book good weather...it was pouring with rain!London Eye: Queue times weren't too bad at around 15 minutes. On a clear day I can imagine the views across London being spectacular, but alas, the rain prevented us from getting the best from this experience. Touch screens within each pod so you can identify landmarks.River Cruise: Due to the bad weather we decided to give it a miss and went to see Shreks Adventure instead.Pros: spectacular views (I'd imagine).Cons: useless if it's a wet day."

"Written June 10, 2012",Afternoon Tea Package,"We booked an Afternoon Tea Package/Private Capsule, for my disabled brothers birthday.  As we had booked this same event before when the London Eye belonged to British Airways, we knew that it was expensive, but my brother really enjoyed it the last time. Unfortunately, this cannot be said of todays experience (10/6/12).  We paid for a minimum of 20 people to be served the Afternoon Tea Experience, as this was the minimum amount of people that you could book for.  There were 14 guests in our group.  We were supplied with one very small tray of mini finger rolls and one very small tray of bitesize wraps.  Tea and coffee was supplied and fruit juices.  Then it was followed by bitesize cakes.  Everyone complained that they were hungry and the food was not suitable for everyone as there was little or no choice.  The 2 bottles of champagne cost us just under £100.00 and tasted terrible. This experience cost us £962.00 in total.  I think that the London Eye needs either new management or needs a complete overall in its Afternoon Tea Department.  They would have done better to have supplied a more traditional range of sandwiches and cakes with some crisps etc.  Not an experience that I am ever likely to repeat again with EDF in charge."
"Written August 31, 2011",Splurge on the Champagne Experience!!,"Upon arriving at the ticket center, I was presented with the ticket for my London Eye Champagne Experience and was told to be back 15 mins before my scheduled flight at the waiting area. During the spare time, I visited the 4D experience that was free of charge but thought it's sort of a waste of time and you get kinda 'wet' from it. While I waited at the designated area, I noted that there were more than 20 people waiting and was wondering if all of us would be sharing one cabin. When our host arrived, it was announced that as there were more than 20 of us, we would be split into two cabins...which means there were less than 15 in each cabin. As opposed to the regular flight I think I saw more people crammed into one cabin and the queue for people holding the normal tickets were quite long as well. The view from the London Eye was spectacular and the champagne experience was very well worth it as you didn't have to waste valuable time in a queue and you had more space in the cabin thus easier to take pics too! Champagne was served chilled. Perfect."
"Written April 23, 2011",A fine farewell to a great city,"My teenage daughter and I met up with friends in London, and after a day of sightseeing and a sumptuous lunch, our friends treated us to a night ride on the London Eye.  I had been reluctant to go on this--just the thought of a Ferris wheel makes me whimper, but I sacked up for my daughter's sake (and to preserve my own dignity) and how glad I am that I did.The wait on the Friday night was perhaps five minutes-- which left me NO time to change my mind!--and the staff were wonderful.  Our pod contained our party of five and perhaps ten other people, which gave us a lot of room to move around.  Thankfully, even if everyone in the pod had stood on one side, it would not have budged.It was a brilliant way to see London by night and I am very, very glad we did so."
"Written February 11, 2011",Expensive but good views,"I went on the London Eye for the first time in several years and again enjoyed myself. I remember it being expensive before and it still was, but I think it was still worth it. The new 3D film at the start was good and definitely an enhancement to the attraction."
"Written April 30, 2008",A Tourist Trap,"We just paid $240 US to take our family of four aboard the Eye.  Though we were shocked at the cost, we swallowed hard and paid up, since we had already promised the kids that we'd go.  We stood in line 15 minutes to get the tickets, then were given a time about an hour later to get back in line, where we waited another 45 minutes, so our total wait was about 2 hours.  The experience itself lasted 25 minutes, and while the view was nice, I must say, it simply wasn't worth the cost.  You can get great views and pictures right from the bridges along the Thames.  If you want something fun to go with your kids, take them on one of the tour boats along the river instead, and then treat yourselves to dinner for the difference in cost."
"Written July 31, 2007",London Eye + River Cruise,"I've been on the London Eye twice now and in my opinion it's a fairly overpriced, overrated experience.I visited the London Eye in July 07 and had booked tickets through a 3rd party website.  I had booked a river cruise + a trip on the London Eye.The First Queue - I had to wait in line in the ticket office to transfer my reservation code for the river cruise and london eye tickets. This line took about 20 mins with only 1 person serving. The River Cruise - The dock for the river cruise is located directly outside the ticket office.  We waited behind a gate until the boat arrived promptly and we all got onboard.  You can sit upstairs on the open top are of the boat or downstairs under cover.  It takes you down the Thames and various attractions are pointed out to the passengers throughout.  It was fairly enjoyable but cold if you are sitting up top so dress up warm.The Eye Queue - We got off the boat and joined the queue for the London Eye and waited around 20 mins before getting on board.  The Eye - I think each pod holds about 15 - 20 people.  It goes very slowly and takes around half an hour.  It all feels very secure and it was fine for my friend who is scared of heights.  For me the views are pretty boring, it's just a big dirty grey city you are looking down on.  I think it would be prettier to go on it at night for the lights or around sunset.To be honest if you want to see London I'd advise taking a bus tour or working out a route and walking around or use your daily travel card to go round all the attractions on busses or via tube for much cheaper.  You'll also see alot more and feel like you've experienced more.  The only reason I made a second trip to the Eye was because my friend wanted on it but even he was pretty bored."
"Written May 28, 2018",Great Tourist Day Out,"I went with my mum for her birthday. We have been in London for almost 20 years but it was still a great day. Our tour guide, Cathrine/Kathleen was particularly entertaining and made it a great 40-minute cruise. Perfect for a tourist day out, whether you are visiting London, or whether you just want a nice and relaxing day out in the sun. The prices were more than reasonable. We got combined tickets for the London Eye and the River Cruise, which came to around £30 each. There were also great deals if you wanted to add a third attraction.Well worth the price."
"Written April 29, 2018",Disappointing,"We got crammed with what seemed with 100+ school kids who took up two seats per child, so not very well managed.  We did mention it to a staff member, who just seemed to shrug his shoulder.  With it drizzling, our family of four could not sit together, and not allowed to stand for safety reasons, so were forced to sit out on the upstairs deck and go very wet.   Most disappointing tour of London, and expensive cost not no good memory in the end.  The host on the microphone was very good though."

"Written October 22, 2014",So disappointing,"I had booked a chocolate tasting experience on the London Eye for my husbands birthday and paid directly over the internet.  Unfortunately when we arrived we were told there was a technical fault and the London Eye would be shut for the foreseeable future. We had our money refunded, which was great, however, as we had travelled to London especially for the trip on the London Eye we were very disappointed. We were informed that we could not claim anything back for the money spent travelling to London, nor were we entitled to any sort of compensation. Not even  10% off a future booking or even a cup of tea in the cafe!!!!!!I have exchanged 3 e mails with the customer relations team and have been told in no uncertain terms that they will do nothing to encourage me to re book the experience. I'm left feeling that they are simply a money grabbing company, who care very little about their customers. Would it really be so difficult to give a goodwill gesture following a huge disappointment?? Be warned - if the eye is closed and you've pre booked, you will be treated appallingly by the staff. Don't waste your money - go somewhere else instead. The company which runs the London Eye just doesn't care."
"Written July 17, 2011",Breath-taking!  This is one thing one must do when visiting London!,"This is like the ferris wheel for grown-ups, except you will feel like a kid all over again!  You will have amazing views all around.  A 360deg map is provided which points out all the main points of interests, which is kind of cool how they did that.  Don't let the long line up discourage, it goes fairly quickly.  Tip: there is a camera at one point of the ride that takes a photo of the pod, if you or your party are standing at that particular window you can have your photo taken and be able to purchase it at the end as a souvenir.

You see plenty from the river that you would not easily see otherwise.The London Eye ticket is discounted by 10% if you book for both & you get priority access to boarding The Eye which can save a very long wait. You can choose to go on either attraction first.Note:- Take a street map with you into the Eye as you will be able to identify far more & there is more to see if you stand on the far side of the pod as you enter.
"Written March 22, 2011",Great view. River cruise excellent.,Did the combined London Eye and Thames river cruise. Cruise the hightlight with 45 mins on the water from the Palace of Westminister to under Tower Bridge and back. Excellent commentary with good mix of information and humour.The views from the eye were excellent especially as was about sunset. Queues relatively short and the bubbles not over full. Could do with reducing the cold air flow into them though.The 4D experience done afterwards although short is very good and woudl recommend staying around for it.
"Written June 15, 2010",Overpriced and overrated,"I have been to London about a dozen times but had not done the London Eye. I was there last month and decided to give it a go.  What a waste of time and money!The ride only lasts about 25 minutes, and you are only at the top for a few minutes. The rest of the time is spent ascending and descending  when the view is not nearly as  impressive. You have to wait in two lines--one to purchase the tickets and one to get on the ride. You can pay extra for a fast-track ticket, but I'm glad I didn't do that. Be sure to view the 4D movie beforehand, though. I liked it better than the ride itself.Despite these complaints, I am going to reluctantly recommend it. Why? Because it's one of those touristy things that most people enjoy, particularly if they are first-time visitors. As for me, I wish I had simply taken another boat ride down the Thames."
"Written August 25, 2007",Worth it,"This is probably one of the most memorable things I've ever done. On my first trip to London, I was a poor college student alone and looking to soak up the city. The Eye was one of two things I paid to do while in London - all the other touristy stuff I was content to just get a picture of :) It was well worth it! I admit it was pretty pricy, but there is no other way like it that you can see London! I recommend this attraction to everyone I know who's visiting London, and I am making my parents do it with me when we visit this winter. My mom is worried about the heights, but once you're up there, it's not so bad. It moves so slowly too that you almost forget you're moving. This time I will be buying tickets in advance though - those lines are awful!"
"Written August 23, 2007",not worth it,"Although the potential is there to get a great view of London, paying for four ""fast pass"" tickets is not the best way to spend 100 pounds.  There are so many stellar attractions to visit, the London Eye could be passed over without ever being missed and you could spend to 100 pounds on a kick butt meal or a show or entry to a plethera of fabulous sites that you only view from afar atop the eye.  The ""ride"" lasted about 40 minutes, the kids (age 9&10) took about 10 mins to pick out all the interesting sites, the fast passes were way too expensive, although we did get a ""guide"" each and the kids got snazy plastic totes."

After seeing the crowds pushing in to buy tickets for the same day, I felt like a genius.  And my family really appreciated it!Our tour guide walked our group of about 15 to the Eye where we waited maybe 5-10 minutes in a group line. We had a great guide who was able to explain everything to us we saw during our 30 minute flight: all the buildings, the neighborhoods, the history, etc in a very entertaining way.  He even made sure that he paused every few minutes to allow us to take photos.  This was a  memorable event for all of us, including my 14 and 16 year-olds.  Plenty of places to grab lunch right there.Strongly recommend!"

"Written December 10, 2006",Good fun and a great view,"I've 'flown' on the London Eye twice and would highly recommend it.  It's a fun, pleasant experience, a bit different and always interesting.  There's something rather exciting about rotating very, very slowly on a 135m high ferris wheel!Firstly, I should emphasise that the Eye is NOT scary!  I am a terrible wimp, not at all keen on heights and petrified on the tamest of fairground rides, but I didn't even quiver on the Eye.  In fact, my 90 year old Granny accompanied me and thoroughly enjoyed the experience!  The capsules are sealed in and quite warm, and there are benchs in the middle for if you get tired legs.  The wheel turns so slowly you don't really notice it moving, and it's very smooth.  The capsules are also fixed into the rotating part, so there's no swinging or rocking.  The view is excellent and all of the main sights in London can be seen.  The entire capsule is transparent and offer all round views, and even from the bottom a lot can be seen.  There are particularly good views of Parliament, the Treasury, the Thames and its various bridges, the BT tower, St Pauls, Buckingham Palace, the 'Gherkin' and Cleopatra's Needle.  It's a very comfortable and exciting way to see the sights of London.I would recommend the Eye to both Brits and tourists from other countries.  It offers a completely different view of London.  The elderly and disabled can enjoy this attraction as well, and it's probably exciting enough to keep most children interested."
"Written July 6, 2005",well worth the wait,"It may take an hour or more, but the view from the London Eye is outstanding. It may look like a ferris wheel but there is really no feeling of movement, it is so smooth."
"Written October 15, 2004",The big wheel,It's not just  the view -  it is all about the experience and the engineering. Everyone in the queues (they do move quickly) is trying to work out how it works.A must do visitBook on the website before arriving in London
"Written October 25, 2003",London Eye,"I visited the london eye earlier this month, with my mother, grandmother, sister and 3 yr old niece. We pre booked our tickets and booked for 1400 hrs flight, we arrived at 1300 and started to queue, it was alot quicker than we expected and we had a buggy to fold down and drinks to stow before going ahead with our flight, there was no segregated area to do this and as we were caught, the staff who were there, were completely unsympathetic to us struggling to deal with an 80 year old lady and trying to fold down a buggy and watch a 3 yr old all at once, they were rushing us and shouting at us to move along, and to put away the buggy etc, etc, . even though the London Eye was excellent and the views were fantastic, our experience was marred by a staff member with an attitude!!!!, The London Eye need to re-evaluate their customer service, not their product, which is fantastic and a sight not to be missed."
"Written October 2, 2018",Skip the line is the way to go!,"One of our ""must do's"" in London was the London Eye.  I was somewhat apprehensive since I have some mobility issues and waiting in long lines is really a challenge.  We bought the skip the line tickets and as advertised when we arrived we got directly in the boarding queue.  Tickets to seating on ride in less than 5 minutes.  Extra nice since it was drizzling that night.  Turned out to be a lovely experience -highly recommended."
"Written September 13, 2018",So huge!!,I couldn't believe just how huge this Ferris wheel actually was in real life! Pictures do not the magnitude justice. Such a cool sight on the Thames in London 
"Written January 4, 2009",Very Boring!,This attraction is expensive and just plain boring. It goes so slow that you don't need the whole hour to view London from there. You've seen it all in the first five minutes and for the rest of the time just sat bored stiff! I definitely do not recommend this attraction for people with young children unless you have something for them to do whilst your on it.
"Written July 11, 2006",Pricy but fabulous!,"Although a bit pricy, I thoroughly enjoyed the London eye.  Last time I was in London it was closed (during a wet winter) so I have wanted to go on it for 3 years.  It's certainly worth doing for the amazing view.  If you want a cheaper option to see the amazing London skyline walk up the 311 steps of the Monument for two pound.   Maybe not as spectacular as the London eye but still has great views (as you can walk right around the observation desk seeing a 360 view).I also enjoyed the london eye river cruise (I purchased this online with my london eye flight ticket).  It was fabulous to relax in the sunshine and sail past all those famous monuments."
"Written June 5, 2006",No great thrills here!,This is NOT a must do for London. In 10 minutes I was bored. You see the tops of the city buildings and that's about it. It was a waste of time and money for me.
"Written January 28, 2006",It's no world wonder,"This pricey ride is not work the buzz.  It's certainly not a must see.  You go up on this big wheel ONCE for $20.00 I would understand if you see something special while you're up that high, but you don't.  London is a great city, but chances are the weather is too rainy or foggy to see anything more exciting than some clouds from up high.  Skip this and run right to Westminster Abby!"
"Written January 20, 2006",A Truly Amazing Experience!,Im afraid of heights but riding on the London Eye was the highlight of my first trip to England. I highly recommend it.
"Written January 13, 2006",Do Not Miss This!,"A must for anyone to see in London. It is worth the wait. We had a clear day and saw so much.  There is a wooden bench to sit onduring your ""flight"".  It moves very slowly so you do not have a feeling of motion until you look at the horizon.  You should get oneof the booklets at the store at the base so you know what to look for and what you are looking at."
"Written October 31, 2005",A must do while in London,"This is a must ""to do"" while in London.  The view was spectacular, we went in September when the weather was clear.  Like other reviewers I didn't have very high expectations, I've been on ferris wheels before and been in many tall buildings with great views (Empire State Building, Sears Tower, Eiffel Tower, etc.)  and this was the most pleasant of all.  You don't have to try and fight your way to get a glimpse, only to have someone push you along.  The speed is such that you don't even realize your moving, but not too slow that you feel like you've been on it for hours.  The 30ish minutes that it took, seemed like much less as my husband and I were finding building and sight that we had discovered during our week and snapping pictures.  A really great and worth while ride.  It may seem a little costly, but the moments and memories are definately worth it."
"Written September 21, 2005",The only time go to on the Eye ...,"Arrive when it is still light, and time your flight so the lights come on as you make your flight.  Magical."
"Written July 30, 2004",Superb view of London,"The London Eye was a big hit with the entire family (teenagers included!). The view is superb and you can pretty easily identify London's famous sights. We purchased tickets on the London Eye internet site prior to leaving U.S. and picked them up from ticket machine at the Eye. This was incredibly convenient and prevented standing in an enormous line to obtain tickets. The basic ride was fine--although if you have money to spare the champagne flight would be fun! We rode at 7:00 PM, had less than 5 minute wait after we obtained tickets from machine. Riding at night with city lit up would be pretty but harder to identify major sights. Definitely recommend the experience!"
"Written September 25, 2023",Fun Package!,"Amazing views and fun way to get them by riding on the London Eye!  The pods looked very cool.  There is a little bench in the center if you start feeling sick/tired and want to sit down - as you near the top (depending on wind I suppose) the pod did start to sway a bit.  Afterwards, the river cruise was fun; we had a great guide, Kit, who pointed out some very cool landmarks and buildings."
"Written February 4, 2007",Overrated,"Prior to my trip to England, every travel book/review I read listed the British Airways London Eye as the must-see attraction. Closed for maintenance during the first two weeks of my trip (early January), it opened again the day before my departure and I made room in my itinerary especially for it. Had I known how overrated this experience would be, I would have spent my last day doing something else. First off, is the line-up. I was there during the off-season and waited 30 minutes. I can't imagine how long I would have been standing during the summer months...it easily would have been a few hours. Then there's the cost; was the 30-minute trip worth £14.50? No. An admission charge 1/2 the price still would have been too much. Add to that the fact that you have to buy one of their £3.00 guidebooks so that you know what you are looking out at (unless you're already familiar with the layout of the city), and the London Eye quickly becomes a tourist trap."
"Written January 16, 2007",Excellent- very memorable,"The London Eye is one of the most spectacular sights in London and is situated very close to the London Aquarium and is also very near the Houses of Parliament. As you enter your ‘pod’ you are likely to be with between ten and fifteen other people. As you climb higher into the air, you can see the best sights of London, and on a clearer, sunny days you can see further than you ever expected. The Palace, The Houses of Parliament, The Bridge and other spectacular buildings are to be spotted from your pod. The London Eye takes around thirty minutes to complete it’s ‘flight’ and it is priced very reasonably.After we went on the Eye, we went to the London Aquarium and we were very impressed by the selection of fish there and we took some really nice pictures. Overall, The London Eye was an excellent experience that is suitable for everyone from everywhere. A memorable experience that we will never forget."
"Written January 9, 2007","Nice views,worth the price and cost","Nice views of Big Ben and London from the Eye. If you are slightly afraid of heights, you might want to press through because the ride is so slow going around, it feels more like an elevator, not shaky at ALL. The only thing I wish was different was that  I chose a sunnier day to go on it, if possible it would be worth checking the weather to plan it that way. We got there early on, like 8:30am. We waited on the LEFT side waiting line behind the rope (if you are facing the ticket building, the LEFT side is for those without tickets). I think we only waited about 20 minutes for the building to open or less, and I got to the ticket counter within about 10 minutes or less once the doors opened for business. Than we walked across to the entry gate was on it quite quickly. It takes about 30 minutes I think to go all the way around. If possible try to get your picture taken with Big Ben in the background, that a nice shot for your album. Everyone in your capsule tends to move around the capsule to let everyone get which pictures you want. However if you don't have a camera they do one of those group ""ride shots"" at the end, I think it cost 10 pounds. The only thing I wish  was different was that they cleaned the windows, they were a little spotty. I think the ticket price 14.50 pounds is worth it, to go once, even with the bad  exchange rate for Americans'. And if you book online, you can get 10% off.  There is McDonalds in the buidling next to it"
"Written August 18, 2006",Worth the money,"I went on the London Eye in July last year and was very impressed. For somebody who doesn't like heights I didn't find it at all scary, it moves slowly and smoothly and the views are spectacular. Well worth it even if you don't like heights! I didn't pay much, think it was little under £10.00 per person and was suprised it didn't cost more. If you're unsure of the London sights and land marks I'd suggest you buy the map as it provides an easy to use reference as to what you are actually viewing. Can't wait to do this again sometime soon, maybe at night to see the lights, think this would look brilliant at Christmas!"
"Written November 2, 2005",Loved it,"Went on the Eye early one very clear morning.  Loved it, this was one of the first things I did on my trip to London.  It was a great way to get an overview of the city and a first look at some of the sights.  We were luck enough to have a very clear day and very short line, so that made it all the better.  September is a beautiful time to visit London.  We did buy a copy of the panoramic view guide book which is really not necessary.  Our capsule had maybe 10 people in it, so there was lots of room to move around and taking pic's was no problem.  I'm really glad I want on the Eye, but it is an experience you only need to do once.  I would not go back except maybe on an evening flight to see the city lights.  Overall well worth the time and money."
"Written September 12, 2005",It was just OK,"I had 5 days to explore London, and the London Eye was just OK.  I purchased the panoramic souvenir book so I would know what I was looking at.  I didn't find that it was a great value for my money overall.  It's a long trip, and after about 15 minutes, I was bored.  I would have rathered spent that time exploring one of the places I was looking at."
"Written August 30, 2004",Up. Up and Oh I Say,Along with my wife and 6 yr old son I 'flew' on the Eye on Saturday 28th August. As we were staying out of London and South East Trains wanted £40 for 3 return tickets (Waterloo to Egham) we decided to take the car. First mistake. Trying to find a parking space was horrendous and driving in London to the unfamiliar can be a thrill in its own right. We had lunch in a nearby bar/restaurant of which there are several close to the Eye. Ours wasn't good value. I have to say my heart sank when I saw the queues but we boarded our pre-booked 'flight' at 14:30 exactly on time and were entertained in the queue by some excellent pavement artists.It was a fine clear day and the viewing was excellent. Trouble is there isn't enough to see to keep you occupied for the 30 minutes of the flight. If the flight time was 15 or 20 minutes you'd still have time to see everything and the queues would be processed quicker. I'm glad I've experienced the Eye but in comparison to the Empire State Building and the view from there - well there is no comparison. The experience of movement adds to the value. But I'd like to go on an Eye in somewhere like Paris or Rome - that would be eye-catching.
"Written October 11, 2003",Eye on London,"The London Eye provides a unique experience while in London. The views are great. We went early in the morning (9:30 am) and walked right on (our reservation had been for 10 am). We had only 7 people in our pod. Passing by later in the afternoon, I noticed that the place was packed. We would probably go again - maybe we'll try an evening ride on a future vacation."
"Written June 18, 2003",worth it,Go late in the day and avoid the lines. This is a great thing to do at the end of your first jet lag day. It is a magical 30 minute ride.
"Written October 9, 2018",Amazing views!,"With some hesitation, I booked this ride. I have a fear of heights. The rooms were large and comfortable and the speed was slow enough to make it comfortable. With minutes I was standing at the window taking in the fantastic views. I would do it again in a heartbeat! "
"Written February 10, 2020",Immense view of London...,"We've visited London on many occasion, but this time it was with Wifey and our daughter <3 The London  Eye and it was amazing to experience. It is very very highly recommended ;-) and something you have to do when you are in London.You have an utterly amazing whole view of London, that is only separated by the Thames River =D For those who have a fear of heights, please try it, without any fear :-)"
"Written May 31, 2019",Long queue even with fixed time slot,We had a timeslot but had to wait 45-60 min in queue before we arrived at the entrance. This is not okay why not improve this with fixed timeslot for ticket holders.Once inside was the ride okay.
"Written November 11, 2018",Very confusing set up,"We were walking by the Eye and the lines weren't very long so we decided to give it a go. We were sent to ticketing. Because of poor signage it took a bit to find the building. We got in line for Fast Track tickets. After 20 minutes in line it was finally our turn. The ""Fast Track"" ticket we could buy was for 2 hours later. What's fast about that? Needs better signage, clearer information. We wouldn't have waited in line if we knew tickets were not immediately available."
"Written May 21, 2018",Enthusiastic Guide,"For a 40 minute tour, we heard a lot of info, and were also entertained throughout, thanks to a brilliant guide.  The other crew were also excellent.  Bought this as an add-on to the Eye, but it was definitely a more worthwhile experience."
"Written April 17, 2018",Convenience,A very time saving idea that lets you enjoy London's best skyline without spending so much time in line especially if you have a very limited time and you a lot more of places to see.
"Written September 10, 2017",Amazing,"It was really nice to see london and the amazing view of it at the top of London eye. I've been with my wife in our honeymoon, it was recommended to us that we have to sea the spectacular view from the eye. And I'm pleased that I did it. "
"Written March 3, 2017",No refund policy unacceptable,"The booking for our party included 2 elderly people - one in a wheelchair. The staff were very kind to the wheelchair user, however  the other elderly person in the party was unwell and unable to attend. I asked if there was a refund procedure for the ONE unused ticket but was told no refunds could be given. It was suggested that a request for the visit to be rebooked for another date MIGHT be considered. I can see no earthly reason for the ""no refund"" poilcy as the booking did not prevent anyone else from taking a flight on the Eye.  I simply put it  down to corporate greed. I have visited the Eye on 3 occasions with various groups, but this experience has given me a somewhat jaundiced view so I would not consider another visit on principle."
"Written March 8, 2016",It was Okay,"Nothing too fancy or unforgettable to brag about. If you have been up the Paris Eiffel Tower, this will pale in comparison. The ride took about 45 mins, be sure to go to the toilet before boarding the cabin or you will end up torturing your bladder till the end of the ride before you can head to the toilet (About 5-7mins walk). Nevertheless, it is worth going for first timers but not for seasoned travellers who have experienced many of these sites."
"Written October 15, 2015",OK,I was a little disappointed. I felt I preferred the views from the nearby excellent Westminster Park Plaza hotel!!!
"Written August 30, 2015",Nice View,Great view... The weather was the best I've seen in all my trips to London. You get a good view of London from the Eye especially when the sun is shinning.Worth taking the ride.

"Written April 23, 2023",Amazing Views,Great views of London! We booked a few days in advance online and checked weather prior to booking to ensure we got those amazing views. About 30 minute ride. Line moved very quickly and £34 is not a bad price for a must do tourist attraction.
"Written March 31, 2019",Good value,"I've been to London dozens of times and finally decided to take a boat tour. I chose this one because it's NOT a hop on hop off tour.It takes about 40 minutes and you see London from a very different perspective. The tour guide is a live person rather than a recording, which is great. Our guide Vicky was very enthusiastic about London and had some good jokes subtly added in. Definitely recommended."
"Written February 22, 2019",Best £5 ever ,Don't normally write a review here. But got to give 5* to Vicky from the boat trip her knowledge and her enthusiasts of London making the boat trip very enjoyable.
"Written September 18, 2018","Great view, skip the lines",We did the advance reservation and had our printed tickets when we came to  he Eye.  We waited about 10 minutes to go through the lines and we avoided a wait of more than an hour.  The Eye has taken a cue from Disney and put lines snaking to the other side of the park area to keep the line moving.  Great views form all stages of the rotation.

"Written July 29, 2018",Great Experience,"On a beautiful Saturday earlier this month, I took my daughter and grandson on the London Eye and River Cruise.  Pre-booked tickets meant no queuing and everything ran like clockwork.  Staff were helpful and security on the Eye was unobtrusive and reassuring.  Clear weather meant we had excellent views across the city.  The commentary on the river cruise was excellent with plenty of unusual facts included and the total experience offered excellent value for money."
"Written July 21, 2018",Don't Waste Your Time And Money,"We bought VIP tickets.  Went to the VIP lounge.  They were supposed to come and escort us to the eye.  The escort was late.  Then we were told we had to run to get the binolulars.  Afterwards, when we went to the boarding area we were told we could not board.  There was a Black gentleman named Lam that kept making fun of us and antogized my daughter.  They called security.  We are from the USA and they refused to allow us entry.  We paid  $307.47 USD.  They were very rude.  We will never return.  Horrible experience.  We did nothing wrong.  They said we were cursing and we were not."
"Written July 16, 2018",Great views,We enjoyed the London eye. Decided not to get a fast pass and we didn’t wait more then 10 minutes.  It’s a large dome that’s shared with a dozen or more people but it’s not crowded. Only needs to be done once though. 
"Written July 12, 2018",Amazing view from atop a landmark of London,"Great panoramic views of London from the high points of the Ferris wheel. At 135 metres, it is Europe’s tallest Ferris wheel. We were with a group of kids who very much enjoyed the 30-minute (i.e., for one revolution), slow-motion ride in a high-tech glass capsule. This is a great way to get an overview of the city and see some of its major attractions, such as albeit, from a distance.  The attractions include the River Thames, Westminster Bridge, the Big Ben which is under construction, the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and many more.London Eye staff are friendly, attentive and helpful."
"Written May 13, 2018",Excellent commentary - value for money cruise,This was an enjoyable and informative cruise along the River Thames and under the many bridges. If purchased with a London Eye ticket the additional charge at £5 is well worth it.Whilst the tour was busy the tour guide' commentary was excellent and the indoor speakers were easy to hear. If you want to sit outside you need to arrive early to join the queue. It was full when we arrived.
"Written April 9, 2018",The Eye,"Very hyped up but no comparison to the Singapore one!!!But if you have not been to Singapore, it is an interesting experience. You get to see the whole of London, the best view of the Parliament and the palaces, and especially the river.We had one of the last trips at 7:30 pm and had the benefit of seeing the London lights come on, which wer spectacular. I would advise to book the late trips to get a look at the sunset and to see the lights."
"Written April 9, 2018",Champagne VIP Experience,"VIP is the WAY TO GO. So glad we decided to go this option as the lines for the eye were so long. We went straight into the building, to a champagne room, were escorted to front of the line when it was time to go. The experience was fantastic."
"Written March 21, 2018",Skipping the line was worth it,"Had an amazing time in London and going on the Eye was really fun. It gave a great perspective of the city. The day we rode it was extremely clear and sunny, which was perfect. Paying the extra to skip the line was also a smart move. The line was really long and would have taken hours, but with the skip the line pass you literally walk right on the eye. It keeps moving and you have to kinda hop on. "

"Written June 8, 2016","Bait & Switch Rip off, and Rude Staff","Looking from the distance, and when buying your ticket, you're buying an experience cruising down the river, where you can see around you, and feel the fresh air through your hair from a nice boat. That's not necessarily what they're selling though.When I reached the front of the queue, all the seats in the open deck were taken, but instead of limiting the number of tickets, to the number of seats they have on the open deck, they simply direct any overflow to a basement deck downstairs, where there's no breeze, and from where it's difficult to see anything that's not at ground level, particularly as the front of the boat tilts up as you're going forward.When I refused the downstairs deck, I went back to the ticket office that I'd earlier effectively paid £1.45 to avoid (by booking online I missed out on my Premium Merlin Annual Pass discount ), where upon explaining the situation, that there weren't any seats available on the upper deck, the ticket agent barked that ""that's no excuse"", and stormed off with ""I'm not dealing with this"".The manager and customer services were polite, but they both fobbed me off with T&C's, and an apology for their rude agent, and were only willing to address the situation with a £10 fee, which was only 50p less than the £10.50 it would have cost for a new ticket at the ticket desk with my Premium Merlin Annual Pass.I guess it's all ok, because Jemma (""Customer Service Executive"") evidently hopes that that my visit ( to the pier ) not living up to my expectations will not deter me from using my Merlin Annual Pass at the London Eye; it won't - feeling hurt and ripped off will deter me from anything financially beneficial to the London Eye."
"Written January 27, 2016",Great London attraction,A nice way to spend the day in London having fun. The cost is about 40 pounds but defiantly worth it. You see all London in a new way. Only issue was the wait to get in approx. 30-45 minutes
"Written December 28, 2015",River Cruise- awful customer service from FAYE but the rest was fantastic.,"I have given this a 3/5 on the back of a terrible initial impression from a member of staff today (28/12/15) called FAYE. We've recently got Merlin Premium Passes so were making the most of them and decided to go on the river cruise after the London Eye. We first came across FAYE at 10.45 when she told us we'd need to wait an hour for the next boat and advised us to return later to buy a ticket. We rejoined the much longer queue later after visiting the Shrek attraction, and after queuing for 20 mins finally made it back to FAYE at her window to buy tickets. It was 12.45 by the time we reached her window. Unbelievably as I went to open my mouth to speak, she pulled down the blind announcing she was closed. Simultaenously her colleague to the left of her opened her window and immediately served the customer behind me. Dumbfounded I spoke to the 'blind' infront of me and stated the obvious ' excuse me, I'm next' to which she replied 'Well I'm closed and won't serve you'. Amazed at the totally deplorable customer service I leant into the colleagues window to enquire if she'd serve us next as we had been next in line, which she did, whilst offering some excuse 'her till has broken' when I asked why we'd been so rudely treated. This was obviously a lie as I'd been behind the lady in front when she'd been served. It simply seemed as though it was FAYES tea break or something. How hard would it have been to let us know in line that she was closing and enable us to be served next by her colleague rather than pulling the blind down in my face? Which customer service school did she attend? On a much brighter note, the river cruise was fabulous and SHIRA was superb with her witty commentary. I would rate the cruise 5/5, but it lost points on the awful customer service at the start. Such a shame, as all the other London Eye staff were pleasant, approachable and made our first trip to London in many years, a pleasure."
"Written October 1, 2015",See london from the sky,"Really worth the ride. Make sure you go on a clear sunny day and not when its cloudy or rainy so that you have a good view of the city. Although some favor going there in the evenings, i prefer during daylight as you will be able to see the neighboring areas as opposed to just lights in the evening. In all cases buy the tickets online, f you don't mind waiting in the queue to get onboard then ok, otherwise buy the VIP or fast track option ticket."

So very glad we decided to add this attraction to our to do list.We enjoyed every minute of this attraction, the commentary was fun, interesting and very informative, the tour guide was actually giving her very first commentary and you wouldn't have known, she was terrific !45 minutes on the river, sailing from the London eye, up to Tower Bridge and back, the price in my opinion was very reasonable and well worth it if you have no other plans for an hour.  Plenty to see and some great photos to be had.I was definitely recommend, but please make sure you take some warm clothing if you are visiting around now and in the evenings as the breeze gets pretty cold !"

So there we were sipping and enjoying ourselves when, with six or seven minutes to go (so we are on our descent) and half a bottle of the champagne left, we were told to ""please finish our drinks.""   Coincidentally, I have a photo timed at about that moment and there is clearly half a bottle at least left.Now, understandably The London Eye may not have a license for us to take the remaining half a bottle of champagne away with us, but when I asked the host what would happen with the rest of our bottle, he said, ""Ah, we'll probably just throw it away.""  We were flabbergasted.  I think we all know that wouldn't happen, but it wasn't even suggested to us that we go back into the Pommery Lounge to finish what had been promised to us in the £360 price tag for this experience.  Not to mention the £19 a glass we had spent already in the lounge.  I then suggested that they will probably sell the champagne by the glass in the Pommery Lounge, to which our host then said, ""Yeah, probably.""The cost is not the issue here.  The Experience is advertised with ""a bottle"" as I have mentioned.  The rotation of The Eye is 30 minutes.  How on earth you can quaff  down a bottle between two people in that amount of time is beyond me.  Perhaps the Administration of the London Eye should start allowing people to finish their experience as they began it.....in the Pommery Lounge!An extremely disappointing end."

"Written March 20, 2015",If you get a 2 for 1 you will save!,"If you are using transit get a 2 for 1 booklet in the tube station. This will save you a ton of money on things like the london eye. It was a lovely ride and view of the city. Go first thing in the morning to avoid long line ups, it opens at 10 am."
"Written February 20, 2015",Big Wheel flight of London,It goes so high it feels like you are in a small plane. No other aerial views of London like it. We did a 30 mins trip up at sunset and it was gob smacking beautiful. You can easily get yourself there on the Underground and just walk over the Themes by the Big Ben. Watch out for the London taxis. Be careful of the street vendors don't show wads of money or their prices change.
"Written November 18, 2014","The eye is great, the service isn't","We went for the Champagne Experience, which is basically just the regular but with priority boarding and champagne.As part of this you are promised priority boarding and they tout their new '4D Experience'.I'll start with the '4D Experience'. It's a ridculous advertisment for EDF Energy and is quite cringeworthy. Actually getting into this was difficult, we missed this by a second and were rudely shouted at that we'd have to wait a few minutes. We literally got to the door and it closed. This wasn't a great start.When we eventually got in, we realized what a waste of time it was queuing for this and we might as well have just went to the McDonalds across the corner. It's a poorly done 3D film with the typical 3D gimmick, in this case it was a flying bird that sticks out with the 3D. Eventually it sprays foam at you. Reminds me of the same subpar experience with is available at The Dymanic Earth in Edinburgh. Basically, this /definitely/ should not be something they advertise on the tickets.Next I'll move on to the 'priority boarding'. Our trip was at 8pm and we were told to make sure we were at the 'priority queuing area' 15 minutes before the trip.This queuing area consists of a squashed barriered area next to the 'priority checkin'. After waiting around 20 minutes from the time we were told to be there I can tell you that this is anything but priority. I do know how to queue, I am British, however this was too much, especially when you've paid that little extra to not queue.When we actually got on the eye, it was great. The host was knowledgable and took photos of us and the champagne was decent. However, it still gets a one star review as this I would argue that this particular stage is not difficult for a business. How they sell this and the service inside the place is terrible.Basically if you are thinking of going on the London Eye, don't buy any priority stuff with the expectation you'll not have to queue and save your time -- don't go to the 4D experience."
"Written September 1, 2014",Discusting service,"I purchased tickets for me and my partner on 19th august, the money was taken from my account and i recieved a confirmation email thanking me for my purchace and to pick my tickets up from the London eye office on the 30th august. When i went to collect these i was told i hadnt baught any tickets, after showing the staff my confirmation email i was left 45 minutes whilst she disapeared, a woman came back with her to tell me my tickets was there but there was a fault with their system so we would have to re-buy tickets evan though i had already paid for them. We had traveled almost 4 hours to visit the London eye and didnt evan get to go on it as the staff was arguing with us for so long we no longer had any time left. To make things worse this was a surprise for my partners birthday as hes always wanted to visit this attraction, but we was turned away with no help or answers as to why we couldnt have our baught tickets and had to return home upset and disapointed. We was also told that the customer services wasnt open on a saturday so they couldnt help us either.Waste of time and money!"

"Written January 18, 2014",Shame on you EDF and London Eye,"Friends of mine from Greece came to visit in London for 6 days over the new year (2014) and booked and paid for tickets online via the timeout website. As they were travelling they didn't have a printer to print out the vouchers but they were given a reference email from the site confirming the booking for the given date.We arrived and went to the collections line. we queued for 20 minutes and once at the counter, they told us they couldn't accept the booking with the reference from anyone else's website except theirs and we would have to forward the confirmation email to their email which they gave us. However, the 3G signal in that area is awful so my friend had trouble sending the email. So we re-joined the line and whilst in it, he managed to send the confirmation emails to them. So, after another 40 minutes of queuing (the line was getting longer) we arrived at the counter. The staff member said they had received the emails but for some reason when they clicked on the links for the vouchers, nothing happened. So, we'd done everything they asked and then they told us they wouldn't honour the tickets and if we wanted to go on it, we'd have to pay again. When we complained about this, they simply said ""if you had bought them from our own site, you wouldn't have this problem"". Well, that may be so EDF/London Eye, but YOU authorise other agents to take our money from THEIR sites so you SHOULD honour those tickets. They made no attempt to call ""Encore"" (the company that sells the tickets via the timeout website) and only gave us the option to pay again.Needless to say we weren't going to pay another £55 for 3 tickets (its excessively expensive for 30 minutes anyway). they gave us a ""voucher refusal"" form and said we would have to seek a refund from the people we booked with. Even though everything has been sent off, my friends are STILL waiting for their refund (in late January) with not even a response. EDF/London EYE - firstly you should always honour tickets issued by your agents and secondly if your agents are dodgy (as clearly Encore are for not even responding to the refund request), you should cut ties with them. If you aren't willing to honour tickets issued by other websites, then make your own site the only place to buy them - stop being so greedy!.its an appalling reflection on EDF , the London Eye and damaging to the reputation of the great city of London for the many tourists that come here.Finally, don't waste your money on this attraction or the greedy company behind it - if you walk along the south bank, there are many more interesting things to see that are for free. Shame on you EDF and London Eye!"
"Written June 11, 2007",Pick a clear day and Prepare for a long wait,A friend and I bought our tickets online to this much hyped up tourist attraction in Mid April. We saved about £4 per ticket by buying a package with Madame Tussauds's front of the line passes. The total was £31.50 (per person) . They asked us to report 30 mins before time.The lines were very long and we had wait about an hour before the actual ride. If you are a seasoned traveller this might not be the highlight your trip. But if you've never been on a plane before or as below the age of 11 you will love the ride. Just make sure you check the weather before.. go on a clear day for better views.
"Written February 21, 2007",Fun experience,"It's a good experience. Come on guys, it's the world's tallest observation wheel. In my opinion, just the engineering aspect of the whole thing made it worth the 30-minute trip.We had Oyster, so the second ticket was free if I remember it right. I definitely wouldn't call it a tourist trap. Anyways, to us it was a very memorable experience.Also, if you show up early enough, there's no line, although it does form pretty quickly during the day. We showed up about 10:15 - 10:30am and didn't have to wait in line. Just bought the tickets (right there in the office nearby) and proceeded to the wheel. There were 3 or 4 other people in the same capsule, so nobody got in each other's way. Those capsules are huge, at least a lot larger than I thought."
"Written January 21, 2007",brilliant,"we as a family loved the london eye so much that we went on twice , once in the day and at night . we bought the tickets at the eye kiosk and then walked straight on both times . this was half term when it was very busy (feb). we also went on again with frends in july and then again just walked straight on (it was late 19:30 ) the last flight . when we go back to london we would proberly go again !"
"Written January 10, 2007",Tourist trap!,"At first, we did not plan on going on the London Eye, but decided to last minute.  It was definitely not worth the money.  We went on the regular capsule with around 10 other people.  The view was nice, but not worth what we paid.Pros: I have a fear of some heights, but this capsule was very large and did not move (like a ferris wheel would) so I felt very comfortable in it.  Honestly, we would much rather have skipped the London Eye and spent our money on London walking tours."
"Written October 9, 2006",A tourist trap - but a must do,"If you get decent weather, you'll get fabulous views of everything London.  You'll get a great feel for the layout of London as you can see the Houses of Parliament on the west side to the modern Swiss Re (Exotic Gherkin) on the east side.  We purchased our ticket at the Victoria Station tourist info kiosk (13 GBP/adult, 10 GBP/senior).  We decided not to purchase in advance online with a date and time since we wanted to try and get a decent day and by booking weeks in advance we'd have no idea what it may be like.  Having said that, in England the weather can turn on a dime .... and rain anyway.  But alas, we chose well - overcast but the rain held off.  The ticket voucher was good for 30 days.  We showed up a few days later at 9:30am which was opening time, and when the doors opened, the line that was forming was divided by staff into two - those that had vouchers, and those that needed to buy tickets.  Thankfully there were far less of us that had vouchers, and we were ushered to an entirely different queue to get the ticket and time.  The others buying tickets had to walk further to a different set of queue stalls.We were told they were having problems and the first flight would be 11:00am - which we were given. - so we had a little over an hour to kill - so we had tea in the ticket building.  After you get your ticket and are given a time, they tell you to arrive 1/2 hour before your ""flight"".  There are queue stalls in front of the Eye - you will end up lined up in here to be hearded up onto the Eye platform.  Once on the platform, you are quickly ushered into one of the pods that are slowly moving - ours had 21 people in.  Don't worry - you'll get great views as there is a lot of glass to look out of.  At the end, you have the option of moving to the front (door area) of the pod to have a ""tourist"" picture for purchase taken - we skipped this - hate these things.  Getting off it is interesting - you feel quite wobbly as the pod is slowly moving and you step off to solid ground - I staggered a little.The attraction is grossly overpriced in my opinion, but alas, you're probably in London for a once in a lifetime trip and if that is the case and you are not afraid of heights, I think you'd be sorry not to be able to say you've done the Eye."
"Written June 6, 2006",Quite a Bit of Fun!,"If you are into getting a birds-eye view of a city, this is a good way to see London.  I went with my ten-year old, and it was quite enjoyable.  I would stop short of saying it's a ""don't miss,"" but it was fun.  We booked online, and we sprung for the tourguide, which I thought was worth it.  The tour guide was educational, and reserving ahead did save quite a bit of waiting.  We only had two days in London, so it was great to not waste a lot of time waiting on a line.  I realize that weather might be an issue in London, but we were very fortunate on our visit to have a lovely day and splendid views!"
"Written September 16, 2005",Fun but wouldn't make it a must,"The London Eye is a nice little novelty.  Having said that, I wouldn't make it a 'must do' while in London.  It is quite interesting watching how the pods revolve around the wheel, but going on it wasn't as special as I thought it would be.  The view of London is pretty if you are on the Eye on a clear day.  I think it's one of those things where you say 'I've done it and it was fun'.  I would recommend that if you are on a budget in London, skip the Eye and go somewhere else where you'll get more bang for your buck."
"Written July 19, 2004",Don't Miss the London Eye,"There is no doubt about it. The London Eye is a must-go. Words cannot describe the experience of looking down at the city of London especially at night when the lights from the buildings are dancing away. My wife and I went for a ride at around 9.30pm in July 03 and we practically walked into a capsule as there was no queue. That is the secret, go late at night about an hour before closing and you won't have to worry about queues. We shared our capsule with another couple who were busy making out right after the ride started. Who could blame them as the view of London at night was enough to get the hormones raging. It was absolutely the most beautiful and romantic sight that we had ever seen. We were enjoying ourselves so much, we did not want the ride to end. Anyway, half an hour later we were back on terra firma vowing that we would definitely return for another ride on this magnificent wheel!"
"Written May 27, 2004",A nice view,The London Eye is a nice attraction.  We got to see a portion of the the changing of the guard ceremony while we were on it.  The river cruise that followed (purchased as a combo tour) was really nice too.  We went in the morning because it's supposed to be less crowded then.  We went in the AM and were able to get on with only a very short wait.
"Written March 23, 2004",Awesome views,"The London Eye has some of the best views in London, you can get the same views from St Paul's Cathedral but you don't have to climb all the stairs! I am extemely scared of ferris wheels but this is nothing like that - you go into ""capsules"" and feel completely safe with a group of around 15 other people. Photos come out perfect even through the glass. Well worth the money!"

"Written February 18, 2014",Excellant Hotel Chocolat Tasting Experience,"My daughter and I visited London for the weekend and decided to treat ourselves with a ""Hotel Chocolat"" Tasting Experience Package, it was beyond good, our expert Lisa was knowledgeable, personable and made the whole experience so memorable. We tried many different types of chocolate on our 1 hour (2 revolutions) trip in a private capsule, learning about how chocolate is made and the chocolate tasting was accompanied by glasses of Prosecco served by two delightful London Eye Hostesses. The whole experience was seamless and most professional, the weather was glorious and that just added to the whole thing. There were tasting guides and 360degree maps in our information pack.We were given a box of chocolates (14 assorted) to come home with and there was a non-alcoholic alternative to the fizzy for those that wished. It was Lisa's birthday on the day and she so obviously enjoys her job so much even that did not prevent her working on her special day. I would recommend this to anyone that loves chocolate, it was well worth the money. 5*, thank you :)"
"Written July 10, 2013","Book a time slot, then have to queue for 1.5 hours","The London Eye is nothing short of an organisational joke.  You book a specific time slot, and then you still have to queue for 1.5 hours to get on.  You finally get on half an hour after your allotted time, and the staff seem to think that it's normal.It's also quite expensive (circa £18).  Go up The Monument instead, it's much better."
"Written April 15, 2013",Get the fast track ticket!,"It was worth the extra money not to wait the long line, since I was there on a nice day. As for the ride itself, you can see a bunch of London's attractions from the Eye itself. I am thrilled by heights so I had a lot of fun. I had a friend who is terrified of heights and he still had a lot of fun, would recommend it ;)"
"Written November 30, 2011",Private capsule - expensive but worth it!,"I decided to push the boat out and hire a private capsule for my boyfriend's birthday as he had never been on the London Eye before and I wanted it to be special (well, he did take me to Rome as a surprise for Valentine's day!). It was very expensive but I thought it was worth it to see the look on his face!You can book the exact time you want so I found a website that listed the times of sunrise and sunset and made sure we were on the Eye as the sun was setting :-)You are not allowed to be alone in the capsule so have a ""host"", who pours you champagne (this only applies to private capsules obviously) and offers you chocolates. They can point out landmarks but can also be discreet and not get in your way. It is very handy too to have someone else in the capsule to take your photo!The views are great, the only disappointment I guess is that the trip is so short. We were so busy taking photos it would have been nice to be able to go around again to take in the views! Also we were sipping a glass of champagne and it was only as we were about to 'land' that the host told us we were not allowed to take the bottle with us (something to do with laws regarding carrying open bottles of alcohol on the street); if I had known that I would have drunk more of it as we were going round but I was more interested in taking photos! Still, it was a once-in-a-lifetime event and a wonderful experience."

"Written May 19, 2011",Lovely view......short lineup,"We took a ride on the London Eye on Friday May 13th..............approx 12:45.p.m......contrary to all we had heard about wait times, we must have been very lucky because we were in our observation car only 5 or so minutes after we lined up, and we did not have fast track tickets...........we inquired abt them but they cost 10 gbp per person extra ...........I'm glad we didn't get them ! The ride took 30 minutes ,almost to the second, and the views were really good, although I doubt I would go again.....................there is a bench in the middle of the observation car, and it cannot accommodate everyone if the car is full, so the tip is to sit in the middle of the bench in the spot that has a small air filtration unit in front of it........................because the unit is against the window no one will stand there and block your view, and the unit is only a couple of feet high so it will not block your view either, nor will it blow air on you....................it was an enjoyable experience.....we are glad we went"
"Written February 3, 2009",Disappointing: not more than 20 minutes!,"Visiting England and London last week end, my son and I went to London Eye Saturday, expecting to be blown away. There was a huge queue for buying the tickets and then another one to reach the capsule. But as you fit 25 people in one capsule, the flow seems continuous. Nevertheless, we were worried about missing another commitment we had afterwards. That’s why I checked my watch just before entering the wheel. 20 minutes later, the tour was already finished! We enjoyed it as it is a really nice attraction, but the duration is far away from the 30 minutes they advertize. We went to the ticket office, asking why it was so short. There, a PR responsible person told us that we enjoyed so much the tour that the time seemed flying for us! As I was not 100% satisfied with this answer, he asked me if I wanted to fill-in a claim form for the management. I do not want to make a fuss, I just wanted to share this poor experience with you.  Please avoid going to the London Eye during peak periods!"
"Written April 28, 2008",Total waste of time and money,"I had booked online and was told that the maximum waiting time would be 30 minutes. We arrived to a vedry long queue on a very rainy day! We, therefore, decided to pay the extra to get the fast-track tickets (about double) which entailed a wait for around 20 minutes in a queue while people in the other ""normal"" line were getting drenched in the rain.Finally in the ""pod"" we were totally underwhelmed! The views are nice, even though it was raining, but, frankly, not at all worth all the hassle and certainly not the money. Save your punds for a nice meal in Chinatown!"

We enjoyed it, the price for it is a bit above average but it's worthed at the end.  Nice views, if you have not much time to see attractions at least can have a glimpse of them from the London Eye."

"Written March 21, 2011",OK but once is enough,"Booked a ticket for 10am thinking the queues wouldn't be too bad - how wrong can one be?  Probably because it was a beautiful spring day.  Arrived 9.30am and had read that if you booked into the 10am slot, you could do the 4D experience after going on the eye.  We booked our tickets on-line and the queue for collection wasn't as bad as the queue for buying tickets although we did get in the wrong one at first because it wasn't very clear.  There was no-one on the door when we entered hence the confusion but we found out there should be someone on the door directing you to the right queue.  We were hurried through the 4D experience before our trip which meant we finally boarded at 10.40ish.  I though it was a pleasant experience and the views are fantastic, the weather helped but I was ready to get off mainly because the temperature was getting hotter and hotter and I felt like I was in a greenhouse.  Hopefully they have air conditioning on in the summer!   I'm glad I did it, would recommend it, but wouldn't do it again."

The ride was shorter than I had been led to expect. The view was good. The ride moves really really slowly-you don't even know youre moving. They take your capsules photo at the end, but since other random people are in your capsule with you i don't really dont that photo desirable and didnt buy it. They take your photo again when you enter the 4D video theatre (where there are no seats) and again i didn't buy it. The background isn't anything special. "

Book online, get fast track, print off email documentation (there's details in email if you're using someone elses credit card to book) and present yourself at the office opposite the attraction to book in (go to desk on the left - priority boarding think it says) you go via a different route and beat the whole queue. The trip itself was great, went in evening - awesome to see all the lights of the city twinkling below. 9yr old enraptured! Best part of the trip. Lovely little eating spots all along the riverbank there. Lovely evening to meander about. Recommend!"
"Written August 11, 2010",London Eye....reservations,"Was recently in London and decided to book tickets on-line for the London Eye.  When booking on-line, you must choose a time for your ""ride.""  We booked a 2pm time and was advised to get there 30 minutes early.  We were actually in the area much earlier and ""killed"" an hour watching street performers.  We waited on line for about 15 minutes to pick up our tickets and then was told the line would be about 30 minutes...it actually took us an hour on line...when we got up to the front of the line, we noticed that people were getting on the attraction who had tickets for 7pm that night...I asked the person working there why they were allowed on now, even though they had ""reservations"" for 7pm and he told us it didn't matter what time you had tickets for the ride...you just needed tickets.  The moral of the story is...the ride was worth it, but go when it works best for you and plan to wait in line for an hour....not the 30 minutes they tell you."
"Written January 10, 2009",Good views.,"It's a bloody big Ferris wheel, but at least it don't squeak and sway and rock, and scare the living bejesus out of you. It offers some great views, and even if you're only taking the same photo as ten million other tourists have already done, it's still worth it to have a look for yourself. Yeah, it's expensive, but everything is these days, and it's money better spent than some tourist traps can offer. At least you know what you're getting. It takes you up, you look down, everyone's happy. And at least your wallet will be lighter and easier to carry...you've gotta try and see the good in everything."
"Written July 22, 2008",Well worth the money - book ahead to save a bit,"This was one of the highlights of our trip.  We booked on the BA website and the cost was $60 for 3 tickets.  30 minute ride, fantastic view on a lovely day.  Purchase the London 360 guidebook, a nice keepsake and tells you what you're looking at.  Lines are long but it moves pretty fast.  If you pre book you save some time, as you don't have to get into the long ticket line, but you do still have to wait in the pre booked ticket line. After that you line up again in the ticket holders line, which is a bit twisty turny like a Disneyland ride line!  Staff is well organized though and it moves rather quickly.  Note if you pre book you still have to call up 24 hours in advance to book a time.  You can get there a bit early and they'll still let you line up.  The ride is smooth and unless you have a major phobia about heights it's not scary, even for young children.  There's a seat in the middle if you want to relax, but most everyone stands to get the best view."
"Written August 22, 2007",Truly Breath Taking,"A must go -- especially at dusk and twilight! Well worth the GBP, but buy your ticket(s) early so that you don't have to wait in the ticket queue and then in the time queue. Bring your camera! Buy the book and take it with you before the voyage, so that you can recognize the buildings as you are seeing them from above. Take photos of yourself in the capsule! ENJOY."
"Written January 8, 2014",LONDON EYE - NOTHING SPECIAL IN MY OPINION,We recently took a trip on the London Eye:When we arrived the queue looked VERY long and we were apprehensive about there possibly being a very long wait - this was not the case we could not believe how quickly the queue was moving - we waited about 25 minutes from joining the queue to boarding the Pod.As there were about 15 people who boarded in front of us we could not get to the end of the capsule / `pod` riverside where the best views are - the first people to board will naturally immediately go to that area of the Pod - they will have great views of the Houses of Parliament / Big Ben and the Thames - those who are not in that position will NOT !It may be because I have experienced the view from tall buildings in both London and elsewhere in the World and I used to do sport parachuting as a hobby [views from thousands of feet up] - but I did not think much of the limited views of London that we experienced from our position in the pod.The organisers would probably state that you should ask people to rotate around the pod - the people on our pod were holding onto the handrail with a `vice like grip` - not because they were frightened of the heights - but to prevent themselves being moved from `Their position` !Some people did try to take photos between / above them - any moving was fiercely resisted by maintain their grip on the handrail !It is not possible to ensure that your party will be the first to board a particular pod as this is done with the London Eye still moving - staff marshal people off each pod as it arrives at ground level and it then moves along a few metres to where people have been held in position to `Rush On` - again while the pod is still moving.IF You are very lucky and find yourselves at the front of the line waiting for the next pod - Great - rush onto it and go straight to the riverside end where you will see some good views of London - although apart from the nearby buildings of note you would not know what you are seeing further away.Any view to the south is not really worth seeing - e.g. Crystal Palace Transmitter tower - ?Although the pods are very stable there was some slight movement near the top of the rotation because of some strong winds - one of my Family members found out for the first time that they do not like heights just after the pod started to go up and they had to sit down for nearly all of the rotation / trip.In our pod there were mainly tourists - probably this was the case in all of the pods after all of the years that the London Eye has been operating - I did not get the impression that they were overly impressed with the `ride`.We had complimentary tickets and I am pleased that we experienced it but I would not have felt that it was money well spent if I had paid approximately £100.00 for 5 tickets.Chris
"Written April 30, 2013",Disappointing - watch out for combitickets,"I bought a combi ticket for The London Eye - Madame Tussaud's - The London Dungeon.I bought it through the website of the London Eye.I found the London Eye itself disappointing. It looks great, has a great location but I got a better view of London from the Tower Bridge and the top of St-Paul's cathedral. Also, the picture that is taken during the attraction only contained the backs of people.I also felt cheated with the combiticket. We decided to visit Madame Tussaud's and The London Dungeon on our last day of vacation (tickets valid for a month). Madame Tussaud's was great, we had an excellent time but dissappointment came when visiting the London Dungeon.We had foreseen 2,5 hours to visit the attraction and then we still had over an hour to get to the eurostar.There was a queue and after about 30 minutes, we were able to enter the building. On their website, it states (quote) : ""The tours last approximately 90 minutes no matter what time you enter."". Well, I find that to be misleading. When you 'enter' the building, you still have to queue for 50 minutes and after that, you still need 90 minutes for the show. So in fact you don't need 90 minutes after you 'enter' but 140 minutes. So, we talked to the people of the attraction, told them that we would miss our train and they were very friendly and helpfull and showed some real concern, they suggested that we would return to the London Eye (because we purchased the combiticket there) and simply ask for a refund (or extend the validity of the ticket,...). No complaints there.When we returned to the London Eye ticket office, however, they couldn't have cared less. The person at the counter refused to do anything about it (""it is a combiticket, no refund"") and showed absolutely no interest whatsoever (he constantly looked the other way while is was talking).When I pointed out that the people of the London Dungeon made the suggestion to come back to the ticket office, he stated that, although they sold combitickets, they remained separate firms and that he didn't care what they had sad.Bad service."
"Written January 12, 2013",Fabulous,"We went on the London Eye at 4pm on a Staurday afternoon.  Short queue to buy tickets, followed by a short queue/wait of about 5 minutes to get on.It was just starting to get dark so during the 30 minute ride the Eye lit up with blue lights and lights switched on across the city so it was very pretty.We only had 10 people in our capsule, but as this was my 4th time on the Eye, i know they flll them up at busy times.Our children, age 8 & 6, loved it, especially the computer screens showing interesting points/buildings. The Eye moves very slowly so you dont feel any movement. If you are travelling into London by train look out for the ""buy 1 get 1 free"" booklets at your local train station.  We grabbed one of these and use the vouchers for the Eye."
"Written November 3, 2012",What were you thinking!,"In a city with such a rich history like Londons,  it baffles me why your city planners would allow such a monstrosity to be built. It is a blight upon the skyline, a monument to tackiness, an eyesore of the first degree, and has left your great city  looking like a roadside theme park. How about a roller coaster in Trafalgar Square? Please dismantle this horrid contraption!"
"Written July 15, 2012",ugly and doesnt look safe at all.,the worst is smell. During warm days a mix smell of people and chemistry is not acceptable at all. Its a nightmare. More of that you wont feel safe there and the whole round is more than 25 minutes so there`s no way you will make your trip shorter if you dont like it.
"Written June 26, 2012",Flexi Fast Track is the way to go,"I can't imagine being in London and not taking a trip on the eye, but the lines are CRAZY!!!  We purchased our tickets in advance (I recommend this for everything in London if available).  On top of on-line advance tickets , we didn't want to be locked into a particular time, so we spent the extra $ on the Flexi Fast Track ticket.  It was perfect, we spent no more then 10 minutes in line and we could pick the most convenient time for us.  The views are great as well.  Don't forget to smile for the photo opt at the end of the ride.  I would have liked to have gone a 2nd time at night, but decided not to spend the extra $."

My boyfriend are enjoy in view but for me was the best 3D Film what we was watch before we are go in Eye. Next time we was there at night and it was rain, that was most perfect night in London. The Eye are change color from  blue, pink, green and it s look beautiful."
"Written August 28, 2011",Take the Champagne Experience,"After reading a Trip Advisor Review took the suggestion of the champagne experience.  Well worth the few pounds extra.  Was an escorted trip in the capsule and there were only 8 of us, when the capsule can take up to 25.  Also had an allotted booked time so didn't have to wait in long queues, and there are long queues.  Our guide was very pleasant and pointed out sights of interest.  Would thoroughly recommend."
"Written June 15, 2011",A visit to London without a ride in the eye is like going to sea without swimming,"The only thing that would make your experience even better is if you can grasb a 2-for-1 voucher or something like this. I know some businesses do offer them (Tescos to mention one). Also, you would get an online discount if you pre-book your ticket which what I did. This also proved clever when I went to collect my tickets from the machines and I saw that huge queue at the tickets office, while it took me two minutes to get mine. So, try to book in advance. As for the ride itself, it was just amazing, especially if your going to stay in London for a short time and you cannot see everything it has to offer. I really enjoyed it. The view of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, etc, is amazing. You might also consider going at night if you love the glamorous nights of London...The last amazing thing was the London Eye 4-D experience which was included in the ticket. It was a short movie in 4-D which we saw after getting off the wheel..Overall, money well spent.."
"Written August 7, 2007",A fun and unique experience,"My family of four loved this ride taken in July 07.  It is expensive, even more so because we chose to use the fast track tickets which I recommend if there is a long line at the regular ticket counter and/or outside at the Eye. We thought it was awesome because:  the ride is unique - we'd never been in a clear pod-like ferris wheel and the views were cool at that height. It was our first day in London so it was a perfect way to start our holiday. We felt comfortable on the ride as there was plenty of room to sit and walk around.  The height did not bother us as we thought it might when we looked down, but no problem. Each pod holds about 20 people. The 30 minutes ride time seem good also. Although the ride keeps moving it was easy to get on and off. Fun! - if you can bring yourself to ignore the cost."
"Written July 5, 2007",Essential viewing,"The London Eye is a must see experience- even for those of you who are scared of heights, like me. Costs about £15 but at this time of year, when it's very busy, opt to pay the extra £10 and skip the que - you'll feel guilty for a few minutes but saves lots ""and lots"" of queing.Can hardly tell you're moving as moves so slowly and , for those of you scared of heights, it's not that bad. Don't get me wrong, i wasn't jumping around in the capsule but i felt relatively secure.You will be treated to a view of London that is impossible to get from anything other than a hot air balloon."
"Written November 28, 2006",Better at night,I been on this during the day and most recently at night. The night view is fantastic and since it was a clear night we could see for miles!Didn't have to que at all just went up bought the ticket in City Hall and went straight through so can't complain.Get a Oyster Card fro travellling around London and it also offers a 2 for 1 deal on the London Eye so at £13.50 for two adults its well worth it!!
"Written September 7, 2006",It's a must-to-do,"Perfect view!It's very pricey but worth it. Get there in time, and prepare to wait. We didn't book tickets before, but still managed to get there, maybe 1-1,5h wait + 30min on the other que. Yep, you have to que two times, first to get the ticket and then for the machine...Remember to take pictures from the other side too! I was too enthustiastic and took lots of pics from the Big Ben, Parlament etc. but forgot the other side..."
"Written September 3, 2006","Misled, Kept Waiting, A Complete Waste of Time","Went to London Eye around 9:30am on Saturday, trying to get an early 'flight' and stood in the queue at around 9:45.  Bought the tickets, went to join the queue, then realised the tickets said 12:00. I went to Customer Services and they explained they were having some technical problems with the Eye...it wasn't working...it would be 12 before a flight would go.  No-one had mentioned this when I booked.  How dare they assume we had the time to wait til 12 noon?  I was offered my money back with no apology, but my 5 year old was then hooked on the idea and had, indeed, planned our whole break around it.  So....we hung around for an hour.  McDonalds nearby had no happy meals; the cafe in the Eye's booking office was crowded beyond reason, as everyone who had been sold tickets to an inoperative ride tried to while away an hour or more and we found it very difficult to occupy our time.  At 11:30, our morning wasted, we ended up being told that the problem was ongoing.  I was appalled. I know problems occur with this kind of thing, but organisations shouldn't take money from people when they know there's a problem.  That's what the Eye did.  They also didn't make any attempt to keep us informed about what was happening and were positively unapologetic about the lack of service.  This was a joke and I'm not sure that we'll ever go back."
"Written June 9, 2006",Worthwhile,"This can be pricey but as a one off experience it is more than worthwhile.We booked on the net several days earlier and arrived half an hour before the pre booked time.We were impressed how efficient the queue was managed. We got on to the pod way before our allocated time.Ultimately on a nice hot day, the view of London is fantastic, and London is a city that has the buildings and the skyline to do it  justice.You go around slowly and alas only once.Take a camera and click away."
"Written January 13, 2005",I didnt get to ride the London Eye,"It looks like it would be fun, but i tried to ride it during the winter months...was looking forward to it...and it was closed!! big bummer. I suggest checking it out on a website or something beforehand."
"Written March 19, 2004",Fantastic experience!,"I disagree with the review below. Whether or not you are afraid of heights you should DEFINATELY go on The Eye! I am absolutely afraid of heights (I won't go above first floor unless I have someone with me) but it really isn't that scary because you're fully enclosed. this experience should NOT be missed, not because of a little fear (it makes it all the more exciting!), nor because of the long ques. Yes, they're long, no denying it. So despite the ques I've given it five stars because there is no other experience like it in Britain. I have great memories of it. Try and go at dusk, it's spectacular!"
"Written June 30, 2003",Sunsets from the Eye,"There are dozens of famous ""views"" in London, but until the London Eye was opened in 2000, few visitors were able to get a birds-eye perspective of central London.Ride the Eye just before summer sunset--assuming the fickle London weather cooperates--for a truly memorable view of London. Long shadows accentuate the cityscape and the setting sun glints off the domes and spires of churches and other buildings. Lights blink on along the Thames and the Palace of Westminster (Parliament buildings) take on a golden glow. Its no wonder that the view from the Eye has become popular in London.David White mail@KidsToLondon.com"

"Written September 2, 2016","Rudeness manner/behaviour/attitude of  FAZIL (fast track on duty ""desk staff"")","On Sept 2,  2016 (friday @ 12. 25 noon time)...a duty ""desk staff"" of fast track named FAZIL was NOT accommodating in his TONE of voice (as if he was  shouting to a deaf ,  non-english spreaking person)· This was seen, heard & observed by all of us in the queue ,  while he was impatiently  giving instructions to a certain elderly tourist couple about their tour voucher document of where to go in another queue from his desk.  When it was my time,  it was the same tone of voice as if no respect and courtesy even I greeted him pleasantly first.   When I responded and  he heard me speaking in English with an appearance of not happy of his tone of voice and general non-coutreous manner,  he pretended to continue (but still in an unfriendly manner / behaviour) the transactions I basically need that time (advance booking tickets for my guests and me). To get even to me and to continue his non-professional customer service behaviour,  he then brisckly ( as if in a throwing manner) placed my  tickets and reciept to a distant side of his front desk INSTEAD of handing it to my hand (like the other customers ahead of me ).   I told him straight that it's very rude to do that plus his behaviour / attitude in serving me.... And he bluntly said he doesn't care .. And added,  I was the one being rude conversing to him. As i left the fast track counter,  I then asked other staffs nearby of whom to report / escalate the incident to any duty manager that very time of that day. A very accommodating and friendly female manager named RACHEL JOHNS introduced herself and listenened about my grievances / complaints against the said staff (FAZIL),... she gave me an official ""complaints / praise"" document entitled ""London Eye Experience"" and waited for me to right the incident. While I was writing the incident another male manager (named SYDNEY) approached me and introduced himself as the direct manager of FAZIL.   He did asked questions regarding the incident as if he incriminate that it might be racism in my part of observing and reporting the matter... But I explained to him it is MORE on the manner / attitude/ behaviour on the point of a front desk customer service.  But,  it seems though that he was defending his staff (as if it was my fault and my behaviour that triggered the staff's behaviour) in my disposition and presence on that time of reporting / escalating the incident.  This was heard and witnessed in front of the other female manager (Rachel Johns) before the male manager (SYDNEY) left me ( bid me good day and hoping the incident wont ruin our tour). The female manager (Rachel Johns) took the document and promised to give it the the higher administration explaining to me that it's for reporting,  investigation and room for improvement for their service to the general public.   She added that i will also expect a feedback about the matter through my email soon. Respect and courtesy to anyone are the most universal key points of CUSTOMER SERVICE experience."
"Written July 21, 2016","Great views, a must to do while in London","My family rode the London Eye in July of 2016. Did we enjoy? Yes. Would we recommend it to friends? Yes. We bought our tickets online thinking that we wouldn’t have to wait in line at the attraction. This was wrong. We had to go wait in line and present our confirmation number in order to get our tickets. We also paid extra to get the Fast Track, thinking this would get us to the front of the line – it doesn’t. The Fast Track only gets you to the front of half the line. I estimate that buying the Fast Track ticket saved us about a 15-minute wait. However, there were 4 of us times £7 per ticket, that 15 minutes cost us £28. I don’t think it was worth it.If you found my review helpful, please let me know that by clicking the Helpful Button.

"Written November 28, 2015",A worthwhile experience. ,Fun. Great to see London from high above. Good initiation to London for those first timers. This 100 character rule that Trip Advisor has is silly. 
"Written October 4, 2015",Over-commercialized & obscured views,"I simply cannot believe they painted stuff onto the front of the viewing capsules for the Rugby! Fine, Coca Cola, you are sponsor of the Rugby World Cup, and happen to run the London Eye at the moment. This is NO REASON to paint stuff on the front of the capsules (yes, the bit from which you're supposed to be able to see Buckingham Palace and the wonderful parks of London) - instead of clear views, we saw black stripes!The other parts of the window that had no ads on them weren't very clean even though it was a dry day and had been dry for several before, so no excuses there either. There were black spots everywhere - this must not happen at an attraction that makes its money with views. The whole enterprise is also run sickeningly commercial, to a point that I have not experienced before. Everywhere it's ""upgrade this, buy that extra, how about adding on ..."" We were herded in front of photographers not just once, but at three different stages of the experience - photos available at the exit for a fee. Also the 4D experience - which I had thought to be a nice documentary flight over London - turned out to be nothing but a several minute advert for the London Eye: Random pictures of happy people and quick views of London cut together. Total waste of time. Yes, they do offer the best views over London, but at this price, waiting times (which can be absolutely horrendous and stretch the recommended visiting time from 30 minutes to closer to 2 hours!), and all the above points, I'll stick to looking at aerial pictures of it in the future."
"Written September 14, 2015",Birthday Present!,"Visited as part of a long weekend in London and had purchased the tickets as part of the London eye experience (4 attractions for a great price !)Ride time of 30 minutes just flew by, the wheel hardly looks to move when you are watching from the ground but once you are on it goes too quickly.The pods are spacious with plenty of space to move around in, we had a slightly cloudy evening for our flight but this didn't detract from the views at all, around a 25 mile view out over London and the surrounding areas in 360 degrees, the touch screens within the pods provide plenty of additional information should the views not be enough to hold your interest for 30 minutes.Queue time at 18:00 on a Saturday night we were expecting over an hour, however we were loaded into our pod within 20 minutes, the staff were all very friendly as well.Definitely worth a visit to see London from this vantage point."

The ticket lady promised it would be a maximum fifteen minute wait.  We timed it and sure enough we were on at about the 15 min mark.  Can't beat the view.  Awesome birds eye perspective.  Got gorgeous shots.   We stood in the area where a camera would take a picture of you from outside the capsule and we got a fantastic family photo!  But it was expensive to purchase.  All in all, a must do when in England but wouldn't do again."

The queues are long, the staff are ineffective at best (I am being extremely polite in that statement) and the cost is extortionate. On the day we  went (family of 2+2) the very cheapest ticket was £66, the queue was an hour long, the 4d experience was closed for fire alarm testing (seriously?!?!...this isn't a 24/7 operation, why can't they do this out of hours) and the toilets (both ladies and gents) were closed for cleaning leaving a 50 strong queue for the ONE disabled loo that was open.

"Written June 2, 2019",Little treat,The partner and I stayed at a nearby hotel on the 1st of June for a little day break. The London eye was one of our must do’s and we really enjoyed it. We didn’t bother with fast pass the que didn’t take too long maybe 25 mins. We didn’t bother printing the tickets I simply showed the people the one on our phone and they let us straight through. You get enough time and get to see the whole of London! Would recommend. 
"Written April 22, 2019",Expensive... but I recommend the VIP line to save you time,"So I am only giving this 3 stars, but mainly because of how expensive it is.  It was about $30 per person for the VIP line (otherwise, we would have been waiting over 2 hours)... and while I understand that the eye is likely expensive to operate, I just thought they were taking advantage of the fact that tourists will absolutely want to participate in the activity.  That said, I understand that I chose to pay for the VIP experience... but the line was REALLY long and we were limited on time.  Of course, the views at the top are amazing, and it is a must-do if you are in London, especially for the first time."
"Written April 20, 2019",Glad we have finally done it,We finally went on the London Eye after all these years of visiting the capital. We did go on a Bank Holiday which was probably pretty silly as the wait was 45 mins. However the view were very good as it was a clear day. The only real niggles that I had is that the windows of the capsule were filthy and there were a lot of people que jumping. We all agreed that we are pleased to have finally done the London Eye but there are other high viewing points in the capital which are less than £100 for a family of 4.
"Written February 21, 2019",Absolutely Amazing ,By far the best thing we have done in London so far. The views are phenomenal. The only thing is that I would strongly recommend that you buy the fast pass as the queues are very long (about 2 hours). Absolutely loved it!!! Will definitely come back

There isn't much to say other than it being a cruise up part, the most interesting part one would assume, of the Thames and back again, but the tour guide with his humours angle on any and everything, with sarcasm and a huge number of truly groan-worthy jokes made it an unexpectedly enjoyable tour."

It is a spectacular view of all of London, and right in front of Parliament and Big Ben. The photo opportunities are great and the Eye's two paid photos are worth every 2 pence. The champagne experience has a great guide -- we had the great Giovanni -- and is usually free of young children (which I like). After 20 minutes, it peaks at 135 meters or 443 feet! Superb.

There are breathtaking views of London and you can really get a sense of the City and its surrounding areas.  The Skip-the-Line is a MUST.  Otherwise you will have a very long wait.  With this ticket, you walk straight to the front of the line.  No wait at all."
"Written December 15, 2017",The weather really affected my rating on this one.,"It was really gloomy and showering when I went there so I wasn't really able to have a good view. So I recommend to check the weather before buying your tickets online (BUY ONLINE!) Oh yeah, they changed the name because of sponsoship into Coca Cola London Eye and now its red. Happy trip!"
"Written June 22, 2017",Not sure about the London Eye,"London Eye is a giant Ferris wheel moving 0.6 knots, takes about 30 minutes to complete the full loop.  The experience does not meet the cost however as the whole thing just seems a corporate sponsored blah experience but there are some great views of the city!  And it is kind of a must do while in London.   Tip - get the fast pass option, helps avoid the long lines.  "
"Written June 7, 2017",Take It for a Spin,"As with most attractions in London the admission onto the Eye is overpriced but on this occasion I didn't mind as we visited on a summers day with clear blue skies, and the views across London from the top are fantastic. I definitely recommend purchasing tickets in advance as even the fast track ques were quite lengthy. If you ever visit London I would definitely put the London Eye near the top of your to do list."
"Written May 9, 2017","Interesting enough, once you are on it. Terrible ticketing and queuing system.","A family group of 10 purchased tickets online for a timed 'flight' at 2.45. We turned up just after 2.00pm to discover you had to join the general queue to exchange our online tickets for actual tickets. This pointless process took 40mins. Once we had our actual tickets we were then instructed to join another queue to board the ride. This is possibly the worst planned queueing system I've ever experienced. You join the queue and snake around until you reach the wide walk way called Southbank which runs next to the river.You are then stopped by an employee and when space allows you are released to cross the walkway and join the second part of the queue on the other side.  We eventually boarded the ride at 3.50pm for a 2.45pm flight. We had prepaid, timed train tickets leaving London at 4.20pm and with the ride taking 30mins we had to miss our train. We tried to explain to 3 different staff members how unhappy and frustrated we were. They were so disinterested or poorly trained that any expression of dissatisfaction was greeted with the answer - ""I don't have to tolerate being shouted at"" or something of the like. (Which we weren't.) We eventually asked to see the duty manager who possessed equally poor customer service skills and referred us the a website complaints procedure. The 30mins you are on the eye is quite interesting but sadly not good enough to out weigh the hassle of trying to get on. I can't help wondering how many of our foreign visitors also have a shocking experience but just don't bother complaining. This is an over-priced rip off and Coca Cola should be ashamed of their association with this tourist trap."
"Written April 29, 2017",Great ONLY with Fastpass tickets,"The iconic eye is a lot of fun.  It is everything you would expect it to be: a quirky attraction with great views and a cool experience.  I thought that the height would be an issue for some in our group, but it wasn't at all.  The pod is very big once in it, and it feels like you are standing in a high building, rather than a ride.  The movement is hard to notice.  One note one this- pay the extra money to get the ANYTIME Fastpass.  The wait is otherwise hours long. Even those with timed advanced ticket passes were waiting at least an hour.  It is very important to note that once you have the anytime pass you must go directly to the base of the wheel to the only real fastpass line (not to any of the other 5-6 ticket entrances). The other entrances will give you a new timestamp ticket, often for a much later time, even with an anytime ticket. Not sure if this is a ploy to thin out the crowd or the numerous uninformed workers.  This happened to us (we realized and ditched it) and many others who often realized too late.  Once we knew where to go, we literally walked on the wheel past 100s of others.  Well worth it!"
"Written April 3, 2017",Incompetent staff and no customer service,"We had looked forward to a great river cruise with fantastic weather and booked our tickets in advance online. We arrived more than 15 minutes before the scheduled departure. Upon boarding, we were told we can only sit inside because the upper deck was full. The inside offers very limited views and was completely stuffy and warm. When we asked if we could take the next boat, we were told to go to the ticket office and they would take care of us. After waiting in line for another 15 minutes at the ticket office, we were only then told there would be a £10 change fee per ticket. After asking to speak with a supervisor, we were told the same thing. Very rude, incompetent and misinformed staff, both on the boat and at the ticket office. The supervisor has the authority to make decisions about as much as a random head of cabbage. Zero sense of customer service. We reviewed the online ticket offering and there was no mention anywhere of not being able to choose inside or outside seating, nor a mention of any change fees.JUST REALLY BAD SERVICE AND ZERO CUSTOMER CENTRICITY!!!There are enough other cruise offerings available in London, which I have personally experienced and are much more centered on the customer experience than this ""company"".In case someone from the Coca-Cola Company actually reads this: Do something with the staff here -- it is tarnishing your brand!Overall: FIND ANOTHER BOAT CRUISE TO TAKE. WE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE. "
"Written March 5, 2017",£100 for family of 5 and long queues ,The attraction is good but highly overpriced for a 45 minute experience and extremely long queues. The main point is a view of Big Ben. You can get a better view for free 3 minutes away at Westminster bridge. The other sites are too far away to get a good view of. The queues are very long even with prebooked tickets. Tip is to prebook standard tickets online and go for the earliest time. Beware on the website that the tickets offered are more expensive tickets. You need to look for the standard tickets.
"Written September 2, 2016","Rudeness manner/behaviour/attitude of  FAZIL (fast track on duty ""desk staff"")","On Sept 2,  2016 (friday @ 12. 25 noon time)...a duty ""desk staff"" of fast track named FAZIL was NOT accommodating in his TONE of voice (as if he was  shouting to a deaf ,  non-english spreaking person)· This was seen, heard & observed by all of us in the queue ,  while he was impatiently  giving instructions to a certain elderly tourist couple about their tour voucher document of where to go in another queue from his desk.  When it was my time,  it was the same tone of voice as if no respect and courtesy even I greeted him pleasantly first.   When I responded and  he heard me speaking in English with an appearance of not happy of his tone of voice and general non-coutreous manner,  he pretended to continue (but still in an unfriendly manner / behaviour) the transactions I basically need that time (advance booking tickets for my guests and me). To get even to me and to continue his non-professional customer service behaviour,  he then brisckly ( as if in a throwing manner) placed my  tickets and reciept to a distant side of his front desk INSTEAD of handing it to my hand (like the other customers ahead of me ).   I told him straight that it's very rude to do that plus his behaviour / attitude in serving me.... And he bluntly said he doesn't care .. And added,  I was the one being rude conversing to him. As i left the fast track counter,  I then asked other staffs nearby of whom to report / escalate the incident to any duty manager that very time of that day. A very accommodating and friendly female manager named RACHEL JOHNS introduced herself and listenened about my grievances / complaints against the said staff (FAZIL),... she gave me an official ""complaints / praise"" document entitled ""London Eye Experience"" and waited for me to right the incident. While I was writing the incident another male manager (named SYDNEY) approached me and introduced himself as the direct manager of FAZIL.   He did asked questions regarding the incident as if he incriminate that it might be racism in my part of observing and reporting the matter... But I explained to him it is MORE on the manner / attitude/ behaviour on the point of a front desk customer service.  But,  it seems though that he was defending his staff (as if it was my fault and my behaviour that triggered the staff's behaviour) in my disposition and presence on that time of reporting / escalating the incident.  This was heard and witnessed in front of the other female manager (Rachel Johns) before the male manager (SYDNEY) left me ( bid me good day and hoping the incident wont ruin our tour). The female manager (Rachel Johns) took the document and promised to give it the the higher administration explaining to me that it's for reporting,  investigation and room for improvement for their service to the general public.   She added that i will also expect a feedback about the matter through my email soon. Respect and courtesy to anyone are the most universal key points of CUSTOMER SERVICE experience."
"Written July 21, 2016","Great views, a must to do while in London","My family rode the London Eye in July of 2016. Did we enjoy? Yes. Would we recommend it to friends? Yes. We bought our tickets online thinking that we wouldn’t have to wait in line at the attraction. This was wrong. We had to go wait in line and present our confirmation number in order to get our tickets. We also paid extra to get the Fast Track, thinking this would get us to the front of the line – it doesn’t. The Fast Track only gets you to the front of half the line. I estimate that buying the Fast Track ticket saved us about a 15-minute wait. However, there were 4 of us times £7 per ticket, that 15 minutes cost us £28. I don’t think it was worth it.If you found my review helpful, please let me know that by clicking the Helpful Button.

When you book online in advance make this your first ticket as it's the busiest and it becomes a fastrack ticket. We went at 6:30 pm it is an amazing view in the dark!

"Written January 8, 2015",New Year Fireworks 2015,"One of the highlights of my/the London calendar are the New Year Fireworks at the London Eye.I have for the past 7 years without fail attended this fantastic event...some years arriving early (very good) and some years not so early (not so good!).In 2013 I made absolutely certain of getting a good spot on the Victoria Embankment by arriving really early at 12noon and made sure I stayed in the same spot directly opposite the London Eye...good move as I had a ringside seat...so to speak ;)However, this last year 2014, things were spoiled a wee bit by the introduction of a £10 price tag, tickets for which had to be booked in advance and with only 100,000 released as you can imagine they sold out pdq. :( boo hoo. I was totally unimpressed, whilst I do realise the reasoning behind this new format, I was still pretty annoyed LOLAnyway, I didn't buy a ticket (stubborn) and so when I arrived in London to see the fireworks I had to find a new spot.....I eventually ended up on Horse Guards and although I couldn't see the lower section of the display, I along with hundreds of other spectators had a fabulous view of the fireworks as they shot up into the air above the London skyline.What an extraordinary sight!  They really are the most spectacular fireworks you could imagine, with bursts of colour, stunning effects, smiley faces and hearts galore, the sounds still travelled to where we were, albeit not as loud as if you are right there on the Victoria Embankment and the crowd roared as the countdown began, oooed and aahhed at each new burst of rockets with wild cheering at the beginning and end of the display.A fantastic event and a must-see on the London calendar. Do however be aware that this is now a ticketed event and you will have to be sharp about it if you wish to attend.I will endeavour to keep an eye on when tickets are due to be released and post the link on my twitter feed @3days_in_london as well as on the #3DIL App (which is free to download by the way).All the best. I hope that if you are planning a trip to London to see the fireworks that you manage to get a ticket.....if not, then Horse Guards, if it open to the public is a really good spot....but as usual...get there early, this is a very popular event. I must also state that if you are planning on taking children, be prepared for a long wait in the queue and also for crowding after the event when folks want to leave in a hurry.fyi....the London Underground usually has free travel on the transport system from 23:45 - 04:30 on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day...for more information on that visit www.tfl.gov.uk closer to the time.Have a great stay in London. p.s. I have given this a 4-star rating only because of the ticketing of the event. It is in itself a 5+-star event"
"Written November 13, 2014",Terrible experience,"Out of everything I did and went to see in London. My experience at the London Eye was the worst. The day I went was what they call a ""holiday"" and because of this was extremely full. I had to be in the ticket line for about 45 minutes, by the time I was able to purchase my ticket they said they only had room for the 4:00 pm and that I need it to be there 30 minutes earlier. I left I came back at 3:15pm and there was HUGE line to get to the ride. I got in line and the employee asked me to get out because it was not my time, so I did. At 3:30 pm I got in line where they explained that it was over an hour wait to get in to the ride. I was outraged!!!! How can it be over an hour wait?! They already know the capability of the ride, how can it take you longer to get there even if its a holiday. I told them that was not acceptable since I Had complied with all of their directions and when I wanted to get in line earlier they did not wanted. They only explanation that they gave me was that it was a holiday. That is ridiculous.... You know what is your volume and capacity of people per time and need to accommodate personnel to comply with your schedule. I went in and requested a refund, had a very difficult time to get the refund because they thought I should understand that it a holiday. What they don't understand is that I am on vacation on a extremely tight schedule and don't have time to waste for ride that cost over $30 for only 30 minutes. After a while I did get a refund. It is not worth your time and money. Personnel was not helpful and treated me like they were doing me a favor instead of understanding that they were being paid to accommodate for each individual paying them. DONT waste time and money on this attraction. Lots of other things to do and see in London."
"Written November 4, 2014",The London Eye - One of the most terrifying ride in the world,So we went to The London Eye. It looked like a giant Wheel but near a river. It was weird because people would pay money to sit in these little cars as it went round.It got very high and I saw Big Ben at night.I properly bricked it as all the sides are made from glass and to the untrained eye look as if you could fall out. (they should look to covering the windows as it makes the whole thing very scary).If they covered the windows and had maybe a hotdog seller inside I would ride again.No way I'm pay to feel like I could die any second. No way.
"Written October 7, 2014",ITS A TRAP!,"The words of the famous admiral best captures this ""attraction"". During my trip, we had the good foresight to get the fast track tickets so we did not have to stand and wait in an agonizingly long line. But even that failed to save this ""attraction"".Once you board, you go up on a very slow ferris wheel. Then you go down. And that's pretty much it. At the top you get a mediocre view of London and the Thames. But since you're in a giant slow moving Ferris Wheel, there's no opportunity to escape even if you wanted to. And boy, if I could, I would've definitely chosen to escape because it was not worth a fraction of the cost paid."

"Written May 29, 2014",Not for those who are claustrophobic or don't like heights!,"My friend wanted to do the London Eye - I don't like heights and have a tendancy to panic in small enclosed spaces, so I wasn't too happy with the idea.  The view, if the weather is good, is breath taking: it's a different perspective and needs some thinking before you can identify certain sights you normally see at ground level.  Fortunately, the wheel turns slowly but steadily and the trip is over in about 1/2 and hour: a few more minutes and I would have been having a full blown panic attach!  Would I do it again? No - because I was seriously uncomfortable BUT, if you do not have my issues it is really worth while!"
"Written May 28, 2014",A Bird's Eye View of London,"This is an excellent way to get an unusual view of London. You get close-up views of the Thames, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament and, as you go higher, you can see into the gardens of Buckingham Palace and have a Bird's Eye view of many of the main tourist attractions in London without all the travel. On a good day you can see for 25-30 miles from the top - as far as Dartford and the Thames Estuary. If you get the chance, also have a go at night - the lights of London are spectacular. Although you can just turn up and get a ticket in the less busy times, it is better to book."
"Written May 20, 2014",Jockey for the best views but be prepared to pay a princely sum for them,"Ferris wheels were so romantic in the movies. You think how Ryan Gosling hung precariously by a bar in order to force Rachel McAdams to go out with him in ""The Notebook"". Or go back further and remember how James Dean stole a kiss from a guilt-ridden Julie Harris in ""East of Eden"". Or even further than that in ""The Third Man"" when Orson Welles gave Harry Lime's famous cuckoo clock speech to Joseph Cotten just as they got off the Wiener Riesenrad in Vienna's Prater amusement park. Oh wait, that wasn't romantic, but neither is the London Eye which is somewhat similar to the Riesenrad in that it features compartments rather than seats to accommodate incoming passengers.However, the compartments in the London Eye are actually air-conditioned ovoidal capsules with 360-degree views that can fit up to 25 people at a time. There's a wooden bench in the middle, but people rarely sit on it for the thirty-minute duration of the ride because everyone feels a need to take in all of London while taxing the cameras on their smartphones to no end. That's certainly what Jamie W. and I did as we elbowed our way in front of the views of the Houses of Parliament and all the other majestic sights along the Thames River. We all had to dodge toddlers, extended family units, and delegations of foreign tourists in order to get photos that appear like we are the only ones aboard the capsule. Getting most of the photogenic angles took up the entire ride, that's for sure.For all that effort, the admission is pretty steep, I mean Disneyland-steep. Retaining a vivid memory of the long queues I saw on my last visit to London a decade back, I thought it would be worthwhile to invest in the Fast Track ticket which allows you to skip the longer line to pop right into a capsule. Perhaps on a weekend afternoon, that would have made sense, but on a Monday morning, it was overkill since there was barely a dozen people in the regular line. A Fast Track ticket costs a whopping £ 29.50, which means for the two of us, we spent almost $100 for that half-hour. Hookers cost less, even the ones with good teeth. and shame on the indifferent woman at the ticket desk who didn't bother to point out that the 4D cinema experience was included. They could have at least thrown in a free fridge magnet."

If you are in London for many days, wait for a clear day so you can really see the sights.  On dreary rainy days it is hard to see that far."
"Written March 31, 2008",Skip London Eye If You Are On A Budget,"I gave the London Eye a neutral rating or a three rating because I'm torn.  As far as the views of the Thames, Parliment, Big Ben, it is a five and I do think it is a great attraction for London to have.  On the flip side I wish I had not paid 33BP which was $68.67USD on 3/15/08 for my husband and I to get on it.  It was recommended to us as a ""not to miss"".  We went at dusk because we had heard that was the best time to go to see the lights of London.  We didn't have to wait long in line ....just a few minutes and off we were in the glass pod of the ferris wheel.  I'm normally afraid of heights but the London Eye is so well done and felt so safe that I wasn't afraid.  There is a very large bench in the middle of the ""pod"" so you can sit down if you need to.  Takes about 30 minutes to go around.  There is room for you to move around in the pod to see different sides so you aren't just standing there like in an elevator.  We are on a budget and though the experience was nice, I wish we had done something else with our money.  It just wasn't that memorable.  If you have cash to spare then go for it!  If not, spend your money doing something else.  It really isn't that big a deal so don't feel like you are missing something huge.  We bought the London Eye guide book for about 3BP and wish we hadn't bought it either.  We looked at it for about 5 minutes then got tired of looking at it and looking out the pod to find buildings that are miniscule from your vantage point on the Eye.  Since you only have 30 minutes in the air you are better off just looking out the pod and skipping the guide book.  Overall:  nice experience if you have alot of money but would not recommend for the average tourist.  Just isn't that big a deal and it only lasts 30 minutes."
"Written November 6, 2007",Must do when in London,"Absolutely loved this, it was much better than expected.  We decided not to book in advance as my hubby (who is scared of heights) was not sure if he would go on with me.  We got to the booking office at 10.00 am on a sunday morning - the queue to buy tickets was actually shorter than the one to collect prepaid tickets.  Within 10-15 minutes had bought tickets and were on the eye.  We must have picked a good day and time as we expected to queue for hours as people had put on the advisor.  The views were superb there was only about 12 people in the pod - so loads of room to walk about and get different views.  Even my hubby enjoyed it (once we had got about half way up he actually stood up!)  Would highly recommend this and put it on my list of must do's when in london.  We even purchased the photo at the end a bit pricey at £7.50 but I think my other half wanted proof that he had actually been on!"

Arrived at 11.00am and we queued for 2.5 hours.  Don't be fooled by these fast track tickets as a lot of people with us in the queue had been 'caught' in the same way.

It was all organised when we got there, no problem, didn't have to wait long to get on.We were also lucky in that we only had to share the capsule with one other couple so had great access and unimpeded views.  It was good, but it's not like you can take great photos as the capsules are that scratched up plastic material.I would only recommend it to those with heaps of time and the money to spare, it's not a must see or do in London.  I'd rather recommend St Pauls where the views are just as brilliant with no perspex between me and the view (plus all the other St Pauls benefits)."

One can scarcely imagine the South side of the Thames without it anymore. It is the world’s largest observation wheel and gives a unique view of London. We booked our tickets on-line in advance and got a fairly decent price. We arrived a little after the recommend time, but this being a Monday morning, the line was fairly short (<5 minutes). I highly recommend coming earlier in the day as the queue really starts growing with tourists and school groups after 12 noon. We had a beautiful, clear, sunny day and the flight was great, but I think even a cloudy day might still be fun. A nighttime flight must be amazing!To say that the “flight” is fantastic, gorgeous, wonderful and exhilarating would not be overselling it! The Eye itself is a thrilling technological and engineering sight. The wheel moves smoothly and effortlessly and the clear capsules give a remarkable view. The one downside is that there is no map, no narration, no displays, so it is often hard to understand what you are seeing. With other observation wheels or towers like the Washington Monument or Empire State Building, there is usually some kind of signage that tells you what you are seeing. On the London Eye, you are left to wonder – what is that funny large building over on the right (it was The Gherkin), or where is Trellick Tower? And since most of your fellow travelers are also tourists – they don’t have a clue either. It would really add to this experience to have signage that helped you understand what you are looking at.That aside, the London Eye is a fantastic way to seeing one of the world’s largest, more complicated cities at a leisurely pace."
"Written March 14, 2007","Out of this World, Brilliant, Fantastic and Impressive","The BA London Eye is truly the number one attraction in Britain. I did the 30 minute trip on March 9 about 2:30 p.m. It’s a short distance away from the Waterloo Station so you better get a train there. The weather was fantastic, a bit chilly and there wasn’t heavy cloud cover. I bought the ticket for £14.50 and just had to wait about 20 minutes before I was able to enter a capsule. The lines are long but they move fast. Security is efficient and once you follow the rules you’ll be through quickly. I also got a guide book for £5 just before I got on with all the views you’ll see and it identified exactly what each was. This was really helpful. Just look at the pictures I’ve attached and see the breathtaking views to be had. There were only 16 people in my capsule and there was enough room for everyone to get around and take loads of pictures. My Sony DC was good enough to zoom in and take a good picture of Buckingham Palace. After the ride, I went into the Gift Shop to get myself some souvenirs. I got some nice chocolate for £1.50 each. Also, a BA draw string bag with a monocular, guide book and key ring for £13.50. I got my friend a mouse pad as well, can’t remember the cost. Overall, it is worth it. I would recommend it to anyone, old and young. Don’t be afraid of the height, it’s only 450 feet above the ground at its highest point. What’s more, the Eye moves so slowing, you barely notice it’s moving. If you stand from Westminster Bridge it looks like if it’s static. On another note, I categorically disagree with the views here that it is overrated and overpriced. That project cost millions of pounds to conceptualise and develop and millions more to maintain yearly. This piece of engineering magic is a definite on your next trip to London."
"Written October 20, 2006",A must for tourist,Been both in day time and night time. There was a full moon so it looked amazing. Remember to turn camera flash off so you dont get light bouncing off the glass. Yes there are queues and waits but isnt it the same for every tourist attraction in the world? I've had to wait longer for attractions in the states. If you are not in london for long i would do the Eye as you get a birdseye view of the city and you can really take it in. I dont think i realised how beautiful London is (kind of took it for granted living in the next county) until i went up the Eye both times. Then i realised how lucky i was and why people come from all over the world to visit it. It has history and beauty all visible from your pod.
"Written October 13, 2006",The Queue was long but was worth the wait.,"It was the first famous landmark I visited on my first trip to London in March this year. It was a miserable, cold day and I missed my stop.  The big bus people were so friendly. They told me how to get there. I couldn't imagine the different nationalities visiting at the same time. Got to the comfort room first, then a bit of refreshment at Mc.Donald. (However do we survive the hunger and thirst without them?  I joined the queue. It was long. I had to wait for the next intake. The girl at the ticket place gave us some hints so we won't experience the dreaded phobia of heights!I got to sit. Some brave people just stood and looked out. I started chatting with a couple from rural England there on their first visit too. It was the gentleman's 60th birthday present. So his lady and I chatted in between photo taking. As far as wecan see we can behold glorious sights. Excellent view. I would go on it again the next time I visit England.It is a must-see. Forget the long wait to get up there. Just do it.It is worth the wait.Emily RuddSydney, Australia"
"Written July 16, 2011",Mirian Does London,The London Eye is a must see.  The views are incredulous.  You must do the 4D experience which is included in the ticket cost.

"Written June 29, 2011",Definitely go for the VIP,"We bought our tickets online prior to our trip, and opted for the basic VIP package. Nothing fancy, but allows you to skip the queue. I think it wound up only costing 2 pounds more than the regular admission bought on site (you get additional savings online). When we arrived on a beautiful sunny afternoon, the lineup was horrific. We were able to walk right up to guest services, grab our reserved tickets, and then go through a separate entrance and were on board in less than 5 minutes. I'm sure the line was at least 2 hours! You also get a cool circular map that shows you all of the major landmarks you will see from the top.The London Eye is just one of those typical touristy things that you have to do in London. Great city views and it's a cool experience."
"Written March 10, 2011",Book online. Be prepared for cloud!,"The notorious british weather can really throw a spanner in the works. Unless it is foggy you should still be able to see as far as St Paul's and easily see Big Ben/Parliament as it is opposite!The ride moves so slowly you do not feel the movement; takes a good 20 minutes to go round. worth it if your first time to London. Lovely setting, good place from where to get perspective. And if your glass is half full, a cloudy day may not be bad. If the sun was out you would not be able to take photos in one direction because of the glare and it would reflect off the glass of the bubble. So yes, go for a cloudy day!!! Hopefully you don't end up with one of the two sunny days a year in England!No, really, enjoy it. Worth it.Hey kids: Big Ben/Parliament..."
"Written January 30, 2011",Nice view!!,"The london eye, on a clear sunny day, is a must experience. so if you are lucky with the british weather, do not hesitate to take a ride up, and see london from above, while the eye slowly spins around. the ""tour"" is very enjoyable and relaxing. it can get crowded but tourist on certain times, try to avoid that if possible."
"Written January 22, 2011",Great views and fantastic steel structure,"This monster wheel is 135 metres tall steel structure situated on the banks of the River Thames. The views from the city are gorgeous, no need to say something about it to convince you to jump in it. Each air-conditioned egg-shaped capsule can carry 25 people! Even by night you can have a great experience like the one we had. To make your life easier, just buy the tickets in advance online at their official web-site."
"Written August 14, 2009","Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it","I took relatives to this attraction last weekend.  As a native Londoner, I was quite frankly shocked and appalled by the experience.  I cannot believe we treat tourists like this.  I prebooked online to be sure of the flight time, I turned up to collect my prebooked tickets to be faced with an horrendous line to pick the up.  There was absolutely no one queue for tickets bought on the day.  Lesson learned, don't pre book.  I prebooked for a flight time of 12.30 and having collected my tickets with 30 minutes to spare went to see where the entrance was for our timed flight of 12.30.  There is only one entrance and I was directed to the queue - It was many hundreds deep.  I said I had a timed flight for 12.30 and they said yes, this was the queue!!! I was appalled. I was told it would take no more than 30 mins to get on the Eye.  It was very hot and uncomfortable in the queue - it was also very chaotic with many people 'jumping the queue - Eye staff seemed to have very little control over it.At 12.30 I had only moved about 10 metres and there was still about 600 people in front of us.  I again spoke to staff who said it would take no more than 30 mins to get to the front of the queue - I said I'd already been waiting 30 mins!  I asked for my money back on the ticket but they refused saying I was already in the queue!.  It took 1 hour and 20 mins to get to the front.There is no excuse for the way tourists were treated by Eye staff, there are many attractions in London which are popular and crowded.  We visited Madam Tussauds the day before and although the queues were long we had a very positive experience.  The Eye experience is over rated and as a native Londoner can honestly say you get a better view of the attractions from the top of a double decker bus. Please avoid this attraction."
"Written July 12, 2009",Loved our time on the London Eye..... did we have to get off?,"Our family of 4 - children aged 8 & 12 - very much enjoyed our visit on the London Eye. We were skeptical because of the mixed reviews, cost and being afraid of heights.... but all of that was put to rest with in the first few moments on board. It is a relaxing way to take in the sights of London from several altitudes and vantage points. We booked the more expensive, reserved time slot ticket so as not to waste any time waiting in queue. We were pleased with our choice. The pod/capsule is quite comfortable and secure feeling. The bench is quite nice for those who might be bothered by the height or need a place to rest. Our children were literally mesmerized by the sights and constantly asked what is that, what is over there? We were also given a guide book that helped point out specific landmarks as you face different directions. We took in the gift shop after our ride and purchased the picture package that they take of you on board as a remembrance. We stayed at the Marriott County Hall in 1999 right before the Eye was built and were thrilled to see how bustling this area now is in London. There are plenty of places to dine or take away from. The Eye is an easy walk from Waterloo train/tube station. We highly recommend this attraction while visiting London."
"Written May 7, 2009","Unavoidable if travelling with kids, but a real ripoff","If you are travelling with a child, you will be magnetically attracted to the giant Ferris wheel across the Thames.  It's run by British Airways, and trying to get on board is exactly like trying to board a plane.  First, the tickets are sold in the County Hall building across from the wheel.  The queue is long, snaking back and forth.  In the best Disney fashion, there are entertainment screens hawking more merchandise.  Unlike Disney, there is also a ""line hustler"" who tells people to move up if they've become too entranced by the videos.  Walk up tickets were 17 GBP adult, 8.50 child.  I was going to book in advance for the 10% discount but I had heard from others that if the weather isn't nice, you really can't see much.  After you have your tickets, you go through a security check line, which turns into the boarding line.  This is the moment when you want to carefully observe those scrambling to get in line with you.  Any crying babies?  Hyperactive toddlers?  Time to be courteous and let them in way ahead of you--or else you will be sealed into a capsule with them and 20 other new best friends for 30 minutes.  The view is nice, but 30 minutes is way too long a time to be cooped up in a glass bowl.  On the sunny side of the capsule, you feel like a bug under a magnifying glass; the air conditioning just can't cope.  Finally, just as in Disney, when you do exit the ""flight"", you are deposited right into the gift shop.   After having been gouged to go on the Eye, we were able to have a hearty, cheap meal at Chopstix, an all you can eat Chinese buffet, located in the same building where the Eye tickets are sold."

Then come on down to London's overpriced oversized ferris wheel and unnecessarily put yourself and your family through a post 9/11 security nightmare.   Arabic speakers may want to remain silent in the 2 hour queue (Search BBC News 'Dubai Family Eye' for details) and parents with prams should keep them close at all times or face aggressive threats of ejection from understandably paranoid security guards.

"Written May 31, 2021",Dangerously not Covid safe,"We were given free tickets as our son had bought them but not used them. On arriving, we saw a massive queue, snaking , hundreds of people long. We were told to come back nearer our ticket time. We asked the man taking the temperatures 2 questions. Both of them he got completely wrong but his answers swayed up into coming back to join the queue. We asked him: how long is the queue time from this point for standard ticket holders. His answer: 30 mins. Actual: over 1 hour. The next question. How many people in each pod: his answer: max 2 households. Actual: 6 households. There was no social distancing at all, people were on top of each other in the queue. There were no stewards telling people to keep apart or to wear face masks, most people weren’t. Even once you had past the security check you get to an inside part, most people were not wearing masks there ( there was just a sign). It was the most Covid unsafe place I have seen so far and it makes perfect sense now how this virus is spreading. This place needs to be closed down. They are obviously just money grabbers who don’t want to lose money and would prefer to risk people’s lives."

"Written August 25, 2012",Must See in London!,"My in laws and kids (two teens) LOVED the experience of going on the London Eye. Going on the London Eye allows you to take in the whole view of the city of London, and it is a great orientation. The cars move so slowly that you can barely tell that you are moving, so there is no problem with motion sickness. We enjoyed being high up, but some with a fear of heights might find it challenging. We thought that this experience was a highlight of our whole trip to London and we highly recommend it to others. My advice is to pre-purchase timed tickets at least a day in advance, once you know (based on the weather forecast) that there will be clear skies the next day. It would be sad to get stuck going on the London Eye on a rainy day."

"Written October 12, 2011",A little expensive,"Do not get bogged down by the title. It depends on what kind of things attract you.  I was personally a little disappointed with the snail paced giant wheel. Also the whole point of the ride was to get a view of London from the top.  I went with a couple of friends and they shared the same thought.  Take it if  you are the kind of person who enjoys aerial view and stuff like that. Also, I could see a lot of kids getting excite. For me especially at that price, it is thumbs downNote: Check out the london attraction pass which combines London eye with Madame Tussauds, sea life, thames cruise and other combinations. If you book it online, you can avoid the long queue and get some discount too."

The kids were fascinated by the fantastic views and since our capsule was not too crowded it was easy to get a good look. Really enjoyable experience! In fact, we visited three main London attractions that day, the dungeon, the london eye and Sea Life Aquarium, and the kids all agreed that the London Eye was the best part of the day!"

"Written September 3, 2019",Better Options For a Birds Eye View of the City,"When we booked out trip to London, this was the first attraction we scheduled. It turned out that it was the most touristy location we visited and it bordered on frustrating. You do book a time for your ""flight"" by picking a 15 minute time slot. Realistically this is only to control the flow of people arriving at the attraction. )There were people in line ahead of us with times 2 hours after ours.) We were in line for over an hour before entering the pod which we shared with approximately 40 people. The whole process had an overall feeling of cattle being herded.The views of the city were great but the pod windows were quite dirty which detracted from the view. Not the attractions fault but...75% of the people spent the full 30 minutes trying to take the perfect selfie, not caring about blocking other people's views etc. I'm not sure some of them every looked out at the city. We did buy the companion ticket that included the river tour. The river tour portion was excellent! We were on the river for approximately 40 minutes and went as far east down the river as Tower Bridge. The guide was funny, witty and very informative. Well worth the small, additional cost.If we knew then what we know now, we would have booked a river cruise and booked either the Sky Garden (free) or The Shard for our view from above! "

Not sure what the limit is but it felt close.Anyway, nice slow tour of the London roofs. Trying to avoid the selfies in the pod was an event due to the number of people trying to make room for each other.On the way down, the rollercoaster bug has latched on to the Eye. Stand up against the window folks and get ready for another photo. Bear in mind the place to stand is about 5 feet wide, I was immediately surrounded by half the pod.Not that I was interested in buying, but I checked out our photo in the shop down below. There was me, the wife, my daughter and 4 others in the frame. Not one to be displayed at home methinks. Included in the entrance fee is a 4D cinema show of a seagull flying over London.

However, there was this family and the two young children in that family were drinking and spilling it all over the floor which wasn’t great, it caused not just us but the rest of the members of the public to have to walk around it and it was an obstacle for everyone.

Honestly I was going because it was something my partner dearly wanted to do, turns out, I enjoyed it more than him! Fantastic views and I never had a single moment of fear re heights, it moves so slowly it’s hardly noticeable and is so stable you don’t get that feeling of “it’s going to collapse any minute”! I say feel the fear and do it anyway - it is soooo worth it. "
"Written November 17, 2019",Fun,"First time riders and in London so we weren't sure what ticket to purchase was we head there could be pretty long waits if you go at the wrong time. Luckily we walked over, purchased our tickets online 45 min prior and walked straight on. No wait, no fast pass ticket. Standard ticket saved ourselves a few pounds 👌🏽overall definitely worth the ride. Beautiful scenery at night with London lit up!"
"Written October 31, 2019",Beautiful Sunset,As a Londoner I finally bit the Bullet and took my 8 Year old Daughter on the Eye. Although it was ridiculously expensive (£82 For Fast track for two) I think the experience was worth it. Went around Sunset and was rewarded with stunning Winter Sunset over the Capitol! Priceless I guess.
"Written October 27, 2019",Awesome views must do,"Do this. Make sure you pre book. Fast track. Pay the extra well worth it. Get in early. We went on a Sunday around 10:20am little line. Great day for us could see all over London. Staff supper friendly and helpful, even security are nice, say hello to them. Yes it's touristy but what a view. "
"Written October 18, 2019",Great view over London,"It is a really impressive construction and you get a nice view over entire London.It can be a little bit pricey and I suggest you to buy the tickets in advance. If you buy them in advance (online) you can pick your tickets up in ‘the office’ near to the Eye.It is a good experience, but it isn’t my favourite attraction and the minus for me is that you have to pick (for standard ticket) 15min slot and also everything extra is really more expensive (fast line for example - around 10£ more)."
"Written October 14, 2019",Pretty ,This was really cool to see. Didn't go on it because it was a little too expensive. But it was pretty to see from boat tour. 
"Written October 11, 2019",Disappointed,"We used National Rail’s offer of 2 for 1 to buy tickets for the Eye. I’m so pleased we did because for 3 of us, the tickets only came out at just under £20 each rather than the full £30 and it wasn’t really worth even the £20. On board the ride, you get brilliant views over the London sky-line but there is no information as to what you are looking at. I’m told there used to be commentary pointing out features but that doesn’t seem to be available anymore. Neither is there a map with places of interest pointed out or even a compass point. "
"Written October 9, 2019",Worth the visit and great price,"We ended up buying the ticket at the pier since we didnt want to chance of being late or constricted. We waited in line for about 15 min, bought the tickets for both the boat and the london eye and eight away went into the line. The line was about 40 min wait but it was moving and the time went by quick. The ride was nice and we didnt have too many people on the london eye booth so we were able to take pictures without anyone pushing. The boat ride was great. It was a little chilly but you get to see the london from the boat and the guide was quite funny. Glad we did it and the price is great. So if you sidnt want to book it ahead of time you can just buy the package for the same price by the pier and not have to worry about being late for your time."
"Written February 26, 2020",Great views ,About 30 minute wait— it is February.  I suspect it’s longer in the summer months.  Great views of London.  Lots of options in the area.  
"Written February 26, 2020",A must-do even if you don’t like heights,What’s great way to take a break from walking around London and take in the view! I have to admit I don’t enjoy heights but being inside a large capsule like this wasn’t bad at all. It moves very slowly and you have lots of time to take great photos. I am glad we decided to give this a try.
"Written February 21, 2020",Worth the experience,"My husband, Aunt and I took my 10 year old son on the London Eye today. He has special needs and came home from school with a 50% off voucher. We booked 2 adult tickets and 1 Child. As our son receives DLA we knew we would be entitled to a free Carer ticket (to be purchased on the day.) At 50% off it seemed a great deal.The process was fairly painless. We purchased our carer ticket from kiosk 1&2 (showing appropriate evidence) and were given Fast Track access for us all. There was a queue as you would expect but it moved smoothly and we went through security painlessly. The flight was good fun. Be aware that the bubbles don’t stop for boarding so be prepared to be hussled on like in a ski lift! The views were fantastic and our son thoroughly enjoyed spotting trains and boats from the air whilst we scoured the skyline for the sights.I’m not sure we would pay full price for fast track tickets given the option so we were glad of the free upgrade. Our son wears a sunflower lanyard signifying hidden disabilities and feel that was a good visual marker for security etc.Lovely day out."
"Written February 21, 2020",A must do,"A must do when in London. On our half term family trip we had a lovely afternoon ride around the London Eye. You get great views north and south, sometimes people are a little nervous or a little reluctant to move around. Some focus on the Houses of Parliament. But without moving around you don’t get a good view of the city, the shard, buck house, St James’ park, the south bank, etc.You also get a 4d ride in county hall behind which is a nice few minutes fun too. Fast track means you queue less but the capacity of the eye is quite high so the standard queue turns over quite quick. If you’ve got the money do the vip and have the space to enjoy and move around freely."
"Written February 11, 2020",London Eye,"It cost £29 but a great view of the city. Its brilliant it lasts about a half a hour, but I thought its very expensive. £58 for two us"
"Written February 10, 2020","Splendid views, photo souvenir is worthwhile","On January 2020 a sunny morning, we go for London Eye.  At the entrance, a photo stand was prepared for tourists as souvenirs.  The views was so fantastic and you could see all the famous spots in one go.   Afterwards, we go downstairs to see the beautiful photos we have taken before enter the London Eye.  It is worthwhile to buy the souvenirs (included website to download photos) especially when you would like to take pictures with 4 members together.   A delighted experience."

"Written September 27, 2020",Great to do,"This is my second time visiting but my first with my small children and it was so much better this time around- the queues were short, everyone had temperature checks, social distancing was enforced and no more than 6 to a pod. A covid must do! "

"Written September 13, 2020",Views,A must if you are visiting London.Amazing views across the city and plenty of time to snap lots of photos.We booked online and had no bother when we arrived.Staff are friendly and efficient.
"Written August 13, 2019",Absolutely brilliant and great staff!,"This was a fantastic experience. There was plenty of room on the pod and you get whisked down the fast track lane so you are pretty much straight on. Our VIP host, Arnie, was excellent. He was informative, added some humour, took time to speak to every guest individually and made sure everyone got a good family photo. The experience itself is great but it made it even better by having a brilliant host."
"Written August 11, 2019",Great views,"Not an adrenaline rush but the views from the top is spectacular best to go on a clear day so you can see most of the major sites, house commons etc. This is worth the trip if you have a family or if you want to go on your own. The cost in reasonable and it is a worthwhile way to spend a couple of hours to do."
"Written August 11, 2019",Great attraction ,We paid extra for the fast pass to avoid the line. The attraction is pricey for the amount of time spent on it but the views are great. 
"Written August 7, 2019",Overpriced but.....,"As most have mentioned the London Eye is a bit over priced, however I did enjoy the iconic views. I have always wanted to go on the London Eye if I ever made it over; And so I did and I don't regret it. We bought standard tickets online the day before and went early in the day and waited a mere 10min max. I had a good experience and personally I would recommend it to others."
"Written August 3, 2019",London Eye,"When in London, taking a trip on the London Eye is an experience you won’t forget! I am deathly afraid of heights, and I mean sweaty palms and the like, but the views and the photo opportunities were worth my discomfort. In fact, the Eye is such a smooth ride that you don’t even feel like you are moving! I didn’t even realize I was at the top until my travel mate told me! The views you see are so spectacular, and by the time the ride was over, I found myself wanting to go again! (Score one for the girl who overcame her fear!) My mate and I bought the “skip the line” passes, and they were worth every penny! (When you see the lines, you’ll understand!) We got on promptly and enjoyed a relaxing sunset ride, an experience I’ll never forget."
"Written August 2, 2019",Champagne on the eye,What a super moment. We shared a pod with a family who had someone celebrating a 60th birthday plus other people. Our host was super and the champagne was pretty good too. What a super end to our three week honeymoon.
"Written August 2, 2019",A good day out,"The London eye and boat trip was really good. The eye is a great experience and shows all the sights of London but with no commentary would only have gotten 4 stars. The boat trip was fantastic and my 4 kids, aged 9 to 13 all preferred it to the eye. I, however, liked the contrast. Would recommend this."
"Written July 29, 2019",Stunning views but way to long times and glass is far too reflective for my liking!,"It's a nice view ja but unless you have the fast track tickets or whatever it's called and you've got the time to spare, maybe take a cruise rather. After waiting for for so long to get to where we got only to be crowded by bunches of strangers all trying to take photo's of the same area at a once-I guess it's understandable because of what a big attraction it is but still. Not my cup of tea!"
"Written July 28, 2019",Ok for first visit...,"Yes i said ok, my son loved the trip on the london eye. Queues were a tad crazy being school holidays. The trip happens fairly quickly.I prefer sky garden, which free and you can get tea and cake at the top. None the less.. its a land mark done."

"Written April 30, 2020",Lovely Panoramic From the Top,"As an iconic landmark in London, London Eye is a must visit place here. Even though I was scared of high but the ride was still enjoyable. While you're at the top, you can see the decent views over London especially on a sunny day. Such a great experience. "
"Written March 9, 2020",VIP with Champagne is worth it!,"For a few extra £, you can skip the line and get some champagne and it's totally worth it! Super friendly staff, very professional, amazing view. All in all, when in London, it's a must!"
"Written July 24, 2019",BOOK IT! River cruise and London Eye!,"CRUISE FIRST THEN LONDON EYE! Wanted to treat my friend visiting London. This was so easy to book and do, no brainier if you want to go up Thames and go on London Eye! Staff on boat were great fun and stories of London were entertaining. ** The only change I made on day was upgrading our London Eye tickets. The queues for Standard tickets were so very long. We went into office directly opposite Eye and upgraded for £10 each and was definitely worth every penny**. We also did the Megabus tour of London (you book this separately) it’s 2 hours but you literally walk over the road towards Waterloo Station and the pick up is there and that was great value for money too."
"Written July 22, 2019",Don’t waste your time,"Sure it’s cool to see the city from so high up, but the lines are way too long. You’re better off navigating the underground."
"Written July 21, 2019",Be prepared to wait...long,"The Southwalk of town is glorious but very crowded. The London Eye is just that. It takes 45 min to go around and hours to wait in line. There is a fast track pass which offers quicker times, however that line was very long yesterday (20, July) as well. If you are going in summer good luck, suggestion is when kids are in school and less travel times for better accommodations "
"Written July 14, 2019",Ridiculously overpriced and horribly long waiting time,"To put it in a nutshell, yes the views are nice but watch out for the cons:Waiting in line for 20 minutes to buy a ticket for GBP 30 (regular price unless you buy a discounted ticket)... get assigned a time slot when you are allowed to enter the actual queue (ours was one hour after purchase of tickets)... wait in another line for 40 minutes for your twenty minute ride... standing in an overcrowded capsule that is... been there, done that but won’t do it again..."
"Written July 12, 2019",It goes around and you see London,"BOught ticket at on the day of the ride, yeah could have prepared and saved 10% but was last minute decisions. Go the standard ticket, fast pass really didn't have much of a difference, check the line first thought. we went around, saw things, got a photo when ""coming into land"" and that was it "
"Written July 12, 2019",ok to go,"i didnt go on the wheel as i just took some picture from the outsidethe ticket is pretty expensive and i dont think is worth to go on as there are so many people in one cart. however if yo really like wheels, i guess you could give it a try with the long line up"
"Written July 12, 2019",Awesome! A must do!,"Bought skip-the-line passes and went straight on through. Great experience, amazing views of the city in all directions! Doesn’t feel too high if you not afraid of heights. Not your typical Ferris wheel, the carriages are quite large."
"Written July 11, 2019",River trip,The ticket we bought through trip advisor was not valid when we turned up at the pier to catch the boat. We were turned away and told the ticket was incorrect. Very disappointed at wasting an afternoon of our London as we only had 4 days in London 😤😤
"Written July 10, 2019",Fast Track !!!!,"Quite a queue, was the extra amount paid worth it, NO.I must admit there was a long line in the normal queue, but still had to wait quite a while to get through.I don’t think the extra price was worth it."
"Written July 6, 2019",Great view of London but skip the queue,"The queues are VERY long most days - especially on weekends, peak season and 11am - 3pm. Be prepared to stand for at least 30 -45 minutes even if you have a pre booked ticket with a time slot. I can highly suggest upgrading to a Fast Track Ticket - the ticket office is opposite the wheel. The extra money was totally worth it! We bypassed loads of people standing in the queue and got into a cabin within 5 minutes My sons age 11 and 13 really enjoyed the view from the London Eye! The cabins are big so fit lots of people but they don’t overcrowd them. "
"Written February 7, 2020",Great view but a huge tourist trap,I was glad we splurged for the VIP and Champagne option. This is a huge tourist attraction with long long long lines. The view of London is the only reason to go.
"Written February 7, 2020",London from the top!,You can see London in 20 minutes from the sky !! Exciting experience! Even if you are afraid of hight you will not be scared at all !!
"Written January 29, 2020",Visit to London,Utterly stunning.  Taking an OS map and binoculars in the pod assists identifying distant objects.  Best done out of the tourist season to avoid queues.
"Written January 26, 2020",Champagne experience ,"Wow london from the sky so pretty! The champagne experience was just what we needed smaller group of people, little glass of champagne and a lovely guide more than happy to take the perfect picture of you with an incredible back drop! 😀 loved every second of the 30 minute journey would highly recommend X"
"Written January 23, 2020",Splurge for Flexi Fast-Track,"For the 360 degree, high-above-London view, I recommend everyone ride this at least once.  We pre-bought the Fast Track ticket before we knew that it would be raining at our chosen time, so the weather hindered our view slightly.  However, even in the rain, there's something peaceful about being that high above millions of people in your little bubble.  I can imagine it wouldn't be so peaceful if your pod companions are chatty and loud, but we had a quiet, reverential group.  Still, I recommend trying to ride on a clear day, for how much further you would be able to see under better conditions.  Spring for the Flexi Fast-Track ticket, which lets you ride at whatever time you wish on your chosen day.  This won't help you so much if it's raining from sun up to sun down, but should there be a break in the clouds, you can head pop on over at any time.  But keep in mind that this is an online exclusive on the London Eye website, so don't show up and expect to be able to buy these flexible tickets at the gate.  Also available for purchase online (I'm not sure if you can buy these at the counter too) -- mini binoculars, which you can then keep as a souvenir!"
"Written January 14, 2020",A Must do While in London!,"Terrific views of London, worth the price and the wait.  I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting London."
"Written January 7, 2020",Requested from granddaughter,"My wife and I took our 16 year old granddaughter to London.  While there, we took her on the combination river cruise and London Eye.  It was something that would not have made the ""to do"" list absent a request from our granddaughter.  I was concerned that the tours would present opportunities to stand in long lines to do activities with little payoff.  We enjoyed the river tour and found the guide to be energetic and entertaining.  The Eye does provide quite a view, even on a rainy day.  The lines at both events were well managed and efficient."
"Written December 29, 2019",Excellent venue,We opted to pay the extra £10 for the express access to avoid the very long queue for the standard admission price. Well worth it! We got on almost immediately.
"Written December 17, 2019",Amazing London View,"It was our first time to visit London, so decided to try this London Eye ride. Since we had a limited time in London and it was on Sunday, decided to purchase the fast track pass. There were a long line for the regular line, but we didn’t have to wait and got in London Eye! We got to enjoy 360 degree London View. The whole ride was about 30 minutes. Really enjoyed the experience!"
"Written December 16, 2019",great view ,I was surprised by the size of the london eye  it was very big which told me that there would be an amazing view as i went on i noticed there was a huge amount of space. it was the weekend and even with all the people there was still a lot of space for every one to move around. in my opinion I would say it’s great for explorers and social media influencers
"Written June 19, 2019",360 View of London ,I purchased likely the latest possible purchase of a fast pass (and pass to get on as it was almost closed for the evening) - I didn’t really check the line out first and I likely could have saved the 10 pounds as there was no line anyway (no one said anything to me either) Views were good on a cloudy gloomy day (sadly Big Ben is completely covered in scaffolding right now) but you could see Houses of Parliament and several iconic London buildings You can walk around and take some cool shots You also get a picture (likely with other people in it) of your trip around the wheel to purchase Definitely something to check out if you have the time on your trip just to say you’ve done it 
"Written June 9, 2019",Seriously save you ££,"I can think of so many better ways I could have spent  ££. Crowded, dirty pods, and windows need a cleaning. If you’re strapped for things to do, go ahead but a true tourist trap. "
"Written June 6, 2019",Unusual way to see London!,"The views are wonderful!  One rotation takes a half-hour (non-stop, by the way), so there's plenty of time for photos & just enjoying the views."
"Written May 25, 2019",Good not Great,"Did this on my last day. I purchased the fast pass but the standard line seemed to take about the same amount of time. It was a clear day and the views were great, but in reality you just see the same things as you do at ground level (Westminster, buildings in the city, etc.). "
"Written May 24, 2019",How can you not do this?,"A must-do in London. The queu was very long, but the system works well and the crowd moved quickly. The view is unparalleled of course and though expensive well worth it. "
"Written May 17, 2019",Very fun thing to do while in London!,"This was a very fun experience, large cars that could fit 20 people, but we only had 10-12 in ours.  Rotates very slowly so you can see all the views, which are magnificent!  You can get a book with pictures of your party for a small fee, which is fun.  Also don't forget to go to the 3-D experience across the walk from the London Eye, it's very fun and included in the ticket, this is where you can get the picture book.  Really enjoyed it!  One of our party gets motion sickness and this did not bother her at all."
"Written May 9, 2019",there are better things to do,"I believe that the best thing about London Eye is looking at it from the distance, it adds some kind of personality to the skyline. The experience itself is very boring. It’s fair to say that London doesn’t have the most interesting skyline to see from the above and at the time of my visit, the Parliament and Big Ben were under renovation so the best part of the view wasn’t looking so great. Keep in mind that is always busy and it takes a while to get into the ride so I strongly recommend the fast track ticket. The area around is also full of tourists so mind your little ones and your safety. Make sure you take your time to walk on south bank, that’s a very amazing part of the city, you can find a stair and go to Tamis’ beach, there’s nice shops, great food and nice view. You can walk to Tate Modern or, even better, to London Tower "

This is more of a symbol of london, so there's definitely an emotional value of it. But being a sensible adult, the ride must enthrall me, specially if i spent 38gbp to buy skip the line ticket.+ves:+ Skip the line ticket takes you to the ride in 10 min. The other one, be ready to wait for atleast 60min or more+ Screenshot of your ticket, can be easily scanned near the entrance.+ Staff was fast efficient and taking care of our needs+ Cleanliness is well maintained+ Vending machines have been installed, if you forgot water or drinks+ Safety sense was very much there. Staff guides you on how to enter and exit the capsule-ves- Total rip off. You take one full revolution. Very slowly. In the afternoon, it gets quite hot in there and we were standing under the AC ducts.- There was no audio commentary, to guide you on important things in the viccinity. This could've reduced our boredom a bit.- All excitement vanishes after 3 minutes, since remaining 17 minutes, will be the same bldgs at different elevation.- I thought only i'm being bored. But then my daughters started to fight amongst themselves. Hinting, that they might have lost interest as well :)- NOT VALUE FOR MONEY- Will never return, even if given a free ticketHit LIKE if my review helped you in planning your trip any better."
"Written April 21, 2019",There are so many other options,"Back in 2000 it was unique & it still provides a focus for New Year fireworks but there are so many more (better) options in London now.I would go to the Wally talkie tower, you have to book (but it’s free) & view is way better, & if you get a foggy London sunrise nothing beats itThen there is the cable car which is cheaper & a novelty + gives you more of an E London perspective but also nice to get the view of the city looking across the Docklands Then you have the shard (expensive) or the gherkin (I think you have to have restaurant reservations) but both good viewsWith all the towers going up there are bound to be more options & look out for the tulip tower going up next years"

"Written April 18, 2019",Great Views,"We purchased tickets from Trip Advisor in advance for this (skip the line tickets), and it was totally worth it. We were able to bypass the long line, which probably saved us an hour or two. It was SUPER crowded on Saturday when we were there, perhaps try another day. There are free restrooms inside the building where you can purchase tickets (downstairs). Even though the Eye doesn't stop when you're getting on, it does move very very slowly, so it's easy enough to get on/off. If you have a fear of heights, like me, there are seats in the middle, so you can look out without getting as anxious. "
"Written June 4, 2019",Family time,"A nice idea to buy tickets for several places at once and with cheaper price. However it was a lucky accident, didn't see any information about it before. Pls advertise more of this opportunity!London Eye, a nice evening trip. Short queueing time, easy ride with comfortable amount of people. Madame Tussaud's, longer queues, time slot not really on time, pretty crowded. A little disappointed that none of the royal family could be photographed self, photos ridiculously expensive. Star wars scenes perfect!!!Aquarium, absolutely adorable, for people of all ages. Liked a lot, definitely worth money. All together, a nice package of tickets for very different types of shows.

"Written May 29, 2019",River Cruise Fantastic! London Eye horrendous experience that I never want to repeat!,"On Monday my husband, 4 children and I participated in the double package of a river cruise and a trip on the london eye. The river cruise was fantastic. Nala, our guide, was funny, friendly and very informative. We loved it! We then were helped by some lovely staff who advised us to come back to the queue for the eye as we were a little early. A short stop for some chips and everything was going well. We rejoined the queue which was quick and efficient. Everything went downhill from there though. When we reached the front we were asked how many were in our party - 6 - at which point the female member of staff turned to the lady next to us and repeated the same question. We were led onto the pod and that was the end of our fun. The lady next to us was part of a large and very rowdy family group. They blocked all of the windows so we could not see anything. They were extremely loud - shouting, singing and jumping around the pod. They climbed on the handrails to take selfies and lay on the bench in the centre so us and another family were forced to the back with nowhere to go and nothing to see. When we did try to get to a window they physically pushed us (including our young children) out of the way. When I asked them if we could get in to get a photo of the children they just looked at us and spread out even further. My 9 year old son was nervous before the flight began but this large group just made his anxiety even worse resulting in him breaking down in tears asking to be let off the london eye. He was simply terrified at the behaviour of this large group of adults and teenagers when he was already nervous at being so high. At one point I almost stood on their baby because she was allowed to just crawl around the floor of the pod while they climbed on the railings. It was disgraceful behaviour that totally ruined the experience for me and my family. When we mentioned this to the salesperson on the photo desk he did apologise and said that the group should have been split up. The opposite happened though and they were actively encouraged by your staff to remain together. If they had wanted a private pod they should have paid for one instead of ruining the experience for us and another family who were trapped with them for the full horrendous experience. It was extremely intimidating and the opposite of what I would expect from a family attraction. As a family of 6 this was an expensive excursion for us but we thought that it would have been a worthwhile experience for our young children. Instead it has become an experience in how to deal with other peoples bad behaviour and lack of respect for others and an experience that none of us wish to repeat. I certainly will not be recommending it to family and friends."
"Written May 26, 2019",Coca Cola London Eye,"Was part of a Golden Tours package. Kids age 6 and 13. Tuesday evening line was about a 20 minute wait. Capsule/pod held about 20ish people. Seating for maybe 8 on a bench in the middle. Others stand around the edge so if you want to see, you stand. We all enjoyed the views. Fish and chips food truck just down the river path is worth the short walk!"
"Written May 26, 2019",Ok - but overpriced,"To start with a positive, the views from the top of the London eye are pretty fantastic, and on a hot sunny day, the air-conditioned cabin is quite pleasant.However, a 30 minute wait for a 20 minute ride is disproportionate, and this after having an advanced ticket purchased.Also, get ready for thousands of people, stressed employees, and an attempt to get as much money out of you via photo opportunities and selling overpriced slushees.Finally, even with a combo ticket, this is a pretty expensive Ferris wheel ride.The day before, we had a view from the top of Saint Pauls Cathedral, which is equally stunning, but this coupled with a historic building, and an exciting (500? Steps) walk up the stairway to the top of the dome.You don’t have to be athletic to walk up Saint Pauls Cathedral, and it is a much, much better value for your money. Skip the London Eye."
"Written August 4, 2018",London Eye,"Definitely worth the money and time to do!  You get a very different view of the city!  And in the height of the tourist season, the 'skip the line' ticket is THE best investment."
"Written July 27, 2018","Irresistible, quintessential London","Years ago visiting London meant seeing Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul's, Nelson's Column, Tower Bridge, Piccadilly Circus, shopping on Oxford Street and walking the West End. Now the complete tourist experience includes riding the London Eye. Fortunately, this giant, iconic ferris wheel is a pleasure to ride and gives you the opportunity to see beautiful, historic buildings and the Thames from a unique perspective. Amazingly, people are well behaved in pods and don't totally dominate key view windows, allowing you to see everything. The 4D cinema experience available before you get on the ride is well worth seeing. My granddaughter loved the whole experience."
"Written July 27, 2018",Wonderful Views of London,"This was one of the highlights of our visit to London. The queues moved quickly and the pods were clean and not over crowded. On one of the hottest days of the year, the air conditioning in our pod was very welcome. Fantastic views of London and the ride was just about the right length of time with grand children."
"Written July 15, 2018",London icon,If you happen to be in London then don’t miss this iconic landmark. Best time to go is a little late in the afternoon when sun is not so killing. If you take fast track then there is hardly any wait. The 4D experience after the ride is also not to be missed although it is only 5 minutes.
"Written July 9, 2018",Nice views,There are some nice views from the London Eye. Not sure if it worth the $40 per person but worth doing anyway if you want to be a tourist. 
"Written July 4, 2018",London eye in style,"We thoroughly enjoyed the London eye and were lucky to have clear skies on a nice warm summers day.The views are spectacular. We decided to do one of the VIP experiences with Champagne. I can highly recommend doing the London eye this way if it is in your budget. This meant that we didnt have to queue to buy our tickets and could escape the crowds to the eye lounge, where we recieved a complimentary drink. We were then guided down to the eye and straight into a pod without having to stand in further queues. We then took in the sights with a glass of Champagne. You really do feel like a VIP."
"Written July 1, 2018",Great views ,"Lovely views over London, very very hot in the pods though. Queues were very long due to high season demands but the queues were managed well to ensure they kept moving. Was able to use my tesco vouchers so the overall cost for the 3 of us was half the original cost from £81 to £40.50. "
"Written June 23, 2018",Great view,"Whilst visiting London with my wife, we decided the best way to take in London was to do the London eye. I’m in London frequently with work but haven’t done the ‘tourist bit’ for a few years. It was great! Queues were large but moved quickly - prob 15 minutes! Great views of a great city! "
"Written June 23, 2018",A Must For First Time Visitors,A great way to see the city with an amazing view.  For our trip around The Eye we bought our tickets in advance online and went with the skip the line option which was worth it as there was no wait for us.The pods are huge and it was only us and another group of four people in a pod that I imagine could accommodate at least twice as many people.  So lots of room to move and find the right spot for pictures.  A trip around takes about 30 minutes so it won’t eat up all that much of your day.   
"Written June 23, 2018",Great First introduction,"We purchased our London eye + river cruise tickets in advance which I would recommend so you don’t have to line up twice. It was our first day in London so we decided to do a cruise. The river cruise was very informative and our tour guide was full of funny facts. We got to see all of the main sights along the Thames so it was a great way to get our bearings. We then lined up for the London eye, don’t be discouraged as the line goes quickly. We got a great view of London/ the Thames and I would definitely do it again! "
"Written January 4, 2019",Nice and worth it,We went on the London eye one day and then got the river cruise first hour on next day's morning. The London Eye was lovely and the views were amazing. Also you didn't even notice you were moving. The river cruise was very entertaining and our guide VICKY was really nice and her jokes made everyone realize how much she enjoyed her job (if your language isn't English they have free listening guides there). We learned interesting facts plus we were sit so we could rest to keep on walking the rest of the day. Totally worth it.
"Written December 20, 2018",Fast pass ticket,"We got 2 fast pass tickets in advanced from a discounted ticket website, on arrival found out we had to join a line to exchange our vouchers for  tickets which was quite long as the attraction was very busy, still got us in slightly quicker than what the normal ticketline would have as it was very long, They cramed a lot of us in one pod which made it hard to move around and get a view from every angle as some people were rude and not letting other people in but eventually after time people moved, was quite expensive for what it was but good to say you've done it, wouldn't go back "
"Written December 17, 2018","Cool idea, but not worth the price.","The London Eye is a London Icon now, but it like the Shard is cool, but not worth the price of admission. The Sky Garden was a much better use of time and resources."
"Written December 14, 2018",Giving London The Eye,Luckily had the fast-track ticket - as queues may be daunting.  Loved the view and the refreshments.  The ride is over real quickly - so don't spend it on your phone taking pictures!  Rather enjoy the view and ask the two ladies accompanying - to take a photo or two for you!
"Written December 5, 2018",Be Fast on the Fast Track Line,"On our ride to London from Southampton, our driver Mark suggested taking in the London Eye experience and suggested getting fast track tickets, which can include the Big Bus ( a hop on/hop off bus) and a boat ride up the Thames to Greenwich.  We jumped on a Big Bus only to find out we needed to buy our ticket at the London.  The operators were kind enough to allow us to ride until we reached the London Eye.  a bit confusing figuring out where to buy the Fast track tix.  Long lines to convert  Ticket purchased on line .. had to be scanned in for a London Eye and Big Bus Tix. Tourist were very nice or very naive in allowing me to cut the line to get info and return once tickets were purchased.  I'm certain had my New York State of Being not kicked in, we would have waited in even the Fast Track ticket lines."
"Written October 30, 2018",Worth a visit ,"We visited on the 29th October and after some confusion over which queue to join as we are Merlin pass holders, and as you approach they had 3 Queues in operation. This is a must use attraction very worthwhile and the views are amazing.. Definitely will visit again.."
"Written October 23, 2018",Marvel at this landmark,Looks beautiful day or night. Expect to queue to get on. Goes around slowly. Not cheap!.... Shared capsule with others. Engineering triumph..... You cannot miss it if in Central London. I use this to get my bearing around London
"Written October 19, 2018","good fun, value for money","Booked online and chose the times we wanted to go on the cruise and the London Eye meaning we didn't have to queue. The weather wasn't great for the cruise but the crew made sure the seats were dry on the upper deck and that we were comfortable. There are refreshments and toilets on board. Jennifer the tour guide knew her stuff and was really cheerful and funny which brightened up the dull day. Well worth the money, only wish the sun had come out! "
"Written October 14, 2018",London Eye fast track,"We bought the fast track tickets for an extra 10 pounds per person. The fast track ONLY fast tracks you from the outside line. Once you head into the shelter of entering the Eye you are with everyone. The Eye itself is good. Great views, car is not too full - so you can walk around, it is very slow moving so no motion sickness."
"Written October 14, 2018",See London Through the Eye,Serene view of London and a great way to orient someone to The sights of Westminster and the City. Great way to watch the sun go down and the city begin to light up for evening. 
"Written July 6, 2019",Used ‘Mates go free’ from Kellogg’s cereal packs,Went there on a Thursday morning. Had booked tickets for later in the day after reading about the queues but were walking past and there was practically no queue. Managed to use our ticket to walk straight on (the nice guide said that we wouldn’t be able to do this if it was really busy). 30 minute ride with great views on a glorious day. 2 of our party were nervous of heights. They mostly sat on the bench in the middle and ‘enjoyed’ the views from there. Great opportunity for photos.
"Written July 5, 2019",Not worth it.,In my opinion the price is not worth the attraction. Better to go to sky garden to see the skyline of London.
"Written July 4, 2019",No other way to do it!,We went to the champagne experience for the London eye (with the optional sky lounge option) and I wouldn’t do it any other way!  We got to sit and enjoy a glass of champagne while watching everyone lined up for hours outside!  And then we had another glass while on the Eye!  The host was fun and charming and gave us great ideas for when and where to get the snapshots!  
"Written July 4, 2019",Nice to visit,It's nice experience but there are many other places providing many even better panoramic view for free like Sky Garden 
"Written July 3, 2019",London Eye visit,"Last Sunday we visited the London Eye while on holiday in London having purchased our ticket over the internet. The directions over the net were somewhat vague so we expected instructions and directions when we arrived. We expected either verbal instructions about where to line up or some clear signs. As there were lots of people in the line up we could Not see the sign posts as they were only about 1 metre high. There was also not enough staff to provide instructions. In frustration we went and lined up for 20 minutes at the ticket office who said we should have just lined up in the correct past track queue. Eventually we found the queue and after another 30 minutes got into a capsule.The trip itself was okay but lacked instruction as to what we were looking at. There wasn’t any points of interest, compass for direction or any handouts to improve the quality of the experience.Unfortunately for us as our capsule reached the top we must have had a mechanical breakdown which left us at the top for a considerable time. Only once out of the 35 minutes were we told of the breakdown and were NOT told of the progress of repairs. This should have been communicated when the air conditioning was turned off for about 15 minutes.Eventually, the rotation began and after about 15 minutes we disembarked from the Eye. I did NOT understand why one of our fellow passengers with a badly broken leg in a wheel chair was allowed to be removed while rotating, when we had to stop the rotation to ‘load’ her. Didn’t seem right!Finally after our experience, there wasn’t a “sorry for your inconvenience’ , it was down the stairs, here’s a bottle of water. There wasn’t a “sorry, but please come back again’ there wasn’t a thing. We did have a poor experience and were unlucky but the lack of communication and poor attitude seems to systematic in London. There are plenty of alternative experiences in London for the same amount of money.Recommendations 1. Make the signs of queues high enough to see when there’s a crowd.2. Improve the directions foe queues on the website.3. Have some sort of guide either verbally, paper or electronic on each capsule know what we are looking at.4. If it breakdown communicate to the patrons regularly5. If apologising for a breakdown at least do it will some sincerity.I doubt we will be back, but it hard to recommend this experience to anyone else who will be visiting London"
"Written July 2, 2019",Over priced ,Not what it used to be......if it’s busy you’ll pay through the nose for a fast pass.....if not prepare to wait for a crowded capsule. 
"Written June 27, 2019",Overpriced ferris wheel ride,"This has become an iconic London attraction but it’s overhyped and overpriced in my opinion. Our tour guide told us that originally it was supposed to be there for few months only, but been there for years due to the huge amount of money it is making- up to 250,000 BP per day!  The commercial focus of this attraction became clear to us when we tried to buy its tickets. There were 6 of us including 2 small children and 2 students. We were shocked to hear the tickets were over  $200. There were no discounts for the children nor for the students in the group. Having been on the Orlando Eye, we didn’t think this ride is worth its fee and skipped it. The lines were long, so if it’s worth it to you, get your tickets online to save your time. "
"Written June 25, 2019",Great way to see the city ,"London eye is one of the must do things to do in London. Situated near the Thames , eye offers you great views of the city . Do go for 2 for 1 offers with national rail tickets . It's a great bargain. "
"Written June 24, 2019",Get there at the right time,"My wife and daughter loved London Eye and we found that the key is getting there at the right time for admission.  We tried on a Friday evening and the line was simply too long.  We asked one of the attendants when would be the best time to return and she suggested before noon any weekday.  We bought online tickets and arrived at 1115 AM and the line was perhaps five minutes.  They both loved the experience, got some great photos and had no regrets.  Neither found it scary at all."
"Written June 22, 2019",AMAZING VIEWS! ,"This is definitely something to do when in London. We had VIP tickets, which we booked when arriving at the London Eye. The VIP tickets allowed us to enjoy a drink in the London Eye Lounge. Then we were welcomed by our guides from the lounge. We got in our compartment with other visitors and got some amazing views. This is a must do!! "
"Written October 9, 2018",A little underwhelming ,"Visited the eye in the evening thinking the crowds would be less.  We had vouchers and had to stand in very long line to get them redeemed, then another line to get on the eye.  The lines did move quickly.  You are packed into a car with about 25 people and the eye does a slow rotation so you can have views of the city.  Nice but probably not worth the money or time."
"Written September 30, 2018",Tourist trap. ,"Yes, it's cool. Yes, it has a good view. But yes, it's damned expensive for what you get out of it. Even more so if you try the expresse route. And the wait is terrible especially if you go in the summer I assume. London has some great alternatives if all you are looking for is a good view of the city. So if I were you, unless you must have this London experience, save yourself some coppers and I suggest you research some other place to see the vistas. "
"Written September 18, 2018",Very expensive,Very expensive but worth the experience and seeing the views of the city from so high in the air. Long lines but they move pretty fast.
"Written September 13, 2018","Nice view,,But boring..","Well it does what it says it does.TIP get 2 for 1 via C2C national rail website, pop in the code on the eye website and you get 1 person FREE, so 2 people for £27, que moved fast enough had pre-booked online tickets so go straight to the line to get on it,, share the pod with about 10 others, plenty of room and AC was on too.View is good (on a clear sunny day of course), but after about 5/10 minutes its pretty boring, 30mins in and your out again.Could be better at night, maybe Christmas time will be more dramatic, to be honest its pretty dull and not something people rave about after, but i suppose you have to try it."
"Written August 28, 2018",Fasttrack to wonderful views,"Yes, it comes at a price. Yet, it is worth it when you have limited time in London. A bit confusing at first, where to queue up. Fairly easy in the end and quick to get on the ride.  "

But truth be told- our host Rhona made the experience. Cheers Rhona, you’re top notch! Make sure to request her the next time you visit London!"
"Written August 8, 2018",You can see it all,The London eye was really tall so you could see for miles.  You could move around and take photos without the basket tipping and you felt completely safe.  Being in the capsule you felt safe and yet looking at it from the ground it looks so high I cannot believe it went so high.  I really recommend the Skip-the-Line.
"Written August 6, 2018",London Must See,I recommend buying a Skip the Line Ticket. It saves so much time and line standing. The view is tremendous - an excellent and unforgettable way to spend a few hours. Be sure and try to find a day with some sunshine. The picture taking is great. It goes so slowly that pictures come out great! I highly recommend this adventure. For all ages.

"Written June 17, 2018",Well worth doing,If you intend to do the London Eye this is the way to go. Your skip the ticket line which was extremely long and also had a much shorter wait for the ride. The view from the London Eye is amazing and I can thoroughly recommend it.
"Written May 14, 2018",Great View,If you want a great view of London this is a spectacular spot.  I liked the option of Skipping the Line because I wanted to control my time better.  If you want to avoid huge lines and have a schedule you'd like to keep this is the way to go.  I think it is worth the extra to get this ticket.  The view is amazing and it is a fun touristy thing to do.
"Written April 22, 2018",Waste of time and money,"Maybe the view is great, but there is no idea what you were looking at. Too expensive and commercial, it is all about the brand identity."
"Written April 10, 2018",Scam and rip off ,‪Absolutely shocked and appalled that we were able to purchase tickets on the merlin webpage for my family with young children when the attraction was closed and have been denied a refund request. What a con and scam. We will never purchase tickets for any merlin managed attraction again  ‬
"Written April 7, 2018",So much fun ,"We went on a day with relatively good weather. There are panoramic views of the city, it’s on the Thames, and it’s close to Parliament and Big Ben. Definitely get the Fast Track pass and arrive within a couple of hours of opening if you can. You can buy advance tickets at tourist information center if you like (we did this). But you still have to exchange those for a timed ticket when you arrive and it looked to me like those lines could get long. If you have time flexibility, it doesn’t matter so much. "
"Written April 1, 2018",Purchased a Priority Combi for Madame Tussauds Priority Entry & London Eye Fast Track Tickets,"Bought the Priority Combi tickets for both Madame Tussauds and London Eye which entitled us for Fast Track Entry but the Guide at London Eye told us we got the normal tickets as the Fast Track wording were not printed on the tickets, what's the point paying £59 when I could get a normal ticket for both attractions at £40, I'm not trying to claim for the refund of £19 but just not satisfied with the reasons that were given to us even we highlighted to a few Guides at London Eye. The experience at the Eye was absolutely amazing, just disappointed with the normal ticket queue instead of being given fast track entry which I've paid for."
"Written March 27, 2018",London WOW!,"First time on the London Eye and it was a thrilling experience. I have a fear of heights,so I was extremely nervous, but I loved every minute of it.

"Written March 26, 2018",Worth a visit,"Enjoyed this trip, second time on it. Would definitely recommend paying the extra for the fast track ticket. Great views of London. My only two negatives are 1) price of the souvenir photo is extortion, if it was a reason or slightly overpriced item we probably would have bought it but was a complete rip off. 2) 2-4 less people per pod would make it more enjoyable. In saying all this, definitely worth a visit. "
"Written March 5, 2018",Great views and a warm ride on a snowy day,"This was a nice warm retreat from some very unusual snow across London, the treat is though the views wher spectacular and probably some that many rarely see. As all the roofs and building, lawns and garden where blanketed in white. It was truly a fairy winter wonderland, even though it was the first day of Spring. I can imagine no matter what the weather the view would always be great so this is well worth the cost and time. "
"Written February 20, 2018",All was quick and smooth,"Had a lovely time in the pod at sunset. Even better when you know the city and what's what with regards to buildings and parks.Your photo is taken against a green screen on the way to the pods, you can buy it if you want to be completely fleeced fpr 20 pounds on the way out."
"Written April 16, 2019",Beautiful but pricey,Spring break 2019 with 3 teens. This was one of the attractions the kids insisted on doing. While the views are stunning I felt that the cost was on the expensive side. We went at dusk which I thought was perfect because all the city lights started to turn on as we were getting close to the top.  The ride is very smooth. You can barely feel any movement. We bought our tickets as an add-on with Big Bus Tours. That included a river cruise and Tower of London. But you have to get the vouchers from a Big Bus attendant.  So that was a bit of a hassle because there was no one available in the immediate vicinity of the London Eye. So I guess what I'm suggesting just buy the tickets at the London Eye ticket office. It wasn't worth the $10 I saved frantically searching for a Big Bus attendant
"Written April 14, 2019",Nice view for half an hour ride,"Remember to book your ticket online for fast track, and for flexible timing, it is costly but only if you dont need to queue to go up to enjoy the nice view. I would recommend to do the walk by the river afterwards."

"Written March 28, 2019",Way too expensive!  ,"Not for average Joe ride. Cost about £30 for a ride. Basically, there are not much skyline in London. Only a few skyscrapers and busy streets. Best view of London is still by Thames River Cruise. Make it to £10. Then maybe it is worth "
"Written February 20, 2019",Informative and entertaining,"I live in London and took my family, who were visiting, on the Eye and on this boat trip and it was probably the best part of the day. While the views from the Eye are astonishing as you think, the boat trip was great to see the city from the river and hear the entertaining trivia. Abi was a fantastic tour guide and clearly loved her job, it was so lovely to hear such enthusiasm and humour. Even my perpetually unimpressed teenage brother enjoyed it!"
"Written February 11, 2019",Great view but could work q's far better,So i had booked online for the standard ticket as it would be cheaper than buying on the day. Thats grand and all but you got to q up with everyone that is also buying tickets on the day to collect them. The should really really have a separate q for people collecting tickets than for people buying on the day. This took us a good 45-50 mins of q'ing to get the tickets which could have been just collected from a machine even. Strange when your actually q'ing longer than one turn of the wheel. All this is prob to try and boost there Fast track ticket service which is an extra €14.......Now onto the views...the day we were there on is was a a lovely clear day where you could see for miles....I would look at the weather and make sure you get your value for money and go on a clear day.

My booking was for 11 so I needed my tickets before that.I tried to attract the attention of a person inside to get information and he kept telling me to go away. Great customer service.When it was time to open (10.30 as it turned out. The sign on the door was wrong), they could not unlock the doors.When we got inside I had 7 people in front of me and there were 3 people issuing tickets.It took 20 minutes to get my ticket. This is true!By the time I got to the ride there was a huge queue in front of me and guess what.It was in the rain. No rain protection at all.Even more galling is that despite waiting your turn in the queue for up to an hour (in the rain!), anyone who has lots of money can pay an extra 10 pounds and walk straight past you to the top of the queue.The view from the ride was not clear with the rain covering the plastic sides.It gets better.Half way up it broke down.We didnt know what was going on because the speaker was not working properly.There were multiple calls saying we have fixed the problem and your ride has continued. While we stayed immobile.As it rains a lot in London, I would recommend against this attraction unless you love being treated like second class people and have a fetish for standing for hours in the rain.Go to the Shard.Its higher, its indoors and they let you return free of charge if the weather is bad on your visit.As fair as the Coca Cola Eye is concerned. I dont know where you learned your customer skills from but go back to school.You dont get a good reputation by treating your customers like you do."

However, the eye would have been better if the thing went faster to  decrease the boredom factor. Also, if I had gotten into a car with no one else, I think the experience would have been much better. The idiots who spent the entire time taking selfies and photos of each other, admiring the ""wonderful pic"" and then discussing in very loud voices their photo masterpiece qualities, made me mental."

Go later in the afternoon for reduced queues.,"We visited this on a Monday, about 4pm, which meant no queues, after quickly paying for tickets, we were on in 5 minutes.  We used our tickets from Southern Rail train from Gatwick to give us a 2 for 1 offer. It would have been very dear if we hadn't had this. Views great, little bit scary as we went near the top, but you forget that. Don't forget to do the 4D cinema experience, it's short but fun."
"Written March 3, 2017","Fun Experience, but not a must see","I'm happy that I was convinced to ride the London Eye. The view is spectacular, but if you're pressed for time or on a tighter budget, this is an activity you can definitely skip. If you are planning to ride the London Eye, it's well worth it to spend the extra money for a fast pass ticket, it will cut your wait time down significantly. Since the ride on the eye is only ~30mins, without a fast pass ticket it's very likely that you'll end up waiting in line for way longer than the ride on the Eye lasts."
"Written March 2, 2017",Nothing amazing apart from it's actual construction,"I feel let down by the London Eye. It was very hyped up when it was first around, but once on it I felt it was nothing special in terms of an exciting ride. It turns very slowly. Yes, there are good views of The Houses of Parliament and Big Ben from above, but you can see these from the ground and be amazed. I admit the Eye is an architectural feat, but for me it's a bit boring."
"Written January 27, 2018",I could the whole of London with my eyes,"Info: Sat inside the wheel on a sunny spring day with clear blue sky’s over London. Pros: - air conditioned cabins - enough space to move around inside without feeling restricted by other guests - the view is amazing, you can see as far as your eye can see. - queuing  lines weren’t that long when I went (but I can assume it would get pretty long.)- photo opportunity - roughly 45mins/1 hour ride.- good location easily accessible and it’s in close proximity to other site seeing locations. - wheelchair friendly. - reasonable entry fee. - kids/family will love it. Cons: - if you have a fear of heights, close your eyes. - sharing cabin with strangers (they could be annoying) - long queuing lines on popular days. Summary, Highly recommended activity for tourists visiting the area. Enjoy. "
"Written December 31, 2017",Worth it!,"Booked ticket that skipped the Queue!  Was worth it as it was a cold crisp day.  Shame that Big Ben was undergoing works but still worth the visit to see the rest of London.  It’s not cheap but hey, it’s London and it’s a once in a life time experience.Would recommend to them to lower price of photos-25 quid is expensive- increase your sales but lowering price.  I ve done that with my business and it’s paid off big time!"
"Written December 4, 2017",Disorganised chaos,"Far to many tickets being sold, not enough staff, 2 plus hours in a queue to collect tickets then another 90 mins to get on the ride.  Very expensive and boat ride was a total rip off. "
"Written February 26, 2017",Disappointed,"Queued for 30mins to buy tickets, to be told we didn't have return train tickets, only outward journey (as we're buying with 241) so manager forced us to return to hotel for train tickets. Very poor customer service, as he could see we'd arrived by train (how were we going to get home!?) Had to queue again, manager couldn't even look at my husband on our return, and wouldn't let us purchase fast pass to get an allocated time. Again, terrible customer service.30 min queue on return before ride. Actual ride took 30 mins, no commetary available. It was the worst attraction we visited in London, would NOT recommend."

"Written January 28, 2017",Converted!,"I was very sceptical about going on the London Eye as I thought it was too expensive and a waste of time, however I got 2 for 1 tickets from National Rail by using my train tickets to London and it was great. It is very clean (cleaners come on after every rotation to clean the pod in seconds) and very interesting. The touchscreens are great so you can see what particular buildings are (or to look for any that are not obvious straight away). We only queued for about 10 minutes as they get people on and off the pods quite quickly. Loved it, one of the highlights of the trip!"
"Written January 9, 2017",Book in advance and check the weather! Avoid champagne experience,A great experience as we expected but the weather changed and it got very wet and foggy so we were restricted. Definitely pay for the fast track even though you end up queueing here also. Do not bother with the champagne experience the lounge is dirty and cold with booming music - the steps up were sticky from not being cleaned. You will get wet queueing if the weather is bad so definitely wrap up. Staff there seem not to care almost numb - their pay must be low. It gets very busy around the London eye so expect people everywhere. We were hungry before we went up so we found a subway around the corner for a cheap sandwich - directly on the street behind the eye

"Written September 3, 2016",Queues ridiculous and allocated time meaningless,"I had planned to take a friend on the Eye who had never visited the capital before, as a treat. I booked and paid for the tickets 2 weeks in advance for a 3pm 'flight' When we arrived, we queued for 50mins just to collect the tickets and were then told that there was at least another 45 mins in a second queue to actually get on The Eye due to 'lots of school parties'. That would mean our 3pm tickets would actually be for nearer 5pm, the time we had booked and paid to have dinner. We were told casually that we could use the tickets any time up until 9pm as if it was ok to hang around for 6 hours for something we had booked for a specific time. I was told that tickets were non refundable and that was a blanket policy. Well, sorry, but you broke the contract to provide a service and, in law, that means you have to provide a refund regardless of whatever policies you wish to try to impose. A thoroughly shameless and illegal practice engaged by a company that ought to know better. Fortunately, I got a full refund from my credit card company despite you trying to defend your indefensible and shoddy practices.It's a shame because the London Eye used to be good until this lot started to run the show and became so draconian."

"Written August 24, 2017",Overrated,"London eye is totally overrated , I booked tickets online for 4 pm as I had tickets for a musical at 8. Got there at 3:45 to be told that I have to line up or I can buy fast track tickets for 10 pound per person. And that the time on ticket, 4 pm, gives me the right stand in line at 4 pm. I paid 40 pounds extra, just to stand in the fast track line. It is not worth the money."
"Written August 14, 2017",Great views but a bit expensive with poorly organised queuing system ,"Cost £40 + £10 in clubcard vouchers. Views were good and the children enjoyed it. Despite booking a time, we didn't get on until 30 minutes after our scheduled time. We were made to queue just by the entrance to the pods for nearly 20 minutes due to another customer arguging with a member of staff. Due to the poor organisation this meant that people in the other queue wo had arrived some time after this git on before us. There was no communication from the staff and no apology for the delay. "
"Written July 16, 2017",Awesome experience on the London Eye River Cruise,"Had a lovely afternoon in London on both the London Eye, followed by the London Eye River Cruise. Every employee I encountered was friendly, helpful and happy. There was a really lovely atmosphere and the process of boarding both the London Eye and River Cruise was incredibly easy. Top marks to the guy we met on the London Eye Pier who helpfully directed us to our cruise which we boarded at 17.45 today (16/07/17). We had some brilliant commentary on board our cruise expertly and enthusiastically delivered by Ruby. Ruby made the experience my wife and I had on the boat really good, particularly her encouragement for us to wave at the bridges 😄😄😄Well done to everyone at the both the London Eye and Rivercruise, I would recommend doing both if you can.

"Written October 4, 2015",Great way to get an overall birds eye view perspective of London,Visited with UK relatives who had little experience of London. This was the first thing we did to give them an overall perspective of the city and the main downtown geography. A must see for first time visitors. Booked tickets online the night before and required only a 5min queue to pick up an hardly any wait for the ride.
"Written October 1, 2015",Great way to see London,The Eye is in a great location which allowed us a birds eye view of some of the great sites in London.
"Written September 9, 2015",a lovely moment with a beautiful night city view,"We enjoyed the night view of London, especially the lighting up Big Ben was very beautiful.  We recommend purchasing the fast pass ticket in advance especially if you visit London during peak season because there was a long line even at around 8PM, which is when we went."
"Written September 8, 2015",Amazing,"Get on the London Eye to get a 360 degree birds eye view of the city of London. Sit in the glass capsules as you see the Thames bending for miles and capturing the other attractions of the city like Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge, Gherkin Building et.al. Queues can be long during weekends. You can book your tickets online and be in the pick up queue which is relatively smaller and faster than the queue for buying tickets. You can also get into the Fastrack queue which will save you a lot of time including avoiding the long queue of embarking, but that comes at almost double the price of normal tickets"
"Written August 28, 2015",One of our favorites,"Beautiful views, smooth ride even for those with fear of heights,  expensive but worth the money.  Get the fast pass!"
"Written August 15, 2015",Fun thing to do with family and friends ,"The lines are huge, even though you have a ticket for a certain time. We made the mistake of waiting to go on our last day, which was Saturday, and we showed up with vouchers at 6pm. The first tickets were available for 8:30pm. We couldn't line up before 8:00pm, and even then we probably waited for 45 minutes. Inside the capsule, you have nice views, but it's basically 40 minutes of people taking selfies! I'm glad we did it, but at the same too, I'm not sure if I'd do again if i came back to London. "
"Written August 15, 2015",Fantastic view,"We ride this every time we visit London and are always amazed with the view and how many people ride this every day.This is right across from Big Ben and Parliament so the view is truly one of a kind. I would recommend getting your ticket ahead of time via the internet. First of all it is less expensive. Second you can avoid the line to buy tickets. The nearest station is either Westminster or Waterloo. I like the former because of the view along the river. I would also recommend getting the daytime/night time ticket. we rode it at 10 AM and then you can ride it again anytime after 5 PM. We went back around 9 PM and the lights of London just reemphasize what a beautiful city it is. Also when you get into the pod, I would avoid sitting. Everyone heads for the benches but really you are not there to sit. Head to the end of the pod facing the left side. That way you can guarantee the best view during the 30 minute ride. "
"Written August 14, 2015",Champagne Experience on the Eye,"Advice: book the ""Champagne Experience"" for the London Eye and have a way, way better experience than those who are waiting in that interminable line with their standard tickets.  If you book online in advance it's £28.80.  The extra eight pounds are absolutely worth it.  The area around the Eye is a tad sketchy and super touristy, as is to be expected.  When we approached, I saw the world's longest line stretching out from the Eye and felt a little glum... but my friend had booked Champagne Experience tickets, so we strolled right past that horrible line and picked up tickets at a nearby building.  Then, we were pointed to a lounge on the second floor, where we waited around a little bit (but on comfortable sofas with views of the Eye, so much better than that line outside), and were then taken directly to the Eye by a private guide with the other parties who'd booked our time slot.  We went through security quickly, where our bags were checked, and then straight onto the Eye with no waiting.  There were about 12 of us total in the group, which was a perfect size.  We had plenty of room to move about the car and not feel crowded.  Our guide poured a glass of Champagne for each of us, handed out maps of what we'd see on our ride, and then gave some description of what we were seeing and engaged us in a quick trivia contest that got everyone laughing.  Everyone was enjoying themselves.  The views from the Eye are spectacular.   My only complaint is that I'd have liked to go around again, it was so breathtaking.  We were there towards the end of the day, on a gorgeous, clear day, and the views of London were absolutely incredible.  I'm afraid of heights, but had no trouble with the Eye.  It moves slowly and the cars are very sturdy, so you don't feel the up & down movement.  If you're going to do the Eye, I recommend bypassing those crowds so you can really enjoy the experience.  Upgrade that ticket!  This is one of those places it's worth it to spend a bit more, if you can."

You don't need to go the ""fast track"" gazebo to purchase your ticket - UNLESS - there is a huge line and you are in a hurry.

"Written October 14, 2015",Fun but expensive.,"I really like the London eye. If your in London for a short time it's a must do, the view or the Houses of Parliament & Big Ben are great. But be warned it isn't cheap! They try to make it seem value for money by showing a 4D film before you going the line. It's probably good for small kids but I got a little bored and impatient just wanting to get on the eye. All in all you have to do it even tho it's expensive. But so are most tourist things and they all have their own draw."

Joined queue and stood for 50 minutes in hot weather before getting onto pod. I felt really sorry for people with young kids. AV TVs did not work and the staff we encountered were rude and dismissive. Lovely view of London of course but would advise visitors just to pop into the Tate Modern for free viewing in much more pleasant surroundings. Save your money folks - the eye is a rip off in our experience. Pity.

"Written June 25, 2016",London Eye (in the rain) and Still Worth the Visit,"Yes, a bit pricey, but it's London and worth the price for the range of breathtaking views around the city and of the Thames. It moves slowly, so much so that there are times you think you may have stopped (and at one point it did for loading passenger(s) with disabilities). The only negative was the long line to buy tix. Too many options/up sell opportunities, so it's slow. Not sure you can purchase in advance, but if so, go for it!Note that we visited on a typically rainy/cloudy evening and except for the windows of our pod being wet and reducing photo quality, we thought it was OK to do this in the rain."

"Written December 22, 2015",Good for First Time Visitors,The London Eye has become a tourist icon.  The views on a clear day make the 30 minute voyage a worthwhile excursion.  The lines are typically long and the Coca Cola Company sponsored attraction tickets are pricey.  Recommended for first time visitors to London with an interest in taking landmark and city view photos.  A walk across the Jubilee Bridge en-route to or from the Eye is a worthwhile undertaking.
"Written December 20, 2015",Nice as always. ,"The queue was lovely and quick considering it was a Friday near Christmas, so we got on in less than 10 minutes.

"Written July 13, 2015",Must-Do while in London,"I am so delighted that we chose to go on the London Eye.  The experience was wonderful.  We were able to see fabulous views over London at a measured enough pace to ensure plenty of good vacation pictures.  Having said that, shortly before returning down, you will be asked to stand where indicated and smile and can purchase a booklet about the Eye and sites visible in all direction, along with your picture before exiting the gift shop.  Your picture will also be made available on line so that you may download it into your digital albums.  Look for the line for VIP access - you will pay slightly more but it is worth the reduction in wait time."
"Written July 13, 2015",Unbeatable London views,"We visited the London Eye first thing in the morning on Wednesday, July 1, our last day in London. I'm glad we waited until the last day, as the Eye gave us a birds-eye view of everything we saw during our trip.The total time from stepping off the tube at Westminster to completing our rotation on the Eye was about 90 minutes, which felt very reasonable. The lines were long, but moved quickly. You'll want to make sure to visit the loo before you get in line, however, as there's no opportunity until your ride is over. All of the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly, and our experience on the Eye itself was excellent. We could barely tell that we were moving, and the 360 degree map (1 pound at the ticket counter) helped us to identify all the landmarks. Note to photographers: since you're enclosed in a clear capsule, taking photos can be challenging on a sunny day due to the reflection/glare. Note to acrophobics: I'm not someone who loves heights, and I had no issues on the London Eye. It's like you're in a little room that just happens to be moving, and does not feel like a traditional ferris wheel. It feels completely stable and safe."
"Written July 10, 2015",London Eye,"Very, very busy attraction.  Best time to go was around 6.30 pm when people were still at dinner.  Well organized, and great views of the city.  Good souvenir store at the foot of the eye.  Very smooth ride."

We were advised by email to be there 15mins before our experience. When we arrived we found out that wE the general opening tome for the eye & we had to join a queue.We found ourselves in a '2hour' queue in 30+ degrees of heat. No organisation, no water or drinks without losing your place in the Q & no adherence to ticket times. Priority given to 'fast track' tickets which meant the waiting times for standard ticket holders extended.I have better things to do than spend, what would have been, 3 hours in a queue being treat worse than cattle going to worse"
"Written July 8, 2015",Fast Track Ticket,If you don't have a lot of time on your hands but you want to check out the city from a good elevation point I would def. recommend a fast track ticket. The line was moving fairly quickly and we were done with the entire experience in about 45ish minutes.
"Written July 4, 2015","Great views, but be sure to use a 2 for 1 voucher","The London Eye provides you with great 360 degree views of the city.  The capsules are very roomy and move very slowly so you have plenty of time to take in the view and snap pictures.  Two suggestions: First, like everything in London, the ride is a little pricey, therefore, I recommend getting a Travelcard and using the 2 for 1 voucher.  Second, I would go late in the evening.  We went at about 7pm and there was no line, plus you get nice lighting for pictures.  We were in the same area a few days later in the middle of the day, and the line was  VERY long."

"Written July 3, 2015",Viewing London From the Eye,Long lines and fairly high priced for our family of 8 - but worth it all.  We were so impressed by the amazing 360 views we got of London.  The Parliament Buildings and Big Ben were especially clear.  The individual containers are very roomy and feel very secure.  The wheel moves slowly (30 minutes for a full revolution) so that even the most nervous member of our group was comfortable.

Great!When we arrived, it seemed there was a long queue, but we need not have worried: It did not take long and we could step into a capsule. Good job, we didn't buy a fast-track ticket!

"Written March 4, 2015",enjoyed the experience,"There are all sorts of ""packages"" you can buy for this attraction...we just got the regular ride and enjoyed ourselves.  Keep in mind that in your ""pod"" are many other tourists...on our particular pod....the really ""great"" spot (that lets you take perfect pictures of Parliament, Big Ben and other great buildings) was taken by a man and wife and their three children.  They were ""dug-in"" and were not willing (upon requests of everyone else on the pod) to move so that others could get a shot.  It wasn't the sort of thing that ruined the trip....just be aware that it can happen..and they are certainly within their rights....so it just is what it is...next time though, we might consider springing for a more private ride.   Another thing worth noting...we went on a rainy day...it was pouring!  Don't let this stop you from going!  The view was still there (though less than perfect..) but the cool thing was this:  we paid regular price, our wait time was less than 10 minutes...whilst in the line...there were so few people buying the ""fast track"" tickets...that they opened up the fast track line for us commoners.  It was great!  True, we were all a bit cold and wet...but honestly..I'd rather have that than to wait for the long lines (I've heard you can wait four hours or more...not sure its worth that...)  so if you are willing to brave a less than perfect weather day...you are likely to benefit.   We had planned on only going to look at the eye..when we got there and saw how short the line was, we went for it.  I'm glad we did. We were killing time before our river boat cruise....this is an easy walk across a bridge from where the boats (dis)embark....  great and busy fish n chips shop nearby."
"Written March 3, 2015",See it all from Here,You can see much of central London from here.  Opt for the skip in line tickets and take plenty of pictures to remember your time there.  then take a walk or run along the River Thames.
"Written May 3, 2015",A Nice View,"The London Eye was a very good experience. The line was very long but moved quickly. The views from the Eye were amazing, we got some really good pictures of Buckingham Palace and the other great sites around London. A must see when visiting London. "
"Written May 1, 2015",Great combi ticket,If you visit the London Eye you can go on the boat ride for free. We really recommend you do this as the Tower bridge from the water is an impressive sight. The gudies have a great knowledge about the historical buildings so you get a good general overview in a short period of time. Get there early so you can have a good seat in the front of the boat 
"Written April 13, 2015",Great view!,"Before we went on, we went to the 4D movie which I highly recommend as it was a lot of fun and showed the things you would see from the top. The London eye itself is also great fun and you get your photo taken on it when your on the way down. There are little computers that tell you what each of the buildings are which is handy if your looking for one building in particular. The view from the top is amazing and you can almost see all of London. You definitely can't go to London and not go on the London eye!"

"Written April 4, 2015",Not Worth the Visit Along With Rude Staff Members!,"My husband and I were visiting London from Hong Kong; my husband is originally from New Zealand and this was his first real trip to London I am a British citizen but left the UK 8 years ago. I have always wanted to take a trip on the London Eye and could say it was on my 'bucket list'. We visited the London Eye and bought tickets. We proceed to board and there were 2 security guards checking bags. I opened my bag as it had 3 zip pockets the gentleman checked one pouch but didn't bother with the other 2, he asked me did I have any sharp objects to which I replied no; he waved me on. My husband was dealt with by another member of staff I can only describe this man as an arrogant bully. He was adamant my husband had a bag containing belongings but it was a camera bag which was empty as the camera was around his neck we explained this and showed him inside the bag along with the camera but he continually bullied my husband asking him to stand to one side; when he did he said it was the incorrect place. Maybe if they want customers to stand in a specific place you appoint footprints like they do in all other security areas in the UK. Ironically they had a screening machine maybe they should use rather than treat customers in such an appalling manner. The way my husband was bullied by the member of staff was despicable and it appears there is no consistency in the way you treat people and this tarnished what was supposed to be a special trip. After disembarking we went to find the member of staff to get his security number or a photograph but he was not there. We have visited other iconic buildings i.e. the Statue of Liberty in the USA and were never dealt with like this. I was appalled to be British after treatment like this and I will never visit the London Eye nor recommend it to anybody. Along with the poor treatment we endured before boarding the attraction was very poor value for money, the view was disappointing, the cabin was extremely hot and the experience did not last long. Don't waste your money."
"Written April 3, 2015",London Eye,"Beautiful views of London from here, i went in January for my brothers birthday and we paid to get onto the London eye you get fantastic views from each side. Definitely a attraction to go on. The staff at the London are very welcoming and friendly."
"Written March 26, 2015",Overprice and awful customer service,went with some visitors from abroad and had to wait over 30 min while we could see a lot of people jumping the queue and if there is a queue it must be followed...one can get to other high venues to see london from above without having to suffer the 45 min queue and overprice fee
"Written March 24, 2015",Disappointing service ,"The view was amazing. You get one full round on the wheel and that's enough, the views on either side are wonderful and even on an overcast day like ours it was outstanding.  The service though of every single worker we came across was horrid. The 3 people taking our tickets out the front were having their own conversation completely,  didnt even look at us or say hello or anything. I now know too much about the fellas domestic with his boss. They were rude, didn't acknowledge anyone coming and going, and a separate group of workers pushed us out of the cabin at the end practically. Disappointing. "
"Written March 19, 2015",Great ride- go in morning,"We happened to get there at 3pm on a Tuesday and there was no line which was great. The cabin holds 35 people so we were excited to have just 2 couples in ours. The views are excellent, but I'd say go in the morning because at 3pm the sun is on the back side of the Parliament/ Big Ben which makes pictures of it almost impossible. They just come out dark, even with our expensive dslr camera. Wish we had thought of that before boarding, because for the price we were not going to ride it again. "
"Written March 16, 2015",Two words...FAST TRACK,"When you get there, if the queue is long, just pony up for the fast pass...we thought it was well worth it! Spectacular views. It moves very, very slow and each compartment is large and air conditioned.Loved it!"
"Written July 31, 2015",Iconic,"This was the first thing we did when we arrived in London. I already bought tickets online prior to arriving to London. We got our Fast Track tickets which were amazing. We saw the queue to buy tickets and we are glad that bought out tickets online. We got there a bit early and the ticket we bought was for 5:00pm but they allowed us to go up around 4:30pm. We met up with out relatives who got normal tickets online, but they were allowed to upgrade their tickets to Fast track tickets. The queue for the normal ticket is different from the fast track tickets. The fast track ticket queue was empty. The capsule was big enough for a few people. You have to sort of squeeze yourself at times to see the view or to take photos as some people hog an area of the capsule. You just have to be polite. The views were amazing, especially because it was my first time in London. We were lucky that it was an amazing day, just a little bit of cloud in the sky. The ride felt quite quick which I'm not complaining about. It just feels so surreal to be in the London eye. The souvenir shop had a lot of good stuff. The 4D experience was pretty cool too. There were also some ice cream stands and drink stands around the area. There was also a cafeteria closeby if you get hungry and toilets of course. Simply amazing."
"Written July 27, 2015",Excellent views of London from the London Eye,"Excellent panoramic views from the London Eye. The London cityscape is fantastic!The 30 minute revolution is about the right amount of time to enjoy the scenery and take pictures.Definitely recommend spending extra and buying the ""Fast Track"" option. My family was able to avoid the regular line-ups of +1 hour (perhaps even 2 hours?), as the timing of our visit coincided with the first Saturday after school let out in July.Sheer madness and chaos in and around the County Hall building, I think especially on the weekends. Purchase your tickets on-line in advance and save. The line-ups to retrieve your pre-purchased tickets are shorter than the line-ups to buy tickets (and no guarantee that tickets will be available).Either way, bring your patience ... and enjoy!"
"Written July 26, 2015",Fantastic experience,"We visited London last weekend and went on the eye on the Sunday. We arrived just after opening (as advised) and queued for about 20-25min. The queue moved constantly so it didn't feel like we were waiting for long.We had a BOGOF offer from national rail card, which was great, as it can get expensive if you are a family paying full price, so look out for offers.Myself and my 7 year old daughter rode the eye and we both really enjoyed the experience. We paid £1 extra for the souvenir map, which in my opinion was well worth it as, we spotted sights such as Wembley stadium, which we probably would not have noticed without the map.  It was surreal to be viewing busy noisy London in a relatively quiet and peaceful ""bubble"" and the views were amazing!!!!!Included in the ticket is a 4D show, which was a nice extra and worth doing, although I think I have been spoilt by visiting the Florida theme parksI think this is attraction is defiantly worth a visit if you are in London, it's an experience myself and my daughter certainly won't forget."
"Written July 25, 2015",Lots of fun,A great view of London- get tickets online ahead of time to avoid wait. Loved that it took some time and you could enjoy the ride and not feel rushed through the experience
"Written July 23, 2015",Save your money,"This was one of the most anti climactic experiences I've experienced. To be honest I wasn't expecting much and it was still a disappointment. They overall hype and long lines add to the discontent. At every corner they try to squeeze some extra money from you with silly photo and other junk. Please save your money. Our two little kids would have eaten our brains if we didn't do this so we had no choice. If you have a choice, don't do it."
"Written July 23, 2015",Amazing view!,"Since this is the second largest ferris wheel in the world, it is a must to visit of course. The wait wasn't too long (consider it was Sunday morning), the view is really amazing to see the enitre city!!"
"Written July 21, 2015",Do the Fast Track!,Pay a little more for the Fast Track ticket. It is well worth it to skip the long line. Our wait could have been about 2 hours. It ended up being 6 minutes instead!
"Written July 20, 2015",Avoid,I purchase skip the line tickets. Paniced when we couldn't make our 2pm booking becos of crowds getting there onlynto find time booked means nothing.  Two hours in fast track que not my idea of fast. Too many people too few staff. .. totally shambolic.  Not worth it at all. Experience foul and ride under welling because of everything that went in to getting on. Avoid!!!

"Written July 17, 2015",Great views of the city,It's a great way to see London's sights. The lines can be long but they moved fast when we were there. We were very happy that they didn't put too many folks on one pod and that it goes slow enough that we were able to enjoy all the sights while taking a bunch of photos. Will remember this experience for times to come.
"Written June 9, 2015",Amazing...,"London Eye is everything you can imagine. It's a beautiful view to see all . You are better off booking on the internet so you can get a ticket. Its always a long line up, but it does go pretty fast.  And its a nice place to go for a walk and lunch"
"Written June 5, 2015",Poor Management - child bleeding and offered no assistance,"I was very upset yesterday after our visit to the Eye.  I decided to wait a day to write my review to determine if I was justified in a low review.  I have thought about this and feel I am.  The Eye itself is a very cool experience.  We purchased fast tract tickets ahead of time and it worked perfectly.  We were on within 10 minutes of arriving.  However, I cannot promote a place that has such little concern for a patron.  While riding the Eye my daughters 10 year old friend began to bleed out of a previous cut.   By the time we exited she had blood on her leg and hand.  The attendant noticed as we got off and told us to go inside to the ticket counter area where we could get to a bathroom to wash off the blood and get tissues for her.  We walked in the door at 8:55pm and was told they closed at 9pm and we could not use the restroom.  I explained that she was bleeding.  This employee told us to go to the bathroom quickly if we could get past ""security.""  A very heavy set employee in a suit would not let us down to the bathrooms, nor would he allow us to get a napkin from the beverage sale area, because, ""the were cleaning up"" and directed us to go two blocks to find a restroom in another business.  Luckily, the employee working the beverage center closest to the door (where they sell Smart Water) saw that she was had blood on her and quickly grabbed some napkins.  The first doorman and the larger ""security"" man laughed as we walked out the door.  As I looked back I noticed the ticket counters were still selling ride tickets to get people on by 9pm.  Was we walked down the waterfront the very nice people working the ice cream stand between the Dungeon and McDonalds saw that she was bleeding and offered water and more napkins.  They even offered bandaids for the First Aid kit, however I had some in my purse to use after getting the cut cleaning up.  I really feel compelled to report a business that has little to no concern to their patrons.  I would highly recommend the Eye experience.  I just hate that ours ended as it did.  Thankfully, a business where we were not patrons were kind enough to help us."
"Written June 4, 2015",Don't hesitate just do it,"After 10 days in London I never gave much thought of doing the London eye. What a mistake, walking pass on our last day around 10 in the morning the line for the eye was only 30 meters long so I thought why not after walking pass over the last week the lines would be hundreds of meters long. The views are breathtaking from the eye you think Big Ben looks great from ground level  wait to you see it from up above. Plenty of room to move around so you will not miss out on photo opportunities. Get there early and beat the crowds and enjoy a life time memory. "
"Written May 30, 2015",STUNNING VIEWS.,"If you are planning on taking a ride on The London Eye,  I suggest you pre book your time & tickets as the queue to this Ride is, in one word,  LONG.  I cannot remember the cost involved but it is well worth it.  We did it during the day, which you could see for miles and miles.  Great to take wonderful photos of all the Landmarks."
"Written May 27, 2015",How many of these exist?  Go for it!,"If you're in London, give it a ride.  We went about dusk and had slight rain, but still got some great photos.  We did the combo package and did the boat ride also which was very interesting.  We are glad we did the combo."
"Written May 20, 2015",no!  Rip off!,"I would love to give this ZERO stars (er...circles).  I booked a ""flexi - fast track"" set of tickets and showed up to a line that snaked out the doors full of irate ""fast"" (or as I like to call it faster slow track) customers waiting for the pleasure of picking up said tickets.  Why you can't simply print out tickets you've already paid for is beyond me.  The line would've taken hours to just pick up paid for tickets.  Then a wait for the actual ride. Mind you this was the Fast Track!The area where it is located was full of tacky ""side show"" type entertainment.  We decide not to waste hours in line - Westminster Abbey took only 40 minutes.  AVOID THIS TACKY Attraction and shoddy customer service. I asked for my money back and they said I could come back later - if like me you have your trip planned out this was not going to happen.  In addition, I was on hold for 15 minutes calling customer service before being cut off - TWICE.  I have been to London four times and there are so many lovely things to do and places to see.  I guess there is a reason I never wasted my money there before (I'm out over $100.00). Do not waste time in this nasty area full of street hucksters."

"Written May 9, 2015",Wonderful Views!,"We really enjoyed seeing the entire city this way.  Get your tickets in advance and get the fast track tickets.  We had no line and went right to the ride, amazing!"
"Written May 8, 2015",Birds eye view with a glass of bubbly well worth it!,Waited in line to purchase a champagne package on the London Eye and River Cruise. Once we got to the front of the queue we were told to go to the VIP line off to the right as we entered to purchase the champagne ride which leaves every hour on the hour for a limited number of guests. We paid for both the champagne ride and river cruise immediately afterwards (we were cautioned we might not make it). The London eye champagne cruise was well worth the extra cost. We went upstairs to a quiet lounge and waited separately from other patrons and enjoyed a glass of champagne (at an additional cost) prior to being escorted as a separate group to the front of the line and onto our own 'private' pod. The pod was comfortable with 10 people plus our amazing tour guide Rae who served us champagne as we rode around the London Eye and was able to answer all our questions. The 360 degree view was spectacular and we were able to see all of the historically significant buildings around London. I have a long standing fear of falling and initially was rather nervous but because the rate of ascent and descent is very slow I was able to adapt and enjoy myself. I would highly recommend the champagne cruise to all adults. The River cruise was nice. The young man who did the commentary was very knowledgeable about the historical significance of the buildings on either side of the Thames. We initially sat up top but the rainy drizzle forced us inside. It was a nice ride but somewhat anticlimactic after our ride on the London Eye. I would recommend doing the river cruise first and the London Eye afterwards. Both are very worthwhile.
"Written May 3, 2015",Fantastic. Memorable. Highly recommended.,Can't rate the fast pass highly enough. Friendly staff. Very accommodating. Pods not packed. Fantastic experience. 10/10. Well done London eye. Tourist attraction done 100%.
"Written March 2, 2015","Fun, brilliant view of the skyline","Had to go on the London Eye, a trip to London would be wasted without having a glimpse of the historic buildings from a higher standpoint!Lots of fun too, not too scary - the carriages move very slowly!"
"Written March 2, 2015",River Cruise,"If you go on the London eye, take a river cruise. You get a discount for 2 attractions. Well worth the visit. You can sit inside or on top. It was cold on the day we went so we sat inside. This is not a problem as the view is still very good and the guide is very knowledgeable. There's also somewhere to get a drink and snacks."
"Written March 2, 2015",Enjoyable trip,"Really enjoyable, the river cruise was a brilliant way to see lots of sights and get a brilliant commentry by staff. Lots of photo opportunities and only takes 40 minutes if time is an issue. The London eye was brilliant, the night flight amazing."
"Written March 1, 2015",Still over priced,"We bought our tickets online for a ""discount"" price and paid £39.80 for 2 adult tickets on the 1pm ride.Really not sure why they give you a specific time as you'll be queuing for around 20/30 mins in a jumbled mish-mash que with no proper system.We took my baby daughter along with us in a pram and were told it had to be folded before getting in the capsule (once folded it actually takes up more room as it separates into 2 pieces but there we are).In the queue you have your picture taken, the photographer was either blind or hated babies as she completely cut my daughter out, even though I was holding the carrier up purposefully for her to be in the picture.The flight itself was ok, saw a few of the land marks and the screens in the capsule are helpful to let you know what's where.Definitely not worth 20 quid each but was ok for a once in a decade trip."
"Written March 1, 2015",Wonderful views,Came here in October on a cold clear day. The sights of London in my opinion are unrivalled and the eye gives a view of all of londons beautiful sights.
"Written March 1, 2015",Gotta Do It!,You gotta do this.  It's a great experience and the views are fantastic.  We went on a cloudy day and it was still breath taking!
"Written February 28, 2015",Even in the rain..........,I've already reviewed the London Eye which I gave excellent even in the rain.The boat trip was good despite the pouring rain. The service and commentary was good. I would say the only issue I have is that the seats at the front downstairs need replacing due to wear and tear and they should be higher as the windows for the front rows are higher than further back and standing is discouraged.I did enjoy this trip and would recommend it.
"Written February 28, 2015",An eye for an eye,"The London eye has always been one of these attractions I kept telling myself I must do that the next time in here. Well finally after countless trips to London I booked the fast track ticket to get on the London eye for 1430. The whole process was fast indeed. We got our photos taken before viewing a wonderful short film of London in 4D  which is free so you really can't complain at that. We then made our way out to the eye and entered the fast track dedicated queue, which was empty, while the other line had maybe 40 people waiting. Within a few seconds we were in a pod and on our way to the top of the world...well London at least. The rotation takes 30mins and I do believe it did take an hour at one stage so I did feel slightly robbed at this fact. However, 30mins seemed to be ample to take in the sights and I can understand why the rotation has been increased...more money less waiting. The views were good when I was there and I managed to see beyond Wembley stadium and I spotted all the popular attractions. One thing that did irritate me was the photo section at the end. I didn't actually get a chance to get my photo whilst on the eye as each photo section was bombarded by a rather rude family (the same family on both sections) which I thought was quite unfair and very selfish of this family to do so. Overall it was a good experience although flawed in some areas regarding photo opportunities so maybe some tweaking is needed in this so all persons within a pod get their photo taken at the end. "
"Written February 27, 2015","Nice view, fun for the kids","Did this once with a co-worker a few years ago and again tonight with my 13yr old daughter. We both really enjoyed it. Buy the tickets online to save a few bucks and skip the line. Great view, nice interactive aids on the ride, comfortable and smooth ride. I have also done the Shard and while the view is better from the Shard, the experience is more entertaining on the London Eye."
"Written February 24, 2015",Use your coupons from the Stansted-Express!,We used the Stansted-Express to go from the airport to the city and they give you some brochures where you can find coupons inside (wide variety of attractions and more) and we use the coupons for the London Eye and got half-priced tickets for each person.The sight of the London Eye is beautiful - would recommend a ride at night. It's worth it and you'll definetly get some nice pictures.
"Written June 30, 2015",London Eye in a Wheelchair,"Go in the morning if you can. The line gets longer later in the day. If you are a wheelchair user, just get the regular tickets. The attendants are professional and will put out a ramp to bridge the gap for wheelers to board the capsule."
"Written June 27, 2015",London Eye worth your while on a clear day,We were the first group on and had purchased our tickets before we left the USA. Therefore no problems with lines. It was a clear day so we had great view . In case it is not clear your ticket will get you into a special visual experience to show you what you missed. We forgot to follow up here. Usually you go first so you know what your seeing or missing depending on weather conditions. Loved the attraction. 
"Written June 25, 2015","Short line, cool views",Not too bad of a wait to get on the ride. The queue moved at a quick pace. I really liked how the pods had monitors that you could click on the building you saw and it would tell you what it what and its function. Really good way to start out a stay in London. 
"Written June 23, 2015","Short lines so no need for the ""fast pass"" premium ticket.","It is what it is... A large plexiglass bubble that gives amazing views of arguably one of the best cities in the world. Not too crowded, many photo ops since people mill around to take in all angles. We left about an hour before sunset and were luckily treated to dramatic lighting under partly cloudy skies. I highly recommend timing your trip to avoid overcast and/or cloudy conditions. Also a good idea to buy online as the line for tickets looked long but the will-call line was nonexistent and there is a ten percent discount. Take in the short (5 minutes or less) 4D movie before your ride. The line for the ride was less than ten minutes after the movie, so the whole experience was less than an hour (half an hour in the bubble). It is a short, scenic walk across the Thames from the Westminster tube station, or a shorter but less scenic walk from Waterloo Station."

I Googled 'What to do in London for 6 hours?' The London Eye came up. I had heard about it but never experienced it. Closer attention online yielded that there were two 'Specials' available: a Pommeroy champagne tasting and. Hotel Chocolat with Prosecco experience. We chose the latter which included two rides on the Eye, Priority boarding, and. 3-D movie with Eye highlights all for less than the ticket pric paid 'at the door'! This was a fabulous experience and highly recommended to anyone visiting London. The views, Hotel a Chocolat staff, and Prosecco were a winning combination!"

"Written June 15, 2015",Customer Service is Terrible - Rip Off,"We were very excited about doing the London Eye on our last night in London, but we never got that experience. We booked the 9:00 pm tickets, and that was a mistake. We got on the wrong train, and ended up reaching the attraction at 9:05. We did realize this was after our booked time, but we figured it would be okay after all the reviews we read about how long the lines usually were. And no where in our email did it state that if you book the 9:00 time slot, and you are not there by 9:00 on the dot, you will not be allowed on the attraction. We were extremely frustrated, so we contacted customer service, which by the way is terrible. We were offered the option to rebook for a $10 administration fee, but we could not get our money back. I understand the tickets are non-refundable, but it's not that we didn't show up or just decided to skip it. Unfortunately, we made a tourist mistake, which cost us $91.00! There was no way we could rebook, since we were leaving the next morning, and the chances of coming back in the next year are not great, since we live in the US. I just feel like charging an administration fee is fine or even just refunding half the ticket price, but to keep the full $91.00 for the three of us, for not providing anything, is a rip off. I hope you're enjoying your free money, and we will never support this attraction or its affiliates again. I can't believe Coca-Cola would want it's name associated with this ratchet of an attraction."

"Written February 13, 2015",Fantastic for people unafraid of heights,"We went on the London Eye not really taking into account how high this thing actually is. We had to look out and not down, but the views were really captivating. I would highly recommend the London eye, but give it some thought if you are scared of heights because when you're on it, you're on it."
"Written February 13, 2015",Pre booked tickets ,Great London iconic attraction .Pre booked tickets for eye and river trip for a time slot.About 50 minutes to que for a great view of the London skyline where you get to see all the London sites.
"Written February 13, 2015",Not a must-do!,"As pretty as the London Eye looks from a distance especially when its lit up in the night, I'm afraid the view is not so breathtaking when you're in the capsule! London is not the prettiest city from a height unlike Paris or maybe Bergen. Having said that, let me add that it is one of my favorite cities in most other ways!As high as The Eye looks from below, its not much when you're right at the top and its definitely not enough height to appreciate the city. Also, the glass of the capsule was not clean the time I had gone so that was another dampener.I do understand that it has become quite an attraction since its opening but frankly you could give it a miss especially if the queues are long. Do it only if its something that you've been wanting to tick off your list but do not expect much!"
"Written February 12, 2015",Enjoyed the Guided Tour,"We purchased our tickets online and decided on the guided tour. Highly recommend you do this, especially during tourist season--they max it at 20 people vs capacity. Since it was off-season, there were only 5 of us, including our guide, so we got to move around, photograph and ask questions at will. A great way to see London and orient yourself, especially on a sunny day."

Goes at quite a slow pace so plenty time to take in all the sights wonderful views over London got nice photos as keepsakes from inside the pod aswell overall really enjoyed fairly priced Id say aswell for the experience 👍🇬🇧
"Written February 11, 2015",Great to visit at night,"To start off, the view is incredible but I rather prefer the night view. It is during the night where some of the most beautiful photos are snapped. London at night is something completely different, it’s stunning!"
"Written February 9, 2015",An eye for an eye,"This is definitely something you must do at night.  Even if you have a fear of heights, the rotations is so slow and smooth, you will be more excited about the scenery."
"Written February 9, 2015",There's no reason not to! ,"If one is making a trip to London I think it is practically mandatory to take a ride on the London eye as well as see Big Ben and perhaps the Royal Palace. A great way to view the cityscape and gauge the London skyline from right along the river. Fantastic view and quite a neat experience inside such a large ""merry go round"" One may also enjoy the stroll along the water where many people enjoy walking. Give it a go, you'll be glad you did.

"Written February 7, 2015",Beautiful view of London,"The London eye is a must, whether your on your own, with family or as a couple. The view is absolutely spectacular! my girl friend and i went twice, once during the day and again at night. To see London all lit up at night from the top of the Eye was amazing. we were lucky enough not to have to wait too long for tickets but i do recommend to purchase in advance as the lines can get long."
"Written January 17, 2015",Overrated,"I never understood how peopke review the London Eye, or similar attractions in other cities if you ask me. I went becausr it became a London institution and you just simply have to go, even though it's not your thing. I will never make the same mistake. The London Eye is the epitomy of a tourist trap. Overhyped, overrated and overpriced. It offers a great view of London, granted. But at that price and waiting time is it really worth it? I don't think so. I can think of 10 better, or at least equally impressive views which can be viewed either for free, like parliament hill or while discovering an amazing place in London, like St. Paul's cathedral "
"Written August 18, 2014",Photo-mad crowd took the joy out of it,"Booked the Fast Lane tickets and there no fuss boarding with six adults and three kids. It all went smoothly. While our visitors from abroad very much enjoyed the ride and took pictures, I was looking for a spot just to enjoy the views. The capsule is big enough for people to move around, however if you needed to sit down, all you would see is people blocking the views to take pictures during the entire ride. Not really worth spending the money if you ask me."
"Written July 24, 2014",Worth the price,The London Eye providing you a nice 360' London view. The wheels is spinning on the perfect speed. Worth the time and price.
"Written July 11, 2014",Must see but do a little planning,"Of course if you are in London, it's a must with stunning view of London.  Here are some tips to maximize your experience.-Check their website, but DO NOT buy the ticket ahead of time. -Once in London, check the weather for a good clear day, go online (wifi at hotel) at night before and purchase tickets to get the discount, we got the family 2+2- Get there, have someone queue in line for the 3D experience while one person go to pick up the ticket in the group.  There are 2 different lines, don't stand in the wrong line.- Then you have to queue again to ride the capsule"
"Written June 27, 2014",Beautiful View,"Prior to our trip to London, I booked our London Eye and River Cruise ahead of time.  I chose a 10:45 a.m. time.  When we arrived, I was so grateful I had booked early because there were several school groups there that day.  With my printout in hand, we went straight to a kiosk, punched in my reservation number, and we had tickets in hand.  We literally walked straight onto the London Eye with no wait.  The Eye is very slow moving.  You step right into the car as it moves, but again, it is so slow that there is no trouble doing so.  There is a bench in the center of the car for those who prefer to sit.  Around the eye are small computer screens that allow you to choose your language and see a map of the view.  This map was very helpful.  I love that the Eye was one of the first things we did when we arrived to London.  It gave us a bird's eye view of where everything was located.  This made it a little easier to navigate to Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace later that day.  You are supposed to use your River Cruise ticket after you finish the Eye.  I misunderstood the website (I thought we could board the boat at any time during the same day), and we went back to do the cruise later on in the afternoon.  They made us stand to the side of the line while they loaded the boat to be sure there was room for us.  There was.  The boat ride was nice.  We were given some history of the bridges and buildings along the Thames.  I was glad we did both of the activities.  The Eye ride is about 30-40 minutes long.The boat ride is about an hour long."
"Written June 19, 2014",London must be seen from here,"My wife and eye took a ride on the London Eye on our first trip to London and honestly, I wasn't all that fussed about doing it. The thought of the long lines and fairly expensive price of going on this thing just didn't do it for me. After a half day of pestering me I finally relented and boy was I happy I did.We were right about the wait times and cost, but aside from that I couldn't have been more wrong. This attraction is well worth the wait and cost and shouldn't be missed if you're in the city. There truly is no better way to see the city than this. It honestly reminded me of the scene in Mary Poppins when she is floating through the sky in London. You'll only ever have to do it once and it will be worth it."
"Written June 10, 2014",Fantastic staff!,My autistic son panicked as we were boarding and the staff were great - even holding up the ride to let him enter the capsule to see what it was like. Unfortunately he decided not to go on but staff you were absolutely brilliant! Thankyou.
"Written June 8, 2014",One of the greatest sights in London,".Not to be missed.Yes, it's pricey.Yes, the queues can be enormously long - even if you buy on-line beforehand you have to queue to get your ticket.  And even if you go Fast-Track, you still queue a bit, depending on how many other people have paid the extra.But it's worth it for the view of all London spread out before you.TIP:  when you go into the capsule, try to get a place straight ahead and slightly to the left.  this gives one of the best views.TIP: get there at 10 when it opens . . . arriving at 10.20 Saturday 31 May it took one and a quarter hours to negotiate all the queues (buy ticket and get on the capsule) and actually start the ride.TIP: check the children actually want to go - a six-year-old screaming with terror is not good news for the other people there with you.:-)."
"Written May 31, 2014",The London Eye,"This is a must for all visitors to London . Spectacular views across the Capital from the south bank,  of Englands historic buildings ,Big Ben, Houses of Parliament ,the old County hall ( now mainly hotels ) several bridges etc.   But it is not just the views but the activity around you ,people from all over the world all chatting to one another (or sign language ) the busy river Thames below. .Simply a wonderful experience not to be missed.!!!   Yes I think it a little expensive , but , do it once anyway you will not regret it ,also it is even more thrilling to ride after dark. I have taken my visitors to the U K many times and see something new each time .   Also watch the 4D short film show which is included in the ticket price at the adjoining cinema.Expensive, Yes, but worth it at least once."
"Written May 18, 2014","Beautiful views of London, and not scary!","I was hesitant to go on the London Eye, primarily because I'm not crazy about heights. However, as soon as you step into the big plastic bubble (along with about 22 other people), the views are so spectacular you don't have time to worry about how high you are! It's very slow-moving and not scary at all. In fact, at times I thought we were not moving although we were. It's 36 stories at its peak, so it's quite high. But you get panoramic views from all sides. Two tips - buy your Fast Track tickets online before you go to avoid the long queues. That also allows you to board much faster. It was well worth the extra fee. I chose the one where I could show up anytime on a given day. Try to go on a clear day - the views are fabulous!Also, there's a snapshot opportunity at the end of the ride. Pose for the pic! It was fun to ride the boat loading at the Tower of London and disembarking at the London Eye pier - took us right to the ride! Nice little ride down the Thames."
"Written May 15, 2014",GREAT,"Everything that you think about when you travel to London can be seen from the Eye. Also, there were tourists from many parts of the world that you could enjoy and talk with. Big Ben is right there with the Westminister Abbey. It's a really great view."
"Written February 24, 2015",London eye,"went for ride on the London eye for the first time, the eye gives great views of London and the map gives you all the directions if you are not familiar with the landscape The ride takes about 30 mins which is just about right Great time "

I use to live nearby, it was a quick walk around the corner for me and I kind of missed coming here. Great place for tour. Exciting time"
"Written February 20, 2015",Be aware of the time of your cruise!!,"We decided to do the London Eye section first, as we booked our tickets on the London Eye website. No where at all, no on the tickets, did it say that the booked time was for the RIVER CRUISE! We spent over £90 in total and didn't get chance to do the cruise section as we missed our time slot. No one at the ticket office was interested and refused to issue a refund. I suppose in hindsight it was our fault for not checking, but us assuming because we booked on the London Eye website, our time slot was naturally for the London Eye, but we were wrong. The Eye itself was fantastic but we felt let down by the cruise we couldn't have."
"Written February 19, 2015",Very disappointing,I was very disappointed when I paid the high price for this trip.  My fear of heights didn't cause the problem it was just the lack of wow factor that it had been built up to.  Save your pennies to get ripped off on another tourist attraction.
"Written February 19, 2015",Great Attraction,"Being located right by the Thames gives great panoramic views of all the ""must see"" buildings around the area. Well worth a visit even on a wet day (as it was on our visit) the rain does not impede the great views."
"Written February 18, 2015",Better places to see London,"I personally wouldn't bother queueing to go on the London Eye. It moves at snails pace and you don't get anything like the best view of London. I'd recommend tourists go to Parliament Hill, Greenwich Park or Alexandra Palace to get a good review...Those are all free and no need to queue!"
"Written February 18, 2015",Expensive but worth it!,I was there by night and the view was breath-taking. The cabins are large enough for everyone to have their own space and enjoy the view from all the spots. Ride is long enough. I was very satisfied and would do it again !

"Written January 4, 2015",New Years Eve in London - Disabled Viewing Area at London Eye,"If you are disabled and thought it would be a wonderful experience to join with fellow celebrants to bring in the New Year in London in 2016 - my advice would be please don't.The designated viewing are for those with disabilities was quite frankly horrendous, showing a complete lack of understanding for those with disabilities that we don't come across quite so often in this day and age, thank goodness.  Toilets were up a steep flights of stairs - not so good for those with walking difficulties, Those attending were hidden well out of view of the main celebration, I don't think I have ever (or for many years) felt so insulted or disheartened on behalf of my disabled son,  Mr Johnson and his event team should hang their arrogant heads in shame.  I am happy to pay and be considered a first class citizen rather than the third class, penned in on the side of Albert Embankment.  Thank goodness it didn't rain!!!!"
"Written December 27, 2014",Its Historic no other thing Special,"After shelling out huge amount if you are willing to stand at a place for more than a hour then you may visit this place. However I would personally not recommend, you can get a better view of London when you board your plane. The charges are way high and there is nothing special about it. instead enjoy the scenic beauty of London eye from outside.ONE BIG TIP - Many frauds are seen near London eye, do not get involved in any gambling games with the men who claim to double your money (have seen many people loosing money), they basically fool people and do have a license for gambling and is completely illegal, would face an arrest if spotted by the Police."
"Written December 19, 2014",Offensive tour guide,"Tour was fine, level of information was average but my lasting impression is that I was gobsmacked at the tour guide's cliched, misogynistic comments about women. If he actually set out to offend half of his audience, good work!"

And all for only a couple of quid more than a standard fast-track ticket, what's not to love?We went after dark and it was an absolutely magical start to an evening on the town. Can't recommend highly enough."
"Written December 12, 2014",Circular river tour,"Starting from the London Eye Pier, which is just a walk across Westminster Bridge,  this 40 minute cruise was just right for the short time we had.  Our visitor was delighted with views of Tower Bridge and the Globe, and even more by the silhouette of the Gherkin, Walkie-Talkie and Cheesegrater. There was a really useful commentary, and other language audio versions.  By this time of year this was the only river tour we could find where you could just stay on the boat."
"Written December 3, 2014",Never again,"It's one of those things you have to do and never do again and the London eye is exactly that , they fail to mention when you purchase the ticket that you will be queuing for ages unless you want to fork out even more money for fast track by the time we got on it it was getting dark never again very boring spend your money on something else."

"Written September 26, 2012","Too expensive? Sure, but great fun to see everything from so high up. Loved it!","Even in the early stages of planning this trip to London, going on the London Eye was a ‘must do’ and it did not disappoint. In fact it was beyond my expectations! This is something you should really splurge on as part of your holiday in London, as the views are stunning. I especially think it’s great as one of the first things a first-timer to London should do. It’s kind of a nice dramatic introduction to London. The venue itself is quite nice. While the lines are long and look rather intimidating at first, they move rather quickly. I don’t think buying the ‘fast track’ tkt is worth the extra cost, in my opinion.  Just be patient for a short bit, and you’ll get there soon enough. The first part of the experience is that you watch a 4D presentation. Frankly, I expected it to be rather lame and a waste of time. So wrong! It was, in fact, amazing, with great graphics and special effects. I went from thinking it was going to be a waste, to being disappointed when it was over, as I wanted more, lol.  In any event, you’re there for the Eye, and what of it? Well, it’s just an amazing piece of engineering which offers some stunning views of some of London’s most icon buildings.  The capsules are brilliant, in that they are comfy, well-equipped with nice information displays and move so precisely that you literally don’t even know your moving. It’s really amazing. So in closing, you know what I’m going to recommend, right? Just go and enjoy the Eye for a different view of Parliament, Big Ben and all the rest of the other famous London sights.Hope this helps."
"Written August 25, 2012",Stunning views,"Another requested outing with our Grandson for his annual stay wth us in the Summer holidays.  We had a two for one voucher which most people in the queue seemed to have so the cost wasn't too bad.  There were queues to get a ticket but they moved very quickly and we felt this was organised well.  We went to the 4D cinema which was good fun for a 4 minute film before going on the eye.  Being in the height of the holidays, we expected to queue for a long time to get on but it was very quick.  We were fortunate that it was a good day so could see for miles.  The computer touch screens in the pods were not too helpful but we could point out most things our Grandson wanted to see.  It really is worth doing once and I would love to do it at night."
"Written August 25, 2012",Eye in the sky,"I have been on the Eye 4 times now. This time was definately the best simply because it was sunny. When you arrive in London try to have a list of to do's ready and put them as either inside or outside things to do. As soon as it starts it rain (and it will), head for the galleries, V&A, shows, tours etc. When the sun smiles on you jump on the Eye the Thames River Cruise and watch the changing of the guard etc. oh yes pack a brolly."
"Written June 19, 2012",Relaxing View of London,"We went back and forth about purchasing tickets ahead of time but ended up buying the tickets at the ticket booth when we were ready to ride.  We were 15 minutes in the ticket line and then waited only 15 minutes more to ride.  There was not a ""Family rate"" in line as advertised.  All in all, we did not want to miss this attraction and we are glad we did it.  The views were beautiful.  And those of us slightly afraid of heights had no problem.  We even bought our picture!"

"Written June 5, 2012",Jubilee weekend disaster!,"We booked a time slot of 3.30 in Feb to see the Jubilee River Pageant.  Turned up 40mins early to scenes of total chaos.  I have no idea they had hugely overbooked it but the queues were enormous.  After about a half hour wait they told everyone with 3.30 tickets to get out of the queue retaining only the 3pm ones.  We stayed put and just as well.  Didn't get onto the eye till 3.45 and luckily did see the Queen's barge - missed all the inital boats though.  Worst than that though was the fact they had 3 GREAT BIG SCREENS where they could have been showing all the action but they chose not to do that and continue with their normal advertising crap.  So we queued for well over an hour, missing the action a few feet from us while watching this rubbish.  I felt sorry for the 3.30 bookings who actually did what they were told as they wouldn't have seen a minute of the celebrations on the water.  The Eye has had years to prepare for this, what on earth happened?  Also it had absolutely no decoration whatsoever for the Jubilee, nothing at all to celebrate a momentous occasion.  Shame on you London Eye!  "
"Written May 18, 2012",Good views,Good views of the city but it's not exactly cheap. I bought the greenscreen photo they offered and it was a poor quality photo considering I paid about $18 for it.
"Written May 18, 2012",Expansive Views of the City!,"If you've done the London-by-bus, and the London-by-river, try London-by-The-Eye! This attraction is not a good idea for those with a fear of heights, even with the very comfortable (and SAFE!) interiors, as the ride from entry to exit is about 30 minutes. Be aware that buying the ticket and queuing for to get into and Eye room can take hours, especially during Summer months and nice weather. Either buy ahead of time, or plan on arriving as early as possible to avoid long waits. Every few minutes the see-through room you and your co-passengers ride to a different vantage point. The 360 degree visibility allows for people to move around the room. There are the to-be-expected rushes of all riders to one section of window for photographic opportunities, particularly when your room moves to an iconic view, but most passengers walk around the room the entire time. Though expensive, the ride on the Eye and the accompanying souvenier book (that label the buildings you will see) are well worth the cost. This is basically a self-guided tour of London, you will see the over-view, the skyline and get the names of the buildings, but you won't get the stories offered on the bus and boat tours. As a positive - the Eye room is always climate controlled and still enjoyable on rainy days, though it is definitely best to enjoy when its sunny."
"Written May 17, 2012",London as you never see it,I was skeptical about going on the London Eye as it seemed to be a glorified bit wheell.  I was wrong.  The unique perspective of London that can be gained from the Eye is truly wonderful. Seeing how pieces of the city connect together is enlightening.  Turning slowly round as you take in a view of the snaking Thames is enchanting.

The pre-paid tour went off flawlessly with no waiting in the long lines to get on the Eye.  We tasted five wines and this tour included two rotations of the ride.  Normally I don't like  heights, but for some reason this wasn't a problem.  The vista from the ride is amazing and I was able to get good photos too!  This was our first trip to London and I would recommend this ride/tour."

Plenty of room to move around, you could have mingled another 20 people in there. The whole experience was fantastic, amazing night-time views over London, with some touch-screen info points in the pod. Would definitely go again."

"Written September 30, 2012",Champagne experience - absolutely incredible,"I have been wanting to go on the London Eye for years, so when my father-in-laws birthday came round, it was the perfect opportunity. We did the champagne experience, which was worth every penny.If you are going on the Eye at the weekend, you need to factor in plenty of time for queueing - once to buy your ticket, and again to take your ride. Booking online helps with the first, and the champagne experience definitely helps with the second. Between showing up and getting into the booth took about 15 minutes.I'm not going to go on about the views, when you are 110 meters up in a glass bubble, you know they're going to be pretty good! Short version - the Eye is worth every penny, and I can't wait to go up again at night. If you have the time, it is an essential tourist destination."
"Written September 27, 2012",Once is enough,"My husband and I were super excited to do the London Eye Experience, especially after seeing it from afar.  I booked advance tickets online, thinking we would be able to pick-up our tickets and avoid the long lines.  That was my first mistake, you have to go to another building a little bit away from the London Eye and stand in a long line to pick-up you tickets and then stand in another super long line to get on the attraction itself.  So, booking in advance, for a set time, did not make much of a difference.  Although the other non pre-booked ticket long was a little longer.  I guess there is an option to fast track this line for a little more money when you book online.  We got in the super long line worried that we were going to miss our dinner reservations.  I have to say the line moved quickly and we were on the ride in about ten-fifteen minutes.  The ride itself and the views were pretty cool, at first, and then after about ten minutes we were ready to get off and move on.  It moves super slow and you have to wait until it goes all the way around, which takes about 25-30 minutes.  I am so grateful I did not pay the extra cost online for a private car or the champagne experience, it definitely wouldn't have been worth it.  I would say the London Eye is a must do, and I am glad I did it, but once is enough."
"Written November 30, 2014",Fast Track is the way to go!,"If you would like to avoid the queues and get straight on to the London Eye, buy a Fast Track or Champagne experience ticket, it adds to the whole experience too.The 4D show is good fun and is included in the price of the ticket. Obviously, the better the weather, the better view, but it is an experience and gives a great view over London."

Took cruise after sunset and it was quite beautiful.  Be prepared when boat turns around to get amazing photos of the bridge.
"Written October 19, 2014",I recommend both,"In London Eye that lasts about 40 minutes (and a queue of about 30 minutes) one can observe London from above and at a slow pace.On the other hand, the cruise is very enjoyable with a guide that explains what you see. Very informative and with a sense of humor if the guide is good as in our case.Highly recommended - especially the cruise."
"Written September 11, 2014",London eye delight ,"I had a girls weekend down in London recently and one of the things we had booked to do was the London eye. Having been on the eye before it was important we spruced our experience up with a champagne experience. Well worth the extra cost (which isn't even that much extra!). A fast track pass is included in this experience meaning you skip the horrendous queue that looked about 2 days long. You and all your fellow champagne experiencers obviously get your champagne, see the amazing views and the lady who accompanies you is there to take pictures with you and your friends whenever you'd like. So nice to add champs, photos, friends and fast track to an already wonderful experience. You'll also get a map telling you the famous landmarks you are looking at from a height. Would recommend this experience highly!! "

So many times here and this is the first ride for us -  but not the last!   Don't miss this event.  Hint:  very poor bathroom facilities - go to McDonald's."
"Written September 10, 2014","Amazing views, great experience.","The London Eye is a must see if you go to London. The views are spectacular and they move everybody along rather well and the bubbles/cars/capsules or whatever you'd like to call them are air conditioned. The price was a bit steep, but tolerable.I booked my ticket online and you must choose a time to visit. I ran late and nearly killed myself to get their the 30 minutes early as they request, only to find out that it really didn't matter anyway. Perhaps this is more of an issue in the high season, but a little more transparency in this regard would have been helpful. Fabulous experience; I'd highly recommend it."
"Written September 5, 2014",Good But Not Great,"The London Eye is a great addition as it's iconic and it gets you up high over the entire city with 360 degree views. While it's good, it's not great.It could be great if it offered a few more things to make it a more meaningful experience.At the start, you're confronted by long queues everywhere you look. We were lucky to wait less than 10 minutes to board in a long but fast-moving queue. During this time, someone could be giving us a short overview of what to expect so that we'd feel more excited about it. Instead, we had no idea and were just herded along onto the constantly-moving large, glass capsules.Once in, everyone crams the windows to stake out their spot for the best views. It turns out, this isn't necessary as there's time for everyone to walk around the entire area and see all the views.While rotating slowly, it would be much better to have an interesting and informative commentary about London and some of its famous landmarks. There's nothing to listen to. I didn't learn a thing. I want to learn something. Ugghh!  What a missed PR opportunity to promote this great city to millions of people each year. Have a famous Londoner narrating an edgy 15 minute audio underlaid with some fabulous UK rock music like Queen. And the narrator? No, NOT Boris. At the end, it's an anti-climax. Nothing is said, nothing is given, nothing is acknowledged and nothing is available except a boring shop. Provide each person with a momento of the experience. It could be as small as a London Eye badge with some catchy phrase that people could wear - further promoting the attraction and it's overall branding. Tip - make sure you book beforehand so that you go straight to the fast lane of the queue."
"Written August 26, 2014","""Fun and Great day""","""I had booked and paid for the tickets online and they were very easy to collect on both locations. The london Eye queue was horrendous even though fairly moving. The view is amazing but it isn't something personally I would do again."
"Written August 26, 2014","Night time, on a clear night.","As title, if you are going to do this, hope to be as lucky as we were weather-wise.There are not many more words to describe what this attraction obviously offers.Queue looks bad but it does not take long to filter down.Do it."
"Written May 13, 2014",Best view of London,Probably the best way to see London. Not much waiting time. Very good view of the city and tablets that explain whatever you see. Pick a day with clear weather. It is kind of expensive but if you bundle it with other sights it comes cheaper.
"Written May 1, 2014",Go for it..,"It is a must in London. On a weekend it will make you wait in queue for 2-3 hrs but at the top of London eye, it seems worth. it has a spectacular view of London from the top, we were able to take many nice photographs. The river cruise is fantastic experience, especially when you sit on top floor.Imp- It is a good idea to buy 360 degree guide beforehand.  The separate tickets for each is a bit expensive but it can be bought together which makes it worth your money. Also, there are two for one vouchers available with the train/metro tickets which makes it way cheaper."
"Written April 13, 2014",Great experience (provided everything goes your way),"The weather and cubicle companions can play a spoiler.. But if you are lucky, it can a spectacular ride. I would strongly recommend buying Fast track tickets online to get a 20% discount but most importantly avoid having to queue. It can be quite long during the summer tourist season"
"Written March 14, 2014",Amazing view,"Beautiful view over London! If you are visiting London, this gives you a perfect chance to see some great sights. We went in the evening - just when the sun was setting, and during that half-hour-ride it became dark. The city lights looked amazing from high up! A definite must, at least once when in London."

"Written February 11, 2014",What a view!,"I almost did not go on the London Eye, because i am afraid of heights...WHAT a SHAME it would have been to miss this! In my mind i was thinking it was like a big ferris wheel, and i feel terrified on ferris wheels. It is NOTHING like a ferris wheel! It is like being in a room, it does not sway back and forth and you are enclosed and I felt totally safe.We went at night and the lights and views were absolutely incredible! I enjoyed this so much!There are touch screens inside the pods to help identify what you are looking at and they are very easy to use. And there are places marked 'photo zones' where you can take pictures without distortion.  It was one of the best experiences! If you are afraid of heights, like me, don't be for this one! You will be fine and enjoy it!"
"Written January 13, 2014",Great,"If you go in London you must take a ride with this. We bought some tickets with more objectives to visit like Madame Tusauds Museum and also The London Eye. There was a lot of people, but the tail was moving fast, aprox 25 minutes. The view in London Eye is great, you see everything at 360 degrees, you also can see planes very close, it is a lovely view! I recommend!"
"Written November 26, 2013","Too tourist, but if you don't go you haven't visited London","This was my first trip to London and my fiancee's fourth time. When I said that I wanted to go to London Eye, she laugh at me. Then I bought the Fast Line Tickets thru Internet and when I got there, it took 1 minute to be inside. I chose to go just before the sunset, so I was able to get the city with the light on and the sun. I was lucky enough to have the skies clear and was able to see the full moon. Needless to say how amazing was the 30 minutes inside."
"Written November 25, 2013",A landmark,"getting up in the London eye is one of these things that you kind of have to do when in London. The view is spectacular. I went when it was dark, which gives a beautiful outline of the city lights and I went during the day where you can see other landmarks and relate to them. It is a bit pricy and there is occasionally a queue, so be prepared. Some of the tourist vouchers offer discounts so read the details well. Nearest station is waterloo but you can also go to Westminster and cross the bridge. Food around that area is expensive and not that good, so if you have kids, feed them before you go. There are many other nice things to see and do in that area, like Westminster abbey, the river boat tour, the aquarium and a nice new sitting area with a mini funfair for kids."
"Written November 3, 2013",Eagle Eye view of London,"The Flexi Fast Track ticket is the way to go if you are pressed for time and you are not certain exactly what time you will arrive at this attraction. My wife and I, after acquiring our tickets with a prepurchased voucher on line before leaving for London, had essentially NO waiting in line. We were ushered into the Flexi Fast Track lane with presentation of our tickets--then promptly walked up to the pod that became available as we approached the loading area.The glass of our pod was amazingly clean--free of smudges both inside and outside--making for fantastically clear photographs of all the classic London landmarks. Our pod was not crowded at all, allowing for freedom of movement to secure whatever vantage point we desired as we oohed and aaahed at one recognizable highlight after another. The ride was unexpectedly smooth with no vibrations appreciated which added to our enjoyment and to the enhancement of our photographs even when zoomed to the maximum.Everyone in our pod was smiling, obviously  enjoying the views. There was even a nice detailed guide directory within the pod that specifically identified all the important buildings and London tourist sites. This was greatly appreciated since we were not familiar with London, coming from Texas.Certainly schedule time for the London Eye, whether you have just a day or a week to visit London. It is clearly evident why this is now the premier tourist attraction in London. Strongly consider the Flexi Fast Track ticket to eliminate queue time in your planning--you will not regret this minor extra expense as you walk to the front of the line!"
"Written September 26, 2013",Worth it,"Its pricey compared to other wheels around the globe but the view is amazing.If you can spare the big bucks, try it both in the afternoon and then afterdark!"
"Written August 20, 2013",Excellent,Booked for a Friday in August was pleasantly surprised the que was only about 2 mins and what an experience you can see for miles it was fantastic well worth going too. Would not recommend buying fast track tickets as normal line was moving so fast we were as fast as fast track. Kids loved it they saw all the familiar sights from a great vantage point. Very good and the staff were really friendly and couldn't have done more.
"Written July 25, 2013",A miserable experience,"Sadly tourists will always flock to a unique attraction such as the London Eye and Merlin Entertainments (owners) know this so have no concerns about treating customers like dirt. Our ticket purchased on-line weeks in advance was for 4pm. Advice on the ticket was to arrive 45 minutes early which we did, to a very long queue which we were NOT ALLOWED to join but told to return after 3:30. We queued in about 30C some of the time in direct sun before getting onto the eye at 5:10pm. Throughout this period they continued to sell ""Fast Track"" tickets knowing they were at least an hour behind schedule on ticket times. Fast track ticket holders continuously jumped the queue. The time on your ticket means nothing more than an indication of the time you are allowed to join the queue. It's a disgraceful and unjust way to operate an attraction but of course it maximises profit. Operating at capacity I estimate they take over £600,000 a day from people who will probably never return - not a service that needs to take any care with customers. Once on the eye the rotation time is about 15 minutes, not 30 minutes as advertised and it's OK if you're easily excited. My advice - don't bother. If you really really must then get a fast track ticket and brace yourself for disappointment."
"Written July 18, 2013","Not A Terrible Attraction, Terrible Organisatio","There were 6 of us.  I booked online (Standard - timed tickets - £100)  collected tickets from machine at the attraction.  Then went to queue at least 35 minutes before scheduled time, massive queue in 90 degrees heat.  There was some attempt to entertain for a while, and it was appreciated.  We eventually got on board 40 minutes after our booking time.  Although this might be an attraction worth visiting if you haven't done it before, the whole experience is an embarrassment for London and the nation."
"Written July 4, 2013",Lovely Views,"While at the Aquarium, we took a detour to the London eye.  It takes roughly 20 - 25 mins from when you enter to exit.  You will see all the wonderful buildings of London and the views are breath taking.  The pods weren't crowded and are very spacious.  Worth the trip and absolutely recommend."
"Written May 27, 2013",Good views but awful commentary,"Despite mediocre weather, the cruise offered a good look at London from the river.  The antics of the other passengers were dreadful - mostly European tourists who constantly jumped up and prevented those sitting down from seeing anything.  The management did nothing to stop them.But the worst part of the cruise was the commentary.  It was loud, boorish, uninformed and often absolutely factually incorrect.   They would do better to offer commentary by headphones for those who want it and allow the rest of the passengers to remain in peace and quiet.The obnoxious commentary would prevent me from taking this cruise again, especially as there are others to choose from."
"Written April 18, 2013","Opted for the fast pass - stress free, relaxing ride.","My visit at the London Eye was a pleasant one. We got there around midday - went on the underground from Euston, getting off more or less right next to the London Eye. Me and my girlfriend decided to pay a little more for the fast pass - an option well worth considering as the queues can be stupidly long.The toilet facilities were pretty none existent but the ride itself was very relaxing. You don't even realise you're moving.. In all we must have waited 25 minutes, to buy the fast pass and get on the London Eye. A must if you're visiting London."
"Written March 11, 2013",Worth the $,It is pricey. But what a pleasant way to take in the city. Also this is kid friendly and something you can do in any weather. 
"Written February 25, 2013",Skip the Line!!,"Hi, I booked the London Eye 4D experience via GetYourGuide.com.  I paid less than I would have paid there and the skip the line feature is really worth the money.  I got there, it was a little rainy and the skip the line worked great, twice.  First to convert the printed voucher from the internet into the tickets itself -  special counter, no line and second to get aboard the London Eye.  The tour is a slow spin all around, with spectacular view of the city from above.  This is well worth the time and money, and everyone visiting London should do it.  Again, purchasing via getyourgude.com was cheaper that the prince in London!"
"Written January 23, 2013",A Must-do,"You need some patience to wait in line and I also thing it's a bit expensive, but it's a great view and a really must-do when you visit London. You won't regret."
"Written April 30, 2012",Great view of London!,"This attraction is located near Big Ben.We did the 3D London Eye show as well (it was included in the price of our ticket). The 3D experience of the London Eye was a nice little show of London (very cute)! It's not necessary in my opinion but a nice little addition.We got on the London Eye and the entire thing takes maybe a little less than 30 minutes.You have plenty of oppportunities for pictures and I liked that you could read about what you were seeing.You actually don't need to buy the map they sell you when you're getting your ticket because once you get on the london eye, they have a ""virtual"" map that you can play with showing you exactly the same thing!"
"Written April 30, 2012","Miserable, disorganized, over priced and insanely crowded","Simple rule. If you have heard of the tourist attraction in London, then don't go. We literally had to put our heads down and shove like we were trying to get onto a Japanese commuter rail just to walk the sidewalk on the way to the London Eye. On a Sunday afternoon (5:00pm). In the pouring rain. After I had already bought tickets online to avoid waiting...Then we waited in a 1/2 line (which was required to learn which line you were actually supposed to wait in). Then we were directed to the real line  - which was then 1 hour long. In the rain. Surrounded by thousands of other tourists - all pushing for their place in the endless lines. In the end, We left, with paid tickets in hand and ran for our life. If you must go - go as early as possible and prepare the push, shove and work your way into endless crowds. As this was April, I can only imagine what sort of living nightmare awaits summer visitors during the Olympics."
"Written March 10, 2012",Great views of London,"I visited the London Eye during the half term week. We arrived early at 9.30am as the ticket office opposite the eye opens for tickets and wanted to avoid queues. We went straight  into the 4d experience which is a short film of the Eye and London. When we came out we boarded the eye 10 mins before the 10am start time, so was very impressed by the flow of things. Wasn't sure how I would feel about it as I'm afraid of heights but I was surprised how it didn't bother me. The capsule moves very slowly which made it feel like it wasn't moving and the views were great to see. I had special Tesco clubcard vouchers so the price didn't really come into play for me but if I had to have paid I would have as its not something I would probably do again and theres always a cost to these attractions in major cities. Glad I had the experience a must do when in London. There is also a mcdonalds restaurant a short walk past the county hall along the river which we found handy."
"Written December 26, 2011",Shatteringly expensive. A Total rip-off.,"Take my advice. Walk away from the London Eye, its hour-long lines and horrifying prices. Instead, enjoy a delightful 20-minute stroll east along the river bank taking in its history, shops and attractions and stop at the OXO tower. Take a lift to the 8th floor and you'll get most of the London Eye's views for nothing. You've saved nearly 40 QUID a head already!!!! and can spend it having a drink in one of the best cocktail bars in London."
"Written October 12, 2011",Wonderful views,I am really happy that my boyfriend and I forked over money to do this attraction. Being surrounded by so many tall buildings in London I wanted a sense of a birds eye view of London and this is the way to do it! The ride lasts 25 minutes and its a great way to get beautiful pictures of the city and to just sit and relax and enjoy the ride. Make sure you are not afraid of heights!
"Written October 10, 2011",London eye,"The eye is an expensive attraction and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of discounts.  You can buy your ticket discounted  when you buy other attractions at several places such as at the london eye, london dungeon.  I recommend buying your ticket at the dungeon because they don't have much lines and it will prevent you from having to stand in line at the eye which can be long.  You first take a picture then go into the 4d show which is like 10min long and amazing you will get alittle wet.  When you get out of the 4d show u get ushered out where you can buy pictures.  Little do you know that they are going to take your picture on the london eye which is much cooler.  So we ended up buying both because we didn't know we would get our picture taken on the eye itself so it is alittle over kill.  The eye tour is about 30min on the eye. I think it was pretty cool.  When you get off the attraction you can buy only the pictures taken on the eye and buy trinkets.  Once you leave the gift shop there is alot of food places to choose from and the aquarium."
"Written August 16, 2011",Worth the queue and the best!,"No way around it! If the weather is fine there will be a queue, and if raining, you will get wet! There is a premium fast track which gives you a special ""cage"". Its about an extra 20% when I was there, however, its for adults only there are no discount tickets and it seems children ( of any age up to 16) are not welcome.Anyway half the fun is to be thrown together with a group of tourists and locals from anywhere and look at the sights of London. Don't buy combined tickets with other attractions. Having a ticket does not mean not having to queue to get in so assess this at the time and in person at the attraction. Having queued once with children, they might not appreciate it a second time! I have been on this ride twice. There are many copies all over the world  ( I have been on several). This is the best, not only the better organised but that London has so many sights to see from such a vantage point."
"Written July 12, 2011",Needs queue management,"Arrived in the morning with tesco vouchers to exchange and queued for ages in something resembling a rugby scrum. Eventually realised that the eye had closed (was still revolving but not loading new people) and people were queuing for refunds.  A simple tannoy announcement would have helped but there was nothing.  One disgruntled customer came in and started screaming violently and swearing hysterically. OK, he was the culprit but it was a result of frustration and there were no security people to usher him away while my daughter was cowering behind me in fear listening to his foul mouthed anguish.  We eventually managed to speak to an official who gave us a leaflet with a freephone number so we were able to call later to find it had reopened. This time there was no queue for tickets and were told the line for the eye was 30 minutes. GREAT!  Half an hour in the queue and we had barely budged, one hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours then finally  after 2.5 hours we boarded tired, hungry, hot, with a grumpy child and my plantar fasciitis absolutely killing my feet.The 30 minute ride was great but the Eye people should really get their act together about managing the queues and disseminating accurate information."
"Written June 18, 2011",Good experience - pick a sunny day to visit!,Really feels  very high up once you are inside but try to go when the weather is fine otherwise you wont see that far. The queues are managed well and move along really quick and you can get a little map to help you identify all the buildings. Each capsule can hold upto 28 adults but there were only 12 or so in each when we went so it was possible to walk about / sit down etc easily. It doenst make a noise or wobble at all so even though I hate heights I felt quite secure!
"Written June 18, 2011",Great 360-degree views,We went on a sunny clear day and the slow rotation of the Eye gave us plenty of time to enjoy the magnificent views and take photos. This is well worth doing in good weather.
"Written May 3, 2010",London Eye - Well worth it!,"I am a bit scared of heights, but the London Eye is a very gentle 'ferris wheel' where you can see all of London.  We took numerous photos at each 'stop.'  So enjoyable.But, even better than the view is the Champagne Flight.  I highly recommend pre-purchasing tickets via VisitBritain.com.  In addition to already having the tickets and thus, avoiding the wait, you can make your purchase in American dollars.  With our vouchers in hand, we were whisked on to the attraction within minutes, while we saw some many people lined up to go on.  Plus, there are a lot less people in your individual 'pod.'  And, if you like champagne, it's a delight.  The guy that served us was very nice and offered to tell us anything about the sights.  We also received a booklet for free outlining the various attractions (I can't remember the cost, but it was extra for the others.)I heard that the Eye was going to be dismantled last year and perhaps only kept for the 2012 Olympics.  I think that would be a shame!  In the 10 years that it's been in London, I believe it has become a great fixture to the town.  Highly recommend going and also having the champagne!"
"Written April 26, 2010",Brilliant!,"The title says it all ...The new 4D experience (included in ticket price) was fantastic ... it had the adults amazed as much as the kids.  Excellent use of 3D cinematography with a little extra to make it seem all the more real (won't say here as don't want to spoil it for you).  The ride on the Eye was on a clear day and thirty minutes was just about the right amount of time to take it all in.  Had three nine year olds and a hyper six year old with me and none of them got bored.This is a London must do and if you follow the advice on the London Eye website and turn up and check in 45minutes before your ""flight"" it runs like clockwork and stress free despite the site being a pretty busy place.  I'm not sure I'd bother with the extra expense of a fast track ticket ... we just had a standard flexi and we didn't queue for very long at all.  We visited on a normal Sunday in mid April."
"Written March 2, 2010",London Eye? What a pain!,"The London Eye was a big let down. Not by the eye itself, the views were stunning asw was the 4D film beforehand.  The biggest let down was the queue's that seem to go no where. We purchased tickets from the original tour co. and we still had to queue in the (ahem ,say this quite sincerely) fast track ticket desk. The staff didn't know how to cope with the different methods of pre booking tickets and the fast track become the terracotta tourists exhibit on the Thames. I would recommend London, i wouldn't recommend the London EYE. All they have done is taken a big wheel and thought of the most difficult way to get passengers on."

"Written January 16, 2010",Great overview of London,The view from the top of the London Eye is amazing. To maximize the experience you should go when the weather is clear and bring along binoculars to get the most out of the experience.
"Written January 11, 2010",You must do this!,"Excellent attraction. Wonderful views. Never realised how big London is until you see it from so high up. We went at 4pm so we saw the city at sunset then as the lights were coming on, beautiful. The pods are comfortable and you don't feel like you are moving. I hate heights but was fine on this. The only complaint is that the ticket office is a bit of a shambles with queues everywhere, and the same for waiting to get on the eye. I would advise paying the extra for fast track, especially if you are only there for a couple days. Well worth it."

But Now under the new management (Merlin Entertainments Group) the ride time is shortened to less then 20 mins. This is very funny because the ticket prices has gone up, before it was about 12 pounds and now it over 14 pounds.  No value for money.!!!!"
"Written July 14, 2009",Great views,"I thought the ride offered great views of London, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We were there in October 2008 and we went in the evening so we could see the night lights of London. What a great time! We took beautiful photos from the Eye, our pod had maybe 6 people in it total, and it was warm even though the air outside was frigid."
"Written December 3, 2008",OK,"As everyone says - the queues are LONG! I was a little disappointed, not sure why really, as I'm not sure I could have expected more than what we got. We went on a clear day in summer and the views were good but I'm not sure it's worth what they charge for it. There are more interesting ways to spend your time in London."
"Written September 7, 2008",London Eye,"I recently combined a trip to the London Eye and the London Aquarium and can certainly recommend it.You will get a great view of the Houses of Parliament, Westminster, the river and the surrounding area.The ride is very smooth and we had a pod to ourselves and so were able to walk around are really take in the sites.My main recommendation is to follow the weather. If you are in London for a couple of days then it is worth trying to get a clear day. Early morning would work best as you then have time to see the sites in the surrounding area."
"Written April 23, 2011",A wonderful experience,"A ""must do"" in London. The view is fantastic, the capsules are large and you get a panoramic view of best of London's best known landmarks in one turn of the wheel. Remember, nothing is cheap in Europe, no matter where you go."
"Written April 14, 2011",A must do if visiting London,"My daughter wanted to see the Eye, so we got the tube to Westminster and when on the bridge, decided to go and see if we could get a ride there and then (as we had not booket any tickets).The time was 6 pm on a Saturday and we couldn't believe how easy and quick it was to buy the tickets, watch the 3D video show (part of the experiance) and take a trip on the eye.  From buying the ticket to getting on the pod it was no more than 35 minutes.We are so glad we took the 'Flight' and found the views truly stunning.  The pod was not packed and there is plenty of room to take photographs.The Eye is good value for money and the only down side for us was that you cannot choose the other passengers (one or two were a little rowdy)."

We tried first on Friday evening but the queues to both tickets and then the eye were long. For Monday we bought the tickets in advance at a kiosk and were able to just walk in. Again, as almost always in London, the staff were great."

Our pod was pretty packed, had to squeeze in to get a view out of the window. Got very hot as you got to the top (and that was on a spring day- can imagine how hot it gets on a summers day!) Luckily there is air conditioning on the sides. Brilliant views of London and you can get a photo done at the end. Takes about half an hour to get around, really enjoyed it, will be going again as i forgot to take my camera this time!"

"Written March 1, 2011","Pick your weather, companions and times of day.",I think we were very lucky. Our daytime trip was on a colourful bright morning where everything looked clear and close and the views were absolutely spectacular. Better I think than those from the Empire State Building. The speed is just right. Make sure if you possibly can that the other passengers are tolerable and considerate. Frustrated disinterested kids or sullen miserable adults do not enhance the experience. We went back a year later in the dark evening which was amazing. Weather and visibility are everything.
"Written February 27, 2011",Impressed with the service,Booked the eye on line for a visit with my parents for a special weekend. Ok so it was rainy so the views could have been better but hey ho we live in the UK so used to that.What has prompted me to write the review is the exceptional customer service we received from the eye staff. I had booked the tickets for a set time - picked them up and we were due on at 11. There was quite a long queue which we were ok with but when the staff saw my dad with his stick (not officially disabled but 80 with knee problem) they pulled us out of the queue and walked us slowly and kindly to the front then stopped the eye so dad could take his time getting in. Great experience seeing everything on the pod (once in lifetime for my folks) and then when we got off they stopped it again to give him time to get off.Lovely people who didn't need any official stuff to understand that someone needed a little more time to enjoy the experienceThank you eye staff you made all of our days
"Written July 21, 2010",Be CAREFUL of cash transactions in gift shop,"My husband and I visited the London eye on Monday June 7th.We really enjoyed the experience.Afterwards  I bought souvenir gifts for our 4 children.I paid cash.The tall male on the till had an American accent and was very loud and distracting,shaking one item 3 times to 'check' that it wasn't broken and speaking in a very loud voice to no one in particular.I had to request a receipt following the transaction.I realised when leaving the shop and counting my change that  he had overcharged me.When I checked  my receipt I got a shock to see that only ONE item was on my receipt.I had purchased and paid for 7 items and extra.Unfortunately I couldn't re-enter the shop because now I had 6 items with no proof of purchase and technically could be called a shop lifter.So my advice to you all is REQUEST a receipt BEFORE you hand over your cash."

Also, 4 years ago the cost was only around £8.00 as the London Eye was owned by BA.Imagine my shock yesterday to find that the cost was £17 per person (what inflationary measure had they used there?!!!) and the attraction had been taken over by Merlin Entertainments (the UK's answer to Disney and all that corporate rip-off).  Also, although I am on benefits that give me discounts at all galleries, concerts and most attractions, there were no discounts available at all.  I also felt that the Eye itself is looking a little tired.  One pod had a free-standing air conditioning unit in it.  One pod went around empty for some reason and one pod was missing altogether.  For the cost now charged - everything should be in tip-top condition.  Even the staff seeing us on were of poorer quality then then used to be!The only good thing is that we purposely chose a quieter time of week and day than most people so we didn't wait long and the queue moved fast.  We also didn't waste time on stupid 4D movies.  If the queue had been long we wouldn't have bothered.The pod was full and, whereas on my previous flights people walked around the pod to see different sights, when you are on the flight with tourists (sorry tourists!) they don't think there are any interesting buildings on the south bank of the river!!!  So they take up residence in the best position overlooking the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace and stay there the whole time - not letting anyone else in.I wouldn't recommend pre-booking either as it would be a very poor experience to have booked tickets then find that the weather is grey and wet and the visibility poor. In conclusion, if you MUST go on the London Eye and have decided that views from St. Paul's / the walkway above Tower Bridge / Monument /  or out on Hampstead Heath / Greenwich / Shooters Hill / Alexander Palace just won't do - please think outside the box and go in the evening and in good weather."
"Written June 11, 2010",Waste of money,"My 8 year old wanted to be on it as it looked so giant and fun etc.etc.... But what a waste of money. First of all it is way expensive for the ride. Spending all that money for a family of four just to be on it for a short time was a total waste of time and money. See it from a distance and spend your money else where. Long lines for waiting, they wouldn't let one member stay in line for all and them let the others join later."
"Written December 12, 2006",Good Weather Only,"I hopped on the Eye last month. Great views from above! It was sunny at first but then the heavy rain poured down and blocked the view for the rest of my ride. Go on the Eye in good weather only! Also, I'd recommend to buy tickets online as crowds could get out of control."
"Written October 25, 2006",Probably the best thing to do in London.,"I've been on the Eye a couple of times now - during the day and at night - and it has to be one of the ""must do"" things if you're visiting London. The views of the city are stunning and with it taking approximately half an hour to go right around, you have time to see everything. Having said that, by the time you have to get off you just wish you could around one more time!If you go in the daytime, I would say to be prepared for some queueing (not much fun, although I've heard that if you pay extra you can get a fast-track ticket). However, on my last visit we got there at 7.55pm (literally 5 mins before closing time) and there were only a handful of people, which meant that we not only didn't have to queue, but also that there were only a few of us in the capsule, enabling us to walk around inside it and get to see the full 360 degrees. The view at night was spectacular too.I can recommend this attraction to anyone - it's great for kids, older people and it's also a romantic thing to do with someone special. Well worth the money!"
"Written September 16, 2006",great photo opportunity!,"the waiting in lines is mighty tedious, and the ride is a bit expensive. But the for great photo memories to share, it is a must see!"
"Written January 25, 2006",Brilliant experience,"Excellent experience, whether you travel day or evening, but best to avoid if it's raining!"
"Written January 10, 2006",Loved it!,This was definitely worth doing. The view was great and you can get some wonderful pictures.
"Written October 20, 2004",Really OUTSTANDING,The London Eye experience was really fascinating.  I think it is the perfect programme for a sunny afternoon.
"Written September 11, 2003",Well worth it,"I thought the London Eye was absolutely excellent and well worth the money it costs to get on it. whilst on the Eye, you feel very safe, particularly since each pod is bomb-checked between each party that rides in it. The only thing that was slightly annoying was the dripping water which splattered us form time to time, and it can get pretty hot (obviously!) in those pods. Overall, a must if you are visiting London; you'll regret it if you don't!"
"Written October 2, 2023",Eyes for a Beautiful View!,Grand view and mesmerising to see the venue and the surroundings!! On a clear day you can get some fabulous pictures and rides !
"Written August 23, 2023",Great views,It was good but not great. Quite a few people in the pod so couldn't see all of the views. Nicely air-conditioned though. Views were lovely though 
"Written October 4, 2022",Good Deal if bought as a combo,"The attraction is overpriced if you buy just a standard ticket.The best value for money is if you buy a combo ticket that gives you Madame Tussaud, Sealife, London Eye and Cruise for 68 pounds (from the londoneye website). At the time of writing this, the 4D experience at London eye was discontinued, so that was a dampener.Go to the website, and buy a combo for Madame Tussaud, Sealife and London Eye that costs 60 pounds. During checkout it will give you an option to add a cruise for 8 pounds. These four are perfect for a full-day family outing with kids. Do Madame Tussauds in the morning (10am), followed by stopover at Buckingham Palace (optional), then go on to the London eye pier and grab a nice fish & chips lunch. Follow that up with Sea life, London Eye and finally the cruise (they are all adjacent to each other).You will be able to fin all this by around 5.30pm. Relax at the riverback with a nice icecream cone and watch the sun set. A busy but relaxed itinerary that will be fun for the kids as well. If you are still feeling energetic, you could try squeeze out a visit to Trafalgar square in the evening by bus, and visit the National gallery for some cool paintings."
"Written May 30, 2021",Not covid safe,"Not covid safe, regretted pre-booking tickets.  Two parallel queues (fast track and standard) which are shoulder to shoulder and not following 2m rule.  Majority of guests did not wear masks, and were not questioned until boarding.  Guests also took masks off once onboard.  The staff clean the middle seats but not the handrails which people touch around the pod."
"Written December 18, 2020",The London Eye is so beautiful,"❣️ One of the important and beautiful landmarks is located beside the river, and I advise everyone to ride and watch London from the height"
"Written December 15, 2020",Not fast track,"So I paid the extra for the fast track when we got there was about 20 people in front, the lady said fast track go in the other way (excellent) only to be stopped at the top of the stairs and had to wait till everyone in the normal cue had been searched my the slowest security in the world so I won’t be paying extra againOn the ride it self the views are amazing even with it being a wet December morning "
"Written December 15, 2020",Chloe,My husband and I enjoyed an afternoon cruise along the river.Chloe our host was a cheerful lady who gave us a fantastic insight into some of the landmarks along the way.We learnt so much from her well presented guide with lots of laughs along the way.She is a credit to your company.
"Written December 14, 2020",Family day out ,The night view is the best especially during Christmas. COVID précautions taken very seriously! Kids loved it... the adults equally loved it too. 
"Written November 18, 2020",London Eye: Do It just to do it,The London Eye was fun. Don’t expect much from it besides long lines and a simple ride in a Farris wheel. The history lesson and views from the top are amazing! Worth doing just to say you did it.

"Written November 14, 2020",Great View. Slow moving,Great view. 30 minutes of slow moving torture. I am scared of heights. Good  thing they had a place to sit down.
"Written November 6, 2020",First date,"Went on a first date.Lovely experience.Was supposed to be sharing but the family after us refused to join our ride so we had it all to ourselves, maybe due to covid.Our temperatures were taken and hand sanitizer available.It's only one revolution but you do get great views of London. You are fully enclosed so sheltered from the elements which was raining most of the day.Would recommend if visiting London but pricey for what it is."
"Written October 31, 2020",Experience ,Good for an experience. A nice 30 minute trip to take in the sites of London. Good social distancing followed. 
"Written October 26, 2020",Fantastic,"Booked a last minute trip to london. Was travelling with my husband and 3 children (14,8 and 4) We all loved the river cruise. Mick was a brilliant guide and made us all laugh lots (even the teenager!) He even sung happy birthday to our 4 year old.London eye was also fantastic. As we are a family of 5 and no queues we had a pod to ourselves. The kids all thought this was amazing and was fantastic to be able to move around and not worry about social distancing! A big thank you for the memories we made!"
"Written October 26, 2020",London Eye,Many photos like Big Ben and River Tames. Would be good on a sunny day as it was raining when I did London Eye. Would like to do again.
"Written October 26, 2020",Excellent Landmark ,Must visit for breath taking views of London.The CocaColas London eye requires pre booking and the queues were still long.But a must visit place.
"Written October 25, 2020",Beautiful view ,"I love the London Eye and all the places around! Have a nice walk in the Queens Walk, see the gardens, enjoy a nice ice cream and ride the London Eye is a perfect plan for a nice day! "
"Written October 25, 2020",Great trip to the London Eye,Great visit to the London Eye prebooked our tickets the night before (Merlin Annual Passholder) the social distancing markers were down on the floors and each pod was cleaned every now and then (with one cleaned going round by its own empty) they was doing the rule of six to each capsule which also meant it wasn't busy as before (In a kind of way was very nice) managed to get some decent snaps of the London eye.

"Written October 23, 2020",Mr & Mrs Rothwell ,Aj was a perfect host during our champagne eye experience .we would recommend this as a fantastic way to view London skyline 
"Written October 20, 2020",Wonderful Wonderful Day,This was a good experience that turned into the most fantastic experience when at the very very top of the eye i asked my partner would she marry me and she said yes!!.She was so shocked and so was everyone in the capsule as well.

"Written October 31, 2020",Expensive but worth it,"Visited with my husband, 6 year old and 3 month old.  Booked tickets whilst there and only had to queue for 5 minutes.  We had our own pod and had a brill time.  Lasts about 30-40 mins so not too long and whilst it’s not something I’d do every time we’re in London it’s definitely an experience I’d recommend doing at least once."
"Written October 30, 2020",A-star for Almiro,"We did the champagne experience with Almiro as our host, the whole experience was worth every penny and Almiro was brilliant couldn't have asked for a nicer bloke. He knew everything about the landmarks when asked and is a credit to the London Eye.From his Manchester mates 😎🤘🐝"
"Written October 30, 2020",Insightful and fun tour.,"Done the tour during the half term break. Safely boarded and all temperatures taken. Must say it is a great tour made even better by our host, Scottish boy called Liam, he had a fantastic sense of humour and gave great history and his own take and recommendations on the sights. Highly recommend and 5 stars for the tour guide himself."
"Written October 30, 2020",Good experience ,The kids have been wanting to do this for a while and they loved it! Good views even though it was raining - got to see everything! Not sure on the tier 2 rules - as we were with another family in our pod?  Would recommend but quite pricy and you can see just as much in the walkie talkie tower which is free or the shard which you could combine dinner!

"Written October 27, 2020",Heights,My partner and I going all the way to the top he was so worried as he dont like heights was such a nice time will be bringing my little one with us next year
"Written October 27, 2020",As good as its looks...,The London Eye offers a fantastic view across the massive city fo London. Point to note - the queues were almost non-existent primarily down to the current covid situation. 
"Written October 26, 2020",Not worth it,I wouldn't really recommend this because i really didnt think it was worth it for that much money.I feel like other places are better than just a view.
"Written October 26, 2020",Highly recommended,"It was difficult to decide which of the Thames boat tour companies to choose, but I'm so glad we booked the London Eye river cruise on a joint ticket with the London Eye.  Jack gave an excellent witty commentary which even kept my young teenage granddaughters interested. One commented ""He made you want to listen. He wasn't boring"" which is the highest compliment from a teenager. Highly recommended"
"Written October 26, 2020",Beautiful sight,The sight of the ferris wheel both on and off are a treat. I love the great view of the city especially at night! I imagine it could also be very romantic. 
"Written July 27, 2022",Pre-booking time slot is an absolute joke!!!,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!You need to make it obvious on your booking sites that when you book your time... this is the time you can actually join the already ridiculously long queue and is NOT the time you actually access the attraction!! Our tickets were for 2.30 and we got there in plenty of time to join the queue so we could get on the London Eye at our allotted time. However we were kicked out of the queue twice and not allowed to join the queue itself until exactly 2.30pm.Very very disorganised and staff attitudes are shocking. Not what you expect from such a highly priced event.Event organisers don’t understand the knock on effect the time slot problem has on other planned activities/travel etc. The time we eventually got on the London Eye was an hour and half from the time slot booked so what is the point in pre-booking I just don’t get it.The pre-booking time slot is an absolute joke and false advertising that you need to rectify or you will continue to have some very angry customers!!Sort it!
"Written July 26, 2022",Total caos.,"It’s my second time in London Eye. I should say that was disapointed the way It’s organizated the entrance to the wheel. There were caos every were! A long line to get to the next “control Point”, but we wasn ‘t check anywere. No body ask our tickets, a girl tryed to send us to make the long first line again. In the middle of the caos of the line, my wife luckily got a ticket with a pink mark, if that hasn’t happened we would had to do the line again.There were people of the staf shouting everywere but they were unable to control the situation.It Was very unpleasant experiencie.Of course the “fligth” is an amazing way to get a view of the city, but they need que get improve in the way they organize the entrance."
"Written July 26, 2022",Oh the queues!,"We foolishly pre-booked tickets. As we were running ahead of schedule we arrived early but were told we could not join the queue until after our booked time, so we had to hang around for 40 minutes before we could even join the queue. There we maybe  50 people in a similar situation, so then a queue to join the queue formed. The staff got stressy and were shouting at people. Terrible system. It would probably have been better to just turn up and get a ticket. While gullible foreign tourists were waiting to join the queue they became prey for some unscrupulous types handing out flowers and balloons to children, then demanding money and then telling people ""that's not enough"" and asking for more money. The actual ride itself was fun but spoilt by the rest of the experience."
"Written July 26, 2022",Disappointed,"We had to wait over an hour even though we had a 2.15 booking, and was not allowed to join the queue early to allow us to be on the wheel for 2.15, making me late for a dinner reservation I had, the wheel also broke down leaving us stuck on it for 10/15 minutes. I was very disappointed in y experience"
"Written June 28, 2022",#jordanisthebest,Jordan was absolutely wonderful! Descriptions and jokes were brilliant. We thorough enjoyed our experience.
"Written June 7, 2022",Very good views of the city,"I am afraid of heights and was not sure I could do this but my son, daughter-in-law and niece were with me so I got on.  It was not scary at all it moves very slowly so you can see all of London."
"Written May 5, 2022",Beautiful sights.,"All of it! It moves very slow and gives you plenty of time to see everything and take pictures. The views are simply amazing. No jerking, very smooth ride. Will do again when I go back."
"Written February 19, 2022",Good time spent and great guide (Jordan),"Very informative and fun cruise that was suitably timed at around 40 minutes.  The guide Jordan was excellent and very funny.  As always, sightseeing can be affected by the weather and it was a awfully dull dayOnly reason for a 4 rating is that the form cancelled our cruise 24 hrs prior then miraculously it was back on (having to rebook after being refunded) - but of an itinerary inconvenience."
"Written September 14, 2021",London Eye River Cruise,"Me and my sister has just been on the the London Eye River Cruise and it was lovely.Starting just underneath the Eye we pre-booked on line for the 11:45 am trip on a Saturday, Not to busy as well, There is a earlier trip at 10:45 , That is the first trip out.The route is from London Eye to Tower Bridge and back lasting 40 mins and you see all of the attractions along the way from the Houses of Parliament, The Shard, HMS Belfast and many others and we went under many London bridges. We both sat on the open top deck and I let the breeze run through my bald spot ! The commentary  was nice , Sometimes it was hard to hear because of the breeze but very informative. Toilets are on board as well you can have a hot or cold drink. The staff were brill as well.."
"Written June 10, 2021",A must do.,If in London you can’t just walk past this amazing wheel. I have been both during the day and at night and would highly recommend doing both.The pods are cool and spacious. The 360 degree view of London is amazing. Takes about 40 mins to circulate. There are seats in the middle of the pods for the ones who are not keen on heights like myself. Price is a little high but you can join this with more attractions to bring the price down if you wish.
"Written May 23, 2008",Worth it!  Great views of London,"We enjoyed the London Eye today.   We almost didn't stop because the line looked a bit long... but decided to go for it.   This was on a Thursday around 6pm.We were in line no more than 7 mins.  The line moved quickly.  We didn't have the fast track/pass... just the regular tix that we bought on the spot.  We were with someone thats a bit ""hesitant"" of heights but they really enjoyed it... the ride is very very smooth and moves so slowly that you really don't feel the movements.  Great views of course and lovely in the late afternoon.  I'm sure evening would be great also.  I think at now in the Spring they close at 8pm... so I don't know if there is a true night-time viewing.Worth It!Enjoy."
"Written May 13, 2008",Do this at night for maximum effect,"We were lucky and did not have a long line to wait in. They are pretty heavy on security-especially with big bags, they do look inside them. It's great lit up and there is a great view from and on the  water. It was awesome to see Big ben and Houses of Parliment from above as well. You will share a pod with other people, so don't be surprised, everyone stands and can even walk around, but there  are benches for those who need seating. This is not recommended for those uncomfortable with heights-because you are encased in a clear pod, you can see all around you and that may be disconcerting for some. We saw all ages on board and everyone seemed to enjoy it. It is pricey though-but you can charge it :)"
"Written May 8, 2008",Waste of time and money,"I expected a guide, or even a recorded message to play during the 30 minute trip, maybe pointing out some things of interest or what not.I was mistaken. It's just you and a handful of strangers in a small pod for half an hour, in awkward silence.For the price I'm sure you could visit other more interesting tall buildings/cathedrals/etc. to get the same views. If you must go, the best time to do it would be on a regular weekday (non-holiday), and take the first 'trip' at 10am. We bought regular, non-fast track tickets online before going, and then showed up at the ticket office at 9:30am. We were the very first people to step into the pod that day, no waiting, and no need to pay for the fast-track."
"Written March 25, 2008",Interesting views,"What can I say...........it is a one of a kind experience and the views are spectacular.  The cost, not unlike everything in London, is very expensive, so get used to it quickly or it may ruin your holiday.  We saved a little by booking on-line which also saves you a ton of time picking up your tickets at the kiosk, just put in your card you paid for the tickets with and out they come.  The line-ups look enormous but at 30 people per car they move along very quickly.  Worth the money just in picture value alone.........bring a zoom lense."
"Written July 24, 2007",Tip for large parties,"I went on the London Eye as part of a hen weekend.  There were 15 of us, and we booked a private pod, which only worked out to be about £5 more per head.  The difference this made to the experience was huge.  We went to a seperate desk, waited a couple of minutes and were then escorted over to the eye where we bypassed all the queues and got on the next available pod.  If you are considering going on the Eye and you are a large party, it is definately worth doing this - it made all the difference.Having said that the queues did look like they moved quite fast, but if you have a lot of people and a schedule to stick to its definately the way to go!I can't comment on the actual booking procedure, because my friend actually booked it in person a couple of months before, but I'm sure the website will give you all the info."
"Written June 28, 2007",Breathtakingly Beautiful,"The London Eye is modern, spectacular, gargantuan and beautiful. The London Eye provides visitors with views across the world's most famous city and the views do not disappoint. One can see world famous landmarks, such as The Palace of Westminster, St. Paul's Cathedral, Buckingham Palace, the BT Tower, Canary Wharf, the list is endless. The Eye is a world-renowned landmark, it is an architectural masterpiece. The London eye is a beautiful, modern structure that symbolises a new, modern and successful London. It is undoubtedly a truly breathtaking creation."
"Written June 20, 2007",Something different,"I start by admitting I am not a great fan of London as such but do have friends who live here so I do go back every once in a while. Having ''done'' all the usual touristy things in previous years, we thought the London Eye would be a nice change. And it surely was ! We booked online (as recommended by our friends) which was a good move as we bypassed all the queues. We were lucky and had beautiful weather so it was a real treat to see London from above and even make out the new Wembley Stadium in the distance. After the tour we strolled around the much improved South Bank area and had a spot of lunch in one of the many restaurants with outside tables (which makes great people watching)Considering what most tourist attractions cost in Edinburgh, Scotland taking a ride on the London Eye was not that expensive and really, the views are worth it. The wheel actually moves very slowly - in fact you can't even feel it move (I am saying his because many people asked me who were too scared to go on it) but it really is very pleasant. The capsule is big enough to walk around or sit in the middle if you wish.Also, you get a superb view of the whole architecture as such while the Eye moves and it makes for some interesting pictures."
"Written June 9, 2007",A must for everyone,"As I live quite close to London it was a pleasant surprise when my daughter suggested that we took her little boy (my grandson) up to town one day. They were staying with us and she thought that a trip on the British Airways London Eye might be nice.We only waited for a few minutes for tickets and then a few more minutes to actually board the flight. The day was a bit dull but that meant you could take photographs without getting too many reflections. Upstream views included St Thomas' Hospital close by and views of the river bending away to the right towards Battersea. On a clear day you can see as far as Windsor Castle. But don't get carried away with distant views when almost directly in front of you is a wonderful view of the the Palace of Westminster. In part of this building are the houses of Lords and Commons and I swear you see the haze of hot air coming up from it!!Looking downstream (Right) the river quickly bends away to the right and affords nice views of the City of London, St Paul's and many bridges and churches. The view of the roof of Waterloo Station is stunning.Look to the north (rive end of the pod!) to see the post office tower. If you have a map with you you can pin point Horseguards Parade, St James Park, New Zealand house, the RAF Memorial on the opposite bank of the river and many more sights. As a senior citizen it cost me £11.00 to fly the wheel and I can't wait to go again."
"Written May 2, 2007",What an experience!,"The London Eye - half an hour of amazement!We queued from right at the back of the last 'boarding gate' at 12.30pm on a sunday, but it only took us half an hour to get into our 'capsule'.  I think this was a very busy time, because we saw very little queues on Sunday afternoon and all day Monday (we were only staying round the corner)It was very organised.  There were some cute souvenirs.  I'd recommend buying te 360 degree guide so you can pick out buildings when you are in the air.  We didn't buy it and didn't know what we were looking at apart from the obvious buildings!I don't THINK I'd do it again.  Then again, I haven't been on it at night time yet!Even though the capsules are air conditioned, it still got hot at the top, even in April!Enjoy!"
"Written April 15, 2007",The London Eye,"I was in London as part of a group, and was not overly thrilled that the London Eye was part of out attractions.  To my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!  The views were beautiful, and it was a nice peaceful break from the otherwise busy city.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The ""pods"" are large , clean, and provide 360 degree views of this wonderful city."
"Written October 16, 2020",Week away,Loved this ? I would recommend to anyone well worth the money especially if you book online and book other trips we saved £90 
"Written October 14, 2020",The big wheel,"We bought a fast track ticket, but that was a bit wasted as there was no queue. We went when it was rainy so the view wasn’t good. Avoid the wheel when raining."
"Written October 14, 2020",Honestly this review is all about Liam,"If I could put more than five stars I truly would. LIAM blew me off the boat and into the Thames and captivated me with his humour and dazzling eyes. His jokes and knowledge about London left me speechless and distracted me from the awful weather. Just like the London eye, he has become the apple of my eye. I'd take a ride with him anyday of the week. Despite the choppiness of the waves, he made the ride smooth. I finally feel like my life is sailing in the right direction. The cruise was decent too yeah. From Maya, Hayley, Shannon & Chloe xxxx😘💕"
"Written October 12, 2020",Our son loved it 💙 ,We booked London as a surprise trip for our 7 year olds birthday and the London Eye was top of his list. Have to say to have visited during this COVID period probably benefited us. We probably queued for 2 minutes tops. There was 4 in our party and we were in a capsule with 1 other couple so plenty room to roam around and opportunity for pictures. Felt safe seeing staff check and clean each capsule between users. The views of London were magnificent and our son said that he just loved being able to see everything. Having done it I don't think I would do it again - but was definitely worth the money.
"Written October 8, 2020",excellent ,it was great..a must if you are  visiting   London. amazing views across the City.first time visit but lot last..beautiful 
"Written October 8, 2020",Great attraction,"Waited 20 years to do this and i was not disappointed !! We had gorgeous weather and despite covid and the year 2020 we decided to go for it! We only had to queue for 20 -25 minutes as the process was quick. There was no social distancing as such, but after checking your tickets twice before boarding and having temperature scanned and security checked we finally made it on board :)As it was blue skies, we saw for miles and the trip was around 30 minutes. It was beautiful with full 360 degree views of London and beyond. If oyu suffer from Vertigo, do not look down.All in all a great experience that is off my bucket list :)"
"Written October 5, 2020",Was okay but not worth the money,"25 minute journey, with another family who refused to wear masks despite strict Covid 19 rules. Views are spectacular, but windows of the capsules are filthy that restrict you to get good clear photos. It was okay but would not rave about the experience."
"Written October 5, 2020",A worthwhile experience,"I’ve lived in London all my life and haven’t been on either one of these attractions, however took advantage of the surprisingly good autumn weather to visit both the London eye and river boat cruise solo. I now know why both attractions are so popular for tourist. They are definitely worth visiting and good value for money if you want a quick overview of London in a short space of time.The river cruise was the highlight for me, which was a duration of 45mins. I had an excellent guide (Shari...may have spelt that incorrectly) she was amazing, very friendly, humorous and knowledgeable. I loved hearing interesting things about a city I’ve grown up in, especially the history, the facts about the pop culture influences and inspiration. The London eye gave me beautiful panoramic views of London in a way I hadn’t seen it before, especially the iconic landmarks you see pictures and souvenirs. I had a standard ticket so my experience was shared with one other family. But because it’s pretty quiet you may get a whole capsule to yourself, which usually cost £500 as a VIP experience. So it’s definitely value for money during quieter periods. There are several opportunities to buy photos taken of you during the experience. However you are free to take your own pictures throughout on your personal devices. There’s seating and more than enough space to stand to suit your preference during the 30minute duration on the wheel. I did the river cruise then the wheel, which I preferred because it gave me more of a background to some of the popular sites you get to see on the wheel.I’d definitely recommend taking advantage of the combo sightseeing deals if you have the time as it is more value for money. However each experience can be bought separately."

"Written October 2, 2020",London eye,Good experience not much to see. Been there twice. Definitely recommend when it's dark. You don't see the dirty river when it's dark but you can see the lights reflection instead
"Written October 1, 2020",Great trip ,Nice to be out somewhere with social distances but needs to be very careful about the current situation 
"Written September 29, 2020",Excellent time,"We went today in the afternoon 17.15pm.Was so nice not to join a big line, went straight on and had our own booth.Great views and I recommend the photo book for £25"
"Written September 29, 2020",Very good,This was so much fun. We had great weather when we went but me and my 10 year old really enjoyed it. I would highly recommend. It was good to see a few sights at once and the guide AJ was full of energy. It broke up our day quite nicely and was thoroughly enjoyable.
"Written September 28, 2020",Excellent views,With all the current social distancing taking place it was great to only have one other couple in the pod. Could move around freely and most miss a view. 
"Written September 23, 2020",Good but a guide book or local info needed,"We loved this but I have to say not being from London, other than the obvious land marks like big Ben and the Palace I had no idea what else I was looking at.A little leaflet or place with info would be ideal to make the most of the experience.Other than that great 30/40 worth doing "

"Written September 20, 2020",Bit warm ,Some great views of London we had a hot hot day was starting to get uncomfortable in the pod with the heat I much say made us feel safe we had our own pod with sanitizer staff where helpful 
"Written September 19, 2020",Excellent views of London ,Booked the London Eye online. Due to Covid-19 we got a pod to ourselves which was excellent. Pods were cleaned regularly. Excellent views. Friendly staff. Well worth a visit.
"Written September 14, 2020",Disgraceful customer service,"Absolutely disgusted by my visit today. As regular visitors to London and after experiencing the London eye multiple times (due to us having a merlin annual pass) I have to say I have never been more appalled and embarrassed by their customer service today. There was one couple in front of us (already at the boarding gate) when we were told to wait for our turn. The operator allowed the couple onto their pod, we didn’t get invited forward until their pod door had closed. We were then invited onto our pod alongside a single rider, someone who wasn’t wearing their mask properly and who was constantly moving around whilst waiting. This made me anxious so my partner and I got out of the pod. The operators stopped the eye and asked why we got off, so we informed them of the situation and questioned why, if 6 people per pod is their policy, did the other couple Get their own and us (plus the other guy) weren’t sharing. The customer service from their colleague Yasmin was disgraceful. She was bordering on yelling at us and wouldn’t let my husband speak. She kept diverting the question of ‘why were we made to wait when we could have gone on as a 5 with the other couple?’ Her response was ‘well you can wait but I guarantee you won’t get your own pod like that couple’ so disrespectful as that wasn’t what we were asking. One rule for one and one for another. Then, their ‘duty manager’ tried to sort the situation, she again refused to answer the question and whilst speaking to my husband, told him to wait and began dealing with another complaint from a group of people. We gave up and walked away. Disgraceful."
"Written September 14, 2020",Enjoyable,"We really enjoyed this cruise, the tour guide was funny, friendly and informative. We got to see all of the sites around London and was given the history about the specific site."
"Written September 11, 2020",Delightful and very informative ,My family and I had a lovely cruise today at 1245. The tour guide (Jon?) was very amusing and informative and the tour was a lovely way to see lots of the sights of central London in an efficient and very civilised manner!I would highly recommend it!
"Written September 11, 2020",Personal pod,Due to COVID 19 there were no queues for the pods. We had pre booked anyway using our Merlin passes. We went straight on and had our own pod!
"Written September 11, 2020",First time visit,"This was our first time on the London Eye and with having series height issues I must admit it was truly amazing, so breathtaking were the views that I wanted to stay on and go round again. Can really recommend this as one of the best things to do in London. Can't wait to go on it again. Its such a cool thing to do. Thanks to all the staff also."
"Written September 10, 2020",Awesome experience!,"Absolutely awesome!! I have to be honest: I was scared stiff and had dreams of lying down on the seat with my eyes closed for the whole 30 minutes, the night before, but not necessary! It was scary stepping on and  off, and for those a little faint hearted, have someone to hand to help you and don't stand near the edge of the pod, but other than that, it was brilliant.  The views are stunning especially in the good weather we had. The Eye moves so slowly that at first you dont realise you are moving and I did eventually manage to leave the safety of the seat. Unrivalled, especially with the disappointment of The Shard being closed for our booked visit. Highly recommended and well worth the money."
"Written September 8, 2020",Scenic,"Really clear views high  across London,  we had the whole pod to ourselves which was an added bonus !  Would recommend you  go on the Eye as part of a ""Attraction "" deal as maybe a bit hefty a price on its own "
"Written September 2, 2020","Great views, great value","We went to the lastminute.com London Eye, as we were going to London from Manchester and we had never been to the London Eye, although we had been to Central London several times. It was quite expensive for 2 adults and 1 child but we had used a £20 Tesco Clubcard voucher, and we paid the rest by card.At the main day, staff checked our temprature and let us in, like most attractions in this COVID time. We had photos taken both in and out of the pod and we went in to the pod, which only had 2 other households in it. I felt that might be a bit uncomfortable in this COVID period, the pod was a bit huge, so it was easy for social distancing. Like they said, there was some great views! Even though I think £2 for a soveniur coin is a bit expensive, the pods were very clean and overall, it was a great experience! They also give you a 30% voucher for lastminute.com."
"Written September 2, 2020","Great cruise, a fun way to learn.","Great cruise, Jack who was our tour guide very informative and funny! It’s a great way to learn about the city."
"Written August 31, 2020",Fill in time ,It was ok but not worth £60 to go round in a circle  I suppose I’m not the best one to comment as I prefer to see things up close and personal ie major land marks but no one insisted I go on so maybe I should just shut up 🤐😂
"Written August 30, 2020","Overpriced but,","I must say that this experience is genuinely overpriced for what it is. At the end of the day you're going on a ""modified Ferris wheel"" so I think that the ticket prices are quite over exaggerated. However, if you are a tourist, or you have never been on the London Eye, then I would still recommend it as you can get a great view on a good day. Just be prepared to save up some money for this specific attraction."
"Written August 16, 2020",Special,"Beautiful views of the city from the London Eye, it is so beautiful to see everything from up there that time inside the capsule flies by. The movement of the Ferris wheel is almost undetectable, so if you suffer from vertigo you can't feel it. Point against the price of the photos, they take beautiful photos of you inside the capsule and at the time of charging them, a photo comes out almost as the value from the entrance, that seemed a bit excessive"
"Written August 12, 2020","Nothing special, spend your time doing something more meaningful.","Travelled in September 2017 the experience was Okay, the line was not that long but it is seriously overrated. Unless you get free tickets spend your money else where. So much to see and do in London don’t waste your time. Hire a bike for 1 hour  and ride around one of the many parks. Might be ok for people who live in England looked like mostly school groups."
"Written August 11, 2020",Great experience,We really enjoyed this experience and were lucky not to have to wait in a queue before boarding . Good COVID-19 procedures in place. Great views of London from The pod . There was a short delay due to a technical problem during our trip but we were kept advised and the delay only lasted a few minutes . It is fairly expensive but in our view well worth it.
"Written August 7, 2020",It’s pretty good.,"We got our tickets Madame Tussauds & London Eye together (£76) for the 2 of us.The London eye lasts about half an hour.We booked a set time (11am) but we still had about a 30 min wait.Due to the pandemic, staff were checking temperatures.The pods were limited to small numbers.The staff doing bag searches, it’s a very relaxed search, they definitely never checked inside our camera bag.Overall, the view is lovely, the pods were spotless.My only criticism, the tannoy in the pod is too loud.Would recommend."
"Written August 5, 2020",Beautiful views,Fantastic views of London’s main attractions from the top of one of London’s main attractions. It’s an absolutely must but highly recommend pre-booking tickets before coming because queues can sometimes get crazy

"Written July 9, 2020",Like a gentrified funfair without the fun ,"The chance to stand in a slowly revolving spheroid with mediocre views of the Thames, and pay an obscene amount of money for the privilege. Because of visiting friends and relatives I've been here several times over the years, and I've hated every single visit. "
"Written July 8, 2020",Ferris wheel (London EYE),"This Ferris wheel gives you an overwhelming experience through its capsules which take you up to great height likely above 100m and give you a landscape view of the whole city of London along with river THAMES.I got opportunity to visit in day time but someday will surely like to visit it during night...as its very fairly bright and twinkling.I think also one trip of single revolution took around 30/40 minutes ..You get to watch the 360 degree view of this most hyped place of England.There are benches in the center of the capsule as apart of seating.I had a clear view to see Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, The Tower and The Tower Bridge and the river Thames of course.There are so many souvenir shops around by ..It was worth it!"

"Written June 5, 2020",Get tickets in advance,"Got my ticket in advance to avoid the line which I'd recommend. I went at night and felt that although it looked cool in person, I couldn't convey that via camera or phone. I would be interested in seeing it during the day to see if I could spot parts of London better. It's pricey and everything around it is extremely touristy but if you're walking around a lot, it's not a bad place to pause."
"Written June 2, 2020",Worth It,"The tickets are expensive, but it's worth it for the great views. Even in the rain, we enjoyed ourselves!"
"Written May 28, 2020",Amazing Experience....,I had ride at night. The view of London was breathtaking.  The fast track ticket is just reasonably priced. It's just worth purchasing since the queue is extremely long and you have to wait longer.

"Written March 27, 2020","Good Views, but not the cost","I am glad we took the opportunity to ride on the London Eye but found that for the experience it was a bit expensive. The staff was friendly and helpful and as we went early when it opened and it was March there were no lineups. We had eight people in our capsule which was not crowded at all. I was a bit disappointed that due to the tall modern buildings to the east, you could not see the Tower of London. The five-minute 4-D Imax experience we wnt to after the ride was worth the experience."

"Written March 6, 2020",London Eye skip the line,We are finding that our time is worth more than our travel money. So any time a skip the line option is available we take it. The London Eye is a fabulous way to see the London Skyline from a birds eye view. I recommend it as a must see for a first time London trip.  Took my 85 year old Mom and she loved it
"Written March 6, 2020",Good sight seeing,"Lovely staff and well worth a visit,espescially on a clear day. Pods were clean and even though we had to Q, very good experiance"
"Written March 6, 2020",London Eye  absolutely beautiful,What a wonderful way to see London. Beautiful experience. Definitely worth going for a ride. Such breath taking views.
"Written March 5, 2020",Eiffel Tower is better but this is a must do in London,"Maybe it was because the day was kind of cloudy and we did not see as much as we saw in Paris. As your time is very limited, you depend a lot on what's happening with the weather. The pro was, that we were able to see several buildings from close but above, something you cannot see from the street while passing by. We shared the space with only a few more, so there was no pressure or uncomfortable feeling while being inside. To see London from above you should consider taking this ride, but only in case it's sunny, clouds will harm the trip."
"Written March 3, 2020",A little disappointing!,"The London Eye was really cool but we went on it right after we arrived hoping that it would give us perspective as to where everything was.  However, there was nothing to point out the highlights of London so we really just got a fun view of a big city.  "

"Written March 1, 2020",Needs window wipers,Yes it was OK. We had a half price voucher from my daughter’s school so it was reasonable value with that. Wouldn’t want to pay full prices. Was raining so couldn’t see out properly.

"Written March 6, 2020","Great view , long ride , NO TOILET","It's a must do experience when you visit London , you will get 360 panoramic view of the city and plenty of photos you can take , but the ride is a bit long and you will get bored , after 15 Min you will be done with all the photos you can take , you need to make sure to to toilet before you ride , as you will be stuck on the capsule for good 45 Min I think. I was showing off my bad dancing skills , I even tap danced myself somehow and moon walked out of the capsule when the ride was over"

"Written February 26, 2020",Views!!,Amazing way to see the views of London. I have been on the eye a couple of times and it is a great way to see the city. I will confess the manners of those who you are riding with can make it break your experience.
"Written February 26, 2020",Nice views but crowded,Maybe I'm no fun but I just don't think it's worth it.  It's hard to get a good picture when you share the space with so many other people.  It's fairly slow as well.  it is of course a great way to get a view of the city but it just wasn't for me.

"Written February 25, 2020",Ludicrously expensive,"Great views, run very slickly, stupidly expensive for a 30min Ferris wheel. And more opportunities to part with your money with souvenirs, photos etc."
"Written February 24, 2020",Underwhelming,"Our experience of the London Eye was entirely underwhelming.  In fact, it's kinda boring and an expensive waste of time.  If you want a great view of London, go to the bar at the new Shard building, near Tower Bridge.  Have a drink, take in the view, and forget the Eye.  I don't get all the hype about the Eye.  Didn't do much for me or my family."
"Written February 24, 2020",What a View!,This is not your carnival ferris wheel by any means.  This thing is huge.  The car holds many people (as many as 20?).  The structure goes so high that you see over everything in all directions.  It takes about an hour to go all the way around and is a pretty incredible experience.  We did the express pass which was totally worth it.  The crowd waiting was huge and the line was long.  The extra money made it palatable for the kids to wait.  When you get on you realize this is going to be a little different.  A little scary and exhilarating at the same time.  The views are amazing and the photo ops are too.  Totally recommend it.
"Written February 24, 2020",Great experience!,"Great experience, wonderful views, even with a fear of heights, really delighted that I did it! Wonderful photo ops. "
"Written February 24, 2020",Quite Expensive,"When on this purely for the views, they didn't disappoint but it's quite pricey for what you get. I only had myself to buy a ticket for and can imagine it be very expensive if you had a family."

"Written February 17, 2020",Fantastic view,"I think you need to go once  to the London eye, because you can see the entire city, I recommend go during night for seeing a fantastic view of the illuminated city. I didn't need to buy a skip line, because the line was smooth. I went there during December and I could see the Christmas decorations, One of the best moments of my life at London."
"Written February 17, 2020",Great view of Westminster and Big Ben (when it's nits covered) ,"Would recommend for a sunny clear day, otherwise for the price it's not worth it. Do it once, wouldn't do again due to price but if conditions good it's a great time"

"Written March 16, 2020",Great experience - super special assistance,"A friend and I took our sons, both with autism, on a trip to London a few weeks ago and booked tickets for the London Eye. The queues were pretty long (although did appear to move quite swiftly) and the staff were super helpful in fast tracking us given the nature of our sons' conditions. The experience itself was great. Although the pod itself was pretty full, there was still enough room and space for everyone to move around and have a good view at any one time. A lovely time was had by all."
"Written March 16, 2020",Spectacular views,"I was bought tickets for the London eye as a birthday gift, I was a bit apprehensive as I don’t like heights however it was a wonderful experience. As you are enclosed in the pod and if you didn’t want to stand by the glass there are seats in the middle.  However the views from the London eye are absolutely spectacular, London has a very diverse architecture, you get excellent views of the old city of London as well as all the new icon buildings. I really recommend this for visitors to London."

I can imagine at peak times it would get very busy but we were there mid Feb and practically got straight on. It was a clear day and the sun set just as we got to the top, magical!!!"
"Written February 24, 2020",Long ques,It was a lovely day. Very very long line to que in. It was moving but slow.  Apparently an excellent view up there according to friends who waited patiently while I went to other attractions within the area. Great experience. Tickets are pricey. 
"Written February 23, 2020",Nice experience ,Something that is required for anyone how visit london to see and experience. It is very huge and you can see the city from the top. Its really nice and worth to ride if you don’t get panic from high levels. 
"Written February 23, 2020",Enjoyable ,"Came here on a Saturday and had a nice time. The views on a clear day are very good. I managed to get half price tickets, however I'm unsure if I would pay full price. "
"Written February 23, 2020",Excellent must see ,Loved it Tourist location Must see in London Walking distance from Buckingham palace Lots of sight seeing tour buses outside to see london 
"Written February 23, 2020",Beautiful at night,We have been on the London eye in the day so we decided this time to go in the evening.We didn’t queue we walked straight on which was nice and there was our family and one more family in our pod (another bonus) the view at night with all the lights were breathtaking I highly recommend going on a night. 
"Written February 23, 2020","Great views, long queues","Fabulous attraction - well worth a visit for the great views, plenty of room in each pod, to move around and take lots of great photosWe visited in feb- great sky and bit cold but still able to see lots of the recognisable building, all situated in SouthBank an interesting part of London - The 4D experience to finish off is priceless Only negative is the length of queues, not very friendly staff.Being forced to queue for photo options waste more time. But I think staff know how to move the queues fast!I would recommend but maybe guided to Make the most of it"
"Written February 22, 2020",Nice place to visit ,We were able to see the 3D movie of the eye of London which was free and nice.nice to walk around the place but on our way to the Buckingham palace we took the double decker bus first time experience and I was thrilled 
"Written February 21, 2020",First time in london,This was brilliant.  So well organised. It is soooo high and you can see so much. A definite must if like me its your first time to London.  We got the binoculars from the shop beforehand but didn't really use them much.
"Written February 21, 2020",Nice safe family environment,"Tourist attraction, safe family environment.  Takes about 30 minutes for the complete ride.  Make reservations in advance."
"Written December 29, 2019",A Truly an Eye of London,"If you're visiting London, this is one of the most recommend things to do, bit pricey but you don't want to miss this experience to see surroundings, buy tickets together with Madame Tussauds and others to avail some discounts."
"Written December 28, 2019",Beautiful view,This gave a beautiful view of London. We ended up getting the fast past and waited about 20 minutes to get on. I can’t imagine the wait for the regular line. I have a fear of heights but was easily able to sit in the middle to enjoy the views without having to look down. Definitely would recommend. 
"Written December 28, 2019",Very crowded but great energy,We saw the queue and decided to skip the giant wheel. But it felt so good to see this whole sea of people around you. The lighting after dark brings in the festive mood. We loved the other rides - 80m high & the merry go round. My kids loved the whole day out. Thank you London!
"Written December 28, 2019",River and Eye Combo,"Recently did the river and London Eye tour, and it was great. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and funny. The actual cruise takes about 40 minutes, and it goes by the Tower of London, City Hall, the oldest waterfront pub in London (the Anchor), among other landmarks. After the cruise, you can go straight to the London Eye. The line to get in the Eye is surprisingly fast (considering how many people are there). The ride takes about 30 minutes, and you get great views of London. I recommend the combination package if you are in London."
"Written December 26, 2019",Nice to see but overrated,"It is nice to see just so you can say you were in London and saw it, but I think it is quite overrated, it is not historical or cultural heritage, and the queues to get on it are ridiculous, especially if you take the price into account as well. It does look good on the pictures though."
"Written December 26, 2019",Awesome views. ,A truly fantastic experience awaits with unbeatable views of central London and beyond; this probably explains why we have done this a dozen times! Recommended. 
"Written December 26, 2019",Kid's delight to view the city from the Eye,"book in advance to get a shorter wait time. amazing view, grand daughter never wanted to get off of it. better than Disney World per her. "
"Written December 25, 2019",SO GLAD we did it!,"We were only in London about 40 hours, and I'm so glad the London Eye was prioritized for us to do.  Great overview of the city!  Nice clear day and Fast Trax is the way to go!"
"Written December 25, 2019",London eye ,Very beautiful and magical view and you can see London from different sides and enjoy your time there. 
"Written December 25, 2019",East family activity to see a Fun view of the city,We went with 3 generations Grandparents to grandkids and everyone really enjoyed it.  It was lovely  to see the whole city from up high and it went slow enough that we really had a chance to take it all in.  Also some fun photo ops.
"Written February 16, 2020",What an attraction! ,My first visit to England and I couldn’t miss this must see landmark! I got great views across the entire city of London and made friends with a couple of guys on the way round! Would definitely recommend for anyone on their first visit!
"Written February 15, 2020",Lovely views but busy pod ruined it.,"As annual merlin pass holders we tend to do this each time we pop to London. It was a Saturday and a gorgeous cold but sunny day, the queue was around 20 minutes which wouldn't have been too bad  had we not had a couple in front of us (55-60ish) who couldn't keep their hands of each other, the look on 10 years face said it all 🤮. We then unfortunately ended up in a pod with them and while i hoped they'd admire the views they continued to snog and grope each other. Tried my best to avoid them but there was like 20-25 people in this pod and we were all shuffling into each other. The views were amazing, probably the clearest I've seen before on there. I do this us Brits are somewhat more considerable though. I'd love for a bit more knowledge throughout the trip, like an automated recording of what to look for etc. Overall ok but I'd be seething to have paid £27 for this type of experience."
"Written February 14, 2020",Our host was brilliant ,"We weren’t really sure what to expect , but booked a fizz package on the eye as part of our celebration . To be honest is was better that expected . The pre lounge and glass of fizz was great and the eye experience was excellent . Made so much more so due to our host ( we can’t remember his name something like Sam mho or something like that ( sorry , he’d been in holby city ) he was great , got everybody involved , informative, funny and really made a good experience into a great one . Well done . The cost was £90 for 2 people inc 4 glasses of champagne fast track etc . Well worth it we loved it thanks  "
"Written February 13, 2020",So this is the London Eye!,"This, I found out, was a product (Coca Cola) of the US. It was a very entertaining attraction that was packed with people wanting to ride. The ride was very informative and you got to see many parts of London from a different perspective."
"Written February 13, 2020",Nice ride with a beautiful voew over London,"I went there with my 2 teens daughters in a grey and cold winter day. We enjoyed our ride - in a very quite capsule with a couple - nothing to compare with the crowded days of summer.I am sure we would have enjoyed even more with a bit of sun to enlighten our pictures. Included in the ticket, a visit to the 4D cinema. To be done once in a lifetime!"
"Written February 13, 2020",Beautiful view,"The London eye gave us a beautiful view of the city. We didn’t have to wait in line. We were able to walk right in. I was thinking of buying skip the line tickets in advance to avoid the lines, but it’s a good thing I didn’t because we didn’t need them. It’s a must do while visiting London!"
"Written February 12, 2020","Amazing views, very expensive","If it's your first trip to London, this is something you really want to consider doing! You'll get great views of many other landmarks as well as being able to tick this big one off your bucket list! I personally find it very expensive for what it is but people will continue to pay that price so it wont change. Book in advance if you can."
"Written February 12, 2020",Well...,It's way too expensive! Sorry but that's just not worth it. Of course you'll get a nice view but nope...not for this price
"Written February 12, 2020",A Bird’s Eye View,"My eight year old daughter learned about the London Eye in school, and when we planned our trip to London, all she could talk about was riding the London Eye. We were fortunate to have a cloudless sky which let us see for miles around us."
"Written February 12, 2020",Super trip,"London eye is amazing, if you know little bit of London then you can see a view of all London around, and the River cruise...if you know where to go by a river, also very interesting"
"Written February 12, 2020",Must visit ,"Visited with my wife and I, 100% worth doing just to say you’ve done it! Great views of London and really nice area too..... if you can get a group of you and hire a pod .... even better !!!"
"Written February 11, 2020",Amazing night view of London,Myself and family enjoyed the London Eye at night. We had an excellent nightime view of the city and took lots of pictures. The Eye rotates slowly so there is no rush. It is a huge structure but extremely well built and sturdy...no fear! The tickets are not cheap but there probably coupons. We enjoyed what is now an iconic London event.
"Written February 10, 2020",Birthday champagne visit,Thoroughly recommend the champagne celebration. VIP treatment. Bypass all the queues. Amazing day. Wonderful treat. Our guide was so friendly and knowledgeable. She was such a lovely young lady.
"Written February 10, 2020",Looks amazing!,"It looks great, but we didn't ride on it. The queue is very long. It will take you hours before you can get in. I have my toddler with me, she doesn't have patience to wait that long."
"Written February 9, 2020",Brilliant and well worth the money,Great staff and great activities. My daughter is a full time wheelchair user and the staff and organisation- and helpfulness of staff was second to none. We had no issues and they all did their very best to support us. Usually I worry about taking my daughter to these type of things but I have to say I need not have worried/ if you’re a wheelchair user or a member of your party is- I recommend this
"Written February 9, 2020",worth it,Quiet a long wait time but definitely worth the wait the views are nothing short of breath taking and a once in a lifetime treat.
"Written February 9, 2020",Marvelous view over the city,"Marvelous view over the city, not quite so high than to be supposed. I liked much of the glass floor under my feet. A little bit scary!"
"Written February 8, 2020",Amazing thank you.,i can not praise the staff enough at the eye today. Our daughter has additional needs and we were a little concerned about how she would cope. There were 9 of us together in total and when we got to the front of the line the lovely people that were assisting people on the eye allowed us to have one of the pods by ourselves which made the whole experience so magical and relaxed for us not worrying about her being loud and upsetting our tourists. Thank you so much to all the staff that helped us today you really did make our visits so magical.
"Written February 7, 2020",it's a must tourist activity!,"to be in London and not to rotate 360 ​​° in the London Eye, is to miss a great fun, conviviality and the best view of the city, you can appreciate the magnitude of the River Thames and enjoy the contrast of historic buildings with modern buildings!"
"Written February 7, 2020",Wow,"A fabulous VIP trip with a glass of bubbly. We really enjoyed it, I only wish I could go round again."
"Written February 6, 2020",Really great way to see most of London without walking,If you don't like walking about and want to see London in about 30 minutes then use the London Eye as you will see everything for about 50 miles but bring binoculars because everything is that small you cant see much detail.I thought £79 for an adult and 2 kids was expensive for a big wheel  ride.The kids liked it.
"Written February 5, 2020",Holiday,"Superb is the word.... No traveller to the UK shud miss this...tickets shud be bought online to avoid the rush.... Various combos are offerd..dont buy the binoculars,its a waste.... The views are spectacular... "
"Written February 3, 2020",Very overpriced not THAT amazing but I guess a must do if in London,If your a tourist I understand that you’re going to want to see this but it’s a bit overrated and extremely overpriced! I would recommend going to the ‘Sky Garden’ for good FREE views!
"Written February 2, 2020",Thames cruise and London Eye,"Good price for this dual ticket so it was well worth advance booking. Staff were great, and we were provided with a funny and interesting commentary on the Thames trip. After purchase (during which you book the time for the cruise), you have to book a time & date for the London Eye. The instructions are to log in with a reference number. If you try and do this, the computer will say ""no"". I wasted an hour discovering that the reference in the documents provided consisted of numbers and letters, but the log in only requires the numbers, not the letters. Since the cruise is about 40 mins, you can book the Eye for about an hour and a quarter after the cruise departure time, and this should provide the two experiences seamlessly. Hope this helps."
"Written February 2, 2020",Too slow ,We visited the london eye this weekend on an evening flight. We enjoyed our flight and had a clear evening to see london. My daughter (8) felt that the flight could have been slightly faster. 
"Written February 2, 2020",Well worth the money,"Unrivalled views across the whole of London a must for any tourist, Queues weren't too bad when we were there, so wasn't necessary to pay the extra for the Fast track tickets"
"Written February 2, 2020",A must do while in london,Booked on line and printed ticket myself much quicker as saves you queuing. Very well organised i was booked in for 1pm but got there 2 noon they just let me on. Have to be quick but moves very slow then you hop on but staff are well trained to get you on and off.  Its approx 30 to 40 mins you are on. You get an amazing view of all round london. And i saw loads as was brexit day loads going on at Westminster. Watch out if you are crossing westminister bridge there where at least 8 packs of what i call pea men with there 3 cups trying to tempt you do not have a go you will loose your money and probably be pick pocketed at same time.
"Written February 2, 2020",50th Birthday treat,"My husband took me on this VIP experience on my special birthday.  We had an evening 'flight'.  We went to the lounge upstairs and was given the choice of drinks, cocktails beers etc.  We had an introduction from our tour guide.  There were 8 people in our pod.  We skipped through the line, and the skip the line people, and entered our pod with our guide and her champagne trolly.  I cannot remember our guides name, sadly, but it was her first day on the job.  She did a great job pointing out the sites, we were given a glass of bubbly (soft drinks were available)  She asked if there was anyone on there for a special occasion,  and as it was my birthday everyone sung happy birthday to me. Our other guests were very friendly and the views from the pod was fab, really good to see it at night.  Had we had a daytime trip I don't think we would have seen much as the weather was poor.  All in all a fabulous experience."

"Written December 31, 2019",Bird’s Eye View of London,"This is really a nice experience. Due to the slow rotation of the wheel, you don’t even feel like you are moving. I hope that people who don’t like heights take a chance on this and get to see London from such a great perspective."
"Written December 31, 2019","Stunning view, great experience","London is very eclectic. It have a fusion of the antique with the modern that is impressive. In one side of Thames River, the Big Ben (now in refurbish). In the other side, the London Eye. And you continue with Castles and Palaces in front of modern arquitecture buildings. The London Eye is becoming step by step like a symbol, an icon of UK as the Big Ben is. But it deserves it. Is an impressive structure that almost dominates the skyline of London. This one is a must if going to London."
"Written December 31, 2019",Great,Get the flexi fast pass. You just go around once. My girls loved it. Ended up at sunset so it was beautiful. 
"Written December 30, 2019",Get in early!,We originally booked to go on the Eye around 12:15 but when we went past at 9:30 am there was no line up and the rotation had begun. The lovely customer service people said we could go on early and we were very appreciative. A hint would be to go first thing in the morning as the crowds start building from 11 am
"Written December 29, 2019",Eye on London,Wonderful 360 degree view of London with one ride. Moderate wait times with optional express lines with additional cost. Awesome view of Thames. Worth the money.
"Written December 29, 2019",Beautiful view of London from Thames river,"If you buy the tickets on internet you only have to wait around 30 minutes to get in, the queue moves very fast. It’s worth the experience. The view of London from above is very beautiful. "

"Written January 28, 2020",A 360 view of London City from River Thames,Recommended for all even for people who quite nervous about heights. You do not feel any shaking of the cabin at all. Be ready with your binoculars if you have one. Be ready at the end of the revolving cycles as there will a photo opportunity at the designated photo spot coloured with pink and faced the camera when instructed. Don't  forget to smile!

"Written January 6, 2020",A must do while in London,"Must do while in London. Not too cramped while was good, just have to put up with the Instagram photos which takes about 10 photos lolIt is a little expensive but well worth it."
"Written January 5, 2020",Best Views of Big Ben,We chose to use the skip the line option and it was definitely worth it. The day that we went it was very cold and standing in line would've have deferred use from going. Once we got on the London Eye it was such spectacular views of Big Ben and all of London. Highly recommend this attraction with the skip the line portion.
"Written January 5, 2020",London Eye,"Great view. Glad we did it. Seemed to be a busy with all the NYE travelers, the fast track line was worth it if in your budget. We were on the eye within 15 minutes of buying the tickets. We were their at sunset December 30. Great views. Our pre teen kids loved it."
"Written January 5, 2020",Amazing Champagne Experience,"Myself and my partner arranged for the champagne experience of the London eye and it was totally worth it. Skipped the line, had a photo before going on the eye and had a glass of champagne on the way around. It was amazing along with the views, definitely a romantic activity to do.  Big shout out to Matthew who took charge of our capsule, knew lots about the surrounding sights and gave myself a cork of the champagne bottle for our anniversary"
"Written January 4, 2020",Sunset view,"we’ve tried the Linq in Las Vegas but this one is better. it’s about 30-40 minutes ride. we’ve captured the perfect sunset, too bad the big ben is under renovation."
"Written January 4, 2020",A lot of fun,I went on a school trip some time ago and i really enjoyed it the only downside is that if you go and it is foggy it is really hard to see the city though luckily there was only a bit of fog when i went aswell as it being cloudy though its england so what can you expect.
"Written January 4, 2020",Champagne Experience,"We did the champagne experience on the London eye which I must say is worth the extra price just for having your own personal capsule for your party and the others on the champagne experience! Our host Matthew was very personal and knowledgeable and couldn’t do enough to make our experience fun and enjoyable! A must do activity for a visit to London , we did it during night time and London’s skyline was stunning "
"Written January 3, 2020",Awesome views,The queue looked scary but moved really quickly. We had clear skies and full sun when we visited so views across London were great. Def a must do!
"Written January 3, 2020",A must to see and experience ,A great place to get some pics of the London skyline - not to mention just the experience of it all. Pay the extra 10 pounds for fast track service - the efficiency of it all is quick and painless😀 Happy to have done this and be part of THE EYE experience. 
"Written January 2, 2020",It's wheely good,We booked online with a 3pm time slot. We rushed to make it on time expecting to get on at the specified time. How wrong were we. Got there at 2.45 and were directed to join the queue. 55 minutes later we got on. Obligatory posed photo which was £20 like so many of the attractions. The ride was great with spectacular views.
"Written December 25, 2019",Arrive early to get on board quickly,"This is a pricey tourist attraction and has long lines starting mid morning, but I suppose it's worth it to do once.  I would not take the time if you are only in London for a day or two though.  On the other hand you do get great views of London for photos.  So it's really a personal choice.  We were glad we did it but looking back on our trip we would not have missed it had we skipped it."
"Written December 24, 2019",One time was enough,"I always wanted to go up in the London eye, so I made sure to add it to the itinerary when planning my London trip. I purchased the fast track ticket and highly recommend this. The views were great and I’m glad I experienced the London eye, but it’s definitely something you only need to do once. The next time I go to London I don’t need to go up in the eye again. The only reason I marked the London eye down was because my sister and I missed our initial time to use our ticket. We were over in Greenwich at the Royal Observatory and our water Taxi got us to the Eye late. We missed the opening hours by 5 minutes and we were told we couldn’t board any longer. I explained that we couldn’t go the next day because we had arrangements to go out of the city to Bath. The employee told us to comeback whenever we could to exchange the ticket and to tell them our story of why we missed our date. We ended up returning two days later and had to go inside to the ticket sales counter and exchange for a new ticket. It cost £5 each to exchange which I guess is better than having to pay full price again, but I mean it would have been nice to not have to pay. "
"Written December 23, 2019",So much fun!,The river cruise and the London Eye were gifted to me and were perfect for this trip to London. I purposefully did the cruise early on during my 10 day trip and was a great way to get my bearings on the area around the Thymes. I did the EYE at night and the views were spectacular.
"Written December 22, 2019",Champagne Experience a little flat,We opted for the Champagne Experience which cost an extra £20 on the regular entry fee. I thought the extra cost would translate to less people in the cabin but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. Essentially you are paying for a fast track entry and an average glass of champagne. The views are spectacular but I would probably give it a miss next time.
"Written December 22, 2019",FUN!,"great must see for London. Views of the water and parks leading to buckingham palace. We could even see if the queen was home or not because the flag was raised which meant she was home. We stayed at sea containers hotel which was walking distance to the Eye. Five or ten mins. No need for ""skip the line"" tickets as the line if it is long moves along very fast. there are lots of birds in the area flying low so be careful of of having food in your hand while walking in the area of the london eye. the actual ride is in a large glass cabin and you feel safe.There is seating inside as well. it move slow so you will not have to worry about illness like that of a roller coaster."
"Written December 21, 2019",London Eye and River Thames Cruise - Good start to trip to London,"For amateur and professional photographers alike, the London Eye offers the platform for some pretty amazing images of London. The wheel moves slow enough to take any type of picture (portrait, time-lapse, slo-mo, etc.) as well, just sit back and take in the really stunning views. In fact, I know the wheel came to a brief stop 2-3 times, but it was so subtle, I almost couldn't even feel it.The River Thames boat tour offered its own unique perspective of many of the same landmarks - although a bit more up close and like a quick introduction. The whole trip lasted about only about 30-40 minutes and allowed for interior and exterior experiences. And our guide was well informed, considerate and provided fun-humored commentary from beginning to end."

"Written January 16, 2020",Overcrowded,"Most probably one of the highest and most amazing wheels in Europe. On a first eye looks stunning and then your desire to fly on is raising up rapidly. Unfortunately, there is a huge queue and with standard ticket in hand you need to wait a lot, so we had not enough time to give it a try. In any case the staff was really friendly and hopefully next we will manage to get on it."
"Written January 15, 2020",Expensive but a worthwhile treat,"We visited at 10.30 am on a sunny, cold Sunday morning. The queue was virtually non-existent, we were greeted by friendly, jovial staff (particularly the security personnel). The ever changing views were impressive with excellent opportunities for photography. This is an attraction that should not be missed."
"Written January 12, 2020",Expensive but worth it,"I went with a Russian friend who was visiting London and purchased fast track tickets which were expensive but meant you could jump the long queue.  It was worth the expense not just for that reason but for the wonderful views of the iconic sites of London’s skyline, the Houses of Parliament and St Paul’s Cathedral. Even though the afternoon was dull we could see the views clearly and took lots of photographs all the way up to the top.  The London Eye also have a staff photographer at the entrance and automatic cameras to record you on the Eye which can be purchased at the end of the trip."

"Written January 8, 2020",unbelievable ride,32 cabins for 32 districts..wow great idea. it gives a eagles eye view of the city. enjoyable ride with friends as every one has varying exclamation feelings
"Written January 8, 2020",A Great Experience!,"My experience on the London eye is never going to be forgotten! The pod was fairly empty, we had a great view and overall great time. I would recommend a fast track ticket to skip the line. If you are in London you for sure have to go on the London Eye!"
"Written January 8, 2020","Amazing staff, fantastic views. What a fantastic experience","We pre-booked using our Merlin VIP Passes.So we got to the fast track 👣lane and had our photo 📷 done, then realised my son had forgotten his bag (in the chip shop). Staff member helped!!!! We got it back!!!!Was then taken to the capsule and enjoyed the views!!!!  This is a magnificent way to enjoy the skyline views and it was a clear day, so we could see literally so much!!!!Definitely worth a return visit"
"Written January 7, 2020",Beautiful London Eye,Eventhough the queque are very long but it wothed with the view. We can see London city from the above. So pretty😍
"Written January 6, 2020",Pretty view of London ,"Although it’s pricy, it’s a must do when in London!You get one roundtrip in the Eye, so you beter enjoy every moment you are in it!"
"Written January 6, 2020",Awesome sight ,Enjoyed our trip to the London eye. Very picturesque especially at sunset! In the day we went the Christmas markets were on which was lovely. Lots of nice restaurants nearby to have a meal or even just a drink. 
"Written December 20, 2019",Mrs.,Omg this view is amazing. Totally worth the money. A must see and do when you're in London. Lights up during the night and lots of opportunities for selfies and photos. You can also buy your pictures that was taken while in the capsule. 
"Written December 20, 2019",Great experience and wonderful views ,"Excellent experience, the London Eye was great!, amazing views and wonderful time. It was raining, so the visibility was not 100%, but even with that, everything was fenomenal. The boat trip was also great and Mike our guide was really funny but really good showing all the best places during the trip.In general, one life time experience, if you come to London, you must visit London Eye and do the whole package. "
"Written December 18, 2019",Amazing ride with excellent tour guide,Ben was great & very entertaining. Will definitely recommend this ride. We shall come back in our next trip to London!
"Written December 17, 2019",Worth the trip,Well worth a visit to get a different perspective on the London skyline.  Quite expensive on a normal ticket so use a discounted ticket if possible.  We used the travel to London by train discount.  Enjoyable attraction.
"Written December 17, 2019",Absolutely Beautiful,it was a lovely experience and watchin.London from a Giant Wheel moving slow :) the timing was well maintained and the entire process was organised well with no mess and overall it was a neat !
"Written December 17, 2019",Nice experience’,"This was a nice experience but make sure you do it on a day where it’s not rainy! Everybody should try this once!Price is ok, queue can sometimes be long, depends on day and time of the year. "
"Written December 17, 2019","Lovely, but pricey","It's a lovely view and it is slow enough that you really do get to see everything around that area. It was a clear day when we started so we were able to see a lot, but by the time we hit the top it had started raining pretty hard which makes picture taking difficult but by then I didn't mind. Not sure we would have done it if it was raining or really foggy when we got there. I thought the price was a bit much, but it's a landmark at this point so we went."
"Written December 17, 2019",Amazing experience,amazing experience ... if you are in love with London this will top it off and your experience would be amazing.
"Written December 17, 2019",Absolutely worth it,My friends and I visited London to celebrate a birthday. The Eye was one of the highlights of this quick weekend trip. We did the Champagne Experience and it happened to be a slow night which meant we had a capsule entirely to ourselves. Apparently that doesn't happen often.I want to take a moment to give a quick shout out to Sam who served us champagne as we looked out over the skyline. She was really great about giving us information about what we were looking at and even gave us a taste of her experiences being an expat in London. If you ever read this thanks so much Sam! You really helped make our night. The Champagne Experience was totally worth paying extra for and the champagne was good stuff. I'm very happy we went and it was the perfect kickoff for our evening.
"Written December 16, 2019",Amazing Views,Amazing views and a great experience to see London from above. Staff were all friendly and super helpful. Would advise buying tickets in advance to avoid more cost on the day.
"Written December 16, 2019",Great views,"We spent a nice afternoon cruising on the Thames, then getting the bird-eye-view on the EYE. Very nice, and worth the tour. We also got to watch the river rescue in action; someone fell into the river next to the Eye."
"Written December 16, 2019",one of top attractions  in London,"This has been my 3rd time in London but first time to do the London Eye.We bought the online fast track ticket ,  though November was not a busy month.If you want to see good views of the Thames and some parts of London  then you must this."
"Written December 15, 2019",50 pounds pp,The place is beautiful but don't pay such a crazy amount to have a ride! Spend those money to have a great drink with your friends in one of the many bars and restaurants close to it and with an amazing view
"Written December 15, 2019",Great ride,"The experience and views are well worth the ticket price. I do recommend getting the fast track option, saves a lot of time. "
"Written December 12, 2019",Awesome view,"It is one of prime attractions in London! We were fortunate enough because we went during off peak season and the waiting queues were not long. Comes with a nice complimentary 4D short movie experience!! The view from the top was pretty amazing except that it was raining , so far off structures were covered in haze. Nevertheless, enjoyed a lot!"

"Written December 10, 2019",Absolutey fabulous,Fast track ticket was a hit. We literaly just walked in. Ride was awsome. U really do not have a feeling that u r spinning. View  is remarcable. Definitely u have to do it but after u ve seen the city around and than go up to admire those sightseens!

"Written December 9, 2019",Το London Eye,Το London Eye is the best way to see the entire London from above and also in a very cheap way!!!!!!
"Written December 4, 2019",London Eye Top!,Its a must if you go to visit London and you want to have a sky look over the city and the river. I really suggest to buy the ticket via web in orser to skyp the line. The best time is the sunset.. they provid also vip package.
"Written December 3, 2019",Great views of london... on a clear day,"Great views of london, however we went at dusk on a cloudly day and it left you a little disappointed. I would go again either earlier in the day or at dark so you can see the lights of london."
"Written December 3, 2019",I recommend it for you ,"I visit London often, but this my first time to be in the London eye and it was a great acceptable waiting time and good staff. "
"Written December 2, 2019",Brilliant view of the city,We rode once during the day and once at night so we could take in the views with and without the city lights.  The views are amazing up and down the Thames.  My only complaint would be that the allow too many people into each carriage which makes it difficult for everyone to see all the views - especially if you are short like I am.  But I would definitely recommend the ride - both day and night.
"Written December 2, 2019",Great experience but now too expensive,"This is on the must do list for most visitors, but now that the price has multiplied over the years I'm not sure it's worth it anymore for an experience less than an hour.  If the Sky Garden is open I've heard it's as good or better.  "
"Written December 2, 2019",Wonderful ,"Wonderful experience, not a very big que at 10am so was on the ride within 10 minutes. Staff were all friendly, "
"Written December 1, 2019",There are other cheaper ways to see the city from up high,"We did this because one of the children insisted this was a bucket list item. It’s a novelty, a giant slow Ferris wheel that takes thirty minutes to do a full rotation giving you ample time to enjoy the view. I agree with another reviewer who suggested some audio in each capsule to tell you what you’re looking at. The views are pretty amazing, especially near sunset, however, you can go to the sky garden for free and see a view of the city from up high and save yourself $50 per person for a fast track ticket. In my opinion, this wasn’t worth the cost and we wouldn’t do it again."
"Written December 1, 2019",A must do London experience,"Absolutely love this, and have done it multiple times with visiting friends and family. A great way to see London from above"
"Written December 1, 2019",Nice experience,"Last time I was in London we skipped this, bur this time me and mu friend took the ride and it was a very nice experience and awesome view from the top"
"Written December 1, 2019",Fun trip,"Great way to see the landmarks of London from an elevated position. The pods are clean, air conditioned and well maintained. It’s easy to move around within the pods and bench seating is available if required. The best time to visit is as the sun is setting and London starts to light up."
"Written December 1, 2019",A wonderful place to ride on and it moves quite slowly.,We visited a couple of years ago and found it an exhilarating experience.  You could see for miles over the top of the houses of parliament and the London bridges. 
"Written December 1, 2019",My Amazing Visit to the London Eye,"It was amazing. The views were outstanding. The queue was pretty long so I advise getting there early. When you get in, it is amazing. The session is around half an hour and once you get to the top, your phone is out taking tonnes of pictures. I recommend this as a trip maybe not with very young children. 8+ is a good age.I hope you visit and have fun!"
"Written December 1, 2019",Has to be done,"You can't visit London without doing the London eye. Used 2 for 1 tickets so half price. Lovely views over the surrounding area, lots of photos taken."
"Written December 1, 2019",Must do in London if you aren’t afraid of heights,Came here midweek in the late afternoon with my wife and 3 young kids. The views of the city were incredible and allowed us to see all the places we visited earlier in the day. Someone in our bubble was afraid of heights and moved to the middle bench halfway through. Overall a great experience.
"Written December 1, 2019",Well worth the visit,Amazing views across London and just a fun experience to enjoy. Queues can be long but worth the wait. Take a camera and enjoy!
"Written December 1, 2019",Amazing view,we had a wonderful experience at the london eye.its advisable to book online since there r many combo offers as well as good deals.The 4D show shudn't be missed as it is included in the fare..The area near the eye is v happening.. lots of  other activities also go around...many food stalls..musicians performing..magic show.many more entertaining things..The view from the wheel is OUT OF THE WORLD..you can see many mo uments from the top...A must visit wen in London
"Written November 30, 2019",Enjoying the sights ,Brought tickets online which was definitely worth doing as by the time we got out of the London eye the queue was massive. It did not take us long to get on the London eye and overall there was good views from the eye. It was unclear where you had to stand while in the pod for a photo in the London eye but overall I would go back on it.

"Written November 29, 2019",London eye,A great place to see the city from above. Especially if the weather is good. A little bit expensive if you don’t buy other attractions in the city. 
"Written November 28, 2019",Bird's eye view of London,"Its took about 30min to complete an entire round, which is ample of time to soak in the beauty of the city & catch a glimpse from above. We went there early evening & the sun was still shining so brightly, worked well for good pictures. At a certain point before getting off, they have a camera to capture the picture of the entire group in the capsule & you can buy that pic (do not quite remember the price though)."
"Written December 9, 2019",My son loved it,"First time with 5 month old, 4 and 6 year olds and they loved it. We were lucky and didn't have to queue but the staff were pretty stroppy about the pram which was the only down side.  We have Merlin passes so I can't comment on value for money but the views are amazing and the ride just long enough to not get bored.  We had a fab time "
"Written December 8, 2019",Amazing view,Great view of the whole city. I went there at sunset and it really was magical seeing all the lights around.
"Written December 7, 2019",Night visit,"Git late tickets so we could view the lights, well worth it.  We had a clear night and thoroughly enjoyed it"
"Written December 7, 2019",Very average ,"This was a very average experience. The only thing special about it is the view but the experience itself was boring, the queuing took too long and it’s very expensive and not worth the time or the money. "

The counter was kind to suggest an afternoon/evening slot where there may be lesser fog compared to the 10am (time of redeeming). He was right! No fog at 2pm. Queue was fast for fast entry, simple body and bag check and good to go!"

"Written November 19, 2019",Amazing experience,Beautiful view of the city and Westminister. The Eye is one of London symbols so you have to try it. Recomended !
"Written November 18, 2019",Great view - not much else,"The Eye is well located, next to the Thames and across the river from Big Ben - easily accessed by the Underground. That being said it is far too expensive for a slow ride that  all it offers is the view."
"Written November 17, 2019",Great view,great view  but thats' about it... only came as I had family visiting and they wanted to go and do all the touristy things... not worth the price in my opinion ..

"Written November 6, 2019",Short ride with ok views ,"The ride was good but the views were obstructed with very little direction where to look.  Also,  on a rainy London day it is hard to see through the glass.A must do while in London but don’t hold your breath to be amazed"
"Written November 6, 2019",London Eye ,I gave three stars rather than more because I felt there should have been a running commentary to point out landmarks - of course it is a great view but you can get this view also at other places around London - I would still recommend to check it off your bucket list - 
"Written November 6, 2019",Super awesome ,An amazing experience and views is London. A must when here!!!They have an express line but the regular line is fast enough 
"Written November 6, 2019",See all of London in half an hour,This was a very enjoyable experience.  I have done it several times now and have always felt it was well worth it. Takes about twenty to 30 minutes and revolves so slowly that you don't feel nauseous or dizzy.  Fantastic views!!  Great family fun!!
"Written November 6, 2019",Love it!,"One of the best attractions of London.It is a slow moving attraction, but when at different peeks of the eye, you are able to get so many amazing views of London. Would highly recommend taking a trip on the eye, but not recommended if you are scared of heights."

"Written November 2, 2019",Buy your ticket from the Hop-on Hop-off bus driver!,"When we recently visited London we wanted to ride the Eye, but the hotel concierge said there were no ticket reservation times available until later in the day when rain was forecast. We then went to ride the Hop-on Hop-off bus and the ticket agent said we could buy ""skip the line"" Eye tickets from him and we could ride anytime (even right then) without waiting in line. I was skeptical, but we purchased the tickets and immediately went to the Eye and it worked! We skipped the long, long, long line and rode before it rained! Buy your tickets when you buy your hoho bus tickets."
"Written November 12, 2019",EyeloveLondon,"The London Eye was on my bucket list and I was happy like a child. It offers a magnificent view over the Thames and city. The service was good as the wheel looks very well and you don't have to wait too long until hop on. I've noticed they are also prepared for those in wheelchairs. The capsule stops when is on top of the wheel so everyone can make photos and enjoy the view, which is great.Nora&Vlad from Romania 🇷🇴"
"Written November 1, 2019",Jack was a winner! ,"We’ve been travelling for 6 weeks - 10 countries planes, trains etc my -  14 yr old is museumed, and castled out and exhausted. Dragged him out of bed for a midday boat tour London eye and arvo walking on the South bank.  Well thanks to Jack - the Ginger ninja he perked up - had a laugh, engaged and enjoyed it.  This is such a great way to get yr bearings in a new city and Jack entertained with a very amusing commentary as we plodded along the Thames - loved the story about marriage proposals that went awfully wrong on the eye-  We then did the London eye with a short queue - again you see so much from that height and it moves at a nice pace for photos and taking in the view.  Finally headed into the 4d theatre ( free with the ticket) which was actually surprisingly very good and set off on foot with the confidence of landmarks from the two tours and finished with street food on the South bank. Great afternoon out on a drizzly, grey London day!  "
"Written November 1, 2019",Pity about the clouds,Really quick and easy process. Great views over London. Plenty space in capsule. Nice amount of time to enjoy views 
"Written November 1, 2019",Do it once anyway!,The purchased tickets for the fast track in advance - which I suggest you do if you want to take in this attraction - otherwise the queue is LONG!  We also had a glass of champagne afterwards (or you can do it before) in the VIP lounge across the way.  The ride up is slow and sometimes you cannot even tell you are moving.  It wasn't very crowded inside so you could easily move about and check out the view from every angle.  It did get a bit boring just watching everyone take selfies and pictures of each other the entire time.  We did get a few good shots - and the attraction takes some photos of you too that you can purchase afterwards.  It was a novelty and we are glad we did it - but I still think the best view of London is absolutely from the Shard.
"Written October 31, 2019",OK but not wonderful,"We got there at 10:00 on a Sunday morning and were able to get book a 10:30 trip. We entered the pod with a minimum amount of queueing  and it was not too full.The trip itself was something of an anticlimax , while you could see many of the sights around London and well beyond if the skies are clear and not too cloudy, the lack of any sort of guidance via and audio guide or  maps meant it was not always obvious what to look for. The 30 minute duration of the trip is just about right as we were all happy enough to leave after half an hour in the pod.Our trip was part of a combined ticket with the Sea Life Centre and Madame Tussauds so it was not too expensive.All in in it was an ok experience rather than a wonderful one,  we all enjoyed the view from the Shard far more when we did that last year as it seemed far more of an event."
"Written October 31, 2019",Go for the 2FOR1 tickets,"Go up at dusk for a night view of London's skyline. No queue on a Friday night either. We walked straight in. A 20 mins or so ride, only worth it if you got a 2FOR1 ticket, available on the Days Out Guide if you travel by trains into London."
"Written October 31, 2019",Great view!,"The London Eye was a pleasant experience. I bought Fast Track which reduced the queues from 3 hours to about 10 minutes.  Once up there it was a nice view of London, all the views gave me a perspective on what it may have looked like in the past and what it looks like now.  With a fast track purchased I feel that it was fun and affordable. If I would not had bought the fast track it would probably have been horrible!  Recommend everyone to do this once, you have done it before maybe it is not very fun!  Everything was fine except the unpleasant staff who scanned the tickets without saying hello or even checking up."

"Written November 12, 2019",London from the Top,I enjoyed my ride on the London eye. The views were incredible. I didn’t care for how pushy some people became with trying to get good photo opts (but that has nothing to do with the ride itself).  Definitely something to do once. 
"Written November 11, 2019",Somewhat enjoyable but overrated!,The London Eye is too expensive for the short ride! We kept getting pushed and shoved by other people and it wasn't the most enjoyable of experiences. Glad we have ticked it off our bucket list but will not be visiting again.

Was able to get some great pics and the bubble we were in was air conditioned for summer. Probably about 15 of us in one bubble, you can stand or there was a bench to sit on. It was a fun experience and would do it again!"

Visiting my niece, and had done the big bus tour, a lot of walking and really wanted to do the eye... so we didIt was a rainy gray day, and we got tix for the 4:15 time slot. Was concerned it would be dreary and dull. Was absolutely wrong. The 30 minute ride provided quite the unique view of London, and the rainy gray complemented it nicely. I got the fast track tix bc we had multiple people and were running all over London all day. They were definitely worth it. However the folks in the standard ticket line moved along very efficiently as well.  Would do again, especially if I could do it in a clear day around sunset"
"Written November 8, 2019",Good eagle’s eye views,This was my third time on the Eye and on a very clear day. The views were good and give you an overview perspective. Bring a map or buy their brochure to get a better idea of what you’re seeing.I felt rushed getting in and off and a little unstable. Staff could be more aware that some people might appreciate a guiding hand. 
"Written November 7, 2019",Great Attraction for Kids,"Our family absolutely loved the Eye of London. I was a little concerned with the price, as it is fairly expensive for a family of five, bit was not disappointed. Would definitely recommend this to other families. The views are outstanding. "

"Written November 27, 2019",WONDERFUL VIEWS OF THE CITY ,What a fun experience! We bought the standard ticket and the line wasn’t too long it moved fast. Would definitely recommend buying the standard over fast track as they both move around the same pace. Over all the experience was fun!
"Written November 27, 2019",Coca Cola London Eye London UK,"London Eye, London, U.K. :- Ride a giant big wheel 135 metres high taking 30 minutes to travel one revolution. The London Eye is situated right at the tourist heart of London, (opposite Big Ben by the River Thames) with commanding views, (25 miles on a good day). Don't worry about helmet. It is not necessary to have a helmet for sitting in Coca Colas London Eye. It’s not essential but most people wear some form of protection such as a sombrero or one of the Busby hats the guards wear. Night view is better than the day.  We were their for two hours. We have also enjoyed cruise tour through river Thames. Very great memoriable experience in the London Eye as well as cruise tour. Very beautiful view of London City is seen through London Eye. We can photograph all the seens. They are also arranging 4D short film for visitors, which is really enjoyable and having great experience. Don't miss this place, when you visit London.

"Written November 25, 2019",Worth the wait,"If the queues are busy, I recommend a fast track ticket. Sure, you pay for it, but it was so worth it. Cut my wait time in half and I could get on my with enjoying my day. You can get lucky or unluckily with the weather in London, so it's best not to schedule and just go on the day with the clearest skies. You'll see why once you get to the top and have this beautiful expansive view down the river and over London. I have been on a few of these 'wheel' things around the world and this is by far the best, purely on where it is located and the view you get of the city. Plus, the rotation is at a nice slow speed so you get a chance for plenty of photographs, but also time to just soak it all in. "
"Written November 24, 2019",The kids loved it,On a trip to London had to go on the London Eye. The children had a lovely time! It was a little foggy so could not see everything as clearly as we would have liked yet still enjoyed the experience. The queue wasn’t too bad considering a Sunday! 
"Written November 24, 2019",London's View....,"You can see London and how beautiful the city is with the river and all the bridges... it is a great location... if you can.. buy the ""fast-track""... I think it's a 5 euros extra... you'll be first in line..."
"Written November 23, 2019",A must do,"Nothing too much to say, as it's really a must do for first time visitors like us. The run was about half hour or so, and we were lucky to have a clear day with a good view over the city. "
"Written November 21, 2019",Most Amazing views,"Fantastic views of the skyline, the Houses of Parliament and the Thames. Moves slowly enough to take everything in "
"Written November 20, 2019",Must visit,It’s an exhilarating experience. An activity one must mist at London. One gets to see the full city. It’s is vey big an Engineering marvel in itself.
"Written November 19, 2019",Great once ,"Although it’s a tourist trap, it is a must do. We waited until the day of to do tickets because we wanted to see what the weather would be like - and if it’s not busy you don’t need the fast track pass "
"Written November 5, 2019","Up, Up in the Air","My husband and I experienced the fast track London Eye ride.  Even though there is a fear of heights, we thought why not we're here.  It was fantastic,breath taking.  Before we knew it the right was over.  Highly recommend this attraction."
"Written November 5, 2019",Average,Just an average tall building without any good view. Parliament was under construction and Big Ben too. Not really much to see
"Written November 5, 2019",Beautiful ,"The London eye offers an amazing view of London. You can see everything from the top, it's a beautiful sight. "
"Written November 5, 2019",A Must Do,This is a must do activity but highly recommend you prebook to avoid the queues. Or go early. Combo tickets save time and money if you are planning to do other stuff. We did the Aquarium and London Dungeons. No need to do all on same day but you certainly could as each place only required a couple of hours. Look for deals on chocolate bars and cereal boxes to save money. Not worth it on a rainy day so check weather forecast.
"Written November 4, 2019",Better than it looks.,My son begged me to go there so I bought him.It was actually a very good experience. The cabin is very big and air conditioned. It lasted around 30 mins and we could see the whole of London. Both my son and myself enjoyed so much!
"Written November 4, 2019",Champagne Experience ,"I purchased tickets for the champagne experience and then paid a bit extra for an additional drink while waiting in the lounge. I suggest paying extra so you’re able to wait in the lounge as opposed to the disorderly lounge outside. ‪A 6:00pm‬ ride was perfect as the sun was just beginning to set. The host was the best and entertaining throughout. The quality of the champagne wasn’t the best in my opinion, but I drunk it since it was paid for. The ride seemed super short. I believe it’s advertised as 30 minutes long…no way! Either way, it was a good experience and I’m glad I did it."
"Written November 4, 2019",Worth while,This is an amazing experience unfortunately the day we did go on was foggy and raining so didn’t experience the full views. But still the experience is good and the 4d cinema is really good.
"Written November 4, 2019",The best view and ride!,Get your tickets on line in order to avoid the long waiting and go for the ride.If you are lucky like us and the weather is nice you will enjoy the scenery od central London from above.Must go!
"Written November 3, 2019",Great Skyline View of London ,"It was raining on our tour day, but we still had a great view of London! This was site was part of Golden Tours and it was amazing! "
"Written November 3, 2019",LME London,"The London eye, River Thames cruise and 4D experience are wonderful experiences in London.  Fast track access is appreciated so that you don't need to wait in the queue.  The guide in the open roof motor boat gave excellent introduction to buildings and infrastructure around as the boat approached each structure including the famous London bridge."
"Written October 17, 2019",Waste of time,The walk across the bridge had more excitement. Sorry I spent so much money to go 10 minutes around. By the time we knew it was over. Tourist trap.
"Written October 17, 2019",Amazing Views!,"After some confusion about having to trade in e tickets for actual tickets, the wait was worth it. The views are incredible! I only wish I could have gone around twice."
"Written October 17, 2019",London Eye - Cantilevered Observation Wheel of Fun and River Cruise Add-On.,"Fascinating view of central London from the London Eye. Be ready for the Coca Cola push since they sponsor the ride. They also want you to get your photo taken TWICE and sell you the souvenir. I could see some might have the fear of getting into the capsule as the wheel generally doesn't stop in the spin, but if needed the operators will stop the wheel to allow those who need time to cross over into the capsule time to get on. The wheel make only one revolution for your ride, unlike traditional ferris wheels that load passengers and then spin several times before ending your ride.The river cruise is very much like all the Thames river trips with commentary of the sights down past Tower Bridge and back up. Be forewarned there are no refreshments available on board. Also if you sit above deck on a rainy day you will get a wet bum. They didn't wipe the seats dry between cruises.A tip for the cruise. Since this one is very similar to other tour companies, most double-decker tour buses in London include a river cruise in their on-off-on bus fare. Save the extra cost of the London Eye combo ticket that includes the river cruise."
"Written October 16, 2019",A bit disappointing,"I've been to London several times and done most of the major sites but hadn't managed the London Eye until now. The views are good. You can see Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament, Buckingham Palace and St. James Park. Otherwise there is so much construction in London right now that you mostly see a lot of cranes. No need to make it a priority."
"Written October 16, 2019",Ok,The London eye experience is neat but not necessarily worth the money. For $30 per ticket I don’t know if it’s worth it. The aquarium was cool though.
"Written October 15, 2019",Wonderful views of London,"We splashed out and had the cupid capsule experience. Our hostess met us in the VIP lounge where drinks are available and escorted us to the capsule.She poured the champagne, orange juice and offered us chocolate truffles from a hamper.The views at the top of the ride are breathtaking.Our hostess Sam made it a memorable experience."
"Written October 15, 2019",London Eye,London Eye interesting. Pretty panoramic views. 4D free movie fun. Not like a cable car that moves around. It is fixed to the Ferris wheel so no motion at all.
"Written October 15, 2019",Great views of london,"There is nothing wrong with this attraction in fact the 4D experience included in your ticket was cute. But for someone who is not too fond of slow moving things the entire ride takes 30 minutes, and you get photos in the eye by an auto photo thing that you can purchase later. I would have preferred to take pictures of the eye from the ground. But if you love vantage points scenery this is your ride! We bought tickets through Big Bus hop on and hop off."
"Written October 15, 2019",Amazing,"It truly is a place worth a visit while you are in London.And don't worry if you do not have prior reservations,the tickets are available at the place and the fast track tickets just get you the ride, maybe 10-20 min faster than the standard tickets."
"Written October 14, 2019",SURPRISED.........,My wife and I both suffer from fear of height and claustrophobia.........don't know what it was but neither of us felt either on the EYE...........it moves so slowly that you feel nothing even when you look down from the top......also because of this you get a great view for taking photos of the city both old and new......from a distance of course........the people working there are both very helpful and friendly ........so if you have a 1/2 hour to kill in London we highly recommend you try the EYE......
"Written October 27, 2019",Wow Great,"London Eye ride was above my expectations, wonderful way to slowly view London skyline and ample time to take photo's"
"Written October 27, 2019",Fantastic view of London,"We realized how beautiful the view could be on a clear, sunny morning.  Surely, the view at dusk would also be very attractive. Great photo opportunity for the city, Westminster buildings  and Thames from up above the skyline.  "
"Written October 25, 2019",A must see,Very iconic site that must be seen for anybody visiting London. Make sure you catch it on a sunny day. The boarding cue takes about 30 minutes so be aware. The ride is pleasant but seating space is limited. The views are nice but not impressive.
"Written October 25, 2019",Not with the money,"Way to expensive, 2 adults and a 6 year old cost £83 then that still ask for donations. Going round on a big wheel shouldn’t be this expensive, don’t waste ur money"

"Written October 22, 2019",Goes high and mighty over London,"It is a remarkable piece of machinery. It seldom stops and you just walk in and out of the hubs while it is on the move. The glass might be a little cleaner, but overall very nice. The only annoying thing was how much they tried to sell you pictures and other accessories. But then again. It is Coca Cola."
"Written October 21, 2019",London Eye at night!,"We did this through Tesco vouchers saving us approx £50!We booked for a Saturday evening, it was fantastic. We arrived 30mins before our time (as advised )there was hardly anyone queuing, fast track people were not on any quicker than us! Bag searched, tickets scanned, we were in a pod 20 mins before our allocated time.Pods normally hold about 20 people, there was about 8 in ours so we had loads of room to move around.What a great view, so much better at night it was quite magical! Would definitely recommend this"
"Written October 29, 2019",A Literal Overview of Central London,We took a spin on the Eye on our first day in London.  We lucked out with no rain and only partly cloudy weather.  We thought it was great to get a sense for how the city is laid out. Views were fantastic. 
"Written October 29, 2019",A fun way to see the city.,We enjoyed the London Eye and the views it afforded all.  You can stand or sit in the middle as it goes around.  We didn't realize we were near the end of the day so wish we had gone earlier as there is a cool park there as well.  There were many people waiting to get on but the employees kept the line moving quickly.
"Written October 29, 2019",Excellent views,Booked tickets with the 2 for 1 via train ticket. Waiting about 20 minutes in total for the attraction. Once of there were excellent views.  Great for all ages. 
"Written October 29, 2019",Views,"The views here are amazing, it gives you such a great feel for London. We rode the eye our first day in London and so glad we did. I purchased my tickets on line, glad I did. There is a fast track ticket option as well, since we went in low season I did not pay extra for that. Glad I didn't as we got on very quickly. We went on a rainy day, but still had amazing views of the Thames and the rest of London. I know this is a touristy thing to do, but you won't be sorry in my opinion if you opt to be a tourist for a day!"
"Written October 29, 2019",Citywide View of London-Pefect for Families and Children,"I wouldn't neccessarily choose to do the London Eye on my own but my 10 year old and 8 year old really wanted to go.  The perfect mix of amusement park and an aerial view of London that made my children say wow.  Definitely buy tickets in advance as that will help with cutting back on time waiting in line-particularly in inclimate weather, and you can plan your day and what you see around going on the London Eye.  Total time on the London Eye was about 30 minutes."
"Written October 29, 2019",Great views,This is an amazing attraction. Do not be worried about the long lines. Pay extra 10# and get fast pass to the head of the line. We were on the ride in 3-4 minuets. The ride last 1/2 hour and continues to move. About 20 per car makes lines go faster. Buy tickets on line to save time. Their wa# plenty of time for photos and you can hardly feel the ride moving. 
"Written October 29, 2019","Great view on a nice, sunny day",The fast track option was definitely worth the additional £10. Great view all around! The only thing that I found disappointing is that I did miss a bit of audio when I was up there so it would have been a bit easier to pinpoint all the sights. A bit more crowd and queue management wouldn't hurt either!
"Written October 28, 2019",Amazing!,We had standard tickets for the London eye and joined the queue on arrival. Amazingly the queue kept moving and we were in the pod within 20 minutes. We thought this was great because it was a very busy Saturday afternoon! If you can spare the time don’t bother with the fast track! The ride lasted around 30 minutes. The only reason I did not give the maximum score was due to the young staff using a mirror to inspect under the seats for any left ’packages’ between customers alighting and boarding. They were not looking at their mirrors and just chatting. maybe just going through the motions?The river cruise was great and very informative thanks to our guide Rupy. Don’t forget the included 4D cinema experience. It only takes 10 mins but is absolutely fantastic. We hope you like having your photo taken because you will have it done a couple of times whilst your there. The best ones are as you go into the 4D cinema where when you come out you can get a nice souvenir book with your photo in starting at £20. We bought one and it’s a nice reminder of a great attraction.
"Written October 28, 2019",Great combination,Loved this activity!  It was easy to get to and definitely not taxing on me since I use a cane.  The boat tour was good with the sites being pointed out with an historical perspective. The London Eye was the absolute best!  After the cruise you get to see the sights from up high and the views are spectacular.
"Written October 28, 2019",Room for improvement ,"We booked online for a timed entry but this meant nothing and you just join the huge queue. My problem was with with how the queues were managed. It was very confusing figuring out where to go. We had to ask several members of staff before we finally got to to the right place and I didn't feel that the staff were particularly helpful. I visited over 10 years ago and I found it less organised this time around. Overall, we enjoyed the views and the experience and would probably visit in the future again. "
"Written October 6, 2019",They Closed Before we Had a Chance to Ride,"We arrived at the Eye a couple of minutes after 6. My husband and my self along with dozens of other people with tickets in hand were turned away. Waste of money, waste of time. We ordered our tickets in advance and it was stated on their website that they closed at 8 not 6."
"Written October 6, 2019",Not bad,Yer it is what it is nice relaxing final they don’t overload the pods. But just watch out for the pics that other people take most of them just jam a phone in your face even if your right at the window
"Written October 6, 2019",Have To Do This Once!,"So we stayed in London for a few days around New Year's Eve this last year. Of course we had to see the London Eye! Bought my tickets online the day before. The FastPass option seemed like a good one because we had seen the lines the day before, and it turned out to be a great idea. Walked past hundreds of folks waiting in line. Couple things to know: The cars don't stop moving (well, rarely they stop but only if a wheelchair or special access person is loading). They're spacious enough to hold 20-some people and not feel crowded. There's a BIG bench right in the middle in case you don't like heights - you can sit there and feel totally safe and not have to stand up. My wife doesn't like heights, but stood up for a while. You can see everything from the bench though for the most part. At some point it'll have you stand in a certain spot to take pictures. Like any attraction, you can claim/purchase that picture down in the gift shop later. The gift shop is crowded as hell, but the picture is worth it. You're there; spend the money."
"Written October 5, 2019",Definitely worth it for the views!!!,The views up there are so worth it!!! The fast track is worth buying instead of standard because if you get normal it is a queue for 30 - 40m wait or fast track for 10 - 15m wait. I would recommend this as a one time thing for tourists!!!
"Written October 5, 2019",❤️ to London,"I think, I left my heart just right here. A perfect spot to capture the best memory while in London :)"
"Written October 5, 2019",Fab!,This is a very fun experience and the views of London were fantastic. We booked fast track tickets to avoid the queues and we walked straight on at our allocated time. The standard ticket queues looked quite long. We also went to the top of the shard and have to say that the London eye was a far better experience in my opinion! 
"Written October 5, 2019","Liked it ok, one time is sufficient","This was a good way to get an overview of London and the surrounding area. We went on a partly cloudy day. I can’t i,Aline it would be a good thing to do in the rain. We went around 4 pm the end of September and the sun was low and in our eyes. Also difficult to take photos as Westminster, Big Ben etc. we’re in the direction of the low sun. I recommend morning time for the best light. Pretty costly."
"Written October 5, 2019",REVIEW,We had a great time worth doing. We unfortunately had an evacuation but that was handled exceptionally well. Our tour guide Lina was just amazing and did a great commentry.
"Written October 4, 2019",Great beautiful site,This is one of the best places to see it's a great way to view all of London.. other than the crowds and trying to navigate thru it it's a must see
"Written October 3, 2019",People are rude!,"We would have enjoyed our experience, but for the people that were in the pod with us.  One couple walked around the pod pushing their way into the primo spot to take constant selfies for the entire ride!  With no consideration for the rest of us that we would like to look out the window at the sites, too!  The other problem was the CHILDREN. I felt like I was on a PLAYGROUND at RECESS!  By the time we reached the top of the ride, the kids had lost all patience and were running around screaming in the pod! I am not exaggerating, it was SO loud! The parents were oblivious to the kids' behavior and offered not discipline. Ruined the experience."
"Written October 3, 2019","Great view,ok experience",We visited london eye but you get almost same view with sky garden or shard. The price is a bit high
"Written October 3, 2019",Great views ,We didn’t pre-book but pretty much walked on.  Queuing was minimal.  Views spectacular and not overcrowded in each pod. Works out at £1 per minute which isn’t cheap.  The 30 mins passed quickly.  I hate heights but at no point did I feel scared (though not keen on the getting on/off a moving pod!). 
"Written October 3, 2019",What a view!,"The London eye was something we knew we would have to do. Two things had us abit worried though, the price and the wait.After finally getting around to doing it, we were happy with both.The tickets worked out to be 30 pound each, which we believe is fairly reasonable.I would recommend sticking with a standard ticket as opposed to the “fast track” tickets for an extra 10 pounds.We honestly found the wait for the tickets was longer than the wait to get onto the eye. In total, I would say we waited for no more than 20 minutes all up. After a quick ticket scan and a bag check you are in the line for the eye. Although normally these kind of security checkpoints are a tad annoying, it is calming to know that some checks are being done. Especially in today’s state.We shared a pod with about 8 other people, so if you aren’t a social butterfly who was hoping to get a pod to themselves, unfortunately that isn’t the case.There are plenty of opportunities to take photographs and the view is simply amazing, as you would expect being 135 meters in the air.As someone who is normally not a huge fan of heights, i found myself a tad anxious early on. However, as the eye ascended and the view kicked in, I found myself not even thinking about how high we were and simply enjoyed what it had to offer. The wheel stops everynow and again to allow people on, however they warn of this as to avoid any confusion in thinking the eye is malfunctioning. The eye has been standing for 19 years now and I think it is safe to say, it is pretty solid and isn’t blowing over anytime soon!There is a quick attempt at another cash grab at the end as they take a picture of you inside the pod. An attempt to up sell the picture to you at the end is the only thing that had us rolling our eyes.All in all, everything is worth it the moment you hit the top of the eye and see London in all its glory. What a view!"
"Written October 3, 2019","Coca-Cola London Eye,London,United Kingdom ","One of the best places to be in London. Coca-Cola London Eye is one of the best landmarks in the world to say the least.

"Written October 3, 2019",Nice views,"This experience is quite expensive for what it actually is. The views were definitely amazing, but your overall experience will depend on who you are in the “pod” with. There were about 10 people (give or take) in our pod, and unfortunately there were some very rude individuals who wanted to take over the best viewing/ photo spots in the pod for themselves for the whole ride. Very irritating. It was nice to get a chance to see London from this perspective though."
"Written October 3, 2019",Good thing to enjoy,If you are planning to visit use day out pass 2 for 1 and buy ticket at London eye.It is worth in that priceYou get 15min ride and can take view of whole London.Overall good experience shall recommendArea around it is also good.
"Written October 2, 2019",the view from above,the stunning view 360 degrees of London is the one of the better experiences of the visit. i have always wanted a skyview and the pictures were perfect.
"Written October 2, 2019",Good Family Fun,"The Eye felt a bit cheesy to me at first but the rest of the family wanted to go and at the end, I changed my mind.  It's an amazing view of the city and sights from above (except for Tower Bridge that's around the corner out of view!)  Good photo ops and not as scary as you might fear in the totally enclosed cabs.   Lines move quickly."
"Written October 2, 2019",Great attraction!,"I visited the London eye with my mum, daughter , auntie and cousin whilst visiting London for a function and decided to go on. The attraction was great we didnt have to que for very long and we were on, some great sights to be seen. Definitely worth a look away from the hustle and bustle of bustle london! Worth the money 😁👍"
"Written October 14, 2019",Great views,Once we got over the high price we decided to go for it.  The pods are roomy with places to sit if wanted.  They don’t add too many people on each pod so you can move around.  The views are amazing.  You can see for miles.  We really enjoyed the experience.  A short 4D video is available for viewing which is included in the price of your ticket.

It doesn't move too fast, allowing us to get great pictures. We opted to not buy ""skip the line"" tickets but the line moved really fast. "
"Written October 13, 2019",Well worth doing,"The London Eye is clearly a must do attraction. We went on a clear morning and bought a ticket which allowed timed entry so that we didn’t have to stand in a queue for very long. While we had great views of Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament, there was a group of tourists who were very loud and not very considerate of others in that they hogged the views a bit."
"Written October 13, 2019","Wet, miserable, not inspiring.","Visited with family who booked this as a treat for me during my London trip. Tickets were pre booked which reduced the queue time to around 20 minutes.  There was a good view of the capital in spite of the weather but it didn't have that wow factor. The trip lasted around 30 minutes. Not sure how much the tickets were, but I was not over impressed. I could have found a similar view from a roof top restaurant in the city & enjoyed it much more. Alternatively a cruise up the Thames would have been more enjoyable & just as informative. It's a novelty strictly for tourists..."

"Written October 10, 2019",Great view!,I purchased the standard ticket online and upgraded for £10 in person.  I was through the line in less than 5 minutes.  The eye moved slowly and made it appear as you never left the ground.   This gave ample time to view all the sights in all directions.   It gave me a great perspective of how big the builds are and how close things really are. I would recommend it
"Written October 10, 2019",Tourist trip,"Just a must do, any family from abroad, see all the landmarks in one go! The 4D is a fun thing so make sure you visit that as its part of the ticket. "
"Written October 9, 2019",Nice to visit,"I felt that it wasn't as exciting as everyone makes it out to be. Only my opinion mind you. It was nice and a great view. Good to do once. I wouldn't do it again. It was part of a tour, but a bit pricey to do on your own. Getting off this was a bit tricky as the floor still moves, although very slowly, it still moves and I was not warned a head of time. "
"Written October 9, 2019",London eye,"We prebooked standard tickets through a deal to get a discount, this included the 4D experience which is a short film and photo opportunity and we enjoyed it. The ticket said to be in queue half hour before the allotted time and it did take a bit longer to get through but it went down quite quickly really. The experience is good, the views nice and the pods large enough that you can walk to each side for different views. It moves slow enough that you almost don't know it's moving."
"Written October 9, 2019",Wonderful views,Great views of the city - bring out the camera!One thing if you get the champagne experience make sure you check the hours.  We had access to the bar for champagne but when we got up there immediately after the London Eye and were told they were closed despite it being full and someone had gotten served immediately in front of us.
"Written October 9, 2019",Brilliant,We didn’t know what we were going to do today but caught river catamaran cruise to the London eye purchased out tickets and went on board. It takes approximately 30 mins to do the complete circle. We had a 360 degree view of London it was amazing to be able to see the city like that. Being the first time ever in London it was a treat to see it and it wasn’t raining that was good. When we got off we went in and saw the 4D presentation of the eye and enjoyed that as well.
"Written October 9, 2019",An eye opener,If you want to see London then you have to do the London Eye.We did not fast track our tickets but also did not stand too long in a ques.
"Written October 13, 2019",Very good,"I won’t make this a long review!I visited as part of a 5 strong family group. The ride was clean, easy to get on and gave fantastic views over London.We were lucky as it was dry and clear when we went. If you have a dry day I would definitely recommend this attraction. I was lucky to find a 2 for 1 offer on the tickets, otherwise I would say it’s a little pricey, but a must do if visiting London. Also, the 4D cinema included in the ticket is well worth doing. "
"Written October 12, 2019",Fantastic!,"The London Eye is great! They keep it nice and tidey. If you are on a schedule like we were, definitely invest in the Fast Track. It was well worth it. We really enjoyed the sights and the Eye itself. "
"Written October 12, 2019",Not the easiest ticket to ride!!,"Booked for 3 of us on the London Eye today. We had a visitor from Australia with us so wanted to impress. The journey in the pod was good once you were on the eye. Getting  onto it is another matter! I booked their standard tickets with a known boarding time of 15.30. We arrived early and realised that the time you are allocated is meaningless when it’s busy. (It was busy!). You just have to join the back of the queue and snake around for 45 minutes before you reach the front.  So if you plan to go on this ride, book a fast track ticket which costs more and lets you jump the queue. Otherwise be prepared to wait and wait and wait!....."
"Written October 12, 2019",Greta Sunset Ride,"We arrived in London late in the day on a Saturday.  We were staying at the nearby Park Plaza (walking distance).  We wanted to ride the Eye, but couldn't be certain our flight would arrive at the scheduled time.  So we splurged in advance and bought Flexi Fast Track tickets online.  These tickets allow you to get in the Fast Track queue at any time during the designated day.  Shortly after we settled in at our hotel, we went out to eat confident that our place in the queue was waiting for us.  When we arrived at the Eye, the queues to buy tickets and to board with standard admission were very long.  However, the Fast Track queue was minuscule by comparison.  We waited maybe 10 minutes. What a great ride.  The sky was clear, and the setting sun was beautiful.  The views in every direction were fabulous.  We were glad we extra for Flexi."
"Written October 9, 2019","Good fun, close to other main attractions","The London Eye is a fun place to visit, close to other main attractions like the London Aquarium, Big Ben, it’s a tick off the list kind of place, and however, if you’re undecided between visiting this and The Shard, I’d recommend The Shard! The London Eye is busy and confusing, lines are long and it’s fast paced getting on and off! The ride never stops, you’re walking on as the carriage is moving around. The views are OK, however not as impressive as from The Shard. The ride takes about 30 mins and once that’s over you’re off. The surrounding area is lovely to walk around and great if the sun is shining, I’d aim for an earlier or later visit as the middle of the day is extremely busy, especially the walk over the bridge which is virtually impossible to cross."

"Written October 8, 2019",Trip with friend ,"Have to say I was disappointed with the 30 min London Eye ride. We were on a limited time scale before going to the theatre so paid for fast track tickets at £37 each rather than £27 for routine ticket. There is nothing  to help you identify the building/skyline you are looking at from the eye. Would have got so much more out of the trip if you could have audio info helping to identify landmarks. So even for a fairly local person I really didn't know what I was looking at apart from Buckingham palace,  shard,  houses of parliament,  st pauls etc. So tourists must be completely list! I found out afterwards there is an app you can download which may assist with this Definitely wasn't worth £37 and not even worth £27!!"
"Written October 8, 2019",Worth it,"Even with my horror, the trip was definitely to recommend. The weather was not the best and all the construction clearly destroys a little. The pictures are a bit expensive, and you have little time to settle before suddenly being photographed"
"Written October 8, 2019",This thing goes high.,It didn't take long to get on to the eye and the 30 minutes you spend going around are well worth it.  It gives you an excellent view of the city of London.  I got a little vertigo at the top but I felt safe the whole time.
"Written October 8, 2019",Amazing!,After coming to London a couple of times every year we finally decided to go on the London Eye and what an amazing experience it was. We had the standard tickets (bought with Tesco clubcard points) for which the queue was huge but to be fair it moved quickly and we were on within 30 minutes. The views are incredible  especially when you reach the top. Well worth the wait in the queue.
"Written October 7, 2019",Fairly dull,"Hard to believe this is a # 1 attraction in London.   There is so very little to it--take a slow elevator (essentially) to the top of a ferris wheel and go back down very slowly.London is not a particularly beautiful city and, with its almost consistently overcast days, the view is insipid."
"Written October 7, 2019",Great views over London,"We traveled off season so could plan and buy a ticket on the best weather day. Capsules move slowly and not many passengers are allocated per capsule, so you can move around freely and take great photos!"
"Written October 7, 2019",Awesome view of the city!!,"Lovely! Lovely!! Thank God I got the fast track ticket and didn't have to stay on the long queue, cause it rained that day. You get such a lovely of the city, perfect for photos. The 4D cinema was also very cool...overall a great experience and would recommend it to visitors. "
"Written October 6, 2019",Lovely way to see london ,Took some friends from abroad around London. Booked the eye as part of a package with city river cruise. We went in September when kids were back to school so it wasn’t busy. It was around 12:30pm when we got to the eye and it was pretty quiet and there was hardly any queue.My friends enjoyed the experience and it’s a great was to see London. 
"Written October 21, 2019",Eyeing the city ,Went on a tour with my older Brother’s and we were dropped off at the London eye. This was part of our trip so why not finish it over looking some of the beautiful sites. It took 45 minutes to go completely around and you could take some nice pictures. This is pretty good for all ages! 
"Written October 21, 2019",Cool,"So the london eye is cool, but to get this 2for1 discount is a nightmare...first you need to have train tickets, that easy. But then you need to have this voucher..Ok, lets get it online you think. Yes you can, but its useless, they need a paper one and guess where you will get that? Yes, not in the office by london eye, but you have to move to the train station to  get the paper version...how ecological..."
"Written October 21, 2019",Pods are quite crowded than before ,We went on a Sunday during Easter holidays and it was busy as expected. I’ve been on it 3 times over 20 years and before it never used to be packed inside the pods. It’s hard to get a decent picture without someone trying to steal your place. Views are good overlooking London and the service to buy tickets was easy.
"Written October 20, 2019",Welcome to London,We took this tour on our 1st day in London for the first time ever in the city. It was very nice and a great way to get an overview of London. I felt like I was being welcomed to London. The champagne made it that much more pleasurable. A great way to start our vacation.
"Written October 19, 2019",Just ok,"Nice attraction, good view of the city. it's too expensive ( 27 pound) and they bring into the cabin too much people ( there is a little bench to sit) and if the rest of people are standing near the windows the people who are sitting cannot see anything. "
"Written October 19, 2019",Good visit ,"This was one of the boxes we wanted to tick while in London a fortnight ago. When we arrived, the queue was enormous (a busy Saturday afternoon and lovely weather) and we honestly came very close to walking. When we asked a staff member how long the wait was, anticipating it would be hours, we were surprised to learn the estimated time would be around thirty minutes. We are glad we asked. The 4D cinema prior to going on “The Eye” was fun and the rotation of the eye, although fairly short in duration, was fantastic and offered great views of key locations within the capital including (to mention but a few) the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and Big Ben etc. Fortunately we were able to get discounted tickets by printing out vouchers prior to coming and showing our rail passes otherwise it would have been wife heavy on the wallet. I’d recommend anyone visiting in advance to try and get these before going. "
"Written October 19, 2019",London Eye,"Awesome experience, but not for the faint of heart! Great views of the city and Thames River. Guide said the Eye has 32 pods for the 32 boroughs of London."
"Written October 18, 2019",Great Tour! ,"We really enjoyed this tour, it was just the right length (not too long) and we got to see several landmarks. Our tour guide Vicki had a ton of informative facts and her sense of bumper was awesome! Definitely started the day off right and got some great pictures too! "

"Written October 1, 2019",Gimmick and Waste of Money,This was a waste of money and tourist trap.  The only good view is of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower/Big Ben (which is under construction at the moment).  No discount on tickets if you have a London Pass or other discount attraction card.  Take a picture of the London Eye from the outside and save your money.

"Written October 1, 2019",Great view,"Great view. We got the trip included with other attractions, and there was no line. So we got on right away. Was nice weather so all good "
"Written September 30, 2019",Lots of ways to experience the London Eye,"We simply chose a standard ticket, but you can go more elaborate if you wish. It was fun to move around the pod and admire the views after a 3 D with glasses experience. It may be a bit of a tourist trap to go for the photos which we could not resist. I thought I might be queasy during the ride but was not at all. Buying tickets online might be a better bargain, but you can assess weather/visibility if you buy tickets at the time you are going.great panoramic views."
"Written September 30, 2019",Totally worth the visit!,"London Eye offers a fantastic view of the city from a considerable height, Sea Life is a never boring classic for kids and Madame Tussauds has managed to be renewed from the historical wax statues only to become a proper fun show for all ages and a real highlight of the trip! All definitely recommended!"

"Written September 22, 2019","Great views, great experience ","Living in Las Vegas we’ve been on the High Roller and now on vacation in London we decided that we needed to experience the Coca-Cola London Eye since it’s the original. It’s noted that the High Roller is 100 feet taller, but we were hard pressed to believe it. The difference is the High Roller, the capsules that you ride in move around the outside whereas the London Eye the hole thing rotates as you enjoy beautiful sites of the city right on the river. We rode it at dusk which made it even more intriguing and the views with the sunset at hand were magnificent. In our opinion, it was much more fun, but we’re not taking away the fun had on the High Roller in Vegas. Relaxing to say the least, you can see Big Bend although it has scaffolding all around it as it’s being refurbished. A must do if your in London. Great for solo travelers, couples and families. "
"Written September 22, 2019",First Time In Capital City,"So I have reached 50 and never visited our capital!First attraction had to be London Eye (I refuse to call it the Coca Cola Eye) and I must say it was really good!.For a temporary attraction built to celebrate the Millennium and last about 3 years the whole structure looks very well maintained and looked after for something that’s almost 20 years old. Lovely panoramic views of the river and major landmarks including St Paul’s, Houses Of Parliament and Big Ben, Buck House In the distance and the Thames itself. You could do yourself a big favour by catching the train into the city and downloading a 2 for 1 voucher from the National Rail website. Hand over the voucher with your train tickets and it works out half price. You can still book a time slot and even though the voucher says otherwise you can still pay the upgrade to fast track tickets if the standard line looks a little long (it was for us on a beautiful sunny late September day, we needed to cram a lot in and a 2nr plus waiting time was worth the extra tenner to skip it). Is it a must do attraction? Yeah probably, is it expensive for what you get?, yes if you pay full price at about a pound a minute!  Would I do it again?, yes but maybe not for a few years. "
"Written September 22, 2019","Love the view, hate coca name",I do love the views from the London Eye. And the engineering is amazing. Truly hate the commercial prefix to the name ugh.
"Written September 22, 2019",Brilliant,"Had visitors down from the North and took them and their children on the London eye, first time for them (umpteenth time for me) and they loved it. Thankfully it was a beautiful day, sun was shining and we could see all of London. Kids loved it. One of our friends children is disabled in a wheelchair and we were very well looked after and given a free fast track pass. Highly recommend for excellent service."
"Written September 22, 2019",Buy tickets a head of time,"For our first time in London, taking a ride on the London Eye was a must. The experience was as expected and there were of course great views. We do recommend buying your tickets ahead of time so you don’t have to wait in the ticket line and the line to actuality board the Eye. "
"Written September 21, 2019",Great View,"We went on a weekday afternoon. The fast track meant we almost immediately got seats in a gondola. Standard pass would have meant about 20 minutes wait, I think. The day was cloudy but clear, so the view was really great. There was enough space in the gondola to move around, and take photos. The entry into and exit from the gondola has to be done while it is moving, even though very slowly. My 85 year old Dad had no probems with it. A great experience, which my Dad thoroughly enjoyed."
"Written September 21, 2019",Super tall ride,Absolutely the best view in London! The lines were long but moved rapidly. Not for one that is afraid of heights.
"Written September 21, 2019",Worth the wait,"Worth the wait for a once in a lifetime experience.My at the time, 6yr old son thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Queue time was quite minimal on our visit.Stepping on and off whilst wheel was turning was a bit daunting but they do stop the wheel to allow for disabled and elderly access.Views were amazing."
"Written September 29, 2019",Stunning,"This lived up to our expectations. Memories to last us a lifetime. 🥰All the staff were fantastic. On the ball, friendly and even after rolling up with a small suitcase due to visiting before our hotel check in, they were friendly, fast and efficient through security. 10/10 🙌🏼 "
"Written September 29, 2019",A great time,The line went very quickly. It was very organized.the views were amazing. Great place to take pictures. My sister has vertigo and because the ride moves slowly there was no trouble.
"Written September 29, 2019",Not great,The only good thing about this is the fast track get to move up front in-line. But really the whole London eye is overrated. Of course most people want to do it but you can get the same view walking by the Thames it taking a boat sight seeing cruise. So really think about if it’s worth the money and your time.
"Written September 29, 2019",Not worth the wait,"Everyone seems to include the London Eye on the list of must-do things in London, but we were waiting for our tour right under it and decided it wasn't work the hefty price.  It's a very slow moving ferris wheel with great views, but there are other places to get views without wasting hours waiting in line and going so slowly around.  I suppose for the ""selfie"" crowd it's worth it to get a selfie with London in the background, but there was too much to see and do for us to spend time with this."
"Written September 28, 2019",A super cool experience.,The London eye was a cool way to get a bird’s eye view of London. My only issue with the experience is that it takes a fairly long time to get to the top and it seemed to take even longer to get back down. I’d still do it again though.
"Written September 28, 2019",Overhyped but one must check it off the list ,"Don't buy the fast track tickets if going on a weekday. The queue moves along pretty fast and the average waiting time is ~15 min which I feel isn't worth shelling out extra money for! The view is great but nothing extraordinary. If it wasn't for the houses of parliament and the Elizabeth tower, London skyline would look the same. "
"Written September 27, 2019",A Must when in London!,"First of all this area is crazy! tons of people trying to go for a ride, if you are like me and preffer to skip these buy the champagne experience, you can schedule a time and they take you right in. Plus you get to enjoy this amazing experience with a glass of champagne!!!"
"Written September 27, 2019",Don't forget to book your time.,"We had a voucher for a visit and checked 2 days earlier if we needed to book. Assured that we just rock up, we did on the assigned day, only to be told we then had to book. At the booking desk I was informed that i could have booked when we came 2 days earlier. was not impressed. As it was a clear day, the views were impressive. Being school holidays, it was quite cramped in the capsule. If I had to chose between The Eye and Westminster Tour, I'd chose the tour for the better viewing."
"Written September 26, 2019",Amazing!! ,Thank you to Jack and the crew on the London Thames cruise! The experience was amazing! This is definitely a not to miss attraction. 
"Written September 26, 2019",Nice but too slow,"Nice view, but it was too slow. I prefer The view from The Shard or the SKY Garden. It is also expensive.   "
"Written September 25, 2019",Expensive and busy,We went on the london eye in summer and the line was extremely busy to buy the tickets and then to go on the ferris wheel 
"Written September 25, 2019",Fun but iberpriced,"Always book ahead, if you arrive late you won’t be let on.  The views are great and the service is reasonable... but if you have slow moving people in from of you it makes you anxious that you won’t get in/out in time."
"Written September 25, 2019",Great view ,"Interesting experience considering that we experienced thunder and lightning at the top of the Eye.  Would have been better with clear weather, but still some great views."
"Written September 24, 2019",Beautiful views ,I know it's suck a tourist thing to do but I love the views. Going around 7pm is a great time. Just at sunset. 
"Written September 24, 2019",A great view of London,"We'd booked online but joined the standard queue as we didn't pay the extra for fast track. Initially the queue looked quite lengthy but it moved well (they load up to 28 people in each capsule) and we were on within about 30 minutes.The pods have a reasonable amount of space so it is possible to move around. The movement is smooth and not at all scary - unless you are seriously scared of heights. Obviously the view does depend a little on the weather conditions, but on a good day you do get the opportunity to see most of the main London landmarks.Make sure you do the (free) 4D experience too - it is tucked away in the same building as the ticket office. It is not earth shattering, but it is a nice intro.Be warned though, this is a Merlin attraction so they will take your photos at various opportunities to sell to you later on. But they don't put any pressure on you and you can choose not to have your photo taken."
"Written September 24, 2019",Daddy daughter day 6yrs old ,This is definitely something you have to do when in london The 1st impression is wow it's a huge wheel and it looks scary and I'm not 1 for heights but when you get into the capsule type of cabin its class very safe and the funny part is and yes hard to believe its moving all the time the cabin doesn't move only the wheel which is class my 6yr daughter was very scared at 1st but after a few mins she was like me relaxed as u wouldn't know your moving

After walking around for 4 days seeing all the sights we went up in the London Eye and saw everything from up top it was so cool too see. You can move around and take all sorts of pictures. It is amazing how much you can see. You are also invited for free to watch a 4D movie about the London Eye. Very fun I highly recommend it if you are going to London don’t miss it. 
"Written September 23, 2019",Can’t pick your fellow travellers on the capsule ,Went on the London Eye with the family. It was Ok - nothing to get too excited over. We were in a capsule with rowdy German men who thought they were the only ones in the capsule. They hogged the prime viewing spots and were loud and making jokes amongst themselves. Was pleased when we were able to get off...

We waited in a lovely bar/lounge area before boarding, only one other couple was in our pod along with a tour host.  She poured our glass of champagne and then when we reached the top point she explained all the landmarks around us and offered to take any pictures with our phones we wanted.  It was a very pleasant uncrowded half hour ride.  Well worth the extra money."
"Written September 15, 2019",Fantastic!! ,"We were on a theatre break in London and decided to do some sightseeing. We were amazed by the sights on the London Eye. We booked our tickets on the website the night before which was incredibly simple. I was concerned with the length of the queue upon arrival but it was quick to go down and was constantly moving. We combined with the London Eye River Cruise. We paid £33pp which I felt was great value for money. It was a fabulous experience on the cruise. Jeannie was our commentary guide. She was very comical and made the trip very enjoyable yet informative. I would love to go on the London Eye again we were so lucky with the weather, we could see for miles and miles. "

Its on the expensive side - however worth the money.The commercial part of it - selling you photos before and after in the london eye sometime can be annoyong however its a ritual everywhere you go. Recommended visit for all - though its NOT cheap we enjoyed thoroughly

"Written September 7, 2019",Best view in town!,"My husband and I were looking forward to going on this attraction and weren't disappointed.  The views were incredible and could be seen from all angles.  You are free to walk around the pod and there are seats if you wish to sit down.  Even though you are in the pod for about half an hour in total, it seemed to go by a lot quicker.  I took  a lot of photos of all that I saw.  We visited London at a very busy time so there was a big queue.  However, it didn't take long for it to move and was worth the wait."
"Written September 7, 2019",Cool - but not a necessity to do,"This was one of our first stops when in London. It is a cool ride and the views are very good. However, it is pricey and crowded. Low rating is due to the fact that they did NOT do a good cleaning the glass - the best view spots were dirty and scunggy. Since this ride is mostly about the views, that was disappointing.Would recommend the tickets that get you to the front of the line quicker - it’s worth it. "
"Written September 7, 2019",Waste of time and money,"Sorry, I do not understand why people are willing to queue for a long time to get there. A waste of time and money, unless you go with a group of friends and have lunch or drink/ s on the way."
"Written September 20, 2019","Good view, long wait!!","Admittedly it was summer and the end of school holidays when we  visited so you have to expect it to be busy so keep this in mind if you are planning to do other activities in the day. All up it was about 4hrs from buying our ticket to when we boarded the capsule/pod. There was a lot of time standing in lines but it was very organised. The view is great all the way up the Thames, over to Buckingham palace and if course big Ben. It is not crowded and plenty of room to move around and see different views. A round trip takes about 25-30minutes. This was an unexpected stopover in London so would recommend buying tickets online to save time. "

"Written September 20, 2019",The Queue was long but was worth the wait.,"A trip to London includes many ""must-see"" attractions and the ""eye"" is certainly in the top ten!! This is a memorable experience no matter your age, background or interests. From the moment you catch a glimpse of the magnificent wheel, your anticipation rises as you approach. Check-in and boarding are efficient because the wheel never stops! It continues to move at a very slow pace as riders continually embark and disembark. The entire ""ride"" takes less than 30 minutes. The views at the top of the wheel (at over 135 meters) are nearly beyond description, as you are gazing 360 degrees from a vantage point directly above the Thames River, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and the Ministry of Defence."
"Written September 19, 2019",The Views Over London Make For A Great Experience,A fun experience with 30 minute rotation allowing one to see London from all points of the compass. The movie included is a very entertaining intro to the Eye.
"Written September 19, 2019",Fun ride,We rode the Eye one evening. We had the fast track tickets and literally walked on immediately. We got our tickets online which made getting very easy. It’s a 30 min ride. We did it at sunset. Beautiful view of London and the Thames.
"Written September 19, 2019",Wow,Bought tickets so we didn’t have to que. pleased we did! Overall great experience have to do it at least once while your there. 
"Written September 19, 2019",Worth Going!,"London eye was fun. I took fast track ticket, which made the experience easy and fast. The normal line was way too long. I would suggest to go for fast track to save on time and long queue. The giant wheel takes about 30 minutes to complete a round and is very slow so you can click photos. The Pod doesn’t stop while entering or leaving so be mindful. They are spacious and not crowded. There is place to sit, can walk around and comfortably have a look at the London skyline. You get to see Big Ben,  House of Parliament, tower bridge Buckingham Palace, Of course Thames river and few more. In total worth going. Staffing is good. There is also 4d show which is included in the ticket so you don’t have to pay extra. Also there’s a park close by. Kids will love it. Uploading few pics. "
"Written September 18, 2019",Worth it,The views you get from here are just awesome. Flexi pass is worth it. We didn’t have to wait in line at all. 
"Written September 11, 2019",VIP pod,Went as part of a work trip.  Didn’t actually experience the lounge with the rest of my party but looked and seemed absolutely fine as a pre drink.The eye is a great way to see the landmarks of the city either privately or in a pod with strangers.
"Written September 11, 2019",My London Eye Ride,"Being on the London Eye is really fun, but I was just wondering, why can’t there be some cafes around London Eye? The place looks so dull, apart from two very small cafes, there’s absolutely nothing to match this great landmark."
"Written September 11, 2019",Gorgeous but pricey!,"Absolutely lovely, highly recommend going at sunset, but very expensive for such a short experience."
"Written September 11, 2019",Great Views,The London Eye is worth the time.  Just make sure you buys tickets in advance. With tickets in hand you bypass the lines which can be very long.
"Written September 2, 2019",great ride,stunning view of London. It was great visibility. The line up wasn't more than 20 minutes. Very cool experience.
"Written September 2, 2019",Spoilt by a few,"So, I think I can safely say it is a must do attraction. Although it is very expensive jury is out if it is worth it, on this occasion it wasnt.When we got on, we were obviously the least experienced riders on there as there was a huge hustle to get to the front of the pod.  We just calmly got on and stood patiently.  It set off 5 minutes later we were at a decent height with a few gasps and wows coming from the front. Could we see anything I hear you say. To our disappointment I have to say no unless of course you count looking at the phone with your arm stretched above your head above the window huggers!It was a total let down purely down to the selfishness of others.  Maybe of course they paid extra to stick to the window.London eye you charge enough, you need to manage this better. In fact the money I paid I think I own one of the pods now, maybe like a Spanish timeshare.  I will have to see when I am allowed to visit again as part of my ownership but this time I wont be letting others on.If you go, fight for the front, but when you have seen all you want please step aside for others!Dont forget the mortgage for the tickets!"
"Written September 11, 2019",Gorgeous views,"We have done the one in Singapore, but this was just as amazing with the views.Wasn’t too busy for line ups, depending on time, only waited 15mins. Can get it as a deal with 2 or 3 other attractions. Definitely worth it. "
"Written September 10, 2019",Eye and cruise,We had short window of time to do both but the ticket agent called the eye staff and they said the line was moving fast enough so we could do both.Each ride is worth the time.The eye takes about 10 to complete and on and off is easy.They can stop it if there is a person who moves more slowly.The river ride was very informative and you can walk back along the shore way to see up close various place.We went back to The Anchor for lunch and the Globe theater for pics. The distance took about 30'
"Written September 10, 2019",Amazing view at sunset ,We booked out ticket as part of the buy 2 or 3 for a better price.  Well worth the saving.   Chose a time slot at sunset and hoped for the best and we ended up at the top of the wheel as the sun set.  Such a great view 
"Written September 10, 2019",London must see’s!!,Beautiful views of the city of london and river thames! We went in summer but before UK schools closed. We visited around 10 am on a weekday and it was not very crowded! If you have young children like mine aged 8 to 14 years its a must see! Anyone in a group scared of heights can still come along and try it...if they still can't stomach it they can sit in the middle of one of the cabins and just close their eyes! Afterwards saw sea of life and madame tussauds. The latter needs prebooking for specific time and it was so worth it!!
"Written September 10, 2019",Such a fun experience,"Lovely calm quiet ride giving you exceptional views of London, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, The Shard, Buckingham Palace, The Tower and obviously the Thames River to name a few. The ride runs very slowly so you can really take in all the views. We fast tracked the line so the wait wasn't bad at all. Maybe 5 minutes."
"Written September 10, 2019",The view is amazing ,I bought the ticket  with  5 attractions one of those was the eye.You can book a hour to comeThe ticket with that pass is much more chipper than if you buy it alone The ride is about 30 minutes total once you get on the weal
"Written September 1, 2019",Visit if you have extra time.,"Visited the London Eye middle of August-2019.   We went there just before 9 PM hoping to see London in the dark, but it got dark only after 9:30 PM and our ride was done by then.     Good thing about this ride in late evenings is that, the lines move really fast.  We had about 500+ people in front of us when we arrived at the bottom of ride around 8:30 but the line moved really fast and were inside the london eye capsule before 9:00 PM and done with the ride by 9:20 PM.  So the ride takes about 20 minutes.  Had a nice view of river Thames, Westminister Abbey and a few landmarks but nothing spectacular.  It is an okay ride.  Do it if you dont have anything else to do and visited all the more important landmarks or the Kids really want to do it."
"Written September 1, 2019",Worth it!,Buy the fast track ticket for this. We didn’t even wait at all. It was an usually warm and sunny day. Great for pics. It’s a 1/2 hour for one revolution. 25 people to a pod which still leaves enough room to move around and take pics. Definitely an attraction to take in while in London especially on a nice day. Plenty of eateries around for a quick bite. 
"Written September 1, 2019",Nice to do but overpriced ,"Title says it all.I pre booked tickets, you still have to queue but it wasn't long before we were on.You get good views but it is overpriced for what you get.It's just a slow big wheel. But because it's on the list of things to do in London, people will visit and pay for the privilege of a 30min flight."
"Written September 1, 2019",Not bad but nothing special either!,"For the last weekend of school holidays I would say we might have been fortunate with the queue, arrived at 11am and only had to wait for 15 minutes to board the capsule. Once inside and going round as it was a nice clear day the view was clear and got better the higher you climbed. If there was a gripe it was that the glass was quite dirty which did show when taking pictures. All in all it was a decent attraction at a slightly high price.One tip is not to order the binoculars as they really are naff and about as much use as a chocolate fire guard, certainly overpriced."
"Written September 1, 2019",Expensive for what it is,"It's iconic so we had to do it but it was a let down and there are many other ways to get a view over London. We were there at a quiet time but were persuaded to select the more expensive ticket for the ""fast track"". That turned out to be unnecessary and I was sure we were in the wrong line but was assured we were not. The experience is underwhelming and the pod we were in looked as if the ""glass"" needed cleaning. Luckily we had no children in our group--I was dreading that possibility as we stood in line with squealing kids. Lining up on a hot day might prove unpleasant. All considered, we got in quickly but it was a big disappointment. If I'd had to wait for any time, I'd have been even more disappointed. I enjoyed the view from the top of St Paul's much more and even some of the bridges give great views of the city."
"Written September 1, 2019",A dream come true,"the cue was long but it is worth the wait.Breath taking view, it was a very nice experience. looking forward to comeback soon. ♥"
"Written August 31, 2019",Great value and experience,So glad we did both. Our guide on the boat trip was Mickey and he did a fabulous job.  Nice to see the major sights from a different viewpoint. We felt it was just the right length. Enjoyed the ride on the London Eye as well.
"Written August 31, 2019",Great views of the river and city,"This was my first visit to London and felt that this was a must do. We were not disappointed. The line was not bad, it was a beautiful day and the views from the capsule where great. The capsule is quite spacious so you can walk around at your leisure, plus there is a very good size all-around bench in the middle if you prefer to sit. Glad we did it."
"Written September 15, 2019",Beautiful 360 view,Amazing view up there in a clear blue sky. Ground staffs are extremely friendly and helpful while the 4D experience is amazing
"Written September 15, 2019",If youcan stand the crowds and line to get on it delivers on the view,"The London Eye is located in an area along the Thames that has several tourists locations altogether, so just walking on the sidewalks is packed and a bit tiresome. If you don't mind crowds or lines then the view from the Eye is definitely exhilarating."
"Written September 14, 2019",A Beautiful View! Amazing Ride!,"We did the Champagne Experience, and it was amazing! We loved it, the sights are brilliant, and the tour guide was so friendly, helpful and really nice! I can't remember his name but he was a bit funny at times too. Wonderful experience which should be enjoyed by anyone visiting London!"
"Written September 14, 2019",A challenge for an adult with sensory issues but 3 attractions in 1 ticket is good value for money.,"As someone who has sensory difficulties, I spent most of my time trying to avoid large groups. Visit to sea life centre was ok, got freaked out by the jellyfish so was slightly disappointed to end the tour on that. There were plenty of fish to look at however the tour route went passed the same tank a few times.I added the london eye because I hadn’t been on it for a while. I like looking at London’s sky line. However, although the queuing was easy, I think that too many people were allowed in the capsule. This increased my anxiety, particularly with the noise levels. I thought I would have been ok at 5pm.So if you’re like me who finds noise levels difficult, I would probably advise to go in off peak times to avoid large crowds and bring headphones. I look forward to visiting Madame Tussaud’s next weekend. Also I think 3 attractions for £50 is worth it, particularly if you like variety."
"Written September 13, 2019",Views,Go early. It opens at 11am and we got on the first car. The views are awesome. It is a bit pricey for the fast pass but worth it because you can walk straight on at most times
"Written September 13, 2019",Fun,"We stayed in London for a day, and this tour pretty much gave us the overview of London. I like the river took us to see the William Shakespeare theater. We rode the boat and right after we took the London Eye. Great views, and you get to snap a cute pic at the end. This location is the prime tourist attraction."
"Written September 13, 2019",Birds eve view ,"This was much better than expected , we had heard that it was overrated , however we really enjoyed it . It was a partially sunny day so our views were beautiful . We were lucky & we literally walked right in , but we had pre- purchased tickets online . Great view & a must see , if you have the time . "
"Written September 12, 2019",To packed in ,"Went on the eye, along with a shed load of people. Could hardly see a thing. Don’t get me wrong what we saw was lovely but I am sure if I would have got a view that was not several layers of people’s heads would have been better. My daughter however didn’t see a thing, her experience was standing in a pod of people for 20 mins for no reason at all. "
"Written September 12, 2019",Great experience ,"A gentle birds eye view of the Thames, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Tower Bridge, London Bridge etc and many more landmarks. This was our second time on the London Eye. I seem to remember a map before pointing out visible landmarks but it was not there this time. Nonetheless it is definitely a 'must see' attraction pn a visit to the capital."
"Written September 11, 2019",Best views,Best way to see London from above! The Eye goes slowly so you are able to take pictures !  Eight passengers in  each pod.  Can sit and/or stand.  There is a bench in the center.
"Written September 3, 2019",Happy Birthday Tea with champagne ,"Magnificent location for an elegant tea. Stunning decor, excellent food, impeccable service, beautiful piano music in the background. What a treat my daughter gave me for my birthday!"
"Written September 3, 2019",Amazing view of the city,Get the express!   well worth it  - the line for general admission was HUGE.  Gives you an amazing perspective on the city
"Written September 3, 2019","Good package, but London disappointing",Big Ben is under reconstruction. House of Parliament is not light up in the night as it used to be. London dungeons attraction and sight seeing bus were also in the package. Strange system of queueing up : you are pre-booking time for starting to queue at the beginning of queue at that time (?)
"Written September 3, 2019",I was skeptical but enjoyed it!,"I was not sure about visiting the Eye, I did not think it would be that exiting. But it turned out to be a very nice experience and the views of London are truly unparalleled. I purchased tickets on-line which made it very quick and easy to get thru the line and get on. I would recommend doing that. "
"Written September 3, 2019",London Eye was so-so but river cruise was great!,"I would say the London Eye can be skipped if you want to save some cash. The wheel moved slowly so you are able to get a view of London but I don't think there is anything super spectacular about the London aerial view. If you have nothing else to do on a nice London day, I would say yes, go for it, but it would not be on the top of my list. As for the accompanying river cruise, it was actually very enjoyable. The guide, Drew, was warm and funny and was corny at times (which is expected for tour guides, right?) but he did provide a lot of information and stories about various London sights such as Parliament, Big Ben, Tower Bridge, London Bridge, the Shard, and other sights on the Thames. I would highly recommend this cruise on a nice day."
"Written September 2, 2019",Nice ride but maybe skip ,"While the experience did offer a great view of the city it was in our opinion not worth the time spent. We did the fast track ticket and it was relatively easy, but could be better served with more information about your surroundings while you are up in the eye. "
"Written September 2, 2019",London eye,"The London eye was an amazing experience made even better by the VIP status of the champagne experience. It’s a splurge, but worth it, as you get to wait in the lounge and order a drink until your host whisks you away. Out hostess, Nicole was also amazing!!!! Definitely would recommend doing this!"
"Written September 2, 2019",Fantastic,We bought advanced tickets the day before visit and when we arrived we were on board in no time fantastic views air conditioned pod I would go again anytime.Not to be missed.
"Written September 2, 2019",See London high above,"The fast track gets us much faster to the capsule and our private guide is knowledgeable. VIP lounge access provides comfort before getting onto the ride, however drinks cost extra.River cruise package is a nice way relaxing after a long day walk, we didn’t take the package since we bought river cruise separately."
"Written September 2, 2019",Not Worth the Money,"Yes.  You great a great view of London, but it is pretty expensive for what is essentially a ferris wheel.  We did the advance tickets so we had a specific time to arrive (which did cost more), but we saved waiting in line for about 1 hour.If you want a leisurely ferris wheel view of the city that you will enjoy it, but if you are budget conscious, then you can find plenty of more interesting things to do in London with you money."
"Written September 7, 2019",A MUST DO ATTRACTIONS,"Bought tickets online, was allowed to board at 10am vs our ticket time of 1030amThe green screen photos they take before you board were sloppy and upsetting they took them and everyone had green halos around them...would have been a great photo but they ruined that.the gift shop after you exit the ride was rude to many so we went next door.  also your ticket includes a FREE 4D movie experience that you can do before or after your ride.  located right across from the Eye itself."
"Written September 6, 2019",Gorgeous views,This was such a brilliant experience for me and my girls. The weather was sunny and warm and the capsule was not crowded at all so we were able to take some nice photos without having to ask people to move. The views were sensational! 
"Written September 5, 2019",Dated concept and uninteresting ride,"The 4D experience is really outdated - using the 3D glasses is passé and the film is evidently made many years back. It does not serve any purpose in enhancing the London Eye ride or enhancing visitors’ understanding of London. The management should learn from other cities such as Amsterdam’s ‘This is Holland’ 5D experience. That is something to beat. The ride on the Eye itself was marred by the fact there is not much of a view up there. The river Thames is full of construction sites and therefore after 10 minutes, the ride felt too long as it became boring since there was not much scenery to admire. Need to revitalise the entire experience to save it from being forsaken in this day and age. "
"Written September 5, 2019",Jolly Good Vantage Point,This is an absolutely splendid vantage point for anyone about to set sail on an expedition. You can see far into the distance with a telescope. I had to give it four stars because I saw no sea monsters from the summit of this amazing contraption!
"Written September 5, 2019",A good way to view the city,"This is one of the best ways to have a bird’s eye view of London. For about 30mins, you have a 360 degree view of the city. The best part is the 3D short video at the end of the ride. You will love this experience. It is also very close to the Dungeons. The queues are long so be prepared to wait. It is best to buy your ticket online to avoid queuing up for the ticket and then for the ride itself."
"Written September 4, 2019",Stunning,"Amazing ride, once is not enough. atleast you need 2 rides if you really want to view everything. and try for fast track for sure"
"Written September 4, 2019",Go express pass.,"Go for the express pass and enjoy a view with little or no queue, London as I have never seen it. BT tower Buckingham palace, Westminster, The Barbican etc. etc."
"Written September 4, 2019",super experience,"the ondon eye experience was super. i already book the ticket online so i didnt have to waste the time standing in the long rows for buying tickets, all staff was really nice from security to gift shop all is good. for river cruise, the guide was so clever and gave us her best to enjoy london main attractions. the security of the cruise was very rude, extremly rude, he came from far away shouting to make the line properly i just got surprised how he is allowed to do that in london which is one of the main capitals in the world in rules and respecting individuals. he is the only one who annoyed my visit that day and thanks GOD that the guide let me forget him"
"Written September 4, 2019","Very touristy, but worth it to see once","Don't get me wrong this is a complete tourist trap - very expensive fast pass tickets, having to take the obligatory photo with the green background before you can even go on and then people queuing for them after. We purchased fast track which was very quick and definitely worth it, but once inside the capsule it was a fight for a view. People seemed more interested in selfies than actually looking at the London skyline. Good for people visiting London and passes half an hour but not worth the cost."
"Written September 3, 2019",Relax and enjoy the view,This attraction was one of four that we purchased together. Although the line up was long it went quite quickly. The children enjoyed being up so high but I am not keen on heights so it was a challenge. The view of the Thames was nice but is was a little pricey for what you got as it didn’t take long to go full circle.
"Written August 14, 2019",Worth it,"We really enjoyed the ride on the eye. You get some good views of London. We were lucky and there was only about a 5 minute wait, we went around 5pm on a Monday. Don't be discouraged by a long line, they keep it moving quickly and place enough people in each car to be comfortable. I almost booked a reserved time online, I'm glad i didn't. We were around the area several times throughout the week and never saw a huge line, the last week of May"
"Written August 14, 2019",London  eye,I bought combine ticket for London  eye and madom tuuso for 40 pound..it was so expensive but i liked London eye more than museum
"Written August 14, 2019",Best view of London there is.,"Go fast track, go with the multi activity bundle and it is great value (£5 a head). Great views, time to enjoy the sights and skyline really impresses."
"Written August 13, 2019",Great but get here early,We prebooked and arrived at 10am where although there were queues they moved quickly. Fabulous views and not so many people in the capsule that you felt crowded.Highly recommend it but advisable to get here early
"Written August 13, 2019",Kathleen Made It,"Took the London Eye River Cruise as a part of a package with the London Eye (£6 each).Have done the river Cruise in the past and this one was very good - quick boarding, good views etc - but have to say that our host Kathleen was excellent - her enthusiasm and humour were credit to the tripDa iawn x"
"Written August 13, 2019",Amazing.. Must do attraction,One of the must do attractions in London. Absolutely stunning views of the city from all angles. Late evening is probably the best time to go there.Worth it.. 
"Written August 13, 2019",Wasn’t worth it the money,We went with my two teenage children and we expected it to be better.  Yes you can see the top of many buildings but not as many landmarks besides parliament and Big Ben which you can see better walking next to them. I would not do it again.
"Written August 13, 2019",A beautiful landmark at nighttime ,I visited there at daytime in last visit around 2 years ago. It’s completely different view at this visit as I felt it’s more romantic. Good to have a walk after dinner but be careful of pickpocket when you visit there at nighttime~ 
"Written August 12, 2019",What a view!,A ride on the London Eye is one of those activities worth doing to make your trip to London more memorable.  With the fast track we were some of the first riders of the day and the views were terrific!  The ride lasts about 30 minutes and it was very peaceful.
"Written August 12, 2019",A mai. Attraction,"Though it was at a hot season,Seems that everything is operated smoothly. Lines were not so long and the views of London are very nice. Not recommended for a rainy day"
"Written August 31, 2019",Does not disappoint!,Make this one of your top attractions. This is a staple in London- go during the day and when the sun is setting you will get some amazing photos! 
"Written August 31, 2019",Not for people with anxiety/fear of heights.,"I don't want to give this attraction low stars because I have anxiety and it might be great for regular people.  I literally started having a panic attack after I realized that I would be locked in that capsule with 20 strangers for 30 minutes, then my fear of heights kicked in.  I literally sat down and proceeded to hyperventilate and sweat from every crack in my body.  My friend I was with was clueless and chatting up other people and taking photos lol.  The only thing that saved me was a young girl from Chicago started talking to me and I just tried to focus on her and converse."
"Written August 26, 2019",Trip,"Well worth giving it a try, I hate heights but managed it the view is breath taking, I was a little apprehensive but plucked up courage and glad I did"
"Written August 25, 2019",Do this,The view is tremendous. It was a treat to get on because it does not stop to let you on. Just take a large step and away you go.
"Written August 25, 2019",Amazing by night and day ! ,I have experienced the London eye 3 times now and never disappointed ! Total different experience visiting during the day than on the the night both breathtaking views. Highly recommended to do while visiting London ! 
"Written August 31, 2019",A Must in London,I visited London on many occasions and this was my first time in the Eye. What an amazing experience!  The day was absolutely beautiful with sun and some fluffy clouds.   I purchased the Fast Track and I am glad I did.  First opening at 1000 and the lines were long. So worth the extra money. The pods were not crowded either in the morning ... I hear the afternoon they do pack 25 people per pod (be mindful).  Glad I did this little adventure and saw London from a different angle.  
"Written August 31, 2019",Worth paying extra,Did not have to q for ages with my child in the August heat so worth every penny. Great way to see London. Enjoyed the 4D cinema however there should really be something marking how the eye was made museum or something !
"Written August 31, 2019",Incredible view and way to see London,Is such a great way to see London in comfort. While big queues they don't pack each of the pods and there is plenty of room to move around and get a good look 360degrees all over London
"Written August 31, 2019",Family visit,Get here early if you don’t have tickets. We arrived at 10 am & the queue was fine. 4 D cinema is ok. 
"Written August 30, 2019",London Eye,The wait on the line to get on the London Eye was about 30 minutes. The cruise provided a good scenic view and the tour guide was funny and made the cruise. Overall I was not impressed with London.
"Written August 29, 2019","Nice view, not a must activity","Very nice view of the city. Having said that, I don’t think it is a must activity for city visitors."
"Written August 29, 2019",View over London,I have been before so knew that with 2 young children it was important to get the fast track so no waiting. Others were in the queue for over 45 minutes. Excellent views of London from the Eye. I also added the River Trip as you get a discount.
"Written August 29, 2019",Good way to see London overall,"We enjoyed our London Eye and river cruise experience, although I would suggest that you do the cruise first, so that you can get information from the tour guide what you are looking at.  That way, when you go up in the Eye, you know what you are looking down on.  The crowds are a little much, but it's part of the price you pay when you go to a tourist city in the middle of summer."
"Written August 25, 2019",Amazing Views,"At the top of the London Eye you get to experience some of the most amazing views of the London skyline from all angles since the ride is cover in transparent glass all over. The river Thames tour experience was also amazing. You get to see some of the most historic buildings along the Thames including the House of Commons or Parliament, the tour guide was great and fun and provided many interesting historical facts about each place we passed by during the ride. The river tour lasted approximately 30 to 45 minutes. And one whole round on the London Eye takes approximately 15 minutes. I recommend it for friends, couples or the entire family."
"Written August 25, 2019",London eye,A wonderful  place from which you can see almost whole London. Definitely  coming back . Me and my friends totally  enjoy it .
"Written August 25, 2019",360 Degree Views,Great 35 minute ride to see all of London. Very clean and secure but a bit crowded so it was not always easy to get the photo shot you wanted. Pay for the FastTrac it’s worth it or you’ll be waiting for hours. Preferred this over the Shard for views.
"Written August 24, 2019",Excellent Experience.,"We got ""Fast  track VIP experience with guide"" by Get Your Guide.  It was really nice to have the guide cause you get more information about the city.  The view is excellent and the ride is long enough to enjoy everything."
"Written August 24, 2019",Expensive for what it is,"It is a very touristy thing and most people think it is a 'must see' thing in London however it is basically a large ferris wheel. The view is good however I am still unsure whether it is worth the high price tag, it probably depends on each individual. In my opinion it not."
"Written August 24, 2019",London Eye,glas we got the fast track - line for general admission was huge.   Awesome views of the entire London skyline from the eye.  Very cool.
"Written August 24, 2019",Tips on visiting the London Eye  - Great view of London!,"Our family took a trip around the London Eye or as they say ""London's wheel of fortune"".    It is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually,  When they opened in year 2000, it was only to be open for five years.  Yet, it was so popular, it became a permanent tourist attraction, and the fortune it was creating. Note, it is cheaper to buy your tickets online than at the sight.Overall it was a fun experience.   The London Eye offers fantastic panoramic views of the city of London.  It was great to see the city from way up above.  The wheel moves slowly around which gives you time to click as many photos. It takes about 30 minutes to go around.   It is one of the touristy things that you need to say you did in London, but probably would not do it again.   We learned more about the London Eye from our walking tour guide than what we learned from being at the London Eye.   Such as, the London Eye was designed by husband and wife architects - Julie Barfield and David Marks.  It opened on the Millennium on December 31, 1999.  When it opened on New Year's Day - there was a glitch and it didn't open to the public until a few months later.  There are 1 to 33 numbered cars on the Wheel - yet missing 13 for superstitious reasons.  The components to make the London Eye came from six European countries - the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Czech Republic, and Netherlands.  It was all assembled in the Thames River and then lifted up.  When it opened, it was the tallest ferris wheel.  Today, they say it is ""the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel"".When you arrive, there is a Visitor Center to print up your tickets if needed.  At the wheel, we were not having a good connection on our cell phones to download our tickets.  So downloading or printing up before you  o may be wise if you are using an overseas phone.  We purchased the standard ticket and not the fast track.  The line quite quickly so we didn't think the Fast Track ticket would be worth it.  At the visitor center, there was a fun 3-D experience which was cool.  It is free for all ticket holders and can be seen before or after your London Eye ride.  Int the visitor center, there is also a gift shop and clean restrooms (Restrooms can be hard to find in London).The company takes photos behind a green screen for you at the top of the line of the London Eye and at the Visitor Center.We didn't purchase the photos that were taken at the Wheel as we didn't all look good.  Inside the Visitor Center, we took another photo.  It came out much better and in fact they take several different shots inside the Visitor Center versus outside by the Wheel they take one shot.  Inside, we got a collage of photos for the same price. The London Eye is within the Jubilee Gardens along the Thames River.  The closest tube station is Waterloo.  You can also can take the tube to Westminister and take a nice stroll over the bridge to the London Eye.   The bridge offers a great place also to take photos,Hungry before or after?  If you walk east towards the Tate Modern Museum, you will find many restaurants to eat at.  Enjoy and have fun."
"Written August 18, 2019",Interesting ,As all major countries have. It does what it says on the tin.Amazing views. Might have a long wait until you get on it but the views are amazing. Worth a vist and a ride.Plus your on the South bank which is good walking. Loads to see plus loads of small restaurants and coffee and bars 
"Written August 18, 2019",Beautiful ,A must go activity... book ahead of time to avoid line. Once you are in indulge yourself in L8ndon scenery... amazing 
"Written August 17, 2019",Fun Ride,"We got fast pass tickets for the London eye. It was the first thing we did when we got to London, we were able to see our surroundings, and get excited about what we would see next. I did think it was a bit expensive but we did enjoy it. If your in London it's good to do one time."
"Written August 17, 2019",Have to do it once,"It’s expensive, but it’s an experience you should do once if you can afford it.  I was pleased to see that even at capacity I didn’t feel like I was too crammed in there.  Also, I felt like I wanted to grab what I thought was the best view before anybody else did, but don’t worry, people tend to move about the capsule and are generally accommodating If you’re snt to squeeze into a specific spot for a view and a selfie.  Go for the express pad so you can skip the long line, but don’t expect to walk right on there will still be a small line. It went fast though.  We enjoyed the views and marveling at the mechanics of it all.  The photo that they take is didn’t work for us which was disappointing but from what I saw of others, it’s not really worth worrying about anyway."
"Written August 17, 2019",I'm On Top of The World!,"Wow! This is an amazing attraction! I loved being able to see the city from up there. If Big Ben wouldn't have been under construction, we could have taken the most beautiful picture of it from up there. It goes slowly enough that you can take pictures from all angles and yet take time to just enjoy the view. My son is afraid of heights so he sat in the the large seat in the middle until he felt brave enough to get close to the glass and take a few pictures. The only weird thing is that the wheel never stops. It loads and unloads passengers without stopping. The entrance/ exit is wide enough to allow all passengers to enter and leave the capsule just in time, but God forbid someone in your group stays behind, I don't know if they can press an emergency button. ??? Anyhow, I'm glad we went up there and enjoy the tallest ferris wheel in the world!"
"Written August 16, 2019",Cruise and London Eye Trip,"We did the cruise first, seeing lots of the sights of London and landed in time to go straight into the queue for the Eye. Still had to wait but it wasn't too bad. Only issue was when we got to the security point our grand daughter decided she needed the toilet. The staff couldn't have been nicer, we were allowed to leave the queue and were instructed to come back in the fast track entry as we had already waited, that was a very positive experience. Good view from the top and fortunately it was a pretty clear day so saw all the sights."
"Written August 16, 2019",It's pretty good,The fast track line is really fast and the view is amazing when you get to the top. At the top you can see almost everything we have amazing pictures
"Written August 16, 2019",So fast track for tix,It’s worth it as long as you buy your tix in advance. The lines were crazy long if you didn’t. Fun and easy tour to see the entire city. 
"Written August 15, 2019",London Eye,"Honestly I found the eye a bit over rated. Yes, you get a lovely view of the city, but it's anti-climactic and even at the highest point, I wasn't all that thrilled. I think it is literally exacltly average. There is nothing great about the Eye, but also nothing bad. The wheel itself  moves very slowly which is fine, you get more of the experience, but at a certain point it started to feel like a drag. I went at around 8pm thinking that the sunset would be nice to see over London, but it really wasn't that great.  I do highly recommend getting the fast-track ticket, it worth the cost. ."
"Written August 15, 2019",Very over rated,The London eye is just an over rated experience. It's not worth the time you spent in the queue to get to the cabins. Can be certainly missed. If you really want to see the view from the height then I would suggest you go to St. Paul cathedral and visit the viewing gallery. But remember it's about 500 steps but worth an experience. 
"Written August 19, 2019",London Eye,"So this is probably my 3rd or 4th time doing the London Eye. It has a great view of the London. The fast pass is definitely a must do. We booked for 12 pm but risked going earlier, around 1045-11, and we were able to get on at an earlier time.The pod was air conditioned which was good and we purchased the photo since it came out really well. "
"Written August 19, 2019",Good but nothing exciting ,"Enjoyed the trip on the London eye as part of an activity deal, wouldn’t pay full price tho as it is not worth it. Long queues and pods are crammed full leaving little room to manoeuvre around. You do get amazing views of all of London and see all the landmarks but very overrated for me "
"Written August 19, 2019",Way too expensive,I have no idea if it was worth the $$$ or not.  But it sure seemed pretty expensive to ride.  I guess I will never know.
"Written August 19, 2019",Iconic landmark,"Absolutely essential to pre book online. Especially if you're travelling at peak times. We went on a Saturday in August which was incredibly busy, but the organisation was fantastic. The staff were polite and knowledgeable. We waited no more than 10 mins in the fast track queue. There were about 15-20 people in our capsule but there was plenty of room to wander around. It takes roughly 30 mins to do one complete revolution and the views from the top are breathtaking.A great trip and I would definitely go again. "
"Written August 18, 2019",Cruise + Eye = awful,"I booked the eye with the cruise for 17.30... so at that time we did the cruise (pretty good), and once we got back, we had to exchange for a timed ticket .. first available was 20.15... and that was the time you can roughly start the regular line (I guess you can start it earlier, there are people controlling the tickets in the line). Line was about 300 meters long... we just couldn't afford to wait 3hs and then do that line and had to leave without seeing. Maybe book eye alone and do the queue on time. If you want the cruise try to make both tickets timed and do the eye 2hs before!"
"Written August 18, 2019",Lovely views poor organisation ,Visited August 2019 with my daughter and sister we had booked our slot for 13:30pm online so arrived just over half an our before our time and joined an extremely long que as we were moving round we were met by an Asian young woman whom I found extremely rude not only to myself but other customers too some of whom English wasn’t their first language I told her I thought she was rude and she walked off. Further down the line  we met a lovely tall black guy who was the complete opposite of the Asian woman. After queuing for over an hour it was now our time to board which was done quickly and efficiently with again lovely staff. Once on the capsule we had a fantastic time and the views were amazing! 
"Written August 18, 2019",Good if you get the weather,"We had a lovely time as for 90% of the time we were in the air, the weather was clear. The views from the top really are lovely. I'd definitely advise getting the fast track tickets. We didn't and ended up queuing for well over an hour before getting on."
"Written August 18, 2019","Underwhelming, long queues, nice enough view","The whole London Eye experience is rather underwhelming. The most interesting thing about it was when we had been standing in queue for 45 minutes and finally reached the real queue where we had to show our tickets again, some Oberyn Martell-looking (the poundland discount version with a black nose ring) clown and his girlfriend cut into the queue and the staff didn’t even notice. I can only applaud their level of cheek. Very good. No, seriously, good on you for skipping the queue, dornish princeling.The view is quite nice, but I felt it wasn’t really worth the full hour we spent in the queue. It really is in the heart of the tourist machine, so I guess it is to be expected"
"Written August 18, 2019",Amazing life experience. A MUST visit to London Eye :) ,We enjoyed watching London from top. We took nice selfies and created a beautiful life memory. Highly recommended. Value for money :)) 
"Written August 18, 2019",Okay but disorganised,This was booked as a rate family day out for my parents 50th wedding anniversary. We booked a private capsule for 25 people. When we got there we had to hang around but we got there early as we thought we had access to the VIP suite. It was a long time before we could go up there as it wasn’t open. You would think they would have it ready knowing a group booking were arriving. After a wait we went upstairs (didn’t see where the lift was). There is a bar but the drinks are overpriced and we were not in there long. There are no toilets upstairs so you have go go back down 2 floors to use them. NOT very VIP at all. A complimentary drink should be included in the bar if booking the entire pod. The lady who served our ordered drinks in the pod was very nice and took photos of the family for us. The experience in itself is good for a large family event but the start wasn’t great or well thought out and executed. There always seems to be lack of communication. I wouldn’t do it again due to above problem. If it’s for a special event then those attending need to feel as though it is so.
"Written August 21, 2019",Family trip ,"Excellent time, booked a viewing time, got in the queue 30 mins before and was on the Eye at the right time scheduled. The staff are very friendly and organised. "
"Written August 21, 2019",Fabulous Engineering ,Buy the skip the line tickets - they do work in London!  Very busy area but it is an amazing view! The ride is about 30 minutes.
"Written August 21, 2019",Fun Rain or Shine!,A must!  Amazing views! Entire family enjoyed it.  It goes so smooth you do not realize it moves.  Large space so you do not feel claustrophobic.
"Written August 21, 2019",Don’t book through discount London,"This is a very enjoyable way to see the city. However, discount London messed up the paperwork and had 5 children under were 10 left without a ticket and very disappointed. Book direct, don’t trust 3rd party pirates. In the end I spent another 150 on tickets....... which leads me to another complaint, why would you not have discounts for groups of kids? 150 is extortionate, especially when you cram so many into the small space. Anyway, nice but dont book through discount London.... shambolic company"
"Written August 20, 2019","Nice views from London, but overrated ","The views from the London Eye are very nice, no doubt, but in my opinion, this attraction is overrated. London has so many other attractions that are more interesting than this one. If you don’t have much time in London, I would skip this attraction."
"Written August 20, 2019",Get there early,"To avoid long queues, pre book and / or get there very early. Do not sit in the middle or everyone will be in the way of a great view of the sights."
"Written August 20, 2019",Worth it even in the rain,"This has become one of those ""must-do"" things in London. We didn't bother with the fast tickets, and our line was just as fast. You get 30 minutes of great views of the city near Parliament."
"Written August 19, 2019",Great visit ,Not the best place to go currently as it was soooo busy when we went due to peak tourist season and summer holidays.View was stunning you can see for miles ahead. Make sure you go in and see the 4D show inside after 
"Written August 19, 2019",Go VIP: Guided tour with champagne,Go VIP and receive an escort ahead of long queues.Champagne and friendly historical tour guide on EYE provided on VIP booking
"Written August 19, 2019",Fantastic,A really must do experience. The only thing is arrive early as it does get busy.  The film  before going on to the Eye is magical with real ‘snow’ falling.  The information given in the pods is really good and obviously the views on a clear day are amazing.
"Written August 24, 2019",Spectacular!  ,"We did the champagne experience last week.  We bought our tickets a few months ago.  When we arrived, we were directed to a nice area with a bar.  We were given a glass of champagne and a non-alcoholic drink for my 12 yr old daughter.  We were allowed another glass of champagne in lieu of my daughter being underage. Soon after a lovely young woman (name began with an H) came to collect the group.  She was so, so nice and acted as both a guide and host.  She escorted us to the capsule.  Fast tracked us on in minutes. We were lucky in that there were only a total of 13 of us (I think normally 20 for this experience).  Our guide/host poured us more champagne (and juice for my daughter).  She pointed out all the significant landmarks.  She offered and took time to take photos of each person/party.  It was a relaxing and enjoyable 30 minutes.  I was nervous that the height may get to me, but I was very comfortable.  It was overcast and raining, yet I thoroughly loved it!  The views were absolutely spectacular even in the rain...wouldn’t be London without rain, right? I highly recommend this experience!  "
"Written August 24, 2019",Nice view in central London,You have to choose a day with at least no rain. We had the chance in February (cold but no rain). The ride itself doesn't give you special feeling but the view is amazing. There are also a lot of other venues to visit as the London Eye is very central. As usual in London transportation via Underground is perfect. The only problem is the long queue and the price.
"Written August 23, 2019",Exciting sky ride,"I had been up before about 15 years ago, but since I was traveling with my granddaughter I did it again. It was not disappointing!! You get to see (mostly) all of London and the view is great! If you can schedule it for sunset - even more spectacular!! Anyone in London for the first time should so this!"
"Written August 23, 2019",a nice round view of London,"London Eye is exactly the name, going on this wheel you'll see the Thames , the bridges on it, and a wonderful view of London, y cabins noiseless is like to be in a space ship but watching the vastness of a great city .the queue is discouraging but don't let  be discouraged by it : it moves faster than you think, and the reward is gorgeous . In the park you could come across some squirrels , don't move and let them do the show, they are nice ""citizens"" in Saint James Park again you'll meet them ,have your camera ready !!!!"
"Written August 22, 2019",Good views ,The views from the London eye are amazing. However I think they should allow smaller groups into the pods. I felt as though it was quite tight in there especially when we wanted to move around it was very difficult to do so. 
"Written August 22, 2019",Still love it ,Been a few times now and still love it what a view could do with commentary in the pod to point out things would be good for those who havent brought the little book you can buy but still great though 
"Written August 22, 2019",Great experience ,"As my family have Merlin passes, we were able to use the fast track entry which meant we were on here pretty quickly. Staff are friendly and super efficient at getting people on and off safely. Wonderful sights and very smooth, didn't feel like we were moving sometimes. My Son (10) loved it, we went on in the afternoon and then he asked to go back on at night and then the next day too! Would be nice to have a little bit of commentary on this, not the whole way round, but just pointing out some sights to look out for."
"Written August 21, 2019",Not value for money,"So expensive to take a family on here. There are many alternatives for views in London, some are even free.We queued for 35 minutes then were off the thing in only 25 minutes. Staff member at the 4D show before the ride tried to force us to have a photo taken. This was actually the only instance of bad service during our five day trip."
"Written August 21, 2019",Worth the $$ to skip the line,"The views are amazing, but I would pay extra to skip the line. You can buy a regular ticket and then upon arriving, if the line is long, you can upgrade to skip the line. Don't forget the 4D show beforehand!"
"Written August 21, 2019",Breath taking view,"A great view of the city. You are really high in the air. On a nice clear day you can see so far and pick out the different sights from a birds eye view. The pods holds about 10- 15 people and you can sit or stand. The pod moves very slow, so you will not get sick from going too fast. We went during the day, but I bet it would be stunning at night with all the nightlights."
"Written August 28, 2019",Another tourist attraction,"I moved from England since this wheel opened in London and was interested in seeing it.  Just so you know - the locals call it ""the eye sore"" and it earns the nickname.  Totally ruining the skyline and architecture of stately, historic Thames side London, hordes of people and pricey as well.  True - you can see over all of London but not worth the queue and quid to ride it."
"Written August 28, 2019",A fantastic way to see it all!,"After 14 days of touring London and Scotland, 4 of us had tickets for the London Eye.  I would suggest doing it at the very beginning or end of a trip.  In the beginning, you'll be able to see the proximity of attractions and make an itinerary (much quicker if using the underground).  At the end of the trip as we did, it reminded me of all of the places we visited.  It also was such a great mix of the old architecture right up against the new.  Our tickets were for noon, but we realized they weren't paying attention to the time and we were able to board early.  Made for a great experience!"
"Written August 27, 2019",Nice but a waste of time.,"Granddaughter wanted to see it.  The area is so overcrowded. Purchased tickets home still had to wait on a massive line to get on. You do have great views of the city, but it’s so time consuming.  It’s up to you this is my opinion."
"Written August 27, 2019",Highlight of London,We knew we had to do this excursion because it is so popular but we dreaded the crowds. We needn’t have worried... we arrived early in the morning and the queue moved really fast!  The sights were incredible and it is well worth a visit 
"Written August 27, 2019",Forget the EYE; Take the Cruise,"Wife and I went on the river cruise first, much fun, very informative and funny host. We got a perspective from the river that we never would have gotten from land. We talked with many who had taken the London EYE before the cruise, and to a person they recommended that we save our money and avoid the EYE. Apparently the EYE is slow, crowded, and sometimes breaks down and stops. We were more than satisfied with the cruise."
"Written August 27, 2019",Waste of time,"Crowded car, you don’t see anything that special and the fast pass price is too high. Utter waste of money."
"Written August 27, 2019",Great Trip,"I took my 5 year old for her first visit to London to meet my friend's. Our Eye time was 12.45 but was informed could queue up to 30 minutes prior to this which we did. When we went the queue was split so that person's not queuing can cross through the centre. To be fair though the queue was very quick. It takes 30 minutes to go round and the views really are breathtaking. Most people congregate at the front of the pod with great views to the left of Big Ben, Parliament etc. At the end of the flight you can have your photo taken on the right hand side both front and back as you go round. It is very much worth a visit especially if you do the Southbank at the same time. As a bonus I used my Tesco clubcard vouchers that I'd saved so didn't cost me anything. A brilliant memory for both my daughter and I!"
"Written August 27, 2019",Don't miss out,"If you are in London, you must go on the Eye. Make sure it's not a foggy day though, obviously. What looks a long queue moves very quickly so not much hanging about, easy to board and they take pictures, inside and out of the capsule. Last about 20 minutes, (didn't actually time it). and seems well worth the money to me."
"Written August 26, 2019","A great, quick way to enjoy the sights of London","We did the ‘no wait’ pass and they meant it!! We walked right up and were whisked away a separate lane for express users.  About a minute later we were on our way to the top! Even on a rainy, cloudy day you could see most of London without any issue. Other passengers were cool (mostly) about moving around so you could see multiple vantage points."
"Written August 26, 2019",I love the London eye!,I went to it and I loved it! Great weather and beautiful view. I was in London for 5 days and one of the days I went to there. I went with my family and it was awesome!
"Written August 6, 2019",Once is enough ,"It’s a fantastic experience, but once is defiantly enough. When you see the queue and have already done it I’d say walk straight past and go experience something different in London. "
"Written August 6, 2019",This was a one off,"We purchased a ticket online however we had trouble redeeming it. The staff helped us out and the eye was magical.  I enjoyed the pod which was full with 4 different nationally. Being the first time, it was worth it "
"Written August 6, 2019",Was ok,"We did this at night and although it was nice to see the city lit up, it was hard to see the actual buildings. We paid for fast track and it was worth as the line was very long, the entire process took about 45 minutes."
"Written August 6, 2019",On a clear day,The view is wonderful.Not worth Fast Track really at £10 per person as the queue does move quite quickly.All in all a nice time
"Written August 6, 2019",Fantastic views,Although it was a 45 min queue the system to keep you moving was good. Great views and the pods are not too crowded so you can move around to see different views
"Written August 6, 2019",Great view over London!,Terrific views of Big Ben and all of London from a large gondola you can walk around in to see in all directions during the ride. Great experience but expect long lines.
"Written August 6, 2019",Day out with family ,"I was Never interested in visiting the London eye, so I didn’t follow all the hype But it was a day out with family (my parents wanted to visit) I don’t regret it Sights were awesome the time around was lovely 45 minutes only issue I had was the number of people crammed into the pod felt a little Overcrowded but I’m also afraid of heights so that could be the issue! I enjoyed myself and would do this again "
"Written August 6, 2019",Beautiful view,Go to the 4D cinema before London eye. It takes like 5-10 minutes. There wasn't a queue. London eye was nice but I think I would rather go to Jubilee gardens and go on their swing ride and enjoy the view from there.
"Written August 6, 2019","great time, and its an experience worth while to take.","I recommend 1st timer to London to take this experience.. u get a chances to see London differently from the top..too bad the big ben is under renovation, unable to see it from the eye."
"Written August 6, 2019","its an interesting tours, able to view London from the eye is definitely great experiences",Queue up to the Eye even its the standard tickets is not take very long... even that that time there are many tourist and its summer time. we took the Eye before going to the river cruise as the cruise is a fixed time.
"Written August 10, 2019",London's iconic view point,Do not do this if you are scared of heights. I was terrified. My family on the other hand enjoyed the whole experience and took lots of fab pictures.The queuing system is chaotic but moved surprisingly quickly. All staff were friendly and approachable.
"Written August 10, 2019",Boat unavailable,"I had planned a day trip from Paris to London. I had purchased my tickets in advance to tour the Thames.  When we arrived at the dock, the coordinator stated the London eye river cruise boat is not service. Boo! So I had to actually purchase city cruise at the ticket booth. They could’ve just honored my reservation without me having to buy another ticket. Anyways let’s see if I get a refund for the original tour. The city cruise was funny and entertaining."
"Written August 10, 2019",Great views,Spectacular views.   Big Ben was covered in scaffolding so we opted for the photo they do.  Was a little overcast for a summers day and rained but overall the experience was great.  Recommend you go on The London eye if you haven’t yet.  We did- tick- off the bucket list.
"Written August 10, 2019",Wonderful!,"What a view you get from the top! Not for the faint hearted and definitely not for anyone who has vertigo! Went round slowly so you get a great view of London. VERY helpful for my disabled husband to get on and off. Thanks to the staff for that. Chatty staff too, who said ""have a nice rest of the day"" to us."
"Written August 9, 2019",Best time!!,My 14 yr old teenager granddaughter and I visited LONDON after a prolonged wait. Airline delays and all that goes along with that. We missed our day for the purchased VIP tickets which were non refundable. I thought I have nothing to loose and called them up to explain. I have only nice things to say about the curtesy and accommodating young girl who waived all of that and let us go the next day!! Needless to say we had a grand time and enjoyed our time in the sky tremendously!! Recommend it highly!! Enjoy!!
"Written August 9, 2019",London Eye - Fast Track Ticket,"My wife and I booked our visited on the London Eye in mid July 2019 on a weekday through ‘Golden Tours’. We had used this company before with the ‘Jump on/off Bus Tour’ and they gave us a heavily discounted price on a Fast Track Ticket which worked out just £3 more than a standard ticket! We booked in for 11:30am and basically walked straight on. There were 10 people in our air-conditioned cabin with the whole trip taking about 30 minutes. Amazing views, we loved it!!It was totally worth paying that extra money to skip the line."
"Written August 9, 2019",up up and away to a fabulous view,Wow still as amazing. I went on this 19 years ago and it’s still just as fabulous. My sister ( her first visit) and I enjoyed the ease of fast track and the 4D London eye movie show was spectacular and good fun. Staff very helpful. Good value for money
"Written August 9, 2019",Seeing the City on a rainy day!,"We could see absolutely everything in the city. We were amazed at how much construction was going on, so a lot of the buildings had scaffolding around them. We bought the 360 map so we could tell what everything was and it was worth buying."
"Written August 8, 2019",Rip off,Toured London and stopped by. Very pretty sight but Went to buy tickets only to find out they’re 30 pounds! That’s a crazy price for one time around the wheel. Instead we toured local places and got a more meaningful experience than we would’ve waiting in line for an overpriced Ferris wheel.
"Written August 8, 2019",A Must Visit!,Taking a ride on the London Eye was number one on my son's list of things to do in London. We booked an early appointment with a fast pass and it worked out great. About a 10 min wait time and he very much enjoyed it!
"Written August 5, 2019","Nice ""round""trip","Lucky to jump on the London Eye with clear sky and nice view. Definitely a must-do experience.Picture at the end of the trip, just try to understand beforehand which will be the camera, if interested."
"Written August 4, 2019",Amazing view,One of the must to visit in London. You definitely must visit it once. Great experience getting up so high. The view is amazing up the top.
"Written August 4, 2019",Very Interesting! ,"We went on this river trip after the London Eye, we loved it! Very funny and informative guide (Kathleen). In some ways it was better than the London Eye. Learnt new and great facts about London. "
"Written August 4, 2019",Good to tick off bucket list,Offers good views of London and the Thames. Would advise try and book for a day with good weather to make the most of the view. Good to tick off the bucket list once in your lifetime 
"Written August 4, 2019",good sight over london from the london eye,"It was a very nice activity/experience to go on the London eye. The only one bad thing about this experience was a lot of people was waiting. But for this experience you will wait all day long :-D The price is also acceptable it was a little bit expenisve, I think the price was 26£. Its a couple of years over I was there. Ill say you guys this experience is every penny worth. You can take some very nice pictures there and enjoy the view over London."
"Written August 3, 2019",Terrible service for what you pay,"So we have been planning our London trip for our daughter for over a month . We had two different vouchers for the London eye - both which were in date. Cadbury’s and Kellogg’s neither of them specified they excluded Friday or school holidays. Both said could pre book but after failing so many times we decided to book on the day. My partner cued at the kiosk 15/20 mins to be told no vouchers excepted at the kiosk would need to go inside. He then cued for a further hour inside to be told the vouchers can not be used. Although the girl didn’t know and could tell us why she had to check with someone else 🤷‍♀️Second day the same kiosk then told us we had to go inside as she is only fast track 🤷‍♀️. I asked to make a complaint to one of the guys helping and he just fobbed me off with I understand. If he said to me once he must have said 10 times not valid at weekends I had to tell it was a “Friday” and there was no mention of exclusion in school holidays, even the staff didn’t know to tell us this. We spent a lot of money this weekend and by far this was the worst service we received. A quarter of million pounds a day they take - you should be providing a better service, better promotions that are clear. If we hadn’t promised my daughter I would have spent my hard earned cash somewhere else. "
"Written August 3, 2019",Beautiful,Absolutely once in a life time trip. Was expensive a little but worth the money me and my friends had. Great time
"Written August 3, 2019",Worth while experience,This was the second time I have ridden the Eye.  It was just as great as the first time. You do have to wait in line but it was worth it!
"Written August 3, 2019",On everybody's to do list,The most amazing and breathtaking view on London! Definitely go at night around 8pm! It is crowded but the line is really going fast so you'll wait approximately 20minutes! 
"Written August 2, 2019",Fast track ticket avoids long queue,"Nice to show up and get right on. Great views of London, good family activity. Not cheap but purchase online and avoid really long queue"
"Written August 12, 2019",GREAT WAY TO SEE CITY ! ,Went to a friends pre drink birthday party on the London Eye. It was a great event and it will be great for my 40th !! 
"Written August 12, 2019",Family trip,"Eh, you read about the queues but it is horrible in real life. The view is fantastic but I think a little bit overhyped if you want something nicer go to sky garden. May be worth it if you buy the champagne package"
"Written August 12, 2019",Great but staff not helpful,Def worth the experience but experience slightly spoiled but staff shouting at everyone to get off and on. Only 30 mins and queues do move quick so not worth spending the extra for faster queue passes. We had a sleeping baby in a pram that we were told had to come out and pram folded as needed space for a wheelchair that was clearly invisible and none to be seen. Staff really not helpful and all about speeding people on and off and got whole family of 6 in a panic when we tried to get on. They should check how many are in your party as family in front of us got split and they had to stop the wheel and bring it back. Disaster. Managed to get pram up and off the moving capsule fine coming off! Worth the sights and money.
"Written August 11, 2019",Wonderful views,"This is our 3rd visit to the London Eye, we enjoy the views so much it’s always good fun. The ride is relaxing and you have plenty of opportunity to walk around the pod to admire the views and take photos."
"Written August 11, 2019",London eye,Fast pass was great! Very quick. Great views of the city. All kids and family members had fun from ages 11 to 75.
"Written August 11, 2019","""Earth has not anything to show more fair . . . . . ""","This quote from Wordsworth's poem on ""Westminster Bridge"" was posted on the sides of the approach as we queued. We'd been warned the queue moved exceeding slow, but were very pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to wait too long (about 20 minutes) to board, and the staff were fab, REALLY friendly (even the bag-checkers!).London is dirty and cramped and claustrophobic at ground level, but this was like the ""celestial city"" when we got to the top of the Eye - the mix of traditional architecture such as St Paul's and Parliament, and the modernistic features like the Shard were somehow beautiful and magical from this distance - we thought about how it must appear to aliens coming in from space!It's expensive - but we got a 2-for-1 deal with our train tickets (you can print a voucher, then have to show your train tickets with the voucher at the ticket office) - so worth it for a ""bucket list"" experience.AND you get a ""4D Cinema"" experience with your tickets, which was great fun."
"Written August 11, 2019",Great Combo,"The river cruise is a great way to see the Thames river. It is approximately 45 minutes long. The tour guide was friendly and very knowledgeable of the landmarks along the river. The London Eye gives you great views of London and the Thames river. The line to get on is quite long, unless you get the fast track. Once you get in the capsule, the view is outstanding. The ride is approximately 30 minutes total."
"Written August 11, 2019",Must See,"A must-do attraction if visiting London as a tourist.The views offered from the top are spectacular and provide some great photo opportunities. There are queues as you would expect, particularly during the summer months, but I found these moved fairly quickly and the wait was not too long."
"Written August 11, 2019","Charged twice - misinformed by supervisors and managers, no refund","Purchased 2 Standard tickets for the attraction on the website in order to avoid queues. Whilst purchasing, the website crashed but my card was charged £60. Advised by outdoor staff to queue in the ticket office where somebody would be able to trace our tickets. Got to the desk, told we were in the wrong queue, had to queue up again at a separate customer service desk. Lady on the desk couldn’t trace our purchase, so called on a supervisor to help out - I’ve never known such rude service! She told us they hadn’t received any money from me so there is nothing they can do, even when I had the transaction in black and white on my banking app. Asked to speak to a manager, who came down and explained the situation in depth so that we understood where my money was, which we appreciated. However instead of offering us tickets told us we could purchase again for the standard price but he would add fast track. He told us that the original money would bounce as the company would not accept my payment, and if it didn’t do so by 5pm to contact their customer service. Paid another £60 for tickets (which luckily we had, others may not have budgeted for this), went on the Eye despite all the mishaps.4pm came, still no refund. 3 days later and I have now contacted customer services three times with no response. Now been informed by my bank that the London Eye have claimed the money (which we were assured would never happen) and I am now £120 down for a 15 minute wheel ride with awful customer service.This is now being disputed by my bank and I am hoping that this review will provoke a response from your company."
"Written August 10, 2019",People in line are the best part!,"The London Eye in July means lines. We were in line with people from India, Nigeria, the US and UK. Talking with them was more interesting than any other part of the experience. For the money, a boat tour shows you much more of the layout of London, with less waiting."
"Written August 8, 2019",Traveler,I think it's mandatory to visit this place if you're spending vacation  with family in London. Great view.Before you come here check weather forecast to be sure you will be able to see something;) 
"Written August 8, 2019",Great Experience,Highly recommended to pay for the fast track line. It save a good couple of hours in a busy day to experience the London Eye
"Written August 8, 2019",Loved it,"The views are absolutely fantastic, highly recommended if visiting London. It is a very busy attraction though and would definitely advise booking a time slot ahead of visiting. Having said that the staff are well organised and very helpful. "
"Written August 8, 2019",Great views,Worth buying the express ticket there was a long queue. The 30 minute trip went fast. Great views so many landmarks to spot.
"Written August 8, 2019",Wonderful Experience,Wife and I totally enjoyed this ride. The line was fairly long but it moves quickly. If you are willing to wait a few minutes in line rather than paying for the fast track tickets which others in our pod paid £40 each for. 
"Written August 8, 2019",See the City from Above!,"We liked the London Eye.  While it was quite busy when we lined up, the queue seemed to move quickly.  The pods are very big, with some seating and glass walls all around.  They even mark on the floor where to stand for the photo opp.The ride is rather slow as it stops to let people on and off consistently.  Not like carnival ferris wheels that let a few seats on then speed up for a few rounds.  This is mostly okay since most people are onboard for the view.  Going slow give you lots of time to soak it in.If you're in London, I think you just have to see it.  It's worth it if you want a view from the heights. Plus, that area right around the Eye is quite active and fun with a cool playground for the littles and live entertainment for all."
"Written August 8, 2019",Great views!,I recommend booking online for a timeslot to avoid the long lines. Also best if you have already done some sightseeing so you know what you’re looking at.  
"Written August 7, 2019",Great views of London,We used the timed ticket at 6 in the evening. A little pricey but we did enjoy the views and a chance to get our bearings having just arrived that afternoon.

"Written August 7, 2019",A must do! ,"Booked tickets online for a time slot (12:30). we got there and was told that we just had to queue which was about an hour long. The time slots don’t really matter. We paid £10 to upgrade to a fasttrack slot which was at 3pm, but as my boyfriend bought his ticket a 1:45 slot became available so we changed. We could queue from 1:15 and we were up in the air by 1:30. I’d recommend buying the fastrack as it saves a lot of time. Well organised and it offers student tickets too! "
"Written August 7, 2019",Fantastic views,"We had to queue for quite some time to get tickets, then queue again to actually get on the eye, but once we were on, the views were fantastic."
"Written August 7, 2019",Magnificent views from the Eye,"Loved this ride. It was a nice slow pace, and the views of the Thames and London were spectacular. Our pod only had about 25 people in it, so not crowded. I have a huge fear of heights but that fear disappeared while we went on this. Highly recommend this!"
"Written August 7, 2019",Fabulous Thames River Cruise and London Eye,The Thames River Cruise was full of sights and sounds. So relaxing going down the river and seeing all the beautiful buildings. It was a little hard to hear the guide but enjoyed it immensely. We then got off and went on the London Eye. I had no idea I would love this so much. What a great way to look all around London. Fantastic views and it takes about 30 minutes to make the full revolution so it hardly feels like you're moving. A must do when in London!!
"Written August 7, 2019",Bought the fast track but couldn't pull it up on either of our phones,"The London Eye was a zoo. We bought the fast track to skip the massive lines but couldn't get the tickets to pull up on either phone so had to wait in a very slow moving line to get paper tickets. If you purchase, definitely print your tickets at the hotel. I was underwhelmed with the the slow moving ""eye"" and was ready to get off about halfway through. I think it was overpriced and overrated."
"Written August 7, 2019",Overpriced,"It’s as simple as supply and demand - this is a popular attraction so they get to charge a lot to do it. Since we had a limited time in London and it was one of the few things my son wanted to do - I bought the skip the line tickets to save on time.  £70+ later we were on.  Half way up the line they took a picture of us that we had the option to purchase at the end of we liked. Your image is photographed with the background of Big Ben and Westminster Abby in the back and you can choose from £20 or £25 package (which includes key chain sized photos and 2 key chains to go with it).  Take your own - it’s not as perfect, but it’s more meaningful and memorable. The trip itself took just under 30 mins. While you do get to see a far distance in London (I feel the best views were of Westminster Abby, Big Ben (currently under restoration until 2021 BTW), and the River Thames. While I would do this again for half the price - I wouldn’t for what we paid. I certainly wouldn’t stand in the massive lines as it would not be worth the wait - keep in mind this was August and the city is bubbling with tourists.  I’d rather spend the wait time at The Tower of London (which I did last year) or somewhere else where you can experience some of the rich culture of the city.  So as I won’t pay to skip the lines and I won’t wait in the long lines it is safe to say I won’t do this one again."
"Written August 7, 2019",Not worth it,"The London Eye is obviously a popular landmark for tourists and the experience is understandably an iconic one. Yet, I don’t recommend that you put in the efforts required to endeavour in this experience.First of all, it’s much more money than it’s worth. I would recommend that, if you want to see views from London, go to the balconies of the Tate Modern Art Gallery or enter the Sky Garden-both of which are free. Second of all, queueing will take you forever in the summer holidays-which could be time wasted if you aren’t staying in London for long."
"Written August 2, 2019",Refunds not Granted for Uncontrollable Circumstances,"My wife and son were unable to get across the city in time for the ride due to circumstances beyond our control. We were told at the site that we would not be refunded. The cost of the ride is rather expensive. Because I didn't want finedor arrested for scalping the tickets, I rode the ride twice with my daughter. Used what I paid for, but I left still feeling cheated. The same company owns the London Underground. My daughter was too scared after entering to continue so we all had to depart. So we paid for four tickets and collectively had 4 minutes used. Again, no refund offered. I won't support or recommend this company to others. They take advantage of tourists time constraints to line  their pockets. Shameful."
"Written August 2, 2019",Ok,Great to visit to see the fab sky line line in London it moves fairly slow worth a trip to if visiting
"Written August 1, 2019",Interesting But Commercialized Too Much,"Guess which US brand is everywhere at the Coca-Cola London Eye!?  Pictures for sale at the end.  Very much an amusement park ride feeling.  Views are nice, on the upside."
"Written July 31, 2019",Very enjoyable ,"Even though we queued for a bit, it was worth it. Every capsule is big enough for the people that ride it, and the views are fantastic."
"Written July 31, 2019","very long lines, nice views","The line wait was about an hour, the ride is about 30 minutes, one of the must see places in London, will try the fast track next time"
"Written July 31, 2019",Highly recommend the champagne experience!,"I cannot recommend going to the London Eye through the champagne experience. We had a great host, Lina, who was the sweetest, friendliest, most accommodating person ever. I can’t talk highly enough about her for really bringing this experience to life in the best way possible. With the champagne experience, we were able to relax, watch the 4D cinema, and head up to the lounge for a drink before Lina guided us through the crowds and to the London Eye. The mixologists in the lounge were very friendly and the drinks were fantastic! Once on board, It was an intimate crowd so you were not overwhelmed by pushy tourists and Lina served you chilled champagne (1 glass, it is only a 30 mins ride after all). We went at sunset on the 8pm time slot which was the PERFECT sunset time. Lina took pictures of everyone on board and had great commentary about the views we were seeing. If you are going to the London Eye this is the ONLY way to experience it. Worth every dollar spent! But also, don’t forget to tip your host :)"
"Written July 30, 2019",Magical view,One of the must to visit in London. You definitely must visit it once. Try to book your tickets online with madame tussauds or other attractions. The photos are too expensive 20 pounds each.  
"Written July 30, 2019",Not as good as I was expecting,A good thing to see but with big ben being covered it's not as good as I could be. I wouldn't pay full price for it but was ok as an add on to madam tussauds 
"Written July 30, 2019",Nothing special,It's just a ferris wheel. Nothing to write home about. I would say that 2 stars are more than enough.

I had give 15 years ago and the city’s skyline has changed so much! Lucky to be there on a beautiful day the staff were (mostly) friendly and helpful. The pods are comfortable and the experience lasts a pleasant while. "
"Written July 28, 2019",Quick and a Easy Access,"The line moved quickly and before  we knew it we were on the Eye enjoying the breathtaking views of London. The ride should be 45 mins in the summer as the weather is so much better, brighter skies, more photos opts. It seem to end so quickly. Oh well, this is a must do attraction.  My second time on it."
"Written July 27, 2019",views of the city on a unique ride,"We decided to do this at the last minute and were surprised by how efficient the line-up was and how quickly, despite the giant crowd, we moved through the line.  In total is was 30 minutes in line (moving the entire time) and 30 minutes on the Eye.  Great views, unique perspective and festive atmosphere.  My teenagers loved it.  I did the regular ticket (not fast pass) and bought it that day in the automatic ticket machine.  Lines were well-monitored and it took us the exact amount of time as predicted by the host.  Line was always moving so despite the size of the line we never felt like we were waiting.  Glad we did this.  It is pricey but a very unique view and something that everyone of all ages could enjoy. "
"Written July 27, 2019",Great experience ,"Everyone should do this if you come to London, you get a great view point of the city regardless of the weather"
"Written July 27, 2019",Great Value for money,The London eye was amazing! We visited on a really hot day luckily the capsule had air conditioning. The views were amazing especially when you reach the top. You can move around the capsule or you can sit down if you are not a fan of heights. I’d definitely visit again and would recommend going fast track as the queues can be at least an hour long!
"Written July 26, 2019",Great experience,"London eye was amazing. We bought the fast track tickets that we got to go quickly. When we get to top, we could see the city of London and it was amazing. I would recommend any family to buy the tickets before you get there as there was a long queue. I would do it again. Visiting London is almost a dream come true."
"Written July 26, 2019",What a view,We may have been lucky with the weather........ But this is definitely the thing to do for views of London..... It goes up it comes down is pretty simple but super smooth there is no hassle (unless the queue is huge) but if you want 360degree views of London uninterrupted then this I deffo recommend..........
"Written July 26, 2019",London Eye,It situated on the Thames River Westminister opposite St Thomas Hospital. Built is a temporary structure but is now to go to place. Long queues is budgeting time is of essence except if you order fast queue. Has 32 carriages representing London boroughs. Top view on a clear day is breathtaking.
"Written July 26, 2019",Worth it!,We were a little hesitant to buy ticket for this because of the cost.  We got the fast track tickets and made a time.  We got in with no wait and the views were amazing.  Completely worth it!
"Written July 26, 2019",Check the box,"While the eye was something I was looking forward to on my trip, I was a little disappointed.   It does have a great view but unless you are with a local most of the ride you will not be able to identify a lot of the sites.   I would definitely get a fast pass online to avoid lengthy lines.   I also felt the pods were not very clean, I do realize that hundreds of people come thru them each day, but definitely not a place for a germaphobe.  Again something you should do but once is definitely enough!"
"Written July 25, 2019",???,Definitely not worth it.  View from river edge is just as good.  Could enhance the experience by having an annotated photo in the cars which describes the different sites you are seeing.  I do not recommend it.  Didn’t need FAST TRAK on day we were going.
"Written July 23, 2019",Slowly slowly watchee London,"The London Eye moves round so gently you hardly notice. Maybe if they got it to blink occasionally you'd realise it's a spinning wheel offering its travellers a unique look at The Big Smoke. Love it. Great fun, even with the queues."
"Written July 22, 2019",Iconic Views!,"I used to live in London with my kids,and one thing we noticed was that, compared to the Pacific NW where we are from, it is pretty flat. Oh, I love it, and have returned many times, but it's pretty hard to get a view there. My youngest daughter and I went on the Eye, and that is a great way to see it all. I also recommend climbing Primrose Hill, which has a view point and maps out the City. I went on the River Cruise alone [my kids were tired by them] and I thought that was touristy fun. My best suggestion is pick a weekday, pick decent weather and perhaps midday. Then check the many kiosks that offer tickets at a reduced price...they are everywhere! You can avoid crowds, get a better view and a better deal if you check around. For those that don't know, the Eye was designed for the Millennium, and was to go super fast, but due to it being so big it goes at a glacial pace, and has been copied around the world."
"Written July 22, 2019",Wow! Wow! Wow!,"Some sights to be seen in here it was absolutely amazing ,you could see Wembley stadium buckingham palace ,downing street to.mention a few fab day there. "
"Written July 22, 2019",Bird's Eye View of The London Skyline,You cannot see London correctly without visiting the Eye. The line moves fast and the ride itself is barely 26 minutes. Well worth the 22 GBP.
"Written July 22, 2019",Great view of London,Very lovely birds eye view of London in spacious capsules that move slow enough to not be scary. Enough room to sit down or take photos without blocking others’ view. Get in earlier for less of a wait in the line.
"Written July 22, 2019",On the to do list for London,"Don’t be put off by the queue lengths as this moves very quickly , especially when you’ve bought in advance & have a scheduled timeOnly criticism is that once you’re up in the air , unless you are a Londoner , you wouldn’t know what buildings or landmarks you were looking at . A view is a view , whether you are up the Shard or the sky garden ( which is free )"
"Written July 22, 2019",Expensive but Unbeatable Views,We were lucky enough to have a discount voucher but it was still very pricey.  Would still recommend it though as the views are unbeatable.We had to queue for about 20 minutes to get the tickets so were dismayed at the huge queues outside but they moved very fast.  The staff are really efficient so we seemed to be constantly moving and ultimately didn't wait long at all.They do  put several people into the same pod but there is still plenty of space.The kids loved the view as did we and it allows views over London that are unforgettable.Would definitely recommend it despite the price.
"Written July 22, 2019",Brilliant!,My husband and I took my in-laws a few years ago and it was a truly wonderful experience - I would highly recommend!
"Written July 22, 2019",Long lines but moved quickly.,Workers made the line move very efficiently. Beautiful birds eye views. Air conditioning in capsule nice since heat wave when we were there.
"Written July 21, 2019",Great Views,"We just returned from a London/Paris family vacation and were really pleased with the London Eye. We prepaid and got fast access to the Ferris Wheel in an effort to avoid long lines. This was definitely worth doing and our wait time was under 20 minutes. We had great views and really enjoyed the entire experience. Plus the location of the London Eye is fantastic, it is the water front with a few touristy things to do, next to the Thames, their is a carousel, some ice cream trucks, street performers and we were fortunate to catch a world food market that had tons of great eating options (like a farmers market but with restaurants instead of produce). This really is a fun activity to do with the family."
"Written July 25, 2019",Is a great experience! A must do.,"I was very happy I have bought a fast ticker because queues are long. Make sure you understand if you have to go to the desk to exchange the coupon or if what you have is already a ticket. And arrive with at least 20 minutes prior time.Some relevant landmarks cannot be seen form London Eye, yet the whole experience and the perfection of how this have been developed is worth the experience."
"Written July 25, 2019","2nd Largest ""Ferris Wheel"" in the World!","My daughter wanted to do this -- so we took the Tube to Westminister Bridge, and walked over to this attraction. It helps to purchase Fast Track Tickets before hand -- saves a lot of time in the long lines. It’s not really a ferris wheel (though it sure looks like one -- on steroids) -- it's the world’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel.The views were stunning -- and they offered a good photo op from the gondola you ride in. If you're afraid of heights, you might want to skip this -- at the highest point it is almost 445' above ground. After our ride we were amazed at how it dominates the London skyline. We could even see it from St. James Park near Buckingham Palace!Can you imagine: supermodel Kate Moss has been on the London Eye 25 times – the record for any UK celebrity."
"Written July 25, 2019",Highly recommend you buy your tickets in advance,"Unless you get there right when it opens, I highly suggest you buy tickets online. The line to buy the tickets was long and then once you have the tickets the line to get on the Eye is even longer. We intended to buy beforehand, but weren't sure which day we would go. The ride is nice and slow and you can take in the views of London. There are plenty of picture opportunities. Each capsule is rather large, so those who may be afraid of heights might do better on here versus a regular Ferris wheel."
"Written July 25, 2019",Impressive to See,We were on a bus tour that dropped us off in front of the Eye. We were short for time to the Tower so we didn’t actually get on the Eye. It was also an overcast day so our driver didn’t recommend it. Looks like it would be fun otherwise.
"Written July 25, 2019",Great experience ,Last Saturday I decided to get this in with my two friends visiting from the US. We did the fast track as it was only £10 more per person but we were able to board quickly. The queues were very long for normal admission. The pics at the end we took two booklets valued at 25£ each with two pictures and the keychain and magnets. Memories I guess. 
"Written July 24, 2019",Stunning views,"I think anyone who visits London should treat themselves to the London Eye. The views are incredible, all-be-it a bit murky when we did it. We got there early in the morning to get tickets so to avoid the queues. The pod was clean and we only had a few other people in with us. It takes about a hour to complete."
"Written July 24, 2019",Nice but Dirty Windows and Pictures,"Spectacular views but the gondolae are very dirty on the outside. So practically impossible to take pictures from the inside through a clean window, always tons of dirt visible on my pictures. Also they close far too early for a day in July (20.30), so no sunset pics ;-/"

Huge queues due to summer holidays but as my nephew has aspergers staff kindly took me to VIP check in for my ticket and then gave us fast track tickets to skip the queues. Made a huge difference to my nephews experience as does not do well in crowds of people. Thank you
"Written July 28, 2019",A giant ferris wheel ,Great views but a bit pricey for just a 30 minute spin. If you are looking for a place to take a panoramic picture it does afford some of the best views but you will be in an enclosed capsule with 12 or so other people who may or may not have similar hygiene standards and level of manners so it is a bit of a crap shoot.
"Written July 28, 2019",Family getaway,Great family time. Kids enjoyed it. Got thru fast track due to health and having a little child with me. Friendly staff.great views. Kids and family enjoyed it.
"Written July 28, 2019",Good experience ,Definitely one to do while in London 👍See all of London from the skies! Great views of all of London 😁
"Written July 28, 2019",Sunset From the Eye,We caught the last spin of the Eye at about 8:30. The capsule was cool and not very crowded (the temp had been in the 90's).  stunning views across all of London. Serene and enjoyable with the sun beginning to set. Expensive but worth it. 
"Written July 28, 2019",Amazing experience,Wonderful experience! I can’t express how amazing the London eye is. This was our first time visiting this attraction and it was nothing short of amazing. The views are spectacular and the staff were lovely.
"Written July 17, 2019",Famous Monument,I did not get the opportunity to get into the monument but visited it by far.  Busy area and nice to see about
"Written July 17, 2019",Fast Track is the Way to Go!,"Had Fast Track tickets for the London Eye. I didn't the last time I took grandchildren, and it took FOREVER to work our way up to the attraction. It is not a scary ride at all. It is benign, you have incredible opportunities to see some 30 miles out, take photos and just chill.It is so iconic that you just have to do it if you are in London, or you won't have had the full London experience. Kids adore it!"
"Written July 16, 2019",Ms,"We were not so impressed with this , we we were hurried to get a ticket & had to choose a time to come back - which was worthless- it was merely a time to come and stand in line for 45 minutes before we got on the actual eye they corralled us on with 20 other people that spoke a different language -we felt like a herd of cattle. Once  on the actual vessel the speaker comes on and starts trying to sell additional events. Really truly not worth the money or the time to do it again we would avoid"
"Written July 16, 2019",Fantastic Views,"We decided to do the London Eye and, seeing the queue, decided to fast-track and pay the extra ten pounds to do this. Fortunately, given that I  use a walking stick at the moment, fast tracking was free and we were quickly onto the London Eye. Surprisingly the photo that was taken at the start was good so we paid 20 pounds for this. The 30 mins (approx) ride was great. It was a great day with lots of sunshine and we enjoyed every moment of it."
"Written July 16, 2019",Worth the Wait,Bought our ticket combo with the London Eye river cruise which we took first. It was great taking us past lots of hallmark sights. Returned to dock to see the huge lines waiting for the Eye. Worth the wait to see London from up high. Would buy fast pass next time!
"Written July 16, 2019","Best views of London, a must","Fabulous views of the city. Clear day really helps. Booked time slot in advance, so limited queuing. Very well run. Helpful staff."
"Written July 16, 2019",Not your aveage Ferris Wheel,"The London Eye is a cool feat of engineering that is safe, exciting and provides an amazing view of the entire city of London. There were a couple of people in my family who do not like ferris sheels and are scared of heights, but after mustering up the courage to ride this attraction, they loved every minute of it and never felt uncomfortable. The Pods are huge (accommodating around 20 people or more) and the ride is slow and smooth. A trip to London would not be complete without a ride on this modern addition to a historic city. Also, on a busy day, it was worth the few extra dollars for the fast pass."
"Written July 16, 2019",Get a good view of the London city,The normal queue was about 45 min wait. If you are in a hurry you can buy the fast track tickets at extre 10 Pounds. If its cloudy would not be worth the money. Quite and moves very slowly. Wheel Chair and disability customers are very well supported. zThey do stop the eye for them. Do not miss the 4d presentation.
"Written July 15, 2019",Worth the experienc,Not mind-blowing but certainly gives you a birds eye view of London. Slow moving and air conditioned capsules make it comfortable for all ages. Suggest doing it at night or on a clear day. 
"Written July 15, 2019",Lovely evening,"My partner and I booked the London eye for 8:15 on a Saturday night. The queue looked very long however it was continuously moving and only took 20 minutes to get to the front. I haven’t been on the eye since I was little so it was nice to go back, the views were lovely at that time of night but you can get better views from the shard. We only paid £30 altogether which was fine, I wouldn’t pay any more for it! "
"Written July 21, 2019",London eye,Beautiful. Definitely worth it. Lines went fast. Not scary at all. Enjoyed it a lot. Would highly recommend
"Written July 21, 2019",Fantastic views of London,"On my bucket list, booked well in advance and we were lucky with a really pleasant day. The Bank holiday was about to begin so preparations were in full swing, crowds collecting so prebooked tickets saved ages of queuing and the actual loading of each capsule was very well organised. It’s a very smooth turn of the great wheel and easy to take photos or a video, really enjoyed it"
"Written July 21, 2019",Mediocre Experience,"The London Eye is one of those tourist attractions that are just what you expect them to be, mediocre and crowded. I will say that the queues, whether fast track or regular, moved pretty fast. They are also pretty efficient in which ways to direct people.  What I do not understand about the entire process, is the price. I thought that the price paid (fast track ticket for one adult and one child) was pretty expensive. As you ascend, you realize that there really is nothing too fascinating about going high in the air to view the skyline of London. If you go during the 2019 season, be aware that renovations for Big Ben and Parliament are ongoing so, you will not get a good photo op there. My advice to you is to either wait until the afternoon to go, when all of the initial crowds have left or wait until later in the evening.  But, overall, i would skip this altogether and walk over the many bridges instead to take in the scenery."
"Written July 21, 2019",Good view of London,"It is a nice thing to do. But it is very expensive, even when you buy the combo with another atraction in London. The view is ok. But you can go to other places in London where you have beautiful views as well and do not need to spend any penny"
"Written July 20, 2019",Good Arial View of London,Popular and crowded. You do get a spectacular 360 degree view of London.  The ride lasts 30 minutes. Very steady ride. Even people with motion sickness can handle this. Not: Buy your tickets in advance if possible. You can buy them onsite as well from multiple kiosks. A 4D movie experience is included with the ticket and is located in the tickets office.
"Written July 20, 2019",Must visit,Must visit This attraction we had some family over so we decided to take them to the London Eye this is definitely a must visit for any tourists visiting London
"Written July 20, 2019",Spectacular view of the city,Busy tourist attraction but the view of the city is well worth it.  All pods are air conditioned and enclosed so you can't fall out.  Careful when you get on and off of the pod as it's still in motion.  Pods are slow enough that it provides a spectacular view of London.
"Written July 20, 2019",Great view!,"Fast and efficient service. The queue moves fast, so don't bother buying the fast track ticket. Great views, especially on sunny days."
"Written July 20, 2019",Fabulous view,So worth going! Just a great view of London. Perfect way to get pictures. Love the fact they don’t pack you in the cars. Plenty of room to move around and see.
"Written July 20, 2019",Are you afraid of heights,"To be honest, this attraction was not on my bucket list but my grandson really wanted to experience it so we went.  The cars hold about 30 people and it moves so slowly that you do not have the sense of being on a carnival ride.  The whole car seems to be made of some type of Plexiglas, including the floor.  My grandson found this very uncomfortable and disorienting and spent most of the rotation sitting on the bench in the middle of the car.   The views are nice but nothing you could not see from other vantage points.  The other thing to be aware of is that the other passengers in your car will compete for the best vantage points and they tend to stay in those spots until a better view is available elsewhere in the car.  If you are not an aggressive person, you probably won't get the photos you were hoping for on this attraction.  Still, the views of historic London are impressive and for those who don't get queasy when they can see what is beneath their feet, it can be a great experience.  "
"Written July 20, 2019",Fun experience ,I visited this. Attraction in the afternoon.  I had a great time and have wonderful memories and pictures.  I purchased a multi ticket online beforehand and saw Shrek and the london dungeon.  I showed up for the river cruise 10 minutes before start time and was thoroughly disappointed that I couldn't ride on the top of the boat because it was full.  A bit of a disappointment since this was my birthday celebration.  I wouldn't get on a subpar trip so we left and had a delightful time at Hard Rock Piccadilly circus!
"Written July 20, 2019",splendid,"If the weather is good , Its spectacular,make sure you book in advance ,to get in on the day can take a few hours"
"Written July 19, 2019",Worth to visit ,"Even if it was a raining day in London, this attraction remains a must to do !! Lovely view on all the major love to visit in London !"
"Written July 19, 2019",Spectacular,I watched a show on NG which was following the construction and engineering.I was fascinated. Great engineering achievement.
"Written July 18, 2019",Wonderful views of London,"We decided to take the London Eye on a spur of the moment. I expected long lines and was prepared to wait for a long time, but despite not purchasing the express tickets (not worth it in my view unless you're in a terrible hurry) and arriving at what I assume is peak time (4-5pm), we were able to get on within 45 minutes. The queue is teed up well ahead of the boarding time and it moves quickly and efficiently. The views are spectacular and I only wish we were there at a different time when the sunlight wasn't as strong."
"Written July 18, 2019",Bored to tears,Fairly friendly ticket-sales staff and fairly competent security staff scaring my 5yr girl. Does not warrant the 30pounds ticket price per adult. What made it average is actually paying 23 pounds each for my 5 yr old who was only tagging along with her older 8yr sister. Then the surprise that the London Eye is fun for those who are afraid of adrenaline. Go do it if you are like Mr Bean
"Written July 17, 2019",London Eye,I recommend getting your tickets ahead of time and give yourself plenty of time to get there! It is absolutely stunning. And if you time it right.....go right before dusk. Amazing to watch the lights of the city go on as the sun goes down!!!!! A must do!!
"Written July 17, 2019",Stop on London before went on British Isles Cruise,We stayed very handy the london Eye.  It takes a hour to go around the Eye and the views were wonderful.  Each compartment holds quite a few people.  You will get great camera shots from up there.
"Written July 17, 2019",Busy but queue moves quickly,Great to see London from a central and high vantage point. Staff efficient rather than friendly. Recommend going earlier in the day if you can manage that.
"Written July 17, 2019",Waste of money,Prepare to enormous queues even if you have prebooked your tickets. The view over London is really amazing but you enjoy it just for 10 minutes or so while you are on top. You can get the same view (including on London Eye) for less if you go to any sky-scraper in around. 
"Written July 6, 2019","An eyesore on the skyline, but a vaguely interesting view.","I have always considered the London Eye (under its many sponsorship brands over the last 20 years) as being a blot on the London riverside skyline.Having finally been persuaded to ride it I find it no less of an intrusion along the river, but the ride was at least novel.  I remain unsure that the minimal entertainment value justifies either its presence or the cost of the ticket, mind."
"Written July 6, 2019",Definitely a must even if it isn't extremely exciting ,"We loved the London Eye. I certainly think that it's a great experience to enjoy in London. You can see so much and get an excellent idea of where everything is. I recommend the skip the line tickets if it's in your budget. We had a much shorter wait than the traditional line, however, if you are going at a slower time, it might be worth it to save the money. By the end, my 10 and 8 year old were asking if it was over yet, but overall, they really enjoyed it. It is air conditioned but perhaps not to American standards. It was quite warm."
"Written July 6, 2019",Nice view,"The price of thirty pounds was quite steep in my opinion, for comparison the Singapore flyer costs around 20 pounds, while the smaller Hong Kong one is three pounds. The view of from the Ferris wheel was nice and not too many people were put into each cabin as I feared would happen. The wait was somewhat long at twenty minutes, but I went during a weekday around 3:00 so probably one of the least busiest times."
"Written July 5, 2019",Stunning views,"Now a modern icon in London, I find the views to be stunning and the experience to a lot of fun.  That being said, it's not the cheapest 30 minutes, and if you add the fast track option it can really add up.  Buying your tickets online 24 hours or more in advance saves you a few dollars, and if you combine it with a river tour, you can save more, but the downfall with buying online is you have to know exactly when you are going to go, eg 1:15-1:30pm.  Regardless of when you go, there will likely be line-ups.  Beware there is a line-up to buy/collect your ticket, then a line-up to get on the London Eye.  To minimize wait time, usually the first one or two hours of the day tend to be better, and better on a weekday than on a weekend.  Of course you can take the fast track option, which can save you anywhere from 30-75 minutes depending on the length of the lines, but at 10 Pounds more per ticket, it's a bit pricey, but time is money. Regardless, the London Eye is a must try experience.  "
"Written July 5, 2019",its a glorified farriswheel,Slow moving large glass domes. Can see London but I found it boring after half of the trip. Did not hold 11 yr olds interest either./
"Written July 5, 2019",Good way to see things from a distance ,"My husband, my 13 year old daughter and myself did this. It was a nice experience but the line was way too long. Not sure I’d be willing to wait in a line like that with small kids. "
"Written July 5, 2019",Wonderful experience,"Not inexpensive and expect very long lines and few if any available seats for waiting.  We paid a few pounds extra for the VIP queue; there was still a wait of about an hour from the time we arrived, but it was well worth it.  Lovely views, lovely photos."
"Written July 5, 2019",Not worth the Money,"I and 3 others booked a slot for the London eye at 1:30 pm when we arrived (half an hour early as instructed) the queue was over an hour, we queried about our time slot but we were just told to get to the back of the queue which was around the corner. We didn't end up going onto the London eye due to the queue times & the heat.Don't use the vending machine in the ticket office either as we attempted to get some water out, it never came out but we were debted £12.We spoke to the staff in the ticket office who confirmed we could get a refund however we booked online so we had to email them and they would refund us. We have emailed the office and haven't heard anything back it has been over a week and from reading other reviews it doesn't look hopeful."
"Written July 4, 2019",Fast pass but not necessary,"As many people have said, a fast pass and prebooking are truly not necessary. Having said that, I paid for the fast pass and it only saved me no more than 5 mins!  So buy regular tickets when you want to go and just line up in the regular line. It’s an awesome 30 mins as it gives you a cool view from up high. Great for a few pics and for the experience. Would probably not do it again as it was £40 pounds each!"
"Written July 3, 2019",Much better than general admission,"Two years ago, we used General Admission and were frustrated by the wait.  This time, we purchased the Fast Track and are so glad we did.  Tremendous difference.  Well worth the few dollars extra."
"Written July 14, 2019",Great view from London eye,"Gives a god view of London. Very crowded, but the lines move really fast. You can buy tickets online and get in at any time. You don't have to wait for the appointment time. "
"Written July 14, 2019",A must do!,Amazing views of London.  This is a must do tire tourist attraction.  I recommend out pre-buy your tickets to avoid the long lines/queue.  You won't get a better view of London anywhere else.  
"Written July 14, 2019",Great view,"Great view from the London Eye. Lovely to see the city from above. However, the queue system was a bit strange and it took a while before we got to enter. Air conditioned chariots was a pleasent surprise"
"Written July 14, 2019",Not worth the price,Expensive and crowded. London has many fine points but the views from the eye are not that impressive. 
"Written July 14, 2019",Mediocre Corporate Cash Grab - WASTE OF MONEY,"This attraction sucked because(1) Your precious money is gone in c.30 minutes. Compare to London Tower or Windsor Castle, where you can spend the entire day for less money and see way more cool stuff! The london eye is actually a high rip-off in comparison.(2) The view is not actually that great because London has a lame skyline. Have you every been in an airplane? If so, you don't need to visit the London Eye. The view of parliament is just as good from the bridge.(3) It's a blatant corporate cash grab. What does Coke have to do with it? Nothing, except that you are bombarded with Coke products while you stand in line, which took way too long.(4) They intentionally mislead you at the start. ""Get your picture taken! It's free!"" they say. Well, technically that's true, but if you want to HAVE to the picture, you're going to have to pay up.(5) The process of getting on and off is stressful because the thing doesn't stop. Why not? Because it would slow down the CASH MACHINE."
"Written July 14, 2019",Gaint Wheel of iconic city ,Experienced the VIP experience with champagne and it was worth it . Starts with a lounge access for waiting and then you have a guide who takes you up with champagne . A 30 minutes view which gives you all possible landmarks of London along with ecstasy of sipping champagne . Must to do in London
"Written July 14, 2019",Buy the best ticket you can afford,"Unless you really like standing in lines, spend the money to get a reserved time.  Arrive a half-hour earlier than your scheduled time and sit in the outdoor cafe to wait.  The ride itself is always impressive, so it's worth not getting into the pod drenched in sweat from standing in the sun."
"Written July 13, 2019",London Eye,The London Eye was a good attraction and a classic London tourist spot. There were good views around the circle and the pods are quite large and don’t feel crowded. The whole ride only takes about 30 minutes. We used the fast pass line which let us walk right onto the ride without waiting in line which was great.
"Written July 13, 2019",Great but long queues,We really enjoyed the London Eye but the queues were horrendous.We understand though as it's London and therefore not the London Eyes fault.
"Written July 13, 2019",A birds eye view from the London Eye,What a view! 180 degrees! A great experience . We had to line up for a while but it was certainly with the wait! 
"Written July 10, 2019",Amazing ,"Needless to say that The London Eye is hugely popular, hence there were mega queues, all seemingly merging into one with different ‘tour guides’ looking for their Groups etc.Not clear that, in the commotion, you have to get your tickets in The Ticket Hall across the way and NOT at The Eye.The Ticket Office was also rammed to capacity with many, many differing languages. However once all that was sorted out the operation was quick and efficient.The views are spectacular - the pods are not crammed with people and so it is very relaxing and most enjoyable and fun.Well Done!"
"Written July 10, 2019",the fast track is great,"the whole experience was very nice. We were very lucky as the weather was beautiful, but apart from that the 4D film before is excellent and the fast track was super as there was a very long line even at 10am"
"Written July 9, 2019",Will do it again!,"We visited the London Eye as part of an MBNA Clipper catamaran river cruise. The whole experience from boarding to leaving leaving the catamaran was great. We were able to enjoy the sights from both the perspective of the river and from way up high. The passenger capsule was large enough for guests to move about and take advantage of the 360 views. Next time we are in London, we will do it again!"
"Written July 9, 2019",A Birds Eye View,"The London Eye is a nice way of getting a view over the city.On research, you are encouraged to purchase your ticket online. There is a lot of fuss over purchasing a fast track or flexi ticket. Personally, I feel this is unnecessary. I would recommend that you purchase a standard ticket online and then get there for 9-9:30 in the morning to get ahead of the queue. It is much like being on a big wheel and lasts 30mins.We did get some fab photos of the city"
"Written July 9, 2019",One of those must see and do places,bought the ticket on one their busiest days!! Saturday July 6th 2019. long lines but if you want to visit during day time definitely recommend the fast track ticket. we went in the regular line around 630 and took us 30 minutes to the ride.
"Written July 9, 2019",Nice way to view the city and pass a little time,"The London Eye was our first stop on our tour of the city. Was hoping to get some information about where things are and what we were seeing, but no such luck. You pretty much had to do your own research to know what you were seeing.  I do suggest you buy your tickets beforehand so you can skip the line to purchase them. It was cool to see the city from high up, but if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't bother."
"Written July 9, 2019",Great views,"This is a one timer.  We had a clear day so the views were great.  However, they are placing too many people in each pods and if you are short, like me, the other people block the views and camera shots."
"Written July 9, 2019","Glad we did it, but only if you have extra time!","The views from the Eye were amazing, but with so much being repaired, you see A LOT of cranes and scaffolding! i'm glad we did it, but if you are crunched for time in London, maybe do something else. I would do this if you had extra time, but maybe skip it in a rushed trip."
"Written July 8, 2019",Nice but not the best way to view ,"A little bit expensive price, the view are good but not much as expected.Very long cue and hot weather in summer, and the online appointment that we did has no meaning. "
"Written July 8, 2019",A good attraction for seeing some of the London sights,As with most of these attractions it’s best to get there early and also if you pre-book tickets it usually works out cheaper. It’s a really good idea to have a map with you before you go into one of the pods because then you can see all the attractions from the pod and link them to places on the map if you’re not quite sure what is what. It takes about 30 minutes to go around in one complete revolution from start to finish. It’s right next door to the London dungeon and a couple of other attractions so it may be worth looking at buying a ticket for several attractions all at once and doing more than one thing as that works out much cheaper.  
"Written July 13, 2019",Great View,"My wife, my daughter and my three grandchildren had a great time during our London Eye Fast Track Ticket with a Professional Guide - a VIP Experience.  Our guide met us at the London Ticket Office at the appointed time.  We skipped past long lines waiting to get tickets and were soon on our way.  We had a great view as we rose silently over the Thames River.  Our guide pointed out various sites and answered questioned posed to him by our group.  In addition to the six of us, there were only four other people on our particular conveyance (gondola).  A great time.  Well worth the money not to have to wait endlessly in long lines."
"Written July 13, 2019",Great views,"Fun to visit but very touristy.  Enjoyed the area of Southwalk.  Be sure to book tickets ahead of time, lines get packed."
"Written July 13, 2019",Simply awesome!,Absolutely fantastic! Must do if you are in London. Had the fast track ticket because of the long lines and got in with in 10 minutes. Amazing views of London and all the top attractions near the Westminster bridge. If you are afraid of roller coasters or Ferris wheels this is still no problem. No wobble at all and goes very smooth. The 4D experience afterward is also very nice. Don’t miss!
"Written July 13, 2019",Loved it.,This is a great tourist atttaction. Really love it. The 360 degree view of london was amazing. The rides moves at a great pace so you could enjoy a lot and take plenty of pictures.Queing up does take time however they move it fast. Overall a great experience 
"Written July 12, 2019",A great view of London ,This is a great way to get a total view of London and the surrounding areas! Make sure you get the fast pass type of ticket to avoid standing in line forever. Get off the Eye and then go right over to the boats. You’ll get lots of information that will help you navigate through London 
"Written July 12, 2019",Beautiful views,"After many visits to London, we finally found the time to visit the iconic London eye! The views were wonderful."
"Written July 12, 2019",Great views and a fun ride,"Went to the London Eye with a 10 year old, a few teenagers and adults and everybody enjoyed the experience.  The lines were not too long with the fast track ticket."
"Written July 12, 2019","London eye with 10, 13 and 15 year old","During our London visit, each child got to pick an activity. My 15 year-old picked the London Eye. Beautiful view, fun experience, but pricey at over $30/person no child rate. So consider whether this is a must do. Otherwise would have been 5 star. Having heard stories of 2 hour wait times in regular cue during peak season, I shelled out extra for the reserved tickets. We booked for 7:45 as wanted to end our day with it so as not to break up touring during the day (most sites close earlier in the evening so good to plan around least flexible hours first). When we got there saw no line for either fast pass or walk on. Can’t say whether that’s because they close the walk on line earlier or whether there was no walk on line. Did cross my mind if I made a mistake paying extra for reserved, but had the situation been reversed and we missed London eye due to cue, I would have regretted.Recommend going after seeing sites in London as kids enjoyed spotting and pointing out bridges we had seen or places we had been. Extra perk, we were looking for a place to have dinner after London Eye and had perfect scouting view of eateries next to Thames. Having spotted tents we walked North next to Thames to discover a summer festival with food tents ranging from crepes, to Thai to burgers all in a festive environment. Felt we happened upon a wonderful end to our evening with good food and ambiance"
"Written July 11, 2019",Very Good,"Booked for this only to see that it had broken down and out of service in our time slot. A quick trip next door to Shrek's Adventureand we noticed it was working again. Staff brilliant at getting us on board. Super helpful. Sunday afternoon is super busy. Honestly,, it is worth the fast trackto save the hassle. "
"Written July 10, 2019",Informative commentary on river cruise,"My daughter had always wanted to do the London Eye, I am not keen on heights so had always put it off. On our recent trip back to the U.K I could put it off no longer!The queues were really long but they did move swiftly and for £6 for an adult bolt on and a £3 child bolt on for the river cruise it was a no brainer. The London Eye was okay, our pod was full so I got jostled and feet trodden on a lot, didn’t help my phobia one not and I frankly couldn’t wait to get back down. There was also a lot of cranes, if construction views are your bag then you will love it, otherwise I would give it a miss.The boat trip however was awesome. I had previously lived in London but still found out new facts. Chloe was really good, informative and with a dry sense of humour that kept me engaged and listening. I would personally take the boat trip over the Eye...personal opinion."
"Written July 3, 2019",London eye ,On every my visit to London I visited London Eye because I fallen in love with panoramic view from the top. I suggest to take fast track pass because difference between normal ticket and fast track is not much expensive. Try to be there 20 minute before sunset and catch up amazing view and see how all lights of London are turning on.
"Written July 3, 2019",Good sight-seeing combo deal,"We got a package that included London eye, hop-on-off bus and a river cruise.  A great combo to explore the various sights in London.  Provides the flexibility to just sit and listen to the audio guide while seeing the sights from the bus, or hop-off to actually explore each of the top tourist destinations.  Either way, you won’t fear missing out, you own your own experience!"
"Written July 3, 2019",Always a great adventure,The London eye is always a great way to introduce you to London or as a culminating event so you recognize places you’ve already seen.  I always take my student groups up there on the last night for one more picture and to recall what we’ve been doing for several days.  It is so easy to buy ahead online and print out at the kiosks when you arrive.  Fast Trak is a great idea if you hate to stand in line.
"Written July 3, 2019",Great views,"Fun experience. It was raining when we went, but we still enjoyed the ride and the views! Goes so slowly you don't even know you are moving!! Highly recommend!!"
"Written July 3, 2019",Just Great!,LondonSuper superb!686275209When in London you must take in this spectacular landmark experience!!We as a family loved it....Great views...great staff...great value...Just do it✔
"Written July 2, 2019",Nice view,Try the Fast Pass it will save you time in line that is better spent having a few pints at the local pub. The ride is about 30 minutes but goes fast so have those cameras ready. Nice time would definitely book again. 
"Written July 2, 2019",Nice view,"You can get a really nice view from London in aprox 30min. I dont think you actually need an skip the line pass if you go early, but I would definitely recommend buying a + river cruise ticket"
"Written July 2, 2019",Waste of time and money!,"Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. We were really excited to go on this on our weekend visit to London. The que on Friday afternoon in the scorching sun was huge, so we decided to pay extra (£10 per person on top of £30 per person tickets) for fast track tickets. We qued in fast track for more than half an hour! Each pod was crammed. Couldn’t move for folded up buggies, baby carriers and people. Buggies shouldn’t be allowed on in my opinion - the children have to be out of them and they have to be folded up, so pointless and take up space and are a hazard. Can’t get a good view due to number of people all fighting to stand at glass. Glass is dirty. Really disappointed by the experience and would not ever recommend this! "
"Written July 2, 2019",An interesting whell of fortune,I personally don't like it but many people like to get into it to have a nice view of London right at the Thames. I prefer many other places where you have a similar or better view of the city.
"Written July 2, 2019",What A View!,"Although the lines were sorta long, it is so worth the wait. A great way to get a birds-eye view of a great city. I highly recommend it to any London newbie!"
"Written July 8, 2019",Beautiful view at a cost,We went on a the London Eye as we thought it was a must. The view was spectacular and loved the experience however it was very expensive (close to $240 AUD). You do get an awesome view but I’m not sure it was worth the cost! Best to couple it with Madame Tassauds for a better price if you’re keen .
"Written July 8, 2019",never made it past the queue,"too many people. arrived exactly at prebooked slot, and was told that we needed to wait for another hour to get in. our schedule didnt allow, so we skipped.oversold experience."
"Written July 8, 2019",VIP Champagne Experience,"I would really recommend this. No queueing, relaxing in the VIP lounge with a champagne cocktail overlooking the eye before being escorted to the cabin for the trip. More champagne on board. Excellent , no fuss, no tress"
"Written July 7, 2019",Spectacular views,"From boarding the MBNA Clipper until the completion of the ride on the London Eye, the views of the skyline were spectacular. The cabin was comfortable and the aft section was a good location for photos on the river. There is plenty of room in the capsule on the Eye for passengers to view the sights from every angle."
"Written July 7, 2019",Great way to see London from above,"Great way to see London from above .Spacious gondola with seating if needed ,but can be very busy in peak times "
"Written July 7, 2019",Nice views ,"As Merlin Premium passholders, we decided to do the London Eye. We went to the information stand in order to book a time slot and the man told us 4:15, 20 minutes passed and we looked at the ticket he had issued us with and it said 4:45 so we had a slight panic as we had things to do at 5:15 (the attraction is about 30 minutes long) - we went back and he said “yeah you need to queue at 4:15” so that’s what we did. The whole thing was really confusing. Not quite sure why our ticket said 4:45 if we were allowed in at 4:15? As Merlin holders, we get fast track which is definitely worth it. The queues were huge!! The London Eye itself is good for views across London. You can see many tourist attractions, such as Buckingham Palace. If I wasn’t a pass holder, then I wouldn’t pay for the Eye though as I feel it’s overpriced. I would definitely do this again, but only with my Merlin pass. "
"Written July 7, 2019",Eye in the sky,"Do This!!  A phenomenal view of London and all the iconic buildings.  The pods are spacious, have seating in the middle and are easy to move around in while you go on your journey to the top and back down again.  Plenty of photo opportunities and smooth and quiet.  Definitely recommend."
"Written July 6, 2019",Nice view,2013Everything about this was awesome. This is a must in London. Very nice highlight of a bday trip .Viewing London at the top on the London eye while sipping champagne🍾.Great memories..It's kid friendly as well minus the champagne😄
"Written July 6, 2019",Expensive and Not Worth It,"They say this is the most visited tourist attraction in the UK.  It certainly feels that way but having done it I can't imagine why.  The fast track ticket did get us priority entrance but when we went at 8:30 in the evening there were hardly any lines.  For a family of 4 the fast track tickets cost us nearly $175.  You enter a pod with a dozen other people and then spend 30 minutes seeing the London skyline.  However, with the exception of Parliament/Big Ben right across the river there really isn't all that much to see.  Its difficult to take pictures with the glass surrounding you and the views just aren't that exciting.  It feels like this is something you ""have to do"" when you visit London but I'd recommend you skip it.  It just wasn't worth it.  Even my kids - ages 10 & 13 - didn't rank this as a highlight of our London trip.  If it is true that this is the most visited tourist attraction then it is very likely that it is the least re-visited attraction."
"Written July 6, 2019",I liked it a lot more than I thought I would,"I was here with a University group in London for 48 hours on the way home to the USA.  Although I thought of it as too much of a tourist trap, it was one of the most requested activities from my group.  When I found out there a huge discounts for school and university groups I added it and the river cruise associated with it to our agenda.  It was great.I am afraid of heights, so I wasn't actually sure I would not chicken out.  It turns out that I had no problem at all.  The pads are so big, it turns so slowly, and the support spokes are so massive that I had absolute no fear at all.By getting the river tour first, we knew what to look for from the eye.I am glad that my students talked me into adding it to the London itinerary and encouraged me to go on board."
"Written July 2, 2019",London Eye experience,Prepaid tickets so just got in the long queue which moved very quickly. Tickets scanned and we were in a pod overlooking London within 5 minutes. Slow and steady rotation and on the day we went it was lovely clear and sunny so a great view. Don't particularly believe it is great value as it is quite expensive ( £30 each at the time of going ) for a half an hour view of London. You wouldn't need to do it again though.
"Written July 2, 2019",Eye for London ,A great way to start a day to see whole of London. Awesome experience with my love one. One of the highlights of our anniversary trip to Europe.
"Written July 2, 2019",A must do!!,The London Eye is amazing. The view from the eye is breath taking. It’s a Ferris wheel with each capsule able to hold 20 or so people. It moves slowly so you can get beautiful pics. Highly recommend!!
"Written July 2, 2019",Good view. Nothing else.,"Good view of London. Enough time to take pics. Make sure you take pics when you are at the top, as it's only downhill from there. The river cruise is also good. The guide was fun, though a but lame but who cares.The cruise takes you till tower bridge, which you might have thought was London bridge until now, but it's not.The queue is big but fast progressing."
"Written July 2, 2019",Not scary at all; great photo ops.,"Do this, if nothing else, for the views. You'll get some great pics and it's not scary at all. They don't crowd the cars too much and there's plenty of room to walk around. It's a super-touristy thing to do, but pretty cool. "
"Written July 1, 2019",Great view, This was an enjoyable event with great views of London. The lines moved fast. I highly recommend this stop on a London vacation. 
"Written July 1, 2019",ok but too crowded,The High Roller in Las Vegas is so much better than this one.  But this one of course has all the views of historic London.  it's just too crowded though.  They should open longer hours.
"Written June 30, 2019",Look for a 2 for 1 Train Ride Ticket,"Excellent views for the first time visitor to London.  You can get great pictures of the London, if it is not raining.  Gives a good overview of London and where you've been or plan on going."
"Written June 30, 2019",Great!! ,We had to que for a time but it was worth the wait....something I would encourage everyone to do once! It's an experience! 
"Written June 30, 2019","Walked right in, but the regular line wait was maybe 10 minutes","We pre-booked the Eye online and purchased tickets which allowed us to arrive anytime and be fast tracked. With the online savings, it was about the same price as if we'd bought the ticket on-site.  The Eye is enjoyable but it's over pretty quickly for the price.  We were lucky as we had only 2 other couples on board with us, but the next two cars were full of children on a school outing. We also used the tickets for the additions, which were okay, but the movie is so-so and the lounge is not worth it (pricey drinks, full and noisy).  That all said, if i were going to the Eye on a busy, sunny day, I would still purchase a fast-track ticket."
"Written June 16, 2019",London in a day,"We were staying in Paris and could only get to London for a day, via Eurostar. So knowing how limited our time was, we booked skip the line tickets for the 28th May but we booked tickets that did not lock us into a time and even though they were a bit more expensive, it worked with our limited time. Once we made it to the Eye, we went into a separate skip the line queue (which really wasn't much of a queue) and we were on the  Eye within 10 mintues at the most after arriving there. A great way to get an overall view of London, being able to see certain landmarks from the Eye that we just could not get to by foot or bus. Each pod seemed to only have about 12 people in them which made it easy to get close to the glass for photos. The pod we were in was clean  and roomy. There was also a bench seat in the middle if you needed to sit. Took about 1/2 or slightly more but so glad we did this and booked skip the line and not lock in time. "
"Written June 16, 2019",Nice view,"The ferris wheel itself is high, but not particularly pretty. The view is good, but there are probably other places to get a view of London from above for a cheaper price. Maybe it's a better experience during sunset. The ticket includes an ""amazing 4D experience"", which is, sorry to say, not amazing."
"Written June 16, 2019",Great view ,This provides a great view of the city and was not crowded when we arrived late in the afternoon.  Kind of pricey for what you get but the views are worth it.  The 4d video is fair.  Could skip it.  
"Written June 15, 2019",Don’t miss it,"The views are spectacular, this activity is well worth doing. If you have the first ticket @ 10 am, they tell you to arrive @ 9:30, but that just meant we had to stand in the rain for 20 minutes; they won’t let you in early and nothing around there opens until 10. Also, we did the fast track tix, which was fine, but if you’re going to go early, they were letting walk ins in along with the fast trackers. Go early and then take the river stroll to the tower bridge, maybe 3-4 miles, a very pleasant walk."
"Written June 15, 2019",Informative view ,"As a claustrophobic and afraid of heights person, I can recommend this activity!  Do go. The view is spectacular. The movement very slow and steady. And the focus is out from you - not really straight down. Do get a map to help you locate points of interest vee went in a light rain and it was still OK. "
"Written June 15, 2019",Great views,Such a pretty way to see London at night.  Our group enjoyed the ride and it was the perfect amount of time. 
"Written June 15, 2019",Incredible View!,"I was wowed by the views...it doesn’t seem that tall by big city standards, so I didn’t expect much, yet you can see everything in London from the Eye. So glad we went! The 30 minutes went by too quickly.The price is steep (60 Pounds for 2 pp for same day, slightly cheaper online but the site wouldn’t let us book tickets, it just didn’t work which seemed to happen with more than one location in London). A group of extremely loud Italians literally yelled the entire time we were in the Eye, people should use their “inside voices” and be considerate of others in the cars or reserve a private car. I’ll have to dub our video to drown them out."
"Written June 15, 2019",Great,Went on the London eye with my 10 year old son. Enjoyed the ride with great views and not too many people in the pod with us. 
"Written June 14, 2019",Bird's eye view,Enjoy unrivaled views of London from the Eye. Ensure to plan your trip on a sunny or clear day so that you may enjoy unobscured views. Twilight will be a good time to vist as one can see day and night views. The ride lasts around 30-35 minutes.
"Written June 14, 2019",Lives up to its name,"Good views of all the main landmarks beside the Thames. They don’t fill up the capsules, which is good as there is enough space inside to move around comfortably and take pictures and enjoy the view from all sides.The queues are long, and it makes sense to choose the fast-track ticket if you are not in a mood to wait in the slow-moving winding queue."
"Written June 26, 2019",American Mom and 12 Year Old Son,"Stunning view- paid for faster admission, which looking at the lines was worth it.  Enjoyed the 4D movie ahead of time.  I feel like it is a must see, but not something you'd ever feel like you had to repeat.  If you have ever been to Wall Drug in the U.S., I'd say it offers that same feeling.  You have to do it, but you'd say once is enough."
"Written June 26, 2019",A must do London attraction,My teenage children loved the wheel and the staff are excellent. Very friendly get your photo take but book online to save yourself time!
"Written June 26, 2019",london eye,"a sort of ""must do"" which doesn't disappoint. Go early - it's a very crowded area and the queue at the Eye is fairly slow.  We were ""with wheelchair"" and were well looked after - somewhat of a fast track.   The pods are not overcrowded and have a bit of seating.  If you know London sights it is nice,  if you are seeing them for the first time it must be fairly amazing.If you can - go when you have visited a few other places so you can orientate - pick your previous places out even!"
"Written June 26, 2019",Great ride,"It is a little expensive, considering London isn't the most beautiful city from above, but we hadn't been on a wheel before so we really enjoyed it."
"Written June 26, 2019",On high. 4,Usually we avoid this type of mega attraction. However with 12 and 14 year old granddaughters who suggested it. Bought tix online and saw a huge line when we arrived. Joined it and surprisingly moved quite fast. Boarding the module was a little thrilling as it was moving. It was clean and not overcrowded. The ride took about 30 minutes.  Of course the views were spectacular. Lot a pix and fun with girls. A good trip.
"Written June 25, 2019",Dry sense of humor of River Cruise Director was hysterical,The London Eye provided excellent views of London. The guided River Cruise provided a great history lesson with humor and wit. A great way to see the city!
"Written June 25, 2019",Day out!!,"What an excellent way to spend 1/2 hour seeing London from a great height. The actual organisational side of things are excellent, your not in the queues very long and then the staff promptly gets you on and your away. A fantastic attraction to visit absolutely brilliant!!"
"Written June 24, 2019",Not quite worth the money ,For two people at 60-80 pound based on whether you go fast track. If you want a good view go with the shard 
"Written June 24, 2019",the view is breathtaking,I went on a sunny afternoon and it was great I could see well outside the city . Buy the fast track ticket it is worth the extra 10 pounds . It only took 15 min verses 45 min in the regular line. 
"Written June 24, 2019",Vacation ,"Buy the fast pass a day ahead of time, saves you money and time. We arrived 5 minutes before our scheduled time and were immediately entered in the que. took about 20 minutes to board while walk up ticket purchasers it was taking over an hour. Could see very far and the views were gorgeous. Highly recommended."
"Written June 22, 2019",Tourist trap,"It was ok - I'm not sure about the hype. Yes, you see London from a birds eye view but was it worth it waiting in line? Our 'pod' had several zealous photo 'hogs' so that was annoying, as well. I'd take a river ride before you spend your money on this."
"Written June 21, 2019",Amazing views!,Highly recommend- the pictures and the views are amazing!  Well worth the cost of the ticket - buy skip the line tickets (in advance if you can) and avoid the lines.
"Written June 21, 2019",Not to be missed,Great first stop on any visit to London.   You can get a bird's eye view of the city and what you want to see later in the day.
"Written June 21, 2019",Not bad!,"This was my first time on the Eye, however I have previously climbed to the top of St Paul's, and the view from up there is just as good in my opinion. Although, you do get a full 360 degree view from the London Eye. You're on the Eye for about 20 mins. I feel a little longer might be nicer (I don't think I would mind 2 rotations), but for a view of London, this is something you should definitely do."
"Written June 20, 2019",Definitely worth the visit!!,What a view!! Very comfortable and easy to get great photos from all angles. Fast track is a must!! Best part of our trip.
"Written June 20, 2019",Nothing to see here.,"The lines are long, the ride is boring, the kids were bored, and the tickets are too expensive for what the experience.  Zero things to see above London, sans construction.  We counted at least 41 construction cranes in the skyline.  So so Boring.  Save your Euro!!!!  This thing should be free and it’s in a completely tourist trappy lane."
"Written June 19, 2019",Kind of expensive and crowded,"It's a good way to see a birds-eye view of London, but the ride itself is kind of underwhelming.  Somewhat crowded pods, and if one of the guests has BO, as one did in our pod :(, it makes for a LONG 30-minute ride around the loop."
"Written June 19, 2019",Amazing views of the city,An incredible experience and a must do in the city of London. The views are amazing. I only wish it lasted longer- maybe two rotations!
"Written June 19, 2019",Great views of London ,"The lines were long but we didn’t wait long to get in. You can sit in the middle, stand by the windows or a little of both, the choice is yours! The views are beautiful, even on a rainy day "
"Written June 19, 2019",Birds Eye View of London,"Fast track entrance is a must.  Half hour to soak up all the sights of Westminster Bridge, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, The Shard and the River Thames as well as sights from around the city.  The only down side was I booked it for 8pm thinking we would see London with night views but it is still light at 9.30pm in June"
"Written June 30, 2019",Fantastic views,You really get to see the London skyline and the ride is also fun.  Thd capsules are completely enclosed and very comfortable.  You can walk around for different views or sit on the bench in the middle.  I walked and got some great pictures.
"Written June 30, 2019",Worth a look!,"Not much to say that hasn’t been said before here.Its one of these things that is worth doing once, the best views I think are over Westminster area.Aim for slightly later in the day, usually not so busy and sunset makes the backdrop over the big smoke a lot nicer!"
"Written June 29, 2019",What I expected ,This was a nice diversion from museums but was about what I expected. Not a disappointment but also not a wow. 
"Written June 29, 2019","Nice, expensive and crowded",We bought a 20% discounted ticket on one of the bus tours. It is comparably expensive and you should know that buying the fast lane is only a reasonable option if you're going afternoon with regular lines being insanely long. Otherwise it's not worth the money.Nice view. Very well organized boarding and security. Can't complain. Is it worth it? Dunno. It's good for some stunning pictures. That's for sure.
"Written June 29, 2019",Great experience-better than expected,My husband and I visited the London eye for the first time. The staff were really friendly and helpful. They couldn’t have been more courteous. The queues looked long but they moved really fast. We didn’t pre book tickets-just turned up and within about 20 minutes we were in one of the capsules. The capsules are very sturdy. No rocking about or anything. You basically feel like you’re in a big oval shaped living room made of glass!! You get really amazing views across London and can see a lot of the historical sites from the London eye. I would recommend to everyone to try it out at least once!
"Written June 28, 2019",London eye and river cruise,Definitely worth the money to bump up to fast track on the London eye. Wonderful combo ticket since they were side by side
"Written June 28, 2019","Slow moving, pushy tourists with selfie sticks",We got trampled a bit in our short line on and during the ride. Nice city views. Hope you get nicer people beside you in the ride.
"Written June 28, 2019","Expensive, but must visit once","The ticket costs 30£, plus we bought fast track for 10£, because this place is always full of people, even if it’s a weekday. With fast track we sat in the cabin immediately and enjoyed beautiful views. It makes a round for approximately 25 minutes, there are 22-23 people in the cabin. I would say that it’s the place you should visit once in your life, just to put a tick✔️. Bring your camera and family with friends with you!"
"Written June 28, 2019",Great views even on a rainy day,Wonderful time on the eye.  It moves slow enough that you can see a lot of London.  Easy on and off even though it doesn't stop
"Written June 27, 2019",Enjoyable,"The ride on the London Eye was rather enjoyable.  It was a little overpriced, but I'm glad we went up as we got some good pictures."
"Written June 14, 2019",Fun time!,The london eye is a must do in london itd seems and while it is a little overpriced (£27) it is a very short but nice time to see the city. But there are cheaper and even free alternatives to getting high up views of the city
"Written June 14, 2019",Popular London feature,We decided at the last minute to visit the Eye and paid the premium for the fast track to avoid some of the queues. The ride itself isn’t spectacular although the engineering is impressive. What is spectacular are the views from the ever changing elevations on both sides and if you are lucky enough to have a clear weather day great views over London and beyond are available. The cars are clean and security checks each car after every group exits which is comforting. The ride lasts about 40 minutes and although quite e pensive is worth doing once.
"Written June 13, 2019",Fun Activity!,"Fun activity with excellent views of the city.  We had a Fast Track with our tour group which made it great.  Line was really long and not sure I would have felt the same if had to wait a long time.  A definite need-to-do your first time in London; however, one time is enough."
"Written June 13, 2019",Upgrade Your Tour,We paid for the private guide and champagne experience.  It was well worth the few extra pounds.  We were there in the afternoon when there were a lot of school tours.  We were able to skip the line and we only had around 15 people in our capsule.  We could have ended up in a capsule with 30 school-aged children.  I didn't need the crowded capsule.  The champagne was an added bonus.
"Written June 13, 2019",London Eyr,Timing is everything.  Avoid weekend late here. Lines are much shorter during the weekdays. Views are spectacular. Best time of day is in late evening as the sun sets on the city.
"Written June 13, 2019",Rounding out our trip to Londom,"As our daughter did 5 yrs ago, on our last night in London, we rode the London Eye. Although it had been a rainy and cold day, the Eye gave us spectacular views of the city we love. Amazing. New family tradition!"
"Written June 13, 2019",London Eye,This attraction is definitely worth a visit. I would suggest the fast track option for a much faster line.  Pick up a map or something that note the surrounding sites so you can see what is where.  Great views!
"Written June 11, 2019",Must see,This is amazingly inefficient so plan to spend lots of time in lots of stupid little es. It it’s worth being able to see the whole city on a clear day
"Written June 11, 2019",Great experience,Just been on the London Eye with my mum and had a great time. I’m not very good with heights but because there were so many buildings and attractions to see from the London Eye I forgot how high it actually reaches. Would highly recommend doing this activity as it is great for all age groups.
"Written June 11, 2019",Awesome place to be!,I enjoyed the visit on the London Eye with my Fiancé! It was a life time experience. The queue well manage and the eye has got reasonable amount of person in it at a time. We took pictures which came out clean and clear after the sighting of the City of London from the peak of the Eye! Wonderful experience! 
"Written June 24, 2019",London eye visit,"The spirit, the crowd, the ambience are perfect. A must visit. BUT, the ‘London Eye” itself is disappointing. It covers very little of London and without any audio in background, one does not does not understand of whatever little is seen. I could have better look of Westminster Abbey and Big Ben, from the ground. Or better take a boat cruise.If you are on short visit, better avoid"
"Written June 23, 2019",This Is a Must!,We made reservations for the champagne experience and it was worth every penny! We did this our first day in London and it was such a great experience. This is a must for a first visit to London.

"Written June 23, 2019",Amazing views,"Went here after visiting the tower of london and the river cruise -- decided to do fast track since it was raining and very crowded, we got on in about 10 minutes.  The ride takes approximately 30 min, it is slow moving and you have amazing views of the area.  You will share the pod with about 10 other people and there are seats, just not for everyone so you can stand to take pictures and sit to rest.  It was worth doing."
"Written June 23, 2019",Visit to check this off your bucket list,"London Eye gives great views of this great city.  That is only to be expected.  However, as a complete experience, I didn't find it first class mainly because of the long waiting time in the queue on a Saturday.  What's the point in reserving a 15min time slot and waiting in the queue for 45min?  At the very least, it disturbs your other plans for the day. Go if you need to tick this off your list.  Or maybe when the waiting is slightly bearable on weekdays.  I bought a combo ticket which included London Eye, Madame Tussauds and Bigbus Classic tour.  It turns out significantly cheaper than doing these attractions individually."
"Written June 23, 2019",Great experience and awesome view but very crowded in carriages,"Worth doing because it’s the London Eye, but the carriages get very very crowded which makes the experience not as enjoyable as it could be. It can be hard to move around the carriage and get good photos. Would recommend doing but just be prepared."
"Written June 23, 2019",Silver wedding celebrations,"We loved every minute of our experience upon the eye. Queuing did not take very long, the only issue us tyd positioningnof the sweet cart inside of the entrance, this caused bottle necks where people were buying drinks etc. But all in all would visit again and would recommend it"
"Written June 23, 2019","Great views, very crowded. ","As you can imagine travelling on a sunny Saturday in June this was very busy. The queue even though you’ve booked a time slot looks huge but to be fair moves quickly  and is managed well. The views over London are spectacular but it would be nice if people were more considerate in the pods in terms of sharing the views, especially when you have small children that want to see but some people won’t move at all. It is very expensive as well, I realise it’s a prime attraction in a capital city but still stings a bit! "
"Written June 22, 2019",London Eye Fast Track,This is a fantastic way to see all of London.  Important...do not buy your tickets ahead of time.  Weather in London can be crystal clear and see forever. Or it can have fog come in and you can't even see one bridge which ruins the whole experience.  We bought our fast track and had a beautiful day and experience. The next day was fog and rain. That said plan carefully
"Written June 22, 2019",A billion dollars but the kids liked it ,"This was insanely expensive but it was the one thing my 6 yr old asked to do, so we did. He seemed to really enjoy it. I would have preferred a cheaper and shorter ride. My 3 yr old threw a fit & I felt bad for all the people (lots of them) trapped in the pod with us. They put a lot more people in one pod than I imagined. I will say, I did pay extra for the fast lane tickets. Otherwise we would have waited forever. There’s a kiosk right inside the ticket office, so you can purchase the tickets yourself. Super fast & convenient. Views were of course phenomenal. "
"Written June 5, 2019",London Eye afternoon visit,"London Eye was ok, nothing special I would add. We have visited in the afternoon, so maybe during the evening is more attractive.You have a nice view on the city and is quite relaxing activity. "
"Written June 5, 2019",My Favorite place in London,"The view from Top is spell bounding, and seems like a short ride and so smooth that you will not realize how quick the ride ends!! Must Visit, and be prepared to stand in long ques !!"
"Written June 4, 2019",River Cruise Okay/London Eye Spectacular,"The river cruise was just okay, but don't miss the London Eye, the views were spectacular.  I highly recommend the London Eye, the river cruise, not the so much."
"Written June 4, 2019",Unique Experience,First of all...purchase the tickets that bypass the long lines.  Also worth purchasing the book that includes a map of everything you will see as you go around...takes about 30 minutes.  
"Written June 4, 2019",A bit of a let down,"London eye is like one of the most iconic places when you think of London. And maybe because of that I was full of expectations when going into this. The service is okay, even With a line we got in fairly quickly, but it was kinda disappointing for me. The view was ok, almost the but not all that, for the money your paying you are there for half an hour, a bit stuck on the angles the capsules are at the moment. It ends kinda quickly and even though the view is nice it is kind of overpriced and super touristy, you're assaulted by memorabilia entering and leaving. Not awful but not the best experience..."
"Written June 4, 2019",Pleasant visit with my mother in law in her wheelchair,"The superb staff gave us all the help needed! Certainly, beat the ques. Lovely view of London. Never been at night so that is my next option."
"Written June 3, 2019",What a view,"Fortunately we went when it wasn't crowded.  Takes about half an hour to make a complete rotation, but a great view of London from the top.  Was dramatic the day we went as a Thunderstorm popped up just as we were at the top."
"Written June 3, 2019",refused a refund when the attraction had technical difficulties!,"Was very disappointed when i brought my 10 year old on a trip to the London Eye. We queued for about an hr to only be told there had been technical difficulties with the ride (which is understandable these things happen), we got a leaflet to say how to re-book, but unable to get a refund! As this was no fault of our own i believe we are entitled to a refund. i can not afford another trip to London or able to get time off work etc. The staff there were not very helpful as they would answer anyone's questions, We left very disappointed with our experience :("
"Written June 3, 2019",On a clear day ...........,"On a clear day you can see all around you, so the song goes!  Wow the views are fantastic.  I found everyone on board willing to share the views from around the sides of the cabin as it moves very slowly and with no distinct shakes.  30 plus minutes of a fantasy world, we even saw the Guards practicing on Horse Guards Parade for the Trooping of the Colour.  The queues are typical winding sort, just like Disney, but they move quickly and the staff are incredible efficient at loading and loading.  Well worth the money but better to book tickets on line before hand.  There is also a Fast Track system available.  If the weather is hot do remember your bottle water and possibly hat. Your bags are checked before entering the line."
"Written June 2, 2019",Great,The London eye is great but only if you do the fast pass. No way I would stand in line for that long.
"Written June 19, 2019",Much better than expected,"This was on the must do list and like the Eiffel Tower, was so much better than expected. We did the champagne tour and our host was lovely.  Greatly enjoyed the sights from the top.  It was really cool to have a 360’ look at London.  It is something I won’t forget."
"Written June 18, 2019",Great fun ,It was good fun thing but way over price for what u can see and do in there . And there's  a big Q  for every where in that place. Worth a visit  tho 
"Written June 17, 2019",Great view,The line up looked lengthy but went by much faster than we expected.The pod we were in had a good amount of people and didn’t feel over packed.Great views and it was enough time to look around and take pictures without being rushed but did not feel too long.There was a bench in the pod to rest which was nice or you were free to stand.Would suggest anyone or any age to do it. Personally I was gong to skip it but glad I did it.
"Written June 17, 2019",Nice experience!,It was worth it! Even if the queue is long but it is running so you won’t get bored. Good experience!
"Written June 16, 2019",Fun day out,Long que but the time was short. The views were great even though overcast. Friendly staff. The fast pass was not purchased but not really needed. 
"Written June 16, 2019",London May 2019,So you have to rid the London Eye when in London.  The views are amazing along the the River Thames.  You get a birds eye view.  Purchase your ticket online and add the skip the line.  It's totally worth it.  I showed up at my designated time and got right on.  Spend some time enjoying the excellent street performers after the ride.  Totally worth it.
"Written June 16, 2019",brilliant experience,you have your dlot time and effectively queue up from then. goes fairly quickly.i am a bit scared of heights but strangely this felt absolutely ok. great views from the eye as you would expect. awesome photo opportunities.would highly recommend 
"Written June 16, 2019",a great way to get a birds eye view,"The London Eye created a capsule filled with a floral garden to give an eye opener feel to the show. There were many ways to utilize the time in the capsule- one could hire one for a personalized experience or have a champagne experience, celebrate a birthday, yoga, anniversaries and so forth, the options were many"
"Written June 16, 2019",Great Views,"Been on it a few times and it’s always nice to go on a clear sunny day. Queues are long, but book in advance and you skip it.On a busy day, you’ll have quite a few people in your capsule. The annoying ones take selfies. Enjoy the moment and ditch the camera. Yiu might even get a discount with an Oyster Card, but double check. "
"Written June 16, 2019",Nice views but not a must-do,"A friend of mine and I visited here on a Friday evening, as neither of us had never done the London Eye before. It was still fairly light when we visited (around 8.30pm) - and I would possibly recommend visiting just a bit later if you wanted to see the city lights all lit up. The views were really good as expected, and we were pleasantly surprised at the lack of any queue at all. I would recommend visiting the London Eye, although you can get an equally good view from other places in London, if you go for a meal or a drink in one of the high rise restaurants - so it depends if you are willing to pay or the novelty of being on a giant ferris wheel."
"Written June 10, 2019",Great views ,You get a great view of London on a good day. Be sure to book your times in advance. You can arrive 30 minutes early of your time. The queue will be long but it moves at a good pace.
"Written June 10, 2019",Not so sure its a must on a trip,"Its a tough one, I have been on the Singapore Flyer which I actually thought was a lot better.  Pricey, long queues for a so-so experience"
"Written June 10, 2019",Always a Great Time,We decided this time around we would do the VIP champagne experience and it was well worth it. We sat in a lounge drinking bellinis and were walked directly to the front of the line.  Met a lot of great people!  
"Written June 9, 2019",Birthday treat ,My son and myself went on the London Eye really enjoyed it my sons 30th birthday treat the view is fantastic if you have good weather 
"Written June 9, 2019",Spectacular views of London,"It's a little pricey, but worth it for the first-time traveler to London.  It moves slowly enough for you to see the sights really well, plus have time to take pictures of your favorites.  The staff are polite and helpful, and efficient in boarding the passengers.  We had a skip-the-line ticket, which made it an even more pleasant experience.  I don't know how long the others waited in line, but we were escorted right up & into a much shorter line."
"Written June 8, 2019",Beautiful Views,"We just had to see the views from the London Eye.  We bought “skip the lines” tickets from Viator that were worth the extra price as we had, maybe, a 3 minute wait on a crowded day.  The  views did not disappoint."
"Written June 8, 2019",One time experience ,"If you want to get a full view of London from the top, go for it. One time experience. Around the place there are good options for having some desserts and other attractions as well to have a look at."
"Written June 7, 2019",Fun,"This was a great way to see the city. I would go on a sunny or partly cloudy day. It is worth it to purchase ""skip the line"" tickets since we were so limited on time to see and do everything London has to offer. Could have done with or without the 4D show. "
"Written June 7, 2019",Bird eye view of London,You can get the bird eye view of London from london eye. The ticket price of shard is more but there is no time limit. While here you have only limited time.
"Written June 5, 2019",Spectacular views ,First time to London - great views and picture taking opportunities.  We bought the tickets that let you go anytime on a particular day and use the fast track lane.  It was worth it  since we weren’t sure of our exact plans that day and it gave us flexibility.  Ordered them online and printed them out - pretty easy. They don’t overload the cars so you have plenty of room to view from all sides and take pictures. They take a picture that you can purchase but we didn’t buy ours - picky teenagers didn’t like the way they looked !The ride goes super slow so u have a pretty good amount of time for viewing.  
"Written June 2, 2019",Great visit,Fantastic views from the eye. Almost 20 years on it is just as good. The queuing was organised with polite staff who were organised to run a slick operation. Recommended for a visit to London don. Don’t forget to prebook to get a time slot.
"Written June 1, 2019",Highest of Heights that Erase Fear,"As a joke I have always said that I am not afraid of heights, rather the sudden (expletive) stop. We fast tracked and skipped the line, got in/on the capsule within 10 minutes and spent the 30 minute ride reveling in the beauty that is the City of London. What ever you pay, it is well worth every penny!"
"Written June 1, 2019",Great Views from Above!,This is a must do when in London. Great views all around and photo ops. I highly recommend getting the fast track tickets in advance as the lines are exceptionally long. We were able to hop right on with no wait what so ever.
"Written May 31, 2019",Loved it!!!,Not that keen on heights but LOVED it!!! Awesome view of the city. Big queues but moved very fast. Highly recommend.
"Written May 31, 2019",Fantastic!,"What a fun experience.  The wheel rotates slowly enough so that you can get a wonderful view of London.  We had a great time.  The tickets are a bit expensive, but buying the Fast Track ticket was definitely worth it as it eliminated standing and waiting in a very, very long line."
"Written May 31, 2019",Worth doing once ,"As expected the view of London is excellent. I was concerned that there would be too many people in the carriage and you couldn’t get a view but that wasn’t an issue, the carriages come round fast and they only have a little time to get people on them- so there was definitely enough viewing space and not too many people in each one. It really is the best way to get a glimpse of all of London if you haven’t seen it before. The only slight downside was the carriages are a bit old now and slightly smelly to be honest, they could use a proper clean daily. The 4d free experience was about what you’d expect for a free experience- nothing special, if you’re in a rush, don’t bother. The river cruise was excellent, again if you haven’t done it before, but I think it’s a very weather dependent thing. This is my second time and this time was sunny and it really improved everything, we sat up on the top deck and could see everything the guide was pointing at. Don’t be afraid to go down to the pier early though, as the queues get long quick and you’ll want to be on the top deck if it’s sunny! "
"Written May 30, 2019",Crowded but alright,Me and my husband went on the London Eye on 29/05/19 and although enjoyable it would have been better if it were less crowded. It was raining outside so the view was a little bleak and limited but we could still see majority of the landmarks nearby. The ‘pod’ we were in was freezing cold and the que to get on the attraction was long and fairly slow moving for saying how crowded the ‘pod’ was. I have previously been on the London Eye and it is much more enjoyable during quieter times.
"Written May 29, 2019","River Cruise, then the London Eye","I went on the River Cruise which was very informative (May 2019 so spring, but there was a chilly wind on the top, so ended up going downstairs for the balance of the cruise - do take a jacket).Then straight onto the Eye (I had pre-purchased my tickets so avoided the very long queues waiting to get on to the Eye). If I'd had to wait in the queue I may not have gone on it - but only due to my issues with heights, lol.  It was a beautiful day with views for miles & miles, amazing.  It does stop a few times but barely noticeable, so am guessing its for other visitors getting onto/off the pods.  Lots of photo opportunities & very friendly other visitors who helped this solo traveller with photos of proof."
"Written May 29, 2019",Breathtaking Wheel over London,The London Eye is a must do attraction in London! The waits are a bit steep so definitely arrive very early. It was a nice and relaxing lift above beautiful London. You will definitely get some great pics of Westminster Abbey and Big Ben from way above. The Aquarium is nearby and worth a visit if you have time.  
"Written May 28, 2019",So much fun...and the views!!,"What a fun attraction! The views are spectacular! We had a pretty good day to view the city too, not rainy or cloudy. Worth the time to do this ride."
"Written May 20, 2019",Not as expected,Probably one of the most advertised attractions in London yet it is not worth the experience. The view of the city is definitely not the best and the ride is so quick. Book your ride for the morning  to avoid the crowd. 
"Written May 20, 2019",Graduation trip,A must do activity...line moves fast and plenty of room in each carriage. I got height freight midway up but able to sit down to calm my emotions. Truly recommend.
"Written May 20, 2019",really good views and experience,Used our merlin pass so we got to go in the fast track que and get on really quickly. It was a clear day with little wind so really good views and felt really safe even at the top
"Written May 19, 2019",The big wheel,A sight well known to London£30 for a 30 minute ride...It was average only able to see the river thames and Big Ben and some landscape. Note considered  worth the money...but if you are into views do it or if you prefer just take a photo of it...No biggie to go on it.Save your money for an ice cream
"Written May 19, 2019",Tourist trap,"Second trip to this commercial monster, not worth the money.Do yourself a favour and walk to the top of Saint Paul's or to the top of the London monument.Much better views and not as tacky . Unless you have a disability save your self  the time and money."
"Written May 19, 2019",Good experience with views of London,"We booked in advance, but only an hour or so as we did it in the hotel before leaving for the day. Weather was cloudy, but you could see for miles around.The staff were all plesent and we didnt have anything negative to say. Well worth the visit."
"Written May 18, 2019",Beautiful views ,"I came here on the 14th May with a combined ticket for Madame Tussauds and really enjoyed it, beautiful views on a nice sunny day and worth doing if you're ever in London, I would certainly not hesitate to go again if in London "
"Written May 18, 2019",A view to remember for ever!,"Our family of four were incredibly lucky to enjoy a ride on the London Eye before it closed for routine maintaince. The views from the top are breathtaking, the lines to get on short on a cold January day. Well worth the cost."
"Written May 17, 2019","Very fun, wonderful views","This was a very fun activity, highly recommend it.  Large cars that move very slowly for great viewing.  "
"Written May 16, 2019",FUN ACTIVITY,I was with a large group of family differing in ages and everyone enjoyed the experience It was a cool way to see all over London.
"Written May 28, 2019",Never disappoints ,Been on the eye a few times but not since it was Coca Cola.   Very quick to get on and such a nice view.   Can’t say much more other than I recommend the London explorer pass.  We used those on the eye and other attractions.  Worlds a treat and saves loads of money in real terms. 
"Written May 28, 2019",amazing deal,"We got the combo ticket, dungeon, London eye, sealife, tussauds and the bus tour. Well worth the money great deal and saves loads of money, dungeon was great fun, the eye was amazing but be prepared to queue, sealife really interesting and plenty to see, Madam tussauds is worth the money and so much to see, loved the little ride that is part of it and the 4d mini film is fun, bus tour was ok but as traffic was really bad it took away from the fun side of it. All in all combo ticket really worth the money."
"Written May 27, 2019",Nice experience,"Although I was initially scared to be so up in the air,while being in the cabin I felt like being on the floor,very nice ,specially for families although quite expensive."
"Written May 27, 2019",Rubbish,Thankfully I only paid £24 for myself & my teenage daughter as we used the codes off the Kelloggs cereal boxes but even then I felt robbed. It goes so slow and you can see out of the windows because they put so many people in each pod. Never again!
"Written May 26, 2019",Fast Path Rules,We got in an out under an hour with a “Fast Path”. We would recommend doing upon arrival to understand the city.  Staff was pleasant and helpful
"Written May 25, 2019",Waste of money ,"We had gone on the city cruises boat tour which was way more better and informative to see the sights from the ground and walk around.I heard many bad reviews on the eye however wanted to give a shot for ourselves. Was very disappointed with the amount of money you pay when you really do not see much at all nothing different to be honest I think other cities around the world have better sky views than the wheel. Also while you are in there, there is a label on the floor stating ""photo zone"" BUT they do not prepare or indicate when the photo will be taken. All the people in our capsule had no idea either and the flash went off when everyone was wondering around.As our tour guide stated you actually are better off going to the free sky deck view which was across the river facing the shard."
"Written May 25, 2019",Fun,It is definitely worth checking out for great views and pics. The price is a little steep but the half hour trip was so unique and fun
"Written May 24, 2019",Fun,"Went on the London Eye. Very good value. Buy your ticket in the park they have a two for one, the Eye and boat ride. The views were fabulous. "
"Written May 24, 2019",Stupendous view,A slow and steady ride which is not overwhelming if you are afraid of heights the only drawback is the skyline is been cluttered by high rise buildings and tending to obscure the older historic landmarks. Potential for interesting photographic shots 
"Written May 23, 2019",Loved the ride and the view,"It went slowly enough, that I didn't get motion sickness! I did the Champagne Sunset Ride and had a blast."
"Written May 10, 2019",Nice way to see London ,"We reached on time and thought it was a grey day , London was still beautiful ! The queue moved quickly There’s a Namco arcade nearby , just before sea world where you can spend some time in the warmth and drink a coffee and use free clean loos if you’re early ! Paying extra for the fast track didn’t seem worth it as everything was so smooth and we hardly waited a few minutes I’m not sure I’ll go again for that kind of money but it’s a must do if you haven’t done it at all "
"Written May 9, 2019",Brilliant,"We had to to wait in line for about 15 minutes, but easy to get on and off. What a view of London, we had about 10 people in the pod. Enough space for everyone. It goes very slowly."
"Written May 9, 2019",A great send off after a month of hard travel.,"I’d say it’s overpriced in general, but where else are you going to have an experience like this? The ride is slow enough to not make someone nauseated. The views of the city’s Are fun, but when I was there, a huge amount of construction and renovation was going on. Many buildings had wrap, cranes or scaffolding obscuring them."
"Written May 9, 2019",Honeymooners! ,Wow!We bought the fast track tickets.This means you don't have to wait in line for a long time.You can purchase fast track tickets online or at the counter. (This may cost a few pounds more)Defiantly was worth seeing the view and Buckingham Palace from way up.It was great friendly service that was fast and efficient.Defiantly worth it.And.. Its not scary at all! 
"Written May 8, 2019",Nice experience ,"Went with family To London and went to London Eye. Easy to book, Nice helpful staff, nothing was too much for them. Lovely experience. We all enjoyed it. Highly recommend it if you are visiting London "
"Written May 8, 2019",The best views of London!,"Amazing experience!! It worth every penny! It has the most beautiful views of London, we certainly recommend!"
"Written May 8, 2019",Definitely worth doing once,"Ok-so it’s a little cheesy and it is kind of pricey, but the views are absolutely amazing and it moves slow enough that you have time for lots of selfies, family photos and yes- just to relax for 20 minutes and take in the London skyline!  The lines are always insane for the London Eye (which is why I have passed it up on previous trips) so I do recommend spending the extra few bucks for the skip the line option (we walked right on while there was a huge queue in the regular line).  The capsules are pretty big- even though there are about 20 people in each one- there seemed to be room to mill around and it’s nice that you can do this rain or shine and that this is an accessible view for folks that maybe have limited mobility and can’t climb lots of stairs.  I’m glad we did it once!  I took one star simply because I do think the experience is pricey and it would be nice if they limited the group size of each capsule to the amount of seating available in each one.  Like I said- they are pretty roomy, but there isn’t enough room for everyone to sit on the benches so be prepared to stand."
"Written May 8, 2019",London Eye,My experience visiting the London eye was really great; The London Eye is a great experience a way to get a sense of London. It is an incredible feat of engineering 
"Written May 7, 2019",views,"worth a visit for the unsurpassed views, also with paying the extra for fast track if busy.don’t forget s trip to the loo before you get on."
"Written May 7, 2019",Spectacular!,"Simply spectacular!Imagine visualizing the entire city of London from one place, historical places, the modern city, everything!"
"Written May 16, 2019",Good view,"The line was faster than i expected , actually it's a great view of the city and Tamesis river.Takes 30 min to complete the round, time is perfect, you could enjoy your time taking pictures ."
"Written May 15, 2019",Standard Ticket Pre ordered- Pay For A Fast Track,"I guess when sightseeing in London, this is on the to do list, however, the view from The Shard is far superior and from Sydney Tower and the Sands Sky Deck in Singapore etc As the title suggest, we paid for the London eye ticket through a tour company as an add on to a day tour. When lining up to get these pre booked ticket, I jumped at the chance to fast track. The line for both the ticket and then to board the eye was extensive. Worth the extra 10 pounds each. The ride was underwhelming I have to say and of all the attractions we visited in Europe and London, this was the least photographed. The weather was perfect but it was almost disappointing. If you are time poor and you miss this one, it is not the end of the world. Perhaps the evening ride is more captivating?"
"Written May 14, 2019",Worth a go ,Had a great time. The views are amazing. It’s exspensive for what it is though. Very high security which is amazing. Just found it a little boring! This was my 2nd time showing a mate. Cool experience but you can go up any building in London & get the same view. 
"Written May 14, 2019",London's iconic sky line,"Breathtaking view of the city of London despite it being gloomy cold windy Saturday morning. Luckily the capsule was not crowded and we could enjoy the view, absolutely loved the experience. "
"Written May 13, 2019",Great view of London,The line when we went was so short we didn't even need to opt for the fast track.  We went at sunset on a nice and sunny clear day.  It was a great time which provided amaxing views of London.
"Written May 13, 2019",Great views,Would really recommend the London Eye. This was my second time on it and I loved it just as much as the first time. Those in our group who had not been on it before were very impressed. The weather was lovely so the views were great. 
"Written May 13, 2019",Online tickets ,"I was surprised to see that after we bought tickets online (London eye + Tower bridge) that we needed to get the ‘real’ tickets. So we needed to wait in a queue for that, and it took us a lot of time to get back to the Wheel and stand in line again. View is beautiful, must see, but I don’t see the point in buying tickets online (that was cheaper, must admit!), and then getting there and standing in queue to get those bought tickets cause printouts are not valid"
"Written May 12, 2019","Expensive, slow but a must do.",The London Eye is a must do and I'd not a thrill ride but at times it's slowness is boring. It's also expensive.
"Written May 12, 2019",Didn't do it for me... ,"It's one of those things to experience while in London but if you don't enjoy being locked into a small pod with a large group of strangers, find another way to check out the skyline. I used vouchers to drastically reduce the ticket price but had I paid face value I'd have been greatly disappointed. Queues moved faster than I expected to get on and although photos were taken there was no sales pitch. Do be aware that there is an airport style bag search before you get on. "
"Written May 11, 2019",Good view of the city,Great view of the city but the shard offers much better view and later viewing. The eye has a fast moving line but is hit and miss of who is on your pod. We had a bunch of rude people pushing to get in and off and standing in front of people trying to sit and view. When asked to move completely ignored. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Would not ride again but should do at least once.
"Written May 1, 2019",Superb views!,"This is one attraction not to be missed! We bought fast track tickets, well worth paying the extra, there wasn't much of a queue when w e arrived but by the end of the ride, the queues were full of school and your groups, it would have taken hours to get through. The views are quite amazing and you are so close to the city which is just over the river. The ride was clean, comfortable and was just the right amount of time. I would highly recommend the London Eye!"
"Written April 30, 2019","Pleasant, but expensive, and felt crowded.",It wasn't the best view of London - and not the most exciting experience you'll have either.  I would skip it and save time and money.
"Written April 29, 2019",Exciting,"If you plan to see and photograph London at night, ride the London eye during autumn or winter season when the nights are longer. We went on the last trip which was 8 pm (23 April) and it was still bright so no nightscape for me to take, plus Big Ben was covered in scaffolding so really nothing interesting that day. The views would've been magnificent if everything was the way I imagined it. Also, buy tickets at the counter and NOT to those men outside the ticketing who are authorized sellers but will also rip you off! "
"Written April 28, 2019",Eyeing the Sunset...,"Timed our ride on the London Eye to coincide with sunset.  We were a few of the fortunate ones for the day we enjoyed this activity, as we were able to catch the ride at sunset and the weather was perfect.  Views all around were nice, making this somewhat of an 'eye-conic' experience.  A bit pricey, but now off my bucket list !"
"Written April 28, 2019",Went with kids,"Nice view but very high price to take 2 kids for 30 min ride to see London. The queues were not bad. The photo from London Eye cost me another £20. I think at least child ticket should be much cheaper, they can’t go by themselves anyway."
"Written April 27, 2019",Views like you've never experienced before!,So much fun and fantastic photos too!  You truly get to see it all from up here - all the way to the horizon!  
"Written April 27, 2019",Good option ,A little expensive for a 30 minutes ride but it’s worth it if you want to see london from the skies. 
"Written April 26, 2019",Fast pass tickets are worth it,"Even though supposedly it opens at 10 according to the website, we got on at 915 and I think it was going before that. Fast Pass not only gets you in another (much shorter) line, it also gets you in a car with only other Fast Pass holders. So we had 5 people in our car, while we saw other cars that were packed. "
"Written April 25, 2019","Great Views, Do the Fast Pass","The views from the London Eye are fantastic. The car moves so slowly, the motion is almost imperceptible. Also, the car is so big that it doesn't feel crowded. One thing, though: We bought the anytime that day fast pass. It's nearly double the price of a basic ticket, but it's worth every pence. The line for regular ticket holders was so long, the workers had to route it across the walkway and into another holding area. I couldn't even see the whole line until I was up in the Eye. It wouldn't have surprised me if the wait was two hours. We, on the other hand, walked nearly right up to the door, with a total wait time of less than five minutes. So go, but only if you do the fast pass."
"Written April 25, 2019",Once is enough. I would not repeat this experience.,"We went with the family through this experience and it was kind of lame. You get to see some of the famous London sights from above, but overall I was not impressed."
"Written May 23, 2019",Great Location,"I think the view would be amazing from the London Eye, were it not for the fact that they close super early (8:30 pm), which sadly, I missed. Also strange to me was that the gift shop also closed at that time. So ixnay on buying souvenirs there. Best bet is to pre-order your tickets and get there by sunset. "
"Written May 23, 2019",Expensive but Unforgettable ,"This really is one of the must-do things in London, as long as you can afford it. It’s certainly not cheap - £30 for an adult and not much less for a four-year-old when we visited, similar to the Shard - but it’s hard to beat as a way of seeing the city from up on high.You get a 30-minute ride taking you up above the Thames with unparalleled views of Parliament and the surrounding area. You’re able to move around within the capsule - something our four-year-old loved as she went from side to side taking it all in. She picked it out as the best thing we did in London when we got home. "
"Written May 21, 2019","Glad I did it but it is just a Ferris wheel, after all.","It seems as though one has to go on the Eye, and I am not sorry that I did.  However, it is just as expected.  It is easy to get a ticket and the line was not very long (I did not pay extra for the fast track)."
"Written May 21, 2019",Great Way to Begin a London Trip,This is the perfect spot to begin a trip to London. It’s a great opportunity to really orient yourself with the city and get a different perspective of many of the famous sites in London.  This is well worth the ~1-2 hours it takes to complete.
"Written May 21, 2019",amazing views,"This attraction lasts 30 minutes. The views are wonderful, due to the location right by big ben, Thames river, parliament, etc."
"Written May 21, 2019",View of the river and London,"This was our second time in London, but the first time we jumped on the Eye.  Wow, it was something else!  It doesn't not spin real fast, so you have plenty of time to see the sights around the Thames River. A must do if you have time."
"Written May 21, 2019",Amazing ride,A ride of the london eye that too in rain.... just simply amazing.... though it might be an understatement. Do get the fast track ticket to avoid the queue and save time.
"Written May 20, 2019",Brilliant on a clear day,"We got very lucky with the weather, clear sunny day and could see for miles.   Great way to pick out the various sights from the top of the wheel. It moves nice and slowly so plenty of time to see all the sights. If the weather is clear its a Must do attraction when in London."
"Written May 20, 2019",Fun,This was so much fun to get on during the day but at night the view is amazing. Must get on when visiting London. 
"Written May 20, 2019",Beautiful View,"We went the perfect time of year!  The weather was beautiful and there was minimal waiting time.  The cruise was fantastic.  Our guide, Victoria, was energetic and quite informative.  What a great experience!"
"Written May 7, 2019",Good experiencd,"We bought our tickets online about an hour before we went, we had chosen a time slot but they didn’t seem too strict on the times chosen 👌 I got a student ticket which was £16 I think and my friends paid £27 for standard adult tickets. Enjoyable activity and the kids in the pod that was behind us seemed to have a great time with the group they were with. We were placed in a pod of about 12/14 people all other small groups of adults. Took about 40 mins in total. Wouldn’t recommend the 4D experience, more of a history of the London eye. "
"Written May 7, 2019",Fantastic views of London,"We were lucky to visit at Easter when the weather was perfect.Luckily we had pre-booked so had no real line as such.The vista was stunning and there were plenty opportunities for photos, even with a full capsule.Book well in advance and try to organise the weather!!!"
"Written May 7, 2019",Not adventurous but it is something to try,First time in London and I had to try the wheel. You will get to see London from the top which is a beautiful view. I am from a small area in Canada so this was an experience for me in London. Try it
"Written May 7, 2019",Long queues - But a must visit,Long queues - but you moment will come to step inside on of the capsules and enjoy the 360 degree views of London. 
"Written May 7, 2019",London Eye,"Had a good time riding the London Eye, staff was friendly and the views was fantastic.  The lines to ride were long, but worth the wait.  It takes approximately 30 minutes to make a complete revolution."
"Written May 6, 2019",A topspot - literally and figuratively speaking,"Our daughter wanted to go up in the Eye and I assumed it would be a total waste of time. It wasn't. It turned out to be the fastest 45 minutes I've been through. So much to see, amazing. Strongly recommended. "
"Written May 6, 2019","Excellent views of the city.  A very touristy ""must do""","Its our family's first trip to London so we had to ride the Eye.  Its a big Ferris wheel but you are enclosed in a glass and metal ""pod"" that fits about 15 or so people so its not a small thing you'd see at an amusement park.  The lines can get LONG but the Fast Track is totally worth it.  It cut the wait time to maybe 3 minutes on a weekday afternoon.Pick a clear day (we did that) or try it at night for another perspective of London.  it doesn't move fast so plenty of time to look around as you go around for 1 loop."
"Written May 6, 2019",Incredible views!,"You need to do the London Eye if you're visiting London.  You will see the most incredible, breathtaking views!  You can stand and/or sit in the compartment, and the line to actually get on may look long, but only takes about a half hour to get through."
"Written May 6, 2019","A cool experience, but WAYYYY overpriced!","My family of 2 adults and 3 young kids enjoyed our trip on the Eye, but I still don't think it's worth the price tag for a family like ours. It cost the equivalent of almost $170 USD to take one 25-minute turn on the thing, which I think is INSANE.  Children's tickets are barely less than the adult fare, so it really adds up quickly. The process to buy the tickets and get on the wheel was super smooth and quick, no hiccups. I would recommend NOT buying the fast-entry tickets until you get there and see how long the regular line is. We went at around 10:30 in the morning and there was a very short line for the regular entry, and it moved quickly. The people who had paid more for the fast lane had wasted even more money. I was told by several people and guides that a better option would be to go to the bar in the Shard (which is one or two floors below the observation deck) and order a drink, and enjoy the fantastic view over the city from there. It will cost you like 60 % less, and you'll get a drink out of it."
"Written May 5, 2019",VIP Experience phenomenal. Non-VIP waits were 3 hours!,"We bought a chocolate tasting VIP experience so we were able to walk right on at our appointed time and get two times around. Otherwise, lines were estimated at 3 hours wait for one time around. Our experience was phenomenal, very comfortable and phenomenal views of the city and the Thames."
"Written April 19, 2019",Great view of the whole city,"Words cannot express exactly how nice and tranquille is a from there. The whole city on your feet, view till the end of horizon. "
"Written April 18, 2019",Must do,"Even if you do not like heights this is a one off experience only if the weather is good you can have great views.The line to get on may look big but it goes down very quickly, the wheel goes round very slow that you do not notice it moving."
"Written April 18, 2019",Long queues to purchase tickets!,"After just over an hour queueing to buy tickets (had an adult goes free voucher so could not book online), we got the time slot we requested. Yet another 40 minute queue to get on the Eye we had a great time. Beautiful day so saw lots of the sights. If you have no money off offers I would definitely recommend booking online."
"Written April 17, 2019",i don't get all the hype,"it's fun, and a great view of big ben and parliament, but it's quite expensive. I was going to plan ahead, which is a bit cheaper, but it's important to know it will be sunny, and we wanted to do fast track (which was great).  It added up to quite a lot.   i think it would be cool to go at dusk, might be more interesting."
"Written April 14, 2019",View from above,"Thought the height would bother me, but it didn't.  Lovely view of all the surrounding area.  30 minutes to go around, but didn't seem long enough.  Would definitely do it again."
"Written April 13, 2019",Not worth it,Thought this would be really interesting but was disappointed. Not that much to see and it is a little too expensive for what it is. Plus you get bored but are stuck on this until it does the whole trip around. 
"Written April 13, 2019",Fantastic and worth doing. ,Worth the money and a great experience.  Did not wait long and queue moved along nicely.  this is a def must do when in London 
"Written April 13, 2019",View of London,went on the London Eye. It was so smooth I didn't know when it was moving. You could see far and wide. Half way through it started to rain which was lousily for pictures. But they take one before.
"Written April 13, 2019",Great Relaxing Views,"A great place to to visit and watch London go by. Views over the River Thames and to see great architectural buildings of London. Can have private parties,engagement and all . Will be great memories to re visit.A must place to visit when in London."
"Written April 13, 2019",Absolutely NONSENSE !!!!!,Boring and overpriced. I was forced to go on. Terrible view.Never again utter rubbish.Money badly spent. Stay away !!
"Written May 5, 2019",Nice views!,We expect a lot and we left the EYE wondering if it worth it.I recommend to visit it on sunny days and only if you have some free time.
"Written May 5, 2019",Do the champagne tour,"We booked the champagne tour the day before. It was great since it was a dedicated time slot (we didn't have to wait in line) and there was a guide in the box. She was friendly, helped us take pictures when at the top, and pointed out various points of interest on the skyline. Plus champagne toast! Totally worth the extra 5 quid or whatever. "
"Written May 4, 2019",Lovely experience ,It’s was a great experience. We had merlin passes and we could go in the fast track lane which was a bonus. 
"Written May 4, 2019",Eye see...,"The line is usually long but this time we got lucky we only has to wait 10 mins, I've sometimes known for it to take hours. The view is fantastic as you can see most of the attractions and iconic buildings from an amazing view. terrific photo opportunity of the landscape, the Big Ben was having some work done so it wasn't visible clearly but still a great observation point of the city."
"Written May 3, 2019",Not to miss,I booked this activity online with get my guide and really enjoyed it. The waiting queue wasn't very long even with our regular tickets. Then we entered with ~ 20 people which was not a problem since the cabin was large enough . We had an amazing view of the city. I think the tour lasted ~25 minutes before we got outDefinitely go for it
"Written May 3, 2019",Tourist attraction must see,"This of course is on the list of must do while in London.  Be sure to purchase the ""fast pass"" as you walk to the front of the line and don't have to queue. "
"Written May 2, 2019",Cool experience,"Everyone should do this once on a visit to London.  I would definitely recommend the fast track ticket especially during busy times.   The view is great, and initially everyone is at the windows snapping pictures, then the second half everyone seeks to kind of settle in and relax just enjoying the view.   Overall a London must but once is enough."
"Written May 2, 2019",Bird's eye view of London,"If you enjoy birdseye views of major cities then the London Eye is a must. Reasonably priced, with spacious cabins that they didn't fill to the brim with tourists when I visited,  it allowed for free movement around the cabin to get maximum views of surrounding London. There is a 360 degree sillhouette map to guide identifying landmarks around London. I particularly enjoyed the view you get of Tower Bridge spanning the Thames. Buy your ticket online and try to plan your visit outside peak periods otherwise you'll have a long queue. They also offer romantic night rides with dinner as well. "
"Written May 1, 2019",Just fine,From the London Eye you can have a good view of the city and the Thames river. But the price is quite expensive for doing it.
"Written May 1, 2019",Great Views from the Eye and the River Cruise boat,We bought the skip the line tickets for London Eye and River Cruise. We walked on to the Eye with no waiting in line. 30 minute ride on The Eye was fun with great views of London. We bought the River Cruise tickets as well as only 5pounds more and worth the money. River cruise was 40 minutes long with plenty of tour guide narrative talking about various historic and interesting London city sights you view while cruising the  River Thames.
"Written April 25, 2019","The most touristic thing in London, but it is fun anyways","We went there a family of four, we had already purchase our tickets. Even though we had booked a time, the queue was long. But they are so used to crowds, so it didn't take so long time to get onboard on one of the domes.The view was stunning, it was really nice to actually do it, so altough it is very crowded it was worth it."
"Written April 25, 2019",Great,"We pre booked slots with our Merlin passes and managed to almost walk straight on in the Fast Track queue. We are glad we did as the ‘normal’ queue was absolutely huge! Security inspections were thorough although an older lady was quite short and rude with me for not opening my bag quick enough on the Thursday evening, shortly before closing. There was no need for this huffing at me. Views are amazing both in the daytime and at night. "
"Written April 24, 2019",Great view of London! ,"The London Eye gives a fantastic view of London. I've been up twice, both times alongside friends of mine who have fears of altitude, and we've all felt very safe. The wheel moves quite slowly and the ""capsula"" feels more or less like a room with glass windows. Pro-tip; Pre-order - and get the champagne experience. If you do not, you will be put in a carriage with a lot of other people and you will wait in line. Also, please don't bring your kids on the champagne experience. The rest of us won't thank you for that. "
"Written April 23, 2019",Wonderful time,"The London Eye is a great, relaxing time to look over London and the Thames River.  The Thames River cruise was really great as well.  Matt ( I think) was our guide and he did a fantastic job."
"Written April 23, 2019",Don’t waste your money,"I’ve been on the Las Vegas one that you can have all you can drink in 30 minutes, that’s fun. This was slow you can get the views like this from a dozen places for free. "
"Written April 22, 2019",Attraction!!,"5* mostley beacuae of good organization. We had fast ticket, well worth it, but attraction  itself is a bit pricey i would say, comparing with what London offers as a part of a world heritage. Lines are huge, we had a time slot and went on exactly on time. We had a photo of us taken at the entrance and I found it as a additional bonus to experience. 20£ for 2 photos, key chain,magnet and a Londony eye book. "
"Written April 22, 2019",Not worth the money,"Bought tickets online for the VIP before we arrived. Be careful getting there as my husband was very nearly robbed on the bridge. (Hold on to your wallets, pickpockets are everywhere). Didn’t wait long to get on. It did provide a nice view of London, which was especially nice this past Easter weekend,  but considering the price it was not worth it, especially for a family of 4. Honestly I wouldn’t have paid more than 15 pound for the experience and feel we were taken advantage of."
"Written April 22, 2019",Nice experience,It is a nice experience. You get to see very nice views of the city and the river. I don't think I'll return though. It's a one time thing.
"Written April 22, 2019",Great views on a sunny day,"Visited on the Thursday leading up to the Easter Weekend.  Pre-booked with club card vouchers.  There were big queues so we enquired about upgrading to fast track to be told the next available slot was in 30 minutes and it would take 10-15 minutes to clear the fast track queue.  Our standard ticket queue was less than 45 minutes as it moved quickly despite being huge.We were there on a clear sunny day and the views were great so well worth it.One thing though - when enquiring about the fast track upgrade, they offered the champagne flights for an extra £5 over the upgrade fee but it would cost even more for the kids so that everyone was paying the same price.  As kids can’t drink champagne I don’t understand why it’s so expensive for kids.In summary - don’t be put off by the queues, the staff keep it moving quickly."
"Written April 20, 2019",Birds eye view of London central,"If you plan to ride on the London Eye, I recommend to purchase tickets on-line in advance. Even with the advance tickets, it still takes a long line of waiting time. Once you are on the ride, you will appreciate the long line up and the view is breath taking."
"Written April 6, 2019","Fab views, worth doing once at least ",I think once you’ve been on the London eye once you wouldn’t do it again but it’s worth going on to see some spectacular views of London. We did the champagne ride. Would recommend!
"Written April 5, 2019",Amazing! ,"Great views, the line moves fast and it is a great experience! I would recommend this as a great addition to anyone’s day out in London! "
"Written April 4, 2019",First time visit ,"Booked online with river boat cruse, best way to do it as you save money booking multiple items than turning up on day. Really enjoyed the experience and even though im scared of height i felt very comfortable due to size of pods and goes slowly around. Close to some bars, restaurants and tube station. Since ive done it i don't think would do again but did enjoy. Only issue was the queue, had to wait 45min to get into proper queue, then took another 35min to get onto ride but i suppose it was a Sat and good weather.  If youve not been you must try it "
"Written April 4, 2019",A must. ,If you’re in London then you need to do this. It’s that simple. Great thing to do first as it gives you an idea of where everything is and what direction you need to be heading in for other sights. 
"Written April 4, 2019",Perfect view but with its faults,"Well the view you cant fault, it is what it is. It was a lovely experiance and my 4 year old really enjoyed it. We are annual pass holders so pre booked our time slot although we shouldnt have bothered. There is a reason Merlin will be 2nd in the world to disney ... customer service. The staff were not very friendly, rude at times and there was an element of not knowing what they were doing. We travelled with a newborn and I would say it was less than family friendly. I was rudly told I couldnt take the baby on in the buggy ... it was health and safety and space apparently. I was happy to take the baby out which i did. They wanted me to take the buggy apart, at the same time as trying to board a pod and hold a baby and keep an eye on a 4 year old. There was little help offered. They said it was about space but did not understand me when i said that putting it down will take up double the space as it came in 2 parts ... hence we took up 2 lots of buggy space in the pod. Again there was no help offered when getting off ... I was trying to put the buggy back together without droppung baby and was told I needed to do it behind the line!"
"Written April 3, 2019",Trip to London  for sightseeing,"On a beautiful sunny day, our flight on the London Eye gave us spectacular views of the whole of the London panorama. Smooth ride, well organised, clean pods. Advisable to book beforehand as it is very popular."
"Written April 2, 2019",Still in maintenance,Will have to go back another time :( great scenery at night with it’s lights though. Too bad I couldn’t get on.
"Written April 1, 2019",Lovely relaxing time with some stunning views and great photo opportunities.,We went on the eye and it was my husbands first time. We both really enjoyed it! It was relaxing and an all round nice trip. We did buy the photos they took of us and they where nice in a book and some key rings ect. They also had some nice gifts in their shop although we did not buy anything else. I would recommend booking a fast track ticket. We went on a Friday and not in school holidays and the Que was very very long so i can only imagine in the middle of summer or in school holidays.
"Written March 31, 2019",Fabulous views!,"The wait to get tickets was a bit much. The line moved at a slow, steady pace. We purchased tickets at approx. 5:50 PM then decided to visit the washroom before getting in line. When we exited, we were told that the tour ended at 6 PM. The lady who sold us the tickets failed to mention that we had 10 minutes to get on the ride! This is a customer service snafu that must be rectified immediately. After getting our tickets, we were directed to the side for photos (to be sold to us) and a 4-minute video that really served no purpose in relation to the ride. Otherwise, we enjoyed our ride on the London Eye. It goes super slow so there is no rockiness. The views were phenomenal which make for great photo opportunities. As nightfall set on London, the views became more lovely. We were unable to visit the gift shop as it was closed when we exited."
"Written March 31, 2019",Fun Experience,"I was a little concerned about going up in the Eye, but I really enjoyed the views and the comfort from the air conditioned pods. It was a nice relaxing experience."
"Written March 22, 2019",What a View,"We happened upon the London Eye during a downpour, but we enjoyed the ride so much.  While in London we experienced several showers, but they were short.  We got to enjoy part of our ride without raindrops on our ""car.""  You do not even notice you are moving!  I'm not afraid of heights, but don't like movement when I'm up high.  There was nothing to cause fear - only awe at the view!  I love the pictures I was able to take from up so high.  I want to go ahead - at twilight.  I hear that is amazing!"
"Written March 19, 2019",Two days in London,"This was a highlight of London The London eye gave an amazing view of London from the sky. We were in London on a pre TA cruise. The time spent with very good friends who live just outside of London was wonderful. Lunch and a boat ride, the London eye and afternoon cocktails. Great memories. "
"Written March 19, 2019",Never tire of this ......,"Watched this wheel being erected (they nearly dropped it at one point lol).  One of the best views of London you will ever get, other than a low level helicopter or airplane flight.  Not cheap but you can get deals sometimes. Well worth having your own pod if you can afford it. "
"Written March 19, 2019",Holiday ,When in London you can’t miss to have a ride in London eye it’s fabulous views on central London and good food around 
"Written March 19, 2019",Very crowdy and very expensive,"Not recommended , too crowdy and too expensive (30 Pound per person) for that short trip. doesnt worth it"
"Written March 18, 2019",Of course it’s worth a go...,In London with our kids. My husband and I had done this years previously but decided to do it again with the kids. Honestly I think it’s very pricey for what it is....especially if you buy a ticket JUST for this attraction...but we had a combined ticket with The Big Bus company for open top bus tour and river cruise...so it was much better value than buying the stand alone London-eye ticket. But it is one of those things I guess you just gotta give a go. It’s very slow moving so not too scary for those people who might think it looks daunting. It’s so slow you barely know u are moving. It is 15 mins up and 15 mins back down. It passes very quickly as you are constantly checking out the view. Plenty of room to move around and a seat if you are tired standing. They let approx 20-30 people In each pod...but they are very big. You do get to see a lot ...It’s one of those things that doesn’t necessarily blow your mind but it IS fun to do and the kids loved the experience. Give it a go....
"Written March 15, 2019",One for the check-list!!! ,"London Eye is one of most iconic tourist attractions in the world. For London, it's a visitors' must, equally famous as oldies like Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge etc.I personally have been to London Eye twice. First time it was fun to be so high by the Thames in early 2017. Even the crowded pods didn't disturb much because London is a naturally beautiful city and in broad daylight, there is a lot of eye candy scenery to be enjoyed from pods all through the ride, even for resident Londoners.Second time I visited last year on an unplanned visit when I missed screening of 'Witness for the Prosecution' playing at county hall nearby. I have to say that the experience gets a little less captivating second time. Off course one reason is the view of Big Ben now obscured by those scaffoldings.I have to gen you about the best way to visit the giant Ferris wheel. First of all, never buy at-the-spot tickets. It's always economical to purchase collective tickets online with 2-3 activities which can easily be done in a single visit. Another way to save is to travel by train and go for '2 for 1' offer if you are a couple. Best time to visit the Eye is around noon as gets busier and longer queues around evening.In a nutshell, London Eye is an epic attraction and mandatory for one visit for anyone in UK. For second visit, it just gets repetitive and so-so. "
"Written March 12, 2019",Must Do!,"Worth doing, I know it only goes round but well worth the money and the time it takes.  At least you can look down on the boring Sea life centre"
"Written March 11, 2019",360 Degree View of London,This cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London is an interesting perspective on London.  We went just before Sunset so we saw the daylight and twilight and it was wonderful.  The negative reviews surprise me because I think they are missing the experience of this amazing structure and the 360 degree views.  There are plenty of windows in each pod and places to sit and just enjoy the moment.
"Written March 11, 2019",London eye with champagne experience ,"Ordered package with champagne experience is real vip package as we were welcomed and collected small group at the lounge by group hostess. Together we went to Eye via fast track line to private capsule.

I enjoyed champagne and had experience without waiting in line. "
"Written February 20, 2019",Book Fast Track!,My boys loved this and once on the London eye the experience was great. Big note however!! Book fast track tickets and you’ll be in within 10-15 minutes. Don’t book these and the queue was really really long!!! Maybe 90 minutes? 
"Written February 19, 2019",Pick a day with good weather,The view from the London eye is excellent but go on a day with good weather. It was just clouding over as we went up but the view was still good but I would imagine it being amazing on a clear. It’s an expensive attraction but use one of the many two for one deals available. 
"Written February 19, 2019",Excellent views but very expensive ,We got the standard tickets so had to line up but the queues do move fast enough so I wouldn’t be too bothered about buying fast track tickets unless you have small kids maybe or are right with time.Views were amazing and I loved every minute of it. However it is very expensive for one spin around which lasts 30 minutes. Definitely a good experience though.
"Written February 18, 2019",Train your staff,I imagine in 2000 this was the best view of London. Proliferation of high risers alongside a really concerning member of staff. Just awful. I’ve lived in London 30 years and like to do the attractions.  This was the worst of all.

"Written February 12, 2019",Great views,Abit expensive but definitely worth the views on a great day. The queues weren’t very long and the staff were very friendly. We like the free entrance of how the wheel was created and the views of London in to the 3D show at the ticket office.
"Written February 12, 2019",Expensive but worth it ,London eye with sun is just a perfect combination. The views are astonishing! A must for a holiday trip!
"Written February 12, 2019",Spectacular views but very short ride,Lines were long but it moved fast. Views were spectacular from the top but ride wastoo quick and not enough time to enjoy it. Photos were taken before we went into thecapsule and we have a choice to buy it when we complete the ride. The next time I am in London I would rather walk around and explore places.
"Written February 11, 2019",Corporate ride with drinks and guests,I booked the London Eye for a corporate treat for our Russian visitors.  Champagne and treats were provided but the ride is so quick that there is not really time to enjoy it.  Probably not worth spending that much to be honest!
"Written March 31, 2019",Amazing views,"The views at night were lovely. Lines were long,  but moved very quickly.  Several in our party were afraid of heights and had no problem as the ride was quite smooth and spacious. 360 degree views were available in the car.  Lovely experience,  but a bit pricey for the length of experience.  "
"Written March 30, 2019",first visit,try to get early morning ride as the eye gets busy as day goes on. the 4D experience you can experience is good if you not sure what to expect really enjoyed it
"Written March 30, 2019",Go for the Fastpass,"40 pounds was worth avoiding the lines, I was surprised how busy it was in late March.  The ride last about 30 minutes, there are about 25 people in the car with you so it isn’t too crowded, but definitely not cheap.  "
"Written March 29, 2019",Cantilevered Observation Wheel,"The Coca-Cola London Eye, according to Wikipedia, “is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London.” The article goes on: “It is Europe’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel, is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually, and has made many appearances in popular culture.”By the description from Wikipedia, it seemed that my family’s visit to this hopping place was a must. When we were in London, we got on the London Eye, and enjoyed the novelty aspect of the wonderful cantilevered observation wheel that was situated so conveniently close to our hotel. The cantilevered observation wheel is also commonly referred to as a “Ferris wheel.” I believe that is what the kids call it these days anyway.The London Eye is across the River Thames from Big Ben. Unfortunately, at the time of our visit to the UK, Big Ben, which is likely an iconic sight from the cantilevered observation wheel, was under construction. This impeded on our ability to attain full enjoyment of the views of London, but didn’t put so much of a damper on our experience of the cantilevered observation wheel that it was to the extent that it destructed our enjoyment time of the cantilevered observation wheel. There were still many sights to soak in, and the London Eye moves along at a slow enough pace for you to enjoy taking pictures and getting a kick out of the other fun and exciting things to do in a gondola.You should go here."

"Written March 29, 2019",Great day out ,Wonderful day out in london especially on a beautiful sunny day. The views of the city are simply amazing 
"Written March 29, 2019",Oh what a view!,"Oh, what a wonderful view of London of you get from up there! Just wow and open-jaw views! Amazing!And for those who are afraid of highs this might be difficult for to accept, but it moves so slowly that you won't even notice that you are moving. Cabins don't move or shake!! Great experience."
"Written March 26, 2019",Awesome London views ,Definitely worth going. It is a must if you’re in London. If you buy tickets online it is way cheaper plus you choose the time frame so you can avoid big queues. 
"Written March 25, 2019",Loved it,Went for anniversary. Unfortunately it was a bit foggy in the day we went so didn’t see everything but was a good experience. Didn’t wait too long in the que and good good priced photos at the end. 
"Written March 24, 2019",Recommendations to visit,Very fast going queue has surprised-after last visit couple years ago thought it would take at least an hour but we skiped in 15 min
"Written February 27, 2019",Eye in the sky,The London eye is worth a visit if you have the time ... Subway to westminister station ... Also view the Big Ben it’s under construction yet ... Parliament buildings ... A nice walk  around and lots of good photos ...ENJOY
"Written February 25, 2019",Half term day out,"Lovely day out with half price through o2 was big advantage, que wasn't too bad too for the weekend, my children loves this place with the lovely views and experience.Bought the photos but quite dark."
"Written February 24, 2019",Buy fast track / get a deal,"Queues at half term (3pm) are probably 45 mins long. Regardless of what your ticket says. Buy fast track if you can. We enjoyed it. Probably something you do once. Perhaps do Thames Rockets afterward, or dungeons or Shrek. "
"Written February 23, 2019",London from the Top,"It was an unforgettable experience to see London from above, especially at night. If you want a discounted ticket, you can buy it in advance from travel website. Bear in mind that you will ride the wheel with strangers since the capacity for one capsule is for about 10 people."
"Written February 23, 2019",Great viewes,I purchased standard tickets through Golden tours. Wheb we arrive the queue was hugr. We upgraded our ticket to the fast line and was totally worth it. We waut for only 5 minutes. The view is amazing. Very romantic if you catch the ride at sunset
"Written February 22, 2019",Anniversary Champagne Experience,A lovely time and beautiful view!  My kids had sparkling juice instead of Champagne which they enjoyed. A little disappointed our capsule had more people than non-experience capsules but that is just bad luck.
"Written February 21, 2019",Nice attraction !,"I have been several times in London, although seems for me to touristic. But last time I bought a ticket and I must confess : super. Topview. Helpfull staff and very friendly. Fastticket is a must if you hate queing. Desadvantage : very crowdy."
"Written February 20, 2019",Book Fast Track!,My boys loved this and once on the London eye the experience was great. Big note however!! Book fast track tickets and you’ll be in within 10-15 minutes. Don’t book these and the queue was really really long!!! Maybe 90 minutes? 
"Written February 19, 2019",Pick a day with good weather,The view from the London eye is excellent but go on a day with good weather. It was just clouding over as we went up but the view was still good but I would imagine it being amazing on a clear. It’s an expensive attraction but use one of the many two for one deals available. 
"Written February 19, 2019",Excellent views but very expensive ,We got the standard tickets so had to line up but the queues do move fast enough so I wouldn’t be too bothered about buying fast track tickets unless you have small kids maybe or are right with time.Views were amazing and I loved every minute of it. However it is very expensive for one spin around which lasts 30 minutes. Definitely a good experience though.
"Written April 13, 2019",Dusk,"20:15. Great time to do this, tesco voucher codes. Arrival and security very good, clean windows.  Offical Photo expensive 25 quid or 20 for 1"
"Written April 12, 2019",London Eye,It’s worth a visit but it’s quite pricey. Great views for Westminster and area. It’s definitely quite nice for tourists!
"Written April 12, 2019",Great views,"Has to be done when you are visiting london a must and great views of the city, would recommend buying the london pass to sealife also."
"Written April 11, 2019",Worth the wait,"Whether you climb aboard during the day or at night, this really is an unforgettable experience. It's a wait and a hassle to board, but the stunning views really are worth it. Book in advance, if you can. "
"Written April 9, 2019",Great views of the city ,We just loved the views of the city from the London Eye.  We got some great pictures of the city. The line was a little long but it moved pretty quickly.  
"Written April 7, 2019",Surprisingly enjoyable,"I thought this was a decent experience, it’s kind of fun being in a capsule that holds upwards of 30 people (although they only put in 15 or so). It’s not that scary if you’re afraid of heights (no glass floor and it moves very slowly) but next time I think I’ll try a view from the Shard instead. It’s technically a little less expensive and you also technically get more time “on top” to view and explore the city. Not having visited the Shard, I’m inclined to think it’s a better way to go between the London Eye and Shard for views of the city. I assume the queues for the Eye are longer than for the Shard."
"Written April 7, 2019",Nice view,Lovely experience. We also had the 4d short movie and we loved it. I reccomend taking the fast track ticket its really worth it
"Written April 6, 2019",Get fast track tickets,The experience was underwhelming for what I was expecting. It’s not included in London Pass. We were going to go Saturday evening around 6pm but the lines were ridiculous. We bought fast track tickets for the next day for 4:30 pm. We arrived at 4pm and were on the Eye within 15 minutes. If we had been in the regular line it would have been over an hour wait. The views were cool but not as awesome as the Shard views in my opinion. 
"Written April 6, 2019",Where’s the air conditioning?,"Big money from a sponsor from Atlanta (coca cola), so why is the pod so stuffy, hot and claustrophobic?  Good views, even with Big Ben under refurbishment."
"Written April 6, 2019",I rode on this,"When I was in London I did this because it was really close to my hotel and I thought it would be fun.  I bought tickets and they let us get on.  Then we went around in a circle and we could look down at the ground and see things.  They look different from in the air and you can see a long way when you are on the top.  We thought it was fun and we liked doing this.  It cost a lot of money for one ride though, but I guess that is okay.  I think you should ride this because it is fun and you can see a lot of things and a lot of places when you are on the top.  "
"Written March 6, 2019",Great experience,With express-line ticket there is absolutely no waiting time when waiting in line. The view would have been even cooler if the weather had been nice. You have to have done it once in London.
"Written March 4, 2019",London must do,"A super way to see a lot of the major landmarks, The boat trip is interactive , informative and a nice alternative to your general sight seeing experience  I would recommend a pm sailing and take the London eye experience at night when its dark this allows the best of both worlds, great package experience "
"Written March 4, 2019",broaden your horizon,Excellent views of London by day. With a true panoramic city scene all around you of one of the greatest cities in the world!
"Written March 4, 2019",Nice view,"Large view on London. Hope the sun will be with you as we had. So very nice moment. Use fast track to skip the queue, sometimes necessary "
"Written March 4, 2019",I LOVE THE EYE.,"The Eye is now an iconic part of London. I watched it going up with great excitement from the first day. I can see it from my apartment and it still excites me. It is a must do if you are in my lovely London Town. The capsules are quite roomy inside and children will love it. Of course, it is much better on a clear day, but hey, this is London! The only bad thing would be a misty or foggy day, but we don’t get many of those despite what Hollywood would have you believe, so just enjoy it. Yes, the queue can be long, but don’t forget, the wheel is moving all the time so you won’t wait for too long. The views are spectacular. After the ride, do what a lot of Londoners like to do and take a walk along the South Bank. There is much to see, such as Gabriel’s Wharf, great for food and little shops. Oxo Tower, fab designer shops. Tate Modern, The Globe, and finally, if you have stayed on the walk, you will find the jewel of this part of London, Borough Market. It has been there for a Thousand years!! How great is that. I’m there at least 3 times a week for my goods. The food is wonderful, great bars and restaurants. There is a multitude of stands selling everything you would ever want to eat. The South Bank is my part of London. Veer off the beaten track and you will find the real London. Yes, it does still exist, but you have to look. It is full of our history. These are the streets that Shakespeare, Dickens and Charlie Chaplin walked. Just imagine, when you walk here you walk in their footsteps. How cool is that. I love having you in my home town. Enjoy, enjoy."
"Written March 3, 2019",Weekend Visit! 🎡,"Booked the London Eye online.. would recommend doing so as the queue to buy tickets was absolutely massive!! Started off with the 4D experience (included in purchase), which I wasn’t thinking much to to start with, but was blown away by the time it was over! Well worth a stop before hopping onto the eye itself! We arrived a while before our reserved time slot, but were accommodated upon arrival which was a massive plus! The queue moved rather quickly, and security screening was quick! The view / experience from the pod is fantastic with many photo opportunities! "
"Written March 3, 2019",Slow with large queues,"You can pay extra for a fast pass to avoid the queueIts ok and the views are across the city are spectacular.  However, youve seen all you need to see half way upSeems to take forever to get round. I couldnt wait to get offBoring"
"Written March 1, 2019",Excellent Views,"Excellent views over London on a clear day, can get hot inside the capsules if it’s hot out side, but worth a visit!"

"Written March 1, 2019",Fantastic,Simply a must! This is a really nice experience that provides a great experience/view of the entire city.
"Written January 19, 2019",Wow!,Great views of London! Very long queue so we were glad we pre-booked the champagne ride. Went to the VIP lounge and went straight on and we were treated to a glass of champagne as we went around. Highly recommend this treat! Fabulous experience. Took lots of photos!

"Written January 16, 2019",A must visit attraction,"The views over London are spectacular, go on a good day, buy your tickets in advance to avoid the queues, and if you want to make it really special, take the champagne flight at sunset."
"Written January 16, 2019",Awesome view of London,Really enjoyed a the sunset view of the city and also took great pictures of Big Ben and Thames River
"Written January 15, 2019",View is worth it !! ,"We visited London and had to go on the London Eye !! It was a must do attraction, we had to queue a bit but not long !! Reasonable priced. The views are amazing across London. When we were on it, it was sponsored by British Airways, think it is Coca Cola now !! When u got in and the doors closed it said to you, you are now flying with British Airways !!I am not a great height lover !! But didn’t feel scared at all. Worth a visit ! Tip - think you can now get good prices with a cruise up the Thames and London eye included !! "
"Written January 12, 2019",Nice attraction but expensive overall,"Lines for tickets were extremely long, understandably during the holiday season.  Purchasing online would be a better option, and I think a bit cheaper.  Staff were friendly.  We enjoyed the short pre-view movie, then the wait for the ride was about 15-20 minutes.  The ride itself was nice but our pod was crowded and people didn't seem inclined to rotate around to share the view.  Glad we experienced this attraction first-hand once, but preferred just enjoying the Eye lit up at night and as part of the city skyline."
"Written January 6, 2019",Experience ,"We decided to book the London eye due to having only one day in London on a quick tour and it was amazing . It provided us a visual of London overall from every angle. Lines was a bit long prior to entering but the process was fast. We also got a picture captured while on the ride. Great experience, highly recommend if you are in London for a short duration. "
"Written January 6, 2019",Coca Cola London eye,Despite Having to  wait in the queue for two hours(Which included ticket collection) we still thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The views offered are amazing and we were able to take some wonderful photos of the city . Would recommend the London eye  to people of all ages. Smooth ride throughout . “”A must do” in London
"Written January 6, 2019",Great view.,"I have nice time in Coca-Cola London Eye.  Great view of London,  Thames,  Parliament and Big Ben. But nothing else.  Approx 10min ride ."
"Written January 6, 2019",It's good (if there were no long lines)!,"I have been there many times with my guests and every one of them liked it. I even had my souvenir picture taken. The queue might get a bit longer at times which only shows that it is a popular attraction among tourists. Don't forget to watch the 4D movie, it's cool!"
"Written February 9, 2019",Something I always wanted to do ,"A little anticlimactic, but all in all worth it. I didn't have to wait long even though I didn't have the fast track. "
"Written February 7, 2019",Worth doing once. ,"The London Eye provides some nice views and I am pleased we have done it, but it is very expensive for what it is, even with concession tickets! If you have the time and money then do go, otherwise, enjoy some of the many other activities London has to offer! "
"Written February 6, 2019",A must do in London. ,"My 2nd time of going on the London eye, and it’s still amazing. Went to the 4d cinema before. That was only 5-10 mins but well worth it, then onto the London eye.  No queues due to the time of year, and spectacular views of the Thames and London with some amazing photo opportunities. Think I was on there approx 20 mins, but it felt like ages. "
"Written February 5, 2019",Waste of time,Waste of time. Too short a ride. You are only high up for a brief time. Too expensive for what it is.
"Written February 3, 2019",Great experience,"The London Eye is a must when visiting London. We booked and paid for our tickets online and arrived at around 9:30am ready for when the London Eye first opened. We weren’t queuing for very long which was great. The views were amazing and it taken around 25-30 minutes to go all the way around. I wouldn’t go again because it think it’s one of those things where once you have done it, you’ve done it though I do think it’s worth doing at least once when in London."
"Written January 27, 2019",Great experience ,Great experience on the London eye. Would recommend the £2 programme to get an idea of what you are looking at when up there!!! The 4d cinema experience was also good. We went fast track and only queued for15 mins on a Saturday. 
"Written January 26, 2019",Night visit,"I visited the London Eye in the summer by day and then in the fall by night. Really enjoyed the night vision with its lovely colours, the busy streets full of tourists!"
"Written January 24, 2019",London Eye,"The London Eye was closed due to works so we didn’t get to experience it. However, walking around the area and had some nice views. Worth the walk thru the bridge. Will come back to experience the London Eye next time."
"Written January 23, 2019",Good but nothing special,First time visiting the London Eye and it was good but to be honest I think it’s a bit hyped up. Queuing times were fine and we didn’t have to wait long as it wasn’t that busy. Views were good and we went up very high so saw the skyline which was nice. Probably wouldn’t go again because it wasn’t anything special but each to their own. 
"Written January 21, 2019",It was ok,"Nice views...  we opted for skip-the-line tickets, which saved us time, but all in all, I am not sure it was worth the time and money to go.  The Shard was much more awe-inspiring!"

"Written December 31, 2018",Great Experience ,Massive in size and scope. Tremendous views of the city. It moves slow enough to enjoy the 360 degree views but not so fast that you would miss anything.
"Written December 31, 2018",Birds eye view,Came here on a family trip in the past few days but we did it in the day time. We did find that some staff told us different answers to our questions. Told to join the quenue half hour before our timed booking as we had booked the boat trip. So we ended up doing the boat trip first as couldn't change the booking. Good views. We didn't both the buy the photos taken inside the pods as other people stood in front of us much to the upset of the  little one with us! Thankfully we took our own photos..
"Written December 31, 2018",VIP champagne experience ,"Overall it was an amazing experience!We had a tour guide Kimi that was so polite, informative and willing to help us / answer any questions.I would highly suggest that kids should NOT be allowed to do this experience!! We had 5 children in our group who were running around and acting up. I know for a fact that I wasn’t the only person to think that kids shouldn’t be allowed as I got talking with a few other adults. Perhaps children under the age of 14?To be honest, I think getting the fast track option and booking tickets online massively helps as the queues were wild!! "
"Written December 30, 2018",Great views of London,"Although the overall experience is great, price is a bit too expensive.Worth doing if you have enough time and good budget, otherwise there is much more to do for free in London."
"Written November 27, 2018",Not suitable for families particularly pregnant mothers and young children,"We booked the VIP experience for my father's 60th. I am 7 months pregnant and we picked the VIP package so that I could rest my feet and enjoy the experience without having to endure the queues. We also had an autistic toddler in our party and hoped time in the VIP lounge would keep him nice and calm before boarding our capsule. Because the VIP lounge doesn't offer meals (which is understandable) my husband went down stairs to buy me a pie to share with the toddler. Whilst eating the pie with my nephew a waitress came and said you are not allowed to eat in here.My sister reasoned that this is a child and a pregnant woman and we booked the lounge specifically give us a chance to recuperate.Furthermore the fact that there were no signs to state the no eating rule, it felt unfair to suddenly inform us of this. I was forced to go downstairs where there was no seating and had to eat standing.Not the kind of treatment you expect for a pregnant woman and toddler."
"Written November 26, 2018",Touristy for sure but...,"We had a great time on our trip around the London Eye.  It is an expensive endeavor for a family to undertake but the views really are stunning. We skipped the expensive novelty photos which helped to cut down on cost. It felt like they were trying to upsell us the whole time we were there on everything from food to photos to souvenirs.  If you have time and money to burn, we felt that it was a fun way to view London…"
"Written November 26, 2018",Wonderful way to get out of the cold and see London!,"We recently traveled to London for the first time last week. It was a cold & rainy day, so what better than to get out of the elements and see the city. We all loved the London Eye experience. There was no waiting and only us and another family of 3 in the ""pod"" with us. Eventhough it was cloudy and gloomy, we still have lovely views of the city. We wouldn've have loved seeing it at night, as well. Such a lovely attraction and worth the money! PS...the Hot Whiskey cart outside of the entrance, is amazing! A perfect & delicious way to warm up!"
"Written November 25, 2018",Great experience and views at a value,If you have little ones and want to go here and some other places around the area. I suggest going to the site and booking online. We got a great deal on tickets for this and the sea life center. We also got great views of the city. Same as most things get here before noon if you want to avoid huge lines. Even on a cloudy day we were able to see pretty far. Our son hates Ferris wheels but he didn’t mind this one because it’s enclosed and it goes really slow.
"Written November 25, 2018",Good,It was like it should be. Fast lane in November not necessary. Good view over Westminster. Combine with others like Madame Tussaud's.
"Written November 21, 2018",My husbands favorite,"Skipping the line was worth it, as the waiting line was way too long when we arrived. Also if the ride could be a bit longer, we fully enjoyed the time in here. The view over the center of London was just wow. Especially as we arrived when the sun was going down. The capsule wasn't too crowded, which was important to have the chance to see as much as possible. One of our top to-do things in London"
"Written November 21, 2018",Good for views across London,Not a lot to review - you go round and round getting decent views of London - not especially exciting and not cheap of what you get- at busy times you can queue for hours and there are better ways of spending your time and money in London and 
"Written November 18, 2018",Weekend relaxing ,It's very big and you can see the whole centre of London. It's must visit and go have a try. It's very good to take pictures all around and unike place. I'd recommend to anyone 👍
"Written November 18, 2018",Not worth the cost,"Excellent facility but hugely overpriced. Check to see if you’re eligible for a discount: nhs, student, etc.The crowd queuing system is a shambles, in need of restructuring. Once in the capsule, it’s great to see London and it’s beautiful landmarks. We went on around 4pm - up in daylight, down in the dark! Wonderful!"
"Written November 16, 2018",Waste of time and money ,"Everyone visiting London want to do this. And I think almost everyone wonders why they did it. Or at-least the ones that were with me in the ‘eye’. It’s bloody boring and the views aren’t that great either. I still wonder why, why, why I paid for this. Avoid. "
"Written December 16, 2018",Beautiful view...but not sure its worth the wait.,"Amazing views when at the very top!!! however not sure it was totally worth it. The line for peopole with tickets was about 2 hours!! Also the views on the way up are just ok. Although the view up top is beautiful, its only there for a few mins making it really hard to grab a picture, especially when theres also 20 or so other people trying to do the same."

"Written December 16, 2018",Waste Of Time - SKIP!,This was a royal (pun intended) waste of time and money. The view is 'meh' and the price is ridiculous. You have to SHARE your cab with strangers.
"Written December 13, 2018",Great view,It is a bit of a tourist trap but something you will kick yourself if you don't visit while in London. The tickets are not cheap but the view is great. Don't worry about a swinging gondola. It is rock steady and takes about a half hour to go around. The gondolas are completely enclosed so there is no wind to worry about.
"Written December 12, 2018",Lovely views,"Did a sunset trip to the London Eye. Used priority tickets which is well worth it especially since:1. The queues are busier in December as well as around sunset2. We had a 2 year old daughter and so wouldn't manage a long queue very well.If you don't mind the wait then standard tickets are fine. The view was lovely. You spend enough time up there and the capsules are not overcrowded. Definitely a must do for London but once it's done, that's it. No need for repeats unlike other London attractions eg. The museums"
"Written December 11, 2018","Expensive, rude staff but nice view ","The staff wasn’t very friendly, we had tickets and there was a staring line so we joined the line, as the boys who checked the tickets were sure we tried to skip the line ( there was no line except constantly walking people everywhere) he told us to go to the back of the line, because of the discussion now there was a line and he wanted us to go to the back. As we were waiting with our four year old this wasn’t very pleasant. But we didn’t had a choice as they both were very rude. But hey, there’s only one London eye so maybe they think they’re allowed to treat people like that. Wouldn’t go back soon. "
"Written December 11, 2018",London Eye by night and rain,"Worth buying the ticket online to skip the queue, though the queue is still quite long. It was an evening ride under the pouring rain of London, but it was still a very nice experience. Pure tourist attraction."
"Written December 11, 2018",Fantastic,It is very interesting to ride in London eye. One can see from top city view. It takes hours to get turn. Staff is very polite and gives information if asked. Eye is very neat and clean.
"Written December 10, 2018",Learn to identify the skyline,"this is a slow ride, so dont see it as a fairground trip-it is for viewing the skyline of a very old city, with lots of easerly identifiable buildings if you know what you are looking at. I took an American friend and as a Londoner, I was able to point out what could be seen. On a clear day, you can see as far as Hampstead Heath. Great for tourists, children may not appreciate it unless they like buildings as their is no commentary. Look out for combined tickets and be aware queues can be long as the ride is very slow, but the pods are large and can take a few people, but you are not squashed in."

"Written December 30, 2018",Nothing wow about it ,The london eye is an overrated place to visit according to me .The ride is nice and slow for abt 25 mins or so .But it has no commentary and no idea what we are about to see .We have to look at places and find out which are there from the top .If there was commentary I guess it would have been more fun .

"Written December 27, 2018",Very beautiful view ,"This is amazing ,the best view around LondonI love this and looking forward to visiting again soon Bye bye🥂 cheers “Ari”🥰❤️"
"Written December 26, 2018",Absolutely Fantastic!,"My partner and I have visited the London eye twice together now, and on both occasions absolutely loved it! The staff are extremely helpful, the capsules are always clean and look modern. The capsules aren’t too over crowded which is fantastic as this enables you to move around the capsule taking photos and creating memories. You can see so much from the London eye, including the Shard, Big Ben, Westminster and so many more famous landmarks. I would highly recommend this tourist attraction. I would also recommend buying tickets online and bringing a print out to save time in the queues. "
"Written December 9, 2018",Wonderful ,Activity to do to have wonderful view of londonExpensive but pleasant comfortable and nice Place to be 
"Written December 7, 2018",London I? London Q!,"OK, the view is good (but there are better in London) but the queuing is unbearable. If this is the best attraction in London, I say poor show. Save your money and go to the Sky Garden. It’s free!"
"Written December 7, 2018",Great views,"Loved this, we bought half price tickets through O2 Priority and didn’t have to queue for long to get on to a capsule. Great views of London thoroughly recommend."
"Written December 5, 2018",Beautiful scene,Well it is more than expected .. the scenery was great and the weather was perfect ! Had to buy the photos taken inside. Recommended
"Written December 4, 2018",London Eye Trip,"The trip was very good we only had to wait ten minutes to board, even though we were advised it would be thirty minutes, and the view was breathtaking even though the weather was dull. The view of the eye in darkness is also something to see."
"Written December 4, 2018",Good deal for families on short vacation (all long weekends),"Was at London on Nov.21-25 on business trip and took some time fro leisure having my family join me.  I mainly booked these venues for my little daughter - which she loved (all of them).   From the three venues only the aquarium (on Sat.24th) did not have a long waiting queue but even so, the line at London Eye was moving fast enough not to freeze your limbs and foe the young one not to complain.  Madame Tussaud & London Eye could fit in a day (Fri.23rd) and we went to aquarium the next - don't think anyone could fit them all 3 in one day if you do not rush through everything !  Although online-ticketing offered the ability to book a specific time-slot - and I did - it was not 'honored' as an appointment, we did wait in-line; I think only those paying ""fast-track""  tickets bypassed the line.   Madame Tussaud's was too crowded for my taste but my little one enjoyed it."
"Written December 3, 2018",Fantastic views of London and great value. ,We have been on the eye multiple times and it never disappoints. Would recommend at day time and night time.
"Written December 2, 2018",You Can See it ALL from Here!,This is definitely worth the time to stop.  You can see all of the sites of London from here.  You also get an awesome view of Parliament and Westminster's Abbey from high up looking down.  
"Written December 2, 2018",Fun and interesting ,Tip pre book an early spot before the crowds decend on the many tourist attractions in the area. We arrived 20 mins early but they let you on and don't have to wait for your time slot.Great skyline views.
"Written November 28, 2018",Great view!!,I took my staff to the eye as our company outing and it was great . The panoramic views are amazing. We went at sunset and it was magical!! I recommend doing the fast track the lines are insane
"Written December 23, 2018",Great experience,"The London eye is a must if you love heights and want to have a great London area view. Don’t pay for the fast track, the normal path is quite fast and do buy your ticket along with the river boat cruise as it is an experience worth having and it is also great value for money,"
"Written December 22, 2018",Exciting ,"We did the champagne experience tour (nice but not really necessary this time of year as the crowds are low) and visited at dusk : the visibility was unlimited. The xmas lights of the city were great. There is a small amusement center and this time of year , a Christmas mart. Also lots to eat nearby. "
"Written December 22, 2018",great view but long queue,"We bought our tickets at the trainstation and understood we could use these tickets straight away to the London Eye. There are 2 queue's. 1 for the ride and 1 for getting the tickets. Unfortunately we found out the hard way that we could not use our tickets straight away, and that in the meantime the ticket counter already closed. So we had to come back a day later..The queue for the tickets was about 30 min.  After that we went to the 4D show which was nice, but not that special. Our ticket timeslot was an hour later than when we got it, so we left to come back later. We came back around 5 pm when it was almost dark. The queue for the ride itself was huge. We had "" normal "" tickets so we could not go to the fasttrack.When we entered the queue and they checked our tickets, we explained that my wife is pregnant. The staff was very thoughtful and said we could use the fasttrack instead. Finally into the pod the view was great. There were about 15 people inside, but we had plenty of room. the ride itself took about 20-30 minutes but was worth it."
"Written December 18, 2018",Eye-catching experience with my penpal and her family.,"Kate (a British) and I  (a Singaporean) knew each other since we were schoolgirls.  We were penpals. The term 'penpals' must sound strange to people born after the 80s, but that was the way young people in my generation did when we wanted to get to know friends from other countries, we would write to one another, using snail mail.Kate and I had never met until this December when my family could make our first trip to UK and finally get to meet her and her family and toured together for 2 days.  We were at the Christmas market near the London Eye.  Initially, I wasn't keen to take the London Eye because there was a long queue, moreover, in Singapore, we also have our Singapore Flyer.  However, Kate encouraged us to try the London Eye because a trip to London isn't quite complete without it.  We agreed, and we went on to try it!What a fantastic experience viewing the famous landmarks of London from the London Eye!  In the late afternoon, after the sun set at 1600 hr, the glittering streetlights and Christmas lighting formed a mesmerizing atmosphere in the cabin, which were filled with tourists/locals eager to capture the beautiful night scenery into their cameras.  We couldn't get enough of the scenery in the short half-an-hour ride.Will be back for more in our next trip to London.  And thank you for the lovely friendship time with Kate and her family on the London Eye.  @Kate:  you were very right, we are glad we had listened to you."
"Written December 16, 2018",Great wiews,If you get there late afternoon or early morning and not have to que too long it’s worth going up on the London eye specially on a clear day. Overlooking London is amazing
"Written October 23, 2018",London by night,"Spectacular, the view we've had over the city with all the lights. Our host recommended it, don't know if by day it's as spectacular as this but I'd go again, worth the waiting line and money. I think you also have enough time up there, as it moves slow."
"Written October 22, 2018",A hit,"This was on the top of my niece's to-do list. Pre-ordering, and paying for fast-track is certainly worth it."
"Written October 21, 2018",Amazing view if Big Ben was not covered,Highly recommend to pay an extra for fast truck but too many people were in my capsule who wanted to take pictures and capsule was not clean so was not able to take good pictures.  It gets warm so dress up accordingly.  I am not sure it’s worth it as Big Ben was covered for next 3 years or so.  I will definitely recommend it after Big Ben was fixed.
"Written October 21, 2018",Need a little bit of empathy with customers,"I would love to review this attraction as we had booked the VIP experience. We arrived about 20 minutes before the allotted time, now while I appreciate it states do try and get there 45 minutes before, there was a demonstration against Brexit this day and we were delayed in the first instance, but once we got there I asked three different members of staff where it was we needed to go and was given 3 different locations, ultimately ended up in missing our allotted time slot. Got to the desk and the next capsule they could get us in was 5.30 and charging £10 for the pleasure of changing the booking. 2 managers later, we still don't have a booking but did manage to get a glass of champagne in the lounge. I would like this resolved."
"Written October 21, 2018","Lovely views, but pricey","The views are lovely and it’s interesting, but I have to say that I thought it was expensive for what it was; however, we also did the express tickets given we expected the line would be long that day.  That being said, it’s hard not to do it and was enjoyable—just pricey. "
"Written October 20, 2018",Be ready to queue but well worth it!,Loved the whole experience what amazing views and great pictures.. Making memories with my boy. Long queues but they go down fast and such a great buzzy atmosphere.
"Written October 19, 2018",Not great,So the London is owned by coca cola...1) over priced2) massive queues3) go to the Shard instead4) if you want to feel like tourist cattle do thisIt’s a big massive Ferris wheel
"Written October 18, 2018",Have to have a like for heights ,"On arrival if you’re going during holidays it is going to be a fair old wait to get on it. The rotation takes 30 mins, you can get a brilliant view of London from it! "
"Written October 17, 2018",Large group,Best to fast pass as the line can be very long. The day we were there the wait was over two hrs long on a Wed afternoon in October. The view is fantastic and you don’t get any feeling of motion at all. 
"Written October 17, 2018",Overpriced ,"I wouldn’t recommend a visit to the London eye, my girlfriend and I did it and whilst it was okay, value for money was poor and I wouldn’t do it again "
"Written November 13, 2018",Book The Champagne Experience - Totally worth it!,"I highly recommend booking the Champagne Experience. I read reviews that said it wasn't worth it and you had to stand in line anyways, etc, etc. so we were hesitant. However, while sipping champagne in the lounge we realized just how long the regular line is and we were so glad that we did not have to stand in it. When it was our time, we were escorted to the faster line, went straight to bag check and were on a pod in less than 5 minutes. Totally worth it! Plus we had a champagne cart and knowledgeable employee in the pod with us who could tell us what we were seeing and answer questions."
"Written November 12, 2018",This is a must when you are in London,"This is a must when you are in London....a bit expensive, and sometimes it can be a long queue, but it is a very nice experience."
"Written November 11, 2018",A good experience,"A wonderful experience, didnt think it was gonna be a good time, bit expensive, but we bought online months back "
"Written November 11, 2018",BOOK IN ADVANCE,You should book your tickets online to save a bit but mostly to make sure that you can still get one. They are often sold out. Overall it’s a tad expensive but the view is very nice and the cabins are kept in good shape
"Written November 11, 2018",Cool Ride,Went up and was able to see the city on a clear day. Wasn’t sure when we would be able to go so we bought tickets on site. Ticket line was long but nobody noticed the kiosks to buy the tickets. We used the machine and saved 20 minutes. Would do again 
"Written November 10, 2018",A fine one-time experience,"You might do it once. However, the lines on a busy day (we were there on a Saturday) were overwhelmingly long, the information was unclear as to where lines started and the lines seem unmanaged. Because the lines were so long, we opted to do fast-track, paying extra to reserve a time slot. We only found out later we should have been asked if we had a day travelcard - which we did - to save 30%. Instead, we paid almost 40 pounds per ticket per adult. That's a pretty steep bill. Was it worth it? Yes and no. The view at times is spectacular -- but there is no onboard guide or recording to provide information as to just what you're looking at. We had someone with us who could guide us, so that helped. If your airplane flies near central London, you might have a nice view also - without paying extra fees and dealing with the lines. Put it this way: if you have the time, energy and cash to burn, go ahead. A better value was the River Cruise -- for 12 pounds, you see all major London bridges and you have a funny guide who provides great information as to what you're looking at."
"Written November 7, 2018",Well run attraction,"Easy online process for booking tickets. Big queue on arrival but they keep the whole thing moving along and the pods aren't overly crowded. Great views of the city and for those who hate heights it is very smooth, solid feeling and reassuring. I think that given two tickets cost £50 that it is simply greed to ask for another £25 for photos that literally took 10 seconds to capture. "
"Written November 7, 2018",London eye,Better to book your tickets online and avoid Sunny Saturdays because it’s hell on earth in a que but apart from that it’s a fantastic experience in one of the best city’s in the world!
"Written November 6, 2018",Wonderful View,London Eye is really breathe taking. It is very high and view is amazing. I was lucky that weather was clear. 
"Written November 5, 2018",The Eye Has It!,The Eye is terrific ... though long queues are horrific ... purchase your tickets online before you go.  Depending on the weather ... you get great views over London all the way to Windsor Castle.  It can be a relaxing 30 minute ride.
"Written November 4, 2018",Must-go!,"Amazing views of London from here. It is definitely a must-visit! We really enjoyed it, it was slow enough to enjoy the views and yet, time flew!"
"Written November 2, 2018",Nice trip! ,We visited the London Eye having booked our tickets on line but the queue we had to stand in was so long we didn’t get on the Eye until one hour later. However the views are fantastic and it remains not too commercially focussed with the pod remaining an easy place to navigate and the views are uninhibited as well. I had been on the Eye before but it didn’t disappoint.  My advice would be even if booking on line expect to spend st least 30-60 minutes queuing 
"Written November 1, 2018",Great view of the city ,"A little pricey for a family, but great panoramic views of all of London’s beauty. Paying for the fast track ticket in advance is well worth cutting down on wait times. Kids loved it.  "
"Written November 1, 2018",Just do it,Been on this twice and it does not disappoint. Both my children loved it. There's a shop on your way round it and when we stopped to get a drink people pushed on ahead in the line that was the only annoying part as the shop is part of the line. 
"Written October 29, 2018",A must do!,"Let me preface this by saying I went on the eye with my mom two years ago and said I would never do it again. I just recently brought my husband to London and felt I had to take him on this. We bought the champagne experience tickets and I would do it again in a heartbeat. The group size in the capsule was much smaller doing it with the experience. Also, we got in the fast pass line. Worth the extra money, and also great to do a night/sunset!"
"Written October 29, 2018",Not really worth the money,"Both my daughter and I agreed that this was an OK think to do in London. It's expensive, the lines are long, and the view is not really all that spectacular.  "
"Written October 26, 2018",Beautiful ,"Nice , nice , nice. A must see in London. Very good atmosphere! If you plan on getting on the London eye— it’s best to purchase in advance !!! The lines are long!!!!!!!!! Very. Ice views - I enjoyed the night views !! "
"Written October 25, 2018",Overpriced must do,The queue system was a little confusing but it did go down quick. I think the price is a little expensive for what it is but it’s a must do attraction when you visit London. 
"Written October 25, 2018",Check Before Getting an Express Pass,Check with staff if you actually need an Express pass. There is no point if the lines are short to buy tickets.Would be nice if they could do more for keeping the glass clean.
"Written October 25, 2018",Insane queues and pickpockets love this area,A group of 4 can have a 30 minute helicopter flight over the city for the same price - need I say more
"Written October 2, 2018",Something you need to do,This is just one of those things you need to do in London.  The Eye is one of those attractions that during the approximately 30-minute ride will all you to view a good amount of London and a pace that seems like you are barely moving.  There is a bench in the middle of each car if you are concerned about dealing with the height.  There is so much to do around the Eye.  Take advantage of it.
"Written October 2, 2018",London Eye experience,"Early evening tickets were purchased for my family of  5 (including my son-in-law) on our last day of a 5 day trip.  It was so worth seeing an elevated view of many of the places we had visited the past 5 days!  A little pricey, but worth the experience."
"Written October 2, 2018",See the expansive London metropolis,This was well worth it. A bit crowded but they move everyone along.  Got some great pics of the Thames and other landmarks with friends in the foregrounds.  Do it--it was memorable.  but once is enough
"Written October 2, 2018",Sightseeing,Take patience with you the ticket lines are long but goes very quickly.the ride give an awesome city view of London and its historic beauty restaurant and rest room's are close.
"Written October 2, 2018","Go early, but Go","Amazing, easy for all ages, spectacular, and worth the price. We have priceless pictures and the overview was breathtaking! "
"Written October 1, 2018",Perfect view of London,"We are afraid of heights but this was a fantastic experience ! The best advice is to get a fast track ticket , the wait was manageable for us as we are seniors . The views were super and we could sit and enjoy the sights ."
"Written September 30, 2018",rainy day,"the day i went there was a rainy day, even that we enjoyed the round.. it was amazing, just sad the the big ben was covered for maintenance (i think 5 years starting 2016 or 2017)"
"Written September 29, 2018",Meh ,It was disappointing.  I thought it would have been a better experience. Not worth the time or money. 
"Written September 27, 2018",A view over London,Decided to do the London Eye and reserved together with Madame Tussauds for a discount which is 11 £ so do it. Overall nice view over London. But I expected more.
"Written September 26, 2018",Pod on top of London,"Even thought the ticket is pricy, you really have quite the serene views of the city. The line is long but moves quickly. Each pod is rather large, temperature controlled and has plenty of room to sit or stand. The trip around is about half an hour. Around the area there is a gift store, ice cream store and vendors."
"Written August 18, 2018",What a wheel!,Who doesn’t like a ferris wheel?  Highly recommend you pay online to skip the lines.  Made a huge difference on queue time.  I also recommend you take this sight in on day one of your trip as it gives you a great view of the city and will help you navigate to other attractions throughout your stay.  Westminster area if very walkable and once we had a birds eye view we navigated it very quickly and easily.
"Written August 17, 2018",Find the sites you want to visit from up here,The Eye was not crowded as we had been told. Breathtaking views.The experience is not rushed lasts around 30 minutes. There's time enough for photos of the entire cityscape. It is a very smooth sweeping moment. Enjoy. 
"Written August 16, 2018",Great views,"We went on the London eye having pre booked our time slot with a 3 attraction Merlin pass after reading the reviews I expected the queues to be a horror story with lots of queue jumpers but I was pleasantly surprised. We arrived at our time slot and went straight to the booked time slot queue and went straight in, after a short 5 minute queue we were on. The pod had about 25 people in it and was not crowded at all. There is a bench in the middle to sit down on which was great for my son who does not like heights. The views were great but it would have been great to have some commentary to let us know what was around us. The trip took about 30 minutes and was good value as we had booked the slot with the 3 attraction Merlin pass.After we went to the 4d free show which was great and gave you a great birds view of the eye and London, well worth a visit and it costs you no more money."
"Written August 15, 2018",Nice sight but short and expensive,"We went in August 2018, the queue was not too long and it took few minutes to get on the London eye. The sight is impressive though it is written that to make a full circle it takes 40 minutes but it was much shorter. Considering the non negligeable cost I’m not shure I would advice it, there are other nicer and cheaper attractions"
"Written August 14, 2018","Touristy, but great",Was not always on my 'to do list'.. . But so glad I did.  .esp glad that I was encouraged to book fast track tickets.  . Worth the extra $The queues are horrendous and no cover available for relief from the sun or protection of the rain.  Warning.  . If u buy tickets elsewhere you needed to exchange them at the site before lining up.  . Be prepared to wait.  . Bit its worth it
"Written August 14, 2018",Great Views - NOT great wait,"While this is clearly the best way to see London from above, I don't know that the lines in August are worth it.  We purchased our tickets in advance, and we still had to wait more than 2 hours to get on.  Signage could be better for where to wait, etc.  We saw lots of people get in the wrong line, wait at least 30-45 minutes only to be told they were in the wrong line.  "
"Written August 14, 2018",Do it once in your life and that’s it! ,OK is the best advice I can give you is either purchase your ticket to make that reservation time fast track in advance or at the hotel concierge do not I repeat do not expect to show up to this place and be able to buy tickets and get on the ride all within that 10 hours it’ll take you to pass through that line absolutely no way! 
"Written September 16, 2018",Great sights at such a height!,"It was an enjoyable and picturesque experience. The duration of the London eye is a good amount of time. We bought tickets for two attractions and we skipped the lines for both, which made the whole experience better. "
"Written September 15, 2018",Beautiful views,"Went here on a clear day, lovely views, plenty of room for everyone. Didn’t like all of the touristy trappings as you wait, but fun! Kids love it. "
"Written September 15, 2018",Superb,"If you have time to do just one thing when you go to London, this is the one to choose. Good vale, world class venue"
"Written September 14, 2018",Great views ,Great views of everywhere around London. Very smooth ride would barely notice you’re moving. Be careful of what time you book your slot for as queues can be very long. 
"Written September 14, 2018",Great views!,I really wasn’t interested in this but my husband wanted to do it. I was pleasantly surprised. The birds eye view was really great! The time allotted was just right. We had a great perspective. I suggest doing this at the start of your visit so you know what the layout of the city is.
"Written September 13, 2018",Fun place to visit,We rented  bikes and rode around the London Eye area.  It was such a nice friendly area to visit. Lots of nice restaurants.
"Written September 13, 2018",Awesome views and photo ops.,We went during a pretty busy time and we only waited for about 5-10 minutes. The ride gave plenty of time to look around and take pictures. Definitely a must if visiting London!
"Written September 13, 2018",Wedding treat,"My husband booked for a champagne flight for 2. We arrived at 1600 to be informed we had missed the flight and we needed to be there 10-15 mins before toCheck in. So we headed to check in and was told we had to pay £10 admin fee - wasn’t happy about this and have filled out complaint letter - if they had highlighted this in email we could have done it! One thing it did say was bring ID - which we did but were not asked for it - so if u have set conditions u need to stick by them all - not just pick and chose!!!Anyway, that issue aside we enjoyed the flight. Nice to see the city. Felt it very strange that we had a child on the flight - I know he wasn’t drinking however having a champagne flight it would be nice to have adults only as not everyone likes children! Luckily the lad was well behaved but had he not of been we wouldn’t have been very impressed! Worth booking VIP to avoid the long Q’sChampagne was nice (one glass) and the host was informative. But strange that she had to bump her “bar” down several steps to the wheel....but luckily no explosions! We didn’t have picture taken when we went in - which others seem to have done. And the photo taken towards the end of the flight was of us and some other random people that couldn’t be cropped out so we didn’t buy it which was a shame as we could of liked a momento. "
"Written September 13, 2018",Worth the wait,London eye is a must if you visiting London. Do not be deterred by the que it moves fairly fast. Try to buy the package deals for all your attractions such as London dungeons etc. It works out much cheaper
"Written September 13, 2018",Line Moves Quickly,"Although very commercialized, the Eye does give you a great perspective of London.  The line moves quite quickly as they load 20-25 people into each capsule. "
"Written August 13, 2018",very crowded - watch your time,"Had 8:00 tickets (sunset)  showed up at 7:30, like the ticket said.  Fast Track puts you right through, ended up getting on too early and missed the sunset.  Area is very crowded.  Shell game cons clogging up the bridge when trying to walk across the river from the Tube Station.  Plan on a solid 20 minutes walking from the tube station to the eye.  Very dirty part of the city with litter everywhere.  View was nice on top, but wouldn't go back."
"Written August 11, 2018",London Eye Great for All Ages,"I visited the London Eye with my mom (86) and daughter (19).  What a fantastic way to see the city!  The staff were very friendly and thankfully the pods are air-conditioned.  We purchased the fast pass and it was worth it!  If you love to take photos, then you should definitely go.  The souvenir photos are quite expensive, but that’s the norm for all of the big tourist attractions."
"Written August 11, 2018",No need to go,"It was not my cup of tea.Simply boring ,The staff at the ticket area is not helpfull I had to find myself a way to get my fast track tickets.The attraction itself is good from the ground.Forget it."
"Written September 26, 2018",Too expensive,On a clear day you can see all of London. But for the cost it just wasn’t worth it. Go to the walkie talkie building and go to the roof top garden for free. 
"Written October 14, 2018",Great views on a sunny day,Worth seeing.  Very busy but if you want spend the money for the fast track ticket.  We didn't see the other sites associated with it.  Well organized.
"Written October 11, 2018",Excellent experience,"We simply walked up and there was no wait. however, in hindsight, I wish we purchased tickets in advance for a reduced price. Still worth it!"
"Written October 11, 2018",Beautiful view of London!,"The London eye was a fun family adventure to go on! It’s about 30 minutes to see the views of the London skyline... and, it’s very pretty. Would recommend for families to do!"
"Written October 8, 2018",London eye,"Smashing experiance with great views even in the rain. Large queue for tickets in ticket office, but you do get on to the eye very quickly. "
"Written October 7, 2018",Go after sunset to avoid the crowds,We had a gift card to use for the London eye and originally went during the day - however we found the pods were fairly full and the queues were long - so we decide to book a time slot in the evening so we could enjoy a view overlooking London when it  is lit up beautifully! And it was definitely worth the wait - our pod only had me and my partner and one other couple in it so we weren’t all trying to get the best spot. Going in the evening is perfect for anybody who would like to go on the London eye and experience this attraction who has already already enjoyed a view overlooking London already (a free option is to visit the Sky Garden)
"Written October 5, 2018",Disappointed & Insulted,"We booked online for the Eye and from the start were disappointed with the whole experience. First, the staff insisted on a printed ticket which we were unable to supply as we were travelling from overseas and staying in an apartment with no printing facilities. We were directed by staff to what seemed the 'usual' place people in our situation were sent about a 1/2 km away to then pay a further £3 to have the ticket printed. Once we returned to the line, we were then told by another attendant that we were in the wrong line for the ticket type we had and had to join another queue! Once we got on the Eye we were further disappointed by the lack of commentary and/or signage in the capsule pointing out the landmarks. The capsules contained no information other than Coca Cola signage and we were then insulted with the request at the end to stand in the Photo zone and ""don't forget to smile"" in order to take another photo to sell to us!  I would not recommend the London Eye to anyone - it is not worth the money and hassle. You can get as good, if not better views, from other areas of the city for free without the insults."
"Written October 5, 2018",London view!,It’s a nice way to have a view from above of the whole London. The wheel is moving slowly so you have enough time to enjoy and see the view!
"Written October 3, 2018",London Eye - negotiate with someone in the next pod to exchange photos!,"We were quickly on-board. It's a marvellous piece of engineering. The pods stay on the outside at all times - cool!After some sign language with a couple in the next pod, we took some photos of them in their pod, then exchanged them when back on the ground."
"Written October 2, 2018",Nice view and cool engineering,"While not a cheap 20 minute ride it is a great view and the structure is quite impressive.  I’m not sure it is a “don’t miss” in London as there are other view options such as the Shard or restaurants in the shard, but not a waste of time."
"Written October 2, 2018",Good Idea,This line for the London Eye can be quite long.  It was worth the effort ($) to get the ticket to avoid spending time in line
"Written August 27, 2018",What a View,"Took a ride on the London Eye, what a spectacular view you get of London from the top of the ride.  The queue is quite long depending on when you go but does move at a fast pace as each pod holds about 30 persons.If you ticket is purchased by a Tour Company (ie Caledonian Tours, etc.) for the London Eye, London Eye River Cruise and Mde Tussauds you cannot book you times for the Cruise or Mde Tussauds on the Internet site but have to do it at the booking offices. Mde Tussauds can be booked at the London Eye office but don't stand in the standard ticket line use fast track or line at the end for booking Merlin Pass times"
"Written August 26, 2018",Round and round we go,This is my 2nd trip on the eye and it really is an experience to be had. The queues aren't too long. I think the price is a bit much BUT you can get 2 for 1 and there are offers online to be found. I was a bit disappointed that the tablets had been removed since my last visit so remember to buy a 360 viewing map before going on. This is a really good piece of kit as otherwise (especially tourists) you will not know what you are looking at. The ride doesn't last too long but definately long enough for you to look at everything. It's a shame they have built some taller building right near it as this blocks the view of the shard. The gift shop is quite reasonable value for money and a good variety of items too. 
"Written August 23, 2018",A must do and the kids will love it!,"Such a fun experience and it takes about 20 minutes to go all the way around and you get views of the city that are just breathtaking.... lots of places to take family photos, etc. "
"Written August 23, 2018",Views,"Great view of the city on a clear day, but if you are visiting London for the first time, it is definitely worthwhile."
"Written August 22, 2018",Great experience!,"Think we got lucky with this one. Got a great price for 3 of us through the O2 Priority app. Passed it around 1.30 and queues were massive (August 22nd), came back 3.45pm and virtually walked straight on in 5 minutes. The views are just amazing and my granddaughter loved seeing Big Ben from this angle. "
"Written August 21, 2018",Over rated ,"Glad I did the London eye but found it overpriced overrated with too complicated a system for getting on. The queue to buy tickets was very slow and customers around us bad tempered and using inappropriate language. People constantly queue jumping for getting tickets and to get onto eye. staff not very helpful and quite dismissive. Generally London and it’s attractions are well signed, except this. There are self service ticket kiosks which staff didn’t mention and we found by accident that were standing empty - this was after leaving the queue listening to foul language, on way to toilet we spied them. We had our tickets in a few minutes, we met up with others that had continued to queue for a further 90 minutes - we had been on eye and had a bite to eat.View is beautiful but disappointed in the experience. TOP TIP - Use the ticket machines on the right when you go in."
"Written August 20, 2018",Great views of Central London,The ride takes about 30 minutes. HIGHLY recommend the fast pass during peak times. Night views are excellent.
"Written August 20, 2018",Great views on a sunny day,Get your tickets in advance to avoid queuing. It doesn't go round very fast and last about 30 mins. On a sunny day you get great views across the London and I recommend trying to go on at sunset - stunning! I've given 1-2 hours for the total visit as the queues can get quite long!
"Written August 19, 2018",Early evening ride 14th August,"We took a ride at 7pm which was perfect time.Most importantly your ticket has a time, if fast track can arrive 5 minutes before and ok those not fast track need to be at least 30 minutes before to queue ."
"Written August 18, 2018",Book in Advance and go on a weekday,"I would highly recommend the London eye! I went with my best friend and we thoroughly enjoyed it. She lives in London and was the one who said to me that we needed to book. I did not manage to book the 2-for-1 as we didn’t quite understand the process with train tickets and things? We paid 48£ for two.The staff are well organised there and the line moved at a decent pace. It seemed there was also some kind of ticket you could buy which meant you could wait in a shorter line, but it didn’t make too much of a difference, although we did go on a week day. Make sure you have your ticket on your phone or printed out and they will scan it. The attraction I would say took about 30 minutes to go around. There are some really great views and I’d highly recommend , especially in the weekdays when it is less busy as we passed by on a Saturday and it was absolutely rammed!"
"Written September 25, 2018",You can not miss it,The London eye is massive. You can not miss it as you see it from everywhere along the river. It's a memory you will never forget.
"Written September 25, 2018",Great views of London,"The Eye is a very nice way to see the setting sun in London.  Each capsule holds around 12 people, but it was still spacious to get many pictures."
"Written September 24, 2018",Avoid in poor weather,"There is a lot of hype about the London Eye, but really it doesn't live up to it and it is very expensive. You don't get much out of a second visit and if the weather is poor and visibility reduced it may feel a waste of time."
"Written September 22, 2018","Great, but expensive ","Fabulous views of London, and a great opportunity to point out different landmarks and historical places to my children. The price, for 30 minutes entertainment, is too high. We got a discount for traveling there by train, but £27 for an adult and £22 per child is crazy. Also, they took a souvenir photo before getting on the ride, but at the end we discovered that only the tops of my children’s heads were visible! I would have expected them to know how to adjust the lens to capture children!"
"Written September 22, 2018",Mark is the best !!,"The cruise in itself is fun, but with Mark’s (tour guide) comments, it brings the experience to a whole new level ! "
"Written September 19, 2018",The views can't be beaten elsewhere,"Ok, totally touristy but so worth the fantastic view on London. I would opt to do this around sunset so that you can see the city lights popping up under a sunset sky."
"Written September 18, 2018",Another must go in london,The only thing that can ruin this nice experience is waiting in queues to buy the tickets. Go for the fast track way
"Written September 17, 2018",Ask for Marian,"We booked the champagne experience / fast track. It was strange as we could not claim our ticket by the machines which were very fast, we had to queue up by the vip desk which took ages due a difficult client, and due the fact that only one person worked, the other was socialising and entertaining a group of young girls.We have been advised to go to the lounge and wait for the hostess to come. The lounge is very small and it was very uncomfortable for us as there was a large wedding party and we were just sitting in the corner in our “normal clothes” the drink menu is rather pricy as well, so I would rather skip this bit if we return.Our hostess Marian was amazing, very bubbly but not over the top, very knowledgable and lovely personality. She couldn’t do enough for us when it came to photographs, answering questions and so on. On our tour we had 17 people in our group which was fine, wasn’t too crowded and we had great opportunities to make photos."
"Written September 16, 2018",Rode the London Eye,Perfect day weather wise so I rode the eye.  Surprised it was only £27 for an adult ride.  Only a 10 min wait to get on.  Ride took about 20-25 min.  Great views if the weather is good.  Come early.  No lines right at 10am.  
"Written September 12, 2018",Great view of the city,"Great views of city of London and Thames river.  Great place to take pictures.  However, the ride is a little expensive and short.  "
"Written September 12, 2018",Nice view!,"You can see all greater London from up there and more. I went up the shard, st Paul's cathedral bell tower and Westminster cathedral bell tower., Anther view with the only advantage you don't need to go up stairs. Something to know before booking, you have to ride and unride the cabin while it is moving. There were people who were afraid when I was there. Otherwise it is quite relaxing. It also works when it is raining but the view is terrible, Ideally if you book the last minute and check the weather forecast before booking."
"Written September 9, 2018",Nicest experience,"We went to the London eye on one of the hottest days of the year, my sister is in a wheelchair as she has ms when she picked up her carers ticket they escorted us through the crowds and took us straight up to the pod. The pods normally continue moving as you get on, but for a wheelchair they stop the wheel and put down a ramp. The journey was fantastic, there is plenty of time to look over the whole of London, they are air conditioned so very pleasant in the heat. You can move around and take photo's of everywhere while it slowly revolves. Strongly recommend this London attraction."
"Written September 9, 2018",Fun Family Event,"We loved the London Eye as a fun family evening event. It was a perfect end to a full day of sightseeing. We were fortunate that the weather cooperated and we had a beautiful view of the evening sun setting over London. Some may feel it’s a bit pricey but it’s more than just a ferries wheel ride. And fear not if heights make you uncomfortable, the glass cabin, in which you ride, feels more like a glass elevator with the freedom to walk around. The attraction takes less than 2 hours including the wait in line. The ride is about 30 minuets. The view is spectacular so don’t miss the London Eye!!"
"Written September 9, 2018",Top of the wirld,Great experience as I expected.Booked the ticket on line with the fast track option so no waiting time.Super!!!!
"Written September 9, 2018",A must see to get a bird's eye view.,"We visited in mid August 2018, there was quite an intimidating line up but it was well organised and moved fast. Great view for pictures. Dress warm for the wait."
"Written September 9, 2018",Great views of the capital,"Go early to beat the queues or alternatively when you book your ticket try and get one that comes with the fast track queue. The ride takes about 15 minutes and will give you some great views of the capital. Great for a once in a life time visit, but that would be all."
"Written September 8, 2018",Excellent Definitely worth the money,We did this for the first time on Thursday wow it was amazing and what a view. You can’t come to London and not do this. Queue went down very quickly and the whole experience lasts about 30 mins. 5 star from me 👍
"Written August 10, 2018",Trip was short,Very short trip It doesn’t take 30 minutesMore than 20 people on board and a long queue to get inSome nice views
"Written August 10, 2018",I wasted £92.70,"Spent 2 days in London with my wife, our daughter and our grandson, who is 13 and had not been to London before.  We had quite a tight schedule but I booked several attractions on line head of time.  In the afternoon of day 2 I booked a timed admission for the London Eye at 3.30pm and a late admission (4.30pm) to Westminster Abbey, not far away.  The London Eye ticket advised to join the queue 30 minutes prior to the set time.  We duly arrived just before 3pm to find an enormous queue.  The queue attendant advised us that the current wait was close to an hour but that our tickets would remain valid for the rest of the day and that it tended to quieten down after 7 pm.  I had booked theatre tickets for 7.30pm so that wasn't an option.  We assessed the situation for ourselves and it was clear that the queue was moving quite slowly and I estimated that we would be in it for a lot longer than an hour.  I went into the booking hall to see if I could cancel my tickets but the queue there was also huge and tickets bought on-line are non-refundable.  In the end, we had a choice - to abandon the whole thing or, as the queue advisor made clear, we could upgrade for £10 each and fast-track (thereby pushing somebody else with a 'timed ticket' back further.  We abandoned the queue.  I lost £92.70 that I could ill-afford.  I feel that the on-line sale of tickets for the London Eye is a complete rip-off.  There is no guarantee that any quoted time will be met or even approached.  You cannot plan around it with any confidence.  It is expensive.  My advice:  DO NOT BOOK ON-LINE.  GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF what the situation is before you part with a penny, unless you have a lot of time on your hands to wait or a lot of money to lose.  My rating is NIL STARS worse than terrible - I didn't get what I paid for, but I feel it was mis-sold."
"Written August 10, 2018",Fantastic views over the river.,"Whilst I have difficulty with heights, I found the movement of the pod very relaxing, therefore it wasn’t as much of a problem as I’d imagined. The pod offers fantastic all round views of London, over the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace."
"Written August 7, 2018",Beautiful view,I'm not a big fan of heights and wasn't too sure about going on this but to be honest it was brilliant and the views you get to see are amazing.

"Written September 7, 2018",Boring,"Paid a high amount of money for a 45minute trip in a pod with not very enticing views considering how high the wheel takes you. Good to look at l, at night time, not worth spending that much money for a ferris wheel"
"Written September 7, 2018",Good the first time you do it...,"Having been on the eye 3 times, I can safely say only do it once! Maybe twice at a push if you do it once in the day and again at night.Try for a clear day which I know is difficult but on a cloudy day with limited visibility, you may not get your money's worth. The eye takes approx 30 minutes and is only truly interesting near the top. It can get quite crowded and so smaller people may struggle to get a great view. London is my favourite city though and I love seeing it from the sky and that really makes this worthwhile. I have done this in the day and again at night and both are pretty great to see. It is worth doing this sooner rather than in a few years when the view becomes restricted. Already skyscrapers have appeared blocking some of the view since I have been on this.It is also worth purchasing this as a multi ticket. It can be pretty expensive for what it is on it's own but bought with entry to Madame Tussauds, Aquarium, dungeons (etc) can be great value as all of those other 3 attractions are brilliant!"
"Written August 5, 2018",Nice but not unforgivable,cool but not forgettabletoo much trouble and huge queues to enter. The ride offers a very beautiful view but there are hundreds of giant wheels around the world more interesting.I only recommend it if it's sunny day
"Written August 4, 2018",Nice ,"Scared of heights, well I loved it. Although it does takes ages to go around. Roughly 45mins. It's one of them things you'd do just the once. Regardless I enjoyed it. "
"Written August 4, 2018",Buy the flexible pass,"If you plan to visit this summer, which has been historically hot, spare the wait in the long lines and spend the extra money to buy the pass that allows you to jump the line at any time."
"Written July 25, 2018","Expensive alone, buy a combo ticket","A really nice experience and great way to view the London City skyline.  It is best value to buy online, get a priority ticket, reserve your time, plus combine it with another site you want to see (we combined with Madame Tussaud’s).  There is a lot of construction going on and one might be concerned that the view towards, London Bridge will soon be totally obscured, but the views of Westminster will still and always be there.  It’s a bit if a more interesting way to see London from up above than simply going to the top of a building.  "
"Written July 25, 2018",Eye-spy With My London Eye ......,"My husband organised this visit to London for us on a gorgeously hot Saturday. We were most impressed with the organisational skills of the staff on the day. Yes, there were queues, but the timescales which were communicated were true to time. Good to know if, like us, you have other organised time activity slots.The view over London is spectacular, the rotation lasts approximately half an hour, lots of space to stand or sit and take in the sight-seeing views."
"Written July 24, 2018",Unforgettable experience,Amazing views of London Town.The capsule wasn't at all cramped so plenty of room for viewing the sights and photo taking.Can get very busy so get in early.
"Written July 24, 2018",Over rated not worth the money ,Wouldn’t rush back to this . It was mediocre at best and boring at worst. It would have been helpful for an audio guide to talk through London skyline . Que system was a joke . If you are limited in time / money give this attraction a miss .
"Written July 24, 2018",Very smooth experience,"We went right at dinnertime on a Monday, so perhaps that was a good time to go, but the line didn't look hours long at all. I paid for FastTrack, however, and it seemed well worth it as we were on a pod within 10 minutes easy. The view is fabulous (I just wish the glass had been a bit cleaner, though I suppose that's difficult in a place where it rains nearly every day). The ride is so smooth that sometimes I didn't even know we were moving unless I looked at the ground or the center."
"Written July 23, 2018",Must do,"It’s the London Eye!  Just one of those things you have to do.  We bought tickets a couple of days prior in the ticket office.  Our timed entrance began at 10:30 and we could get on any time until 7:30pm.  We got there at 11:30, and waited in line maybe 10-15 min, not bad.  It moved fast.  Time on was 27 minutes.  Great views, capsules are air conditioned.  Experience is exactly what you’d expect.  "
"Written July 20, 2018",The London Eye is cool. ,"Lines, shuffles to get the spot you want in the car, and the random 20 people you can be stuck with all prejudice this attraction. However the one thing that stands clear is the need to visit it and ride the Eye. It has great views, and you a look at history from the air!"
"Written July 16, 2018",Nice but too expensive ,"The view is awesome but the price you pay isn’t worth. We paid for the fast track ticket in advance and the normal line was fast, so for us it was a lost of money "
"Written July 15, 2018",Easy access and effecient,"Bought tickets online in the US before arriving in London.  Very easy website to navigate. On arrival, just showed our tickets right at the gate and we were on board in less than 5 minutes"
"Written July 15, 2018",Great view,"We went up on the London Eye. It would have been nicer if they wouldn’t have put so many people in each pod. The “photo glass panels” are only on one side of the pod so the photos you take from the other side through the “normal glass” aren’t as clear.It is nice to see the city from so far above it.Tip: buy your tickets ahead of time online and make sure you specify you want the “fast lane” ones so that when you get there you can be ushered through a quicker, shorter line and not have to wait through the normal (very long line.)"
"Written August 4, 2018",Best time,The Coca Cola is a really nice place to go and overlook the wonderful London city it goes slowly so you can make the most of it you have to go to this amazing landmark 
"Written August 4, 2018",Good but queue in the sun was tough,Excellent views of London but the long queue with no shade was challenging and boring for 6yr old - 40 mins. 
"Written August 3, 2018",100% go says the 9 year old,Yes it is really crowded but it’s worth the wait The place u get ur tickets is not at the London eye it’s in a different building You can get packages that have other things like the wax museum or the Tower of London and save money that way.
"Written August 1, 2018",Eye would recommend,"We pre-booked tickets for the London eye and would definitely recommend doing this as this is a popular attraction among many tourists as it is so eye-conic so lines are busy, our tickets allowed us immediately entry. Wasn’t waiting long in lines and when we stepped into this magnificent treat to the eye, we were amazed, attraction offers a seating area and also provides instructions on where to stand for photos, ride offers clear views across the capital, able to see majority of London’s landmarks, however if you have a phobia of heights would not recommend as it may be frightening, eye thought it was amazing, attraction goes at a slow speed enabling you to take in all the glory, attraction lasted roughly 45 minutes. Therefore eye would definitely recommend and eye will be visiting again very soon."
"Written July 30, 2018",Chocolate Tasting Experience,"We paid a little extra for the Hotel Chocolat Chocolate tasting experience, with this you get a Hotel Chocolat Rep telling you all about the different chocolates as she hands each one out, you also get two glasses of prosecco one for each rotation on the London Eye!!!  There was non alcoholic options also available for children and non drinkers!!I have been on the Eye twice before this experience and i would have to say this was by far the best way to do it.  We were collected from the VIP Coca Cola lounge and fast tracked onto the eye.  We shared the experience with 20 people in total and the whole thing lasted an hour.  I would like to say i could have stayed longer but even i was starting to feel a little sick of all the chocolate by the last bite!!!! (there was plenty of chocolate!!)  another nice touch is that you each get a nice sized box of chocolates to take home too.All in all fantastic experience the staff handing out chocolate and drinks were lovely and they gave you plenty of opportunity to look around at the views in between eating and drinking."

"Written July 29, 2018",We didn’t even make it to the wheel - the booking/time slot system is a joke,"We booked standard tickets in advance for a spesific time slot. However we were sent in the back of the enormous queue together with all other ticketholders. The queue didn’t even have a proper path, just a bunch of people making their own line. After some time we reached our allocated slot, and we asked a member of staff how long more waitingtime was expected before we reached the wheel. The answer was 1 hour. We didn’t have time for that so we left and thought we’d just change the time slot on their booking page to another day/time. And that’s where we got surprised, when we first entered our initial slot, it said it could be changed a number of times for free, but not now.... our booking was not there anymore because the time slot has passed. Altogether we must say that the time slot and booking system is a joke. The ride might be good but they have to do something with the process before you enter the wheel. "
"Written July 28, 2018",Long que’s avoid if time is an issue,My husband and I booked online for a 4pm ride in the London eye. We arrived at 3.45 and was over an hour later by the time we stood in the que. Great view’s although I wouldn’t say it is half an hour more like 15 mins.

"Written July 14, 2018",Excellent,"We had to tickets for 6pm and joined the queue at 5.30 under the instructions from a London eye rep. The queue was huge, snaking beyond the ticket office entrance.The queue moved fast and we were on our pod at 6pm, the allotted time. The views were gorgeous and the expert was excellent. The pods hold about 20, we were on the queue with school kids but were put in a pod with tourists which was better. The pod is beautifully air conditioned, it doesn't stop to let you on but moves so slowly it's life hopping onto an escalator.The green screen photos were good, definitely have a look at themLast tip, book online and select a combo with another attraction."
"Written July 13, 2018",Amazing views,"We were pretty lucky in that the line wasn't too long, and the time we did spend in line was worth it, in my opinion. The views are amazing and if you or your guests are only in London for a short time, this is probably one of the best ways to see the city because you can clearly see nearly all of the major landmarks in one go from above. Don't forget your camera!"
"Written July 12, 2018",Jump the line,"We purchased the fast track ""Jump the line"" tickets, and thank heavens for that: We got in straight away, not much time to watch the 100´s of people standing in line.It is expensive for a family, but just something you have to do once in your life."
"Written July 12, 2018","Great visit, do buy the quick pass","A very wonderful ride with some brilliant views of London. The entire ride takes around twenty minutes so it felt like good value for money. We had great weather so we were able to take some awesome pictures. The only negative is that they have many fully automated vending machines but it was never advertised, and as far as I could see, nobody even knew of their existence. Everyone queued up at the manned teller's which took about half an hour. Very big waste of time and resources."
"Written July 11, 2018",London eye - book online but print in building,"A must do in London with kids. We booked our tour online because we had 11 people. When we got there it was very slow to try and open each ticket on my cell phone.   I eventually went in the building and printed out paper tickets with my confirmation code. so for anyone who has lots of tickets,  I would recommend just printing inside from the start since cellular reception is not the best."
"Written July 11, 2018",Good,Busy but manageable with the fast-line tickets. Takes 30mins. Great for pics. Provides a good idea of the layout of London and the key places of interest. 
"Written July 11, 2018",Book in Advance!,"A check off the box sight.  Not sure it's worth the price as there isn't a lot to see from the top.  Definitely do the advance tix and we did pay extra for a certain time to reduce the wait.  Actually, we booked for the first time of the day so the line was only 5 minutes.  Many people don't realize, there is a 5 minute 4-D experience right across from the London Eye that is included with your ticket.  Of course, they want you to buy the family photos, but it is fun.  Try to go early before the lines get long.  From here, you can walk across the street to Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, etc."
"Written July 10, 2018",Line moves quickly,We were warned that if we didn’t prepurchase tickets we may not get in. In our case this wasn’t true and we were able to get right in. We bought tickets at 5:45 on a Monday evening for 6:15.  We walked right to the end of the line and by 6:15 we loaded the Eye. In our case the fast pass would have not been worth it. The views were great. Too bad there isn’t an audio tour or map or something to walk you through some of the sites. Overall very efficient. 
"Written July 10, 2018",Champagne Experience is Worth it!,"I had an amazing time with the Champagne experience which was only like a 40 pound upgrade price.  You skip the line, wait upstairs in a VIP lounge and enjoy hand crafted cocktails (you purchase your own), your ticket is good for one glass of champagne while on the London eye and have a private host with you and a small group the entire time.  Once you are at the top, you have  a full panorama view of London and it is absolutely breathtaking.  Everyone was so nice and your host will even take pics of you if you are a solo traveler like myself :)The ride wasn't too short and not too long, it was just right.  Well worth the price!"

"Written September 5, 2018",EASY AND CONVENIENT  WAY TO GENTLY HOVER ABOVE THE SIGHTS OF LONDON,The slow turn of this giant wheel with its dangling glass gondolas is the perfect way to hover above the Thames  with delightful views of some of London's most famous sites. If you can time it for just after sunset with a dark blue sky and the building and street lights coming on its a magical flight.

The compartments are large and completely Murano glass, with benches to sit on as you go around. There are 4 stations in each compartment with info on each of the changing landmarks you can see from the compartment as it turns. Totally worth doing."
"Written August 28, 2018",Spectacular views of the city,"Visited with relatives from overseas. We booked online in advance and arrived about 15 minutes before we were due to go up.  After a short wait we were able to join the queue which moved quite fast despite it being a very busy Saturday in July.  The capsules are large and airy and they move slightly Way enough that there is plenty of opportunity to move around and see the views in different directions.  It would be nice if there were information boards in the capsules to tell you what you are seeing but there was nothing.  The views are spectacular and fortunately we know enough of London to point out most major landmarks.  After the trip on he Eye we went inside the visitor centre to see the 4D film.  I was a little disappointed that you had to stand for this as we'd been on our feet for quite a few hours by this point.  The film is quite good but not a major selling point in my opinion.  This is a must do attraction for visitors who don't come to London often - probably best dine near the start of a holiday to help you get your bearings.  Like all Merlin attractions, you have to exit via the gift shop and photos are pushed upon you at every opportunity but it is easy enough to say no."
"Written August 28, 2018",Nice westminister view and overall London,"We paid more to get an express tickets ; it was worth it to skip the long lines , even we were visiting in January.  Ice view from top"
"Written August 27, 2018",Super Rhona,"When you pay only £41 pp and end up with only the two of you in a cabin, you know you kinda won the lottery!We enrolled for the Champaign Experience and we were so lucky to have Rhona as our host! This smart and funny young woman explained us what we were looking at from the sky, combining facts with humour.The champaign (Pommery) was very good, the view was nice, the weather was okay.To be recommended!"
"Written August 27, 2018",Get the fast track,"We are glad to have purchased the fast track pass. The queues for the standard ticket holders were very long. We got in line and were immediately placed in a pod. The ride takes about 20 minutes. The views of the city were okay. Maybe the views are more enjoyable if viewed at night. It's worth doing for photo ops, but otherwise a little boring."
"Written August 27, 2018",Super visit,"Had a super trip to London eye. Great experience, organised queues, friendly staff and security spot on. Lovely views of london. Kids loved it and smiled all the way thru"
"Written June 24, 2018",Avenue Vert ,"The Eye is the start point of the Avenue Vert Cycle route to Paris. We took a trip and from the top on a clear day the view across London is spectacular. We could see the Trooping of the Colour as it headed down the Mall from Horse Guards, St Paul's, All of the now iconic tower blocks of Central London and Canary wharf. It's a great vantage point to orientate yourself to the layout of the capital and the distances of the popular sites."
"Written June 23, 2018",Great activity,The line up wasn’t bad so we didn’t buy a fast track ticket and only waited about 30 minutes to board. The ride is very comfortable in an air conditioned “capsule”. The views were great and we got some fantastic pictures. It’s well worth the price of admission. 
"Written June 23, 2018",Fun! Fun!,"We had done the London Eye on a previous visit, but our daughter and granddaughter really wanted to do it, so we did it again. It’s very enjoyable particularly if you can point out specific areas e or buildings. Wish there was an identification key/map in the capsule. "
"Written June 23, 2018",Okay,Another attraction near westminster abbey and big ben! This London Eye may give your London to-do-list A great shoot! 
"Written June 22, 2018",Great view - busy!,"Great view, but beware that London pass doesn’t have a fast track for this. Some crazy amount of marketing as you would expect, with multiple opportunities for you to buy a drink or snacks before you get on.Seems like you should get a free can of soda for the price of admission though ;).If I ever go another time, would definitely try way early or late; lots of other tourist attractions in the area keep a large crowd."
"Written June 19, 2018",Going on the Eye was so fun and a great view of London!,"Highly recommended, I would do it again!  Buy the Fast Track tickets and avoid a long wait in line. It was busy on a Saturday."
"Written June 19, 2018",Awesome views with high price tag,The wheel moves very slowly so it gives opportunity to have great views of the infrastructures around the river Thames. Be prepared to wait in the long queue and the price is quite expensive. 
"Written June 18, 2018",Great view of London,The wait was only about 15 minutes. The views were spectacular. The cabin was spacious and comfortable. Only had one day there. Glad we chose the London Eye over a bus tour.
"Written June 18, 2018",#EyeLoveLondon,Amazing site to see. A must go to tourist attraction. Enjoyed the 4d theater and the view from the ride. Great for picture taking. Captured nice photos. Although the Big Ben is under construction still had a good view of it and buckinghams palace
"Written June 18, 2018",A must when in London for pleasure.,"A definite must to view parliament, the big Ben, the river thames and other city views from very high up. It moves really slow. Ride is about 25 minutes. Great for photos. The pods are air conditioned and have a place to sit in the middle."

"Written July 9, 2018",Amazing View,"The view from the eye is amazing and worth the money and the wait. Absolutely breathtaking and the highlight of my trip.One could clearly see Buckingham Palace, St James park, Westminster Abbey, the Parliament, but it was disappointing that the Tower Bridge was not visible from i"
"Written July 8, 2018",It was overrated ,London is super expensive and everyone wants to do the London eye! It was OK nothing special you are packed in with 20 other individuals and the Big Ben is fully covered in construction work! It was ok but I would never do it again
"Written July 8, 2018",Nice,Nice view I recommend to buy the BiG LONDON TICKET GOOD DEAL FOR 5 attractions you can check it online 
"Written July 8, 2018",Ok....,"My kids were expecting to go to the London eye so much, once we got there I realized it was all about the marketing, the views are amazing and really worth the time but I think it is a little overrated, it is a little slow, it takes about 30 min from start to finish plus the long line before, I suggest to buy the skip the line tickets to save some time.

"Written July 7, 2018",Champagne Experience on the London Eye,Had a great time.  The Champagne Experience with the Eye Lounge was perfect. It was a crazy busy day at the Eye and being able to relax in the Lounge was great.  When it was time for our ride the guides came to get us and escorted us to the front of the line where we boarded the Eye capsule along with a container of champagne.  Definitely worth the extra money not to stand in long lines. And the guides (Rhona and Matthew) were personable and informative.  
"Written July 7, 2018",Birds eye view of London,This is definitely worth doing. You get some great views of the city. We pre-booked and so when it was our time we were able to walk straight in with very little waiting. The pods are air conditioned and that was important as it was quite hot the day we did it. The pod was clean and is quite spacious - they didn’t crowd too many people in which meant we all could move about quite easily and take photos from all directions.
"Written July 6, 2018",Don’t waste money on queue priority,I wondered about paying the extra to get priority boarding but based on other reviews and the significantly higher cost I did not do this. It turned out we only waited about 15 minutes to board as it was not too busy. But I did not see a priority line anywhere.It is worth the money as you get great views of London and it takes about 30 minutes for a complete circle.
"Written July 6, 2018",Excellent though busy.,"This was part of an ""experience"" day given to me last Christmas. London waa rather hot and very busy in general and so was the London Eye. I was using my mobility scooter and ALL the staff went out of their way to be helpful and very friendly. Wouldnt hesitate to recommend this visit, the veiws from the wheel were fabulous and the staffs attitude made me feel very special."
"Written July 5, 2018",Good views,Long line when we went.  Great views but not worth the price or wait in my opinion.  The lines were confusing and the crowds were crazy big on the day we went.  
"Written June 16, 2018",A Must,"Great views of the city. Very comfortable, hardly noticed the movement. Staff very friendly and efficient."
"Written June 16, 2018",Great experience totally recommend it ,This a must if you travel to London really nice experience and you can buy a couple of attractions in same ticket 
"Written June 16, 2018",Great Views,"Standard tourist attraction. While providing great views there are a lot of high rise buildings that you can visit also sometimes at a lower cost. The staff are pleasant and helpful but you will need to book and plan your visit as there is always a queue, "
"Written June 14, 2018",Full marks for special needs assistance,"I visited with my severely autistic and non-verbal 19 year old son. He is unpredictable in crowds and very suspicious of new situations. I warned the ticket office at the time of purchase and they were very attentive to accommodate his needs. As half anticipated, when we reached the pod, he had a panic attack and tried to run away, eventually being persuaded to sit down on the ramps where everyone was queuing. The staff were great, clearing some space around him, and eventually stopping the Eye from rotating so he could enter in calm and controlled conditions, ensuring he was happy before restarting the wheel. He loved it and was absolutely buzzing when the ride was over. It is fantastic when attractions go out of their way to ensure people like my son get the opportunity to enjoy experiences the rest of us take for granted and which they would otherwise be denied."
"Written June 12, 2018",Beautiful View along the Thames,The London Eye was a great experience. Some of the best views of London come from within these rotating tubes. 
"Written June 11, 2018",VIP Champagne package,"Definitely worth the price! We did not have to make the huge line, but were immediately shown to the VIP Lounge and had a glass of Champagne while we waited for our Tour Guide. We did not wait 10 minutes before Nathan showed up. What a pleasure this young man was! He had lots of trivia to share which made the ride much more interesting. The view was spectacular, and we had another glass of Champagne at the very top. We had a great time, beautiful view of London, definitely worth the price."
"Written June 6, 2018",EIFFEL TOWER VIEW OF LONDON CITY..,it is a good place to have an overview of the major attractions of London city in a giant wheel...especialy if you dont have a lot of time to explore the city. you need to be lucky to have a sunny day to enjoy it better
"Written June 3, 2018",Fabulous View,We went on a Saturday and it was school holidays here so very busy. We had vouchers so had to line up for them then lined up to get on the London Eye. But let me tell you it was well worth it. Fantastic view!!! Very well organized 👌🏻
"Written June 3, 2018","Nice views and all, but...",...since I paid for overpriced fast track tickets for me and my daughter I can't really give the Eye a higher grade. £77 for a thirty minute spin is too much.
"Written June 1, 2018",Brilliant,"The weather was beautiful, the sights beyond the city were fab. It goes very smoothly in the pod you can't tell you are moving."
"Written May 31, 2018",Best way to see London,"Probably the most touristy thing we did but very well done and clean. Even on a hot day in London 75F/25C, it was cool in the capsules."
"Written May 30, 2018",Got to do the London eye when in London ,"Well, it’s just a customary thing to do when in London.Good with these setbacks: Queues were long without the priority tickets, book time slots in advance but wasn’t really sure if it made any difference as the queue was just as long. Get the combo pass and check out the priority pass to see if it does make any difference. "
"Written May 30, 2018",Great view on sunny day,The London eye gives you a great view of the city especially on a sunny day. The area is very congested and touristy. You do the eye once and that's it. Its like Niagara Falls - you go when family is in from put of town. Lines move very quickly. 
"Written May 28, 2018",It was not nearly as good as many reviews make it seem,Was just a really slow moving car full of kids... at least we had skip the line tickets and didn't have to wait in a long line for a pretty boring ride. 
"Written May 28, 2018",Great vuew,"Great trip on the London Eye, you can see all of London from the top. The staff were really friendly and very caring towards the less able passengers."
"Written May 25, 2018",Exquisite,"Thoroughly enjoyed every minute.  Love that it doesn't stop and is always moving.  So much fun, and the views are incredible!  Well worth it!"
"Written May 25, 2018",Just ok,"I was honestly expecting more/better views from this attraction. We purchased the fast track tickets which saved us from waiting in the long standard ticket line. We waited maybe 10 minutes before getting onto the eye. Overall, I was expecting more and left feeling a little disappointed "
"Written May 23, 2018",a GREAT way to see London!,"We visited the Eye on our first evening in London.  We made reservations months in advance (highly recommended) for the 6 pm ""champagne VIP event"" where we spend the leisurely half hour that it takes to make the full circuit as we sipped champagne  with about 12 other people as our guide pointed out the sights and helped us take pictures of ourselves in just the right places.  It certainly got our visit to London off on the right footing!"
"Written May 23, 2018",London eye,This was our second visit to the eye and was even better than the first. The staff were excellent and as my wife is disabled and uses a small electric scooter she needs a ramp to enter the ride and the two guys were speedy cheerful and very helpful. The book that comes with your pictures of the ride has improved massively.
"Written May 20, 2018",Fear of heights,This was a first for meMy fear of heights was not a problem as long as I didn't look down lolI felt safe and very little movement until we were going over the top The views are great on a clear dayGreat feature a d can't believe I waited do long 
"Written July 4, 2018",Birds eye view of London city,Amazing view and great scenic birds eye view of the beautiful city of London. Very easy to commute and lots of discounts Available online through various websites. Lots of pubs around for food after. You could walk around locally as well since London eye is located in the heart of London city.
"Written July 4, 2018",Amazing view!,I think this is best part of my London experience every time.  Buy your tickets on line and pay for fast tract.  It is worth it!
"Written July 3, 2018",It is worth it!,"It's not only the view of the city,  it's the feeling that you get seeing the other shuttles,  the good mood of the staff and of course the amazing photos you get to shoot."
"Written July 2, 2018",London Eye,Nice ride to the top. It was very slow and easy to seethe city from above. It is near Big Ben (although it was under construction/restoration June 2018). I would suggest getting the jump the line if you are looking to do it quickly. It saved a lot of time.
"Written June 30, 2018",Champagne tour twice,"We have taken the champagne tour twice. You skip the queues, and have a much quieter capsule. The views are stunning."
"Written June 30, 2018",Lovely. Worth it.,"A bit terrified at the thought of doing it when I saw how huge it was but needn’t have worried, it’s amazing- goes so slow you can’t feel it moving, very relaxing, superb views. photo is taken if you stand at  a certain point on way down - there was about 10 other people in the capsule with us and some of them were in the photo too so didn’t bother buying it. We pre booked- only way to do it. It was a Wednesday morning June 6th - wasn’t that busy when we arrived at 9.20 and got straight into the top of the fast pass queue - worth booking - normal queue was much longer. Starts at 10am - By then there was a big queue - it took about 30 mins or more to go around - by the time we came out queues were v big. There is no map or pictures telling you where and what everything in your view is - this would have made it a better experience, knowing what buildings and views we could see. Price is  expensive too but for us it was worth it. I only gave it 4 / 5  for lack of maps somewhere. "
"Written June 27, 2018",FANTASTIC!,Fastpass is well worth it. We saved about an hour.  Walked right up to the front and only waited a couple of minutes.  Selfie sticks everywhere.   The best shots of big Ben are on the way down. We really enjoyed this attraction.  
"Written June 26, 2018",Beautiful Eye London on the Night ,"it's worth it. a wonderful panorama with London. I recommend, even if the price is a little expensive :)"
"Written June 26, 2018",Worth it to get a birds eye view of London,"This place has changed quite a bit compared to the last time we were there about 8-10 years ago but it still is one of the major attractions in the area. Sure, the crowds have increased compared to the last time but this is the best way to get an aerial view of the surroundings in London. It is convenient enough for older and younger folks to get on and get off the capsule and there is always help available if needed. The 4D theater was a great intro to this attraction. It is right next to the ticket counter and is included in the price. So, try not to miss that as it is totally worth your time.Few things that could be improved :Stop charging extra to skip the lines.Would recommend anyone with older people or younger kids to get on a faster line as it was difficult to manage the kids in a long line.Also, the photos that were taken both at the 4D theater inside and at the attraction themselves looked like a joke. Not sure how many of those photos they sell but they definitely need to do a better job if they expect people to pay for their memories. Our photos looked like someone cropped them and attached them to a background. Would never buy those that way."
"Written June 25, 2018",London eye,"This was great experience to view london from sky , to see parlament and all around buildings was great remember."
"Written April 19, 2018",Decided to give it a miss this year,"We bring grandchildren to London every year and this has been a fixture of our visits, but we decided to give it a miss this year - in our opinion grossly over-priced, plus the inconvenience of long lines. Not to say that thye view from the top is not impressive."
"Written April 18, 2018",Best View over London,I absolutely love this place...I think I came here over 10 times already lol. Highly recommended for tourists + locals :-)
"Written April 16, 2018",Brilliant,Loved this river cruise.the boat was comfortable with an upstairs deck. Brilliant commentary. We saw a lot of landmarks. Our 10 year old granddaughter loved it.we worth a trip. I would deff do it again next time we visit London.
"Written April 15, 2018",Scared of heights but loved it!,"As I am a merlin annual pass holder, I don’t have to pay to go on but if I didn’t have a merlin pass I don’t think I would pay the prices they charge as they are quite expensive for a half hour ride. However, the staff are friendly and happy to help. Because the London Eye moves while you are getting on, the staff stop the ride if you are in a wheelchair, disabled or have a buggy/pushchair and help you get on safely. If you want a picture done then I would recommend you get it done before the ride because there is one near the end of the ride and strangers often get in the picture near the end. I find it a bit cheeky that you have to walk through the gift shop to get out but it’s not that bad. Great view day or night."
"Written April 15, 2018",Great booking,Weather wasn’t great so we didn’t expect to queue as long as reviews we had read. We had pre booked Tesco clubcard tickets. We printed at home. Went straight to the queue and we were on the eye within 10 mins. Even though weather wasn’t great a fun time was had. 
"Written April 12, 2018",Big wheel,I must admit I was apprehensive about this ride as I have a fear of heights! It was a nice smooth ride .. I even managed to stand and look down (bonus) it was shame about the view as the day was cloudy ..would do again on a sunnier day.
"Written April 11, 2018",Less Crowded than last time.,"My eldest daughter requested a trip on the eye when we visited London and we agreed. We utilised the days out in London 2 for 1 offer with the rail tickets. Otherwise it is very expensive to do.It was as I remember. They could improve the interactive experience within the pod, or reduce the price. I also downloaded the app before we went but it was rubbish, don’t bother.The views were ok, both children enjoyed it and for the first time we did not have to queue for very long to get on.  It will remain a must do for tourists but is not my favourite "
"Written April 10, 2018",A great view!,"My daughter’s dream came true! We’ve visited the London Eye! The view and emotions were great, though the view of Paris from the Eiffel Tower we liked more. Londoners - no hard feelings!😄"
"Written April 9, 2018",Good fun,"This is a very fun attraction, it allows you to get a great view of London which is great for snapping photos. This also appeared to be fun for all the young children on board judging by the way they were acting. "
"Written April 7, 2018",Worth it!,Worth every penny! Spend extra 10 quid and get a fast track tickets! Totally worth it! The view is absolutely amazing!
"Written May 18, 2018",Best value in London,We took the Thames cruise as part of our London hop-on-hop-off tour. (also a great value) The cruise lasted an hour with a great comentary from a young very well informed crew member. A great way to see London from a fifferent perpective. We did not ride on the London eye. Long line ups and $65 CAD for one hour seemed expensive.
"Written May 14, 2018",Book,"Fantastic experience  - make sure you book online, ques horrendous at times. The view over London and the Thames is magnificent and really worth getting over any fear of heights."
"Written May 13, 2018",Spectacular Views,Even though there was light rain shower activity the views were spectacular.  The amount of time on the Eye is just right. Very worthwhile. 
"Written May 12, 2018",Eyes in the Sky,"This is a wonderful attraction with the possibility of a fantastic view especially for those who are shutterbugs The location is quiet extraordinary. When touring London, I would strongly recommend purchasing and reserving  your admission tickets in advance especially during tourist season. We were there just prior and it was perfect, lines were fairly short. The weather here can be an issue if the fog is heavy and or rain, something also to consider. "
"Written May 8, 2018",Pricey,"The shard is better It has No queue’s! Not because it’s not popular. Nice staff though, all were very friendly, but that’s not what I was paying for "
"Written May 7, 2018",Expensive but worth it,"A great experience. Scary, but  really good to see from heights one of the worlds famous city- London."
"Written May 6, 2018",Hot and slow,Hot little holding pens for the cattle as you slowly rotate around the circle. Nice views through steamy plexiglass. Not worth it. 
"Written May 4, 2018",Good to see,"London from this attraction is necessary to see. I recommend to buy online on CocaCola London Eye and buy fast-track and save ticket to phone. If you have bad weather, buy additionaly flexi time, you can come whenever you want and without any line!"
"Written May 2, 2018",Amazing views,No matter if you are an adult or a child the London Eye it’s an amazing experience which gives you one of the best aerial views of London. If you want a romantic experience you can go at night and order champagne while riding the wheel.

"Written April 6, 2018",Skip the Line Tickets a Must,"We highly recommend the skip the line tickets for the London Eye. We has purchased our tickets day before and was well worth it. The standard line was lengthy, but with the skip the line tickets, we pretty much walked straight onto the London Eye. Great views and experience for all. "
"Written April 6, 2018",Not so cool... Maybe just with a nice weather ,"Ok, is a good attraction very known in UK but isn't so cool, maybe if you have luck for a good weather and you like calm things to do and it's ok to wait for a long line this can be a good thing to do... Otherwise, can be really boring. So, depends what do u like.I don't know if I would have patience for another time in this attraction... "
"Written April 5, 2018",Pretty cool,Premium merlin passes so pretty much walked straight on using the fast track lane. No booking required. Wasn’t expecting that! The attraction lasts about half hour. Great views of the city.
"Written April 2, 2018",Fabulous,I was taken to the London Eye for a champagne ride and initially thought I wouldn’t like it. I thought it would be slow and boring but I was so wrong. Yes of course it was slow but it was great with fabulous views over London. We got into our pod and were presented with a glass of Champagne. The pod had a bench seat in the middle so if you wanted to sit you could but we mainly stood up and admired the view. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely do again.
"Written April 1, 2018",Great attraction,"This is a must see , to see London. Get there early or book in advance. Especially if you have a bigger family or group. The fast track is a good idea. Stunning view of a great destination."
"Written March 29, 2018",Good experience,"Myself and my boyfriend visited the London eye this month during a weekend away in the city. It was a first experience from my boyfriend and a second for myself. Would definitely recommend if you are visiting London, and have not been on before. The views are pretty cool and it is a really good experience. Definitely something you need to do if your visiting London. However it is not something you really do more than once."
"Written March 27, 2018",Worth the visit!,"Great views, pods are large and fit 15 or so people. Plenty of time on the ride, moves very slowly, tons of photo opportunities!  Bought tickets when we arrived, got a queue time (about 20 minutes after time we bought tickets) and boarded without much waiting. "
"Written March 26, 2018",Very long wait,The line was very long and it was a cold day so we didn't have munch fun. It's okay to do it once but I will not do it again.
"Written March 26, 2018",Night Raid,"Near the top of our list of things to do when coming to London from America was to ride The London Eye, which we did on Sunday, March 25.  We purchased Day & Night Tickets, thinking, ""WOW!! A chance to see the lights of London after dark.""  Well, imagine our disappointment when the ticket required our ""Night"" ride to be on the same day after 4:30 pm, but the ride closed at 6 pm when it was still daylight!!!  We saw no point in making another ascent in daylight and tried to find customer service at the site.  Guess what -- no such thing!!  I was told by one employee at the ticket office to go on-line for customer service.  There is no such option that I can find on the web site nor is there a phone number.  So, I guess we wind up eating the extra pounds we spent for the Day & Night ticket.  Word to the wise:  make sure it's dark for you night ride!!!!!  AND, don't hope to be able to get any ""customer service""."
"Written March 25, 2018",Birds Eye View!,This was included in our itinerary on a coach tour to London. A lovely experience on a nice cold day. Plenty of people queueing but we didn't have to wait long.  Breathtaking views.  Plenty of photography.
"Written April 30, 2018",Very nice ride,"Nice spacious capsules with enough view points to see the scenery from all angles We were there on a very very hot day, so it was lovely that the capsules were all air conditioned. The staff were very nice too All in all a good experience It takes about 35/40 mins for the wheel to go all the way round"
"Written April 29, 2018",Good,"This was good to see all the sites of London from. If we did not have fast pass however, I am unsure if we would have waited in the gigantic line. "
"Written April 29, 2018",Ok experience but not worth the money,It’s an expensive experience and long waiting times during summer time to get up. But the British weather doesn’t do justice to the views. Its not something I would recommend to people when they.come to visit us. Rather go up the shard.
"Written April 29, 2018",What a fun familiy experience,Great skyline and nice to see the views from a different perspective. Easy to get too safe for kids too.
"Written April 29, 2018",Goes up. Comes down. ,"Didn’t have to wait too long to get on or to get tickets. We went on a Sunday. It was busy. Don’t think it’s worth getting a fast track ticket. The capsule is good. Moves slowly. Good views of the city from different angles, which was cool. Not all the touch screens worked in the capsule, which is why I’ve marked it down - otherwise, it did what it should. Wouldn’t say it’s a must do. We were here 4 years ago and didn’t go on. For some reason I feel like a Coke. "
"Written April 29, 2018",Beautiful view but not as good as i360,"Having gone to the British Airways i360, I had high expectations for the London Eye but felt that the 'pods' obscured the view quite a bit and the weather caused the 'pod' to cloud up a bit making it a bit disappointing. Skip the greenscreen photos and opt for a few selfies while you are up there and remember to enjoy the view"
"Written April 29, 2018",Poor queuing system ruined it. ,I'd already booked tickets but was told i needed to go inside to recieve official tickets so we queued for 30 minutes to collect our tickets. We then went outside and joined another long queue for another 45 minutes.  At times we didn't move at all as the fast track had a constant stream of people. Then this woman kicked up a stink behind us and the staff allowed her through - what a joke.!! Finally 1.5hrs after arriving at the London Eye we got on it but in honestly the moment had passed and i don't think the experience was totally appreciated.  Not exactly a cheap experience. 
"Written April 26, 2018",A very disappointing experience,"My wife and I had pre booked tickets and confirmation for a time slot for our 'tour'. Our booking was for a 'Champagne' ticket which was supposed to include 'Priority Fast Track Boarding'.We understand that this was a busy venue and it was raining, but the quality of information and assistance from several members of the staff was very poor, with different and conflicting information being provided by several staff members.On arrival, (30 minutes before out pre-booked time) we showed the attendant our booking confirmation and were sent to the long general queue for people who were buying their tickets as they arrived. After waiting around 15 minutes in a very slow moving line, we thought this was the wrong line and jumped the ropes to a shorter line which we thought was more appropriate as we had pre-booked. Once we reached this counter and showed the girl (who was the only one who was pleasant and helpful), we were told to go to the VIP section to collect our tickets.Once we got to the counter here, a very surly and grumpy young man gave us our tickets and sent us outside without any explanation or direction.We approached the 'Priority Line' and showed our tickets and were told that we were to line up with the regular visitors. Once in this line we twice asked different attendants if we were in the correct line and we were assured that this was the case.After waiting around 25 minutes in the rain, we finally got on board, about 20 minutes after our pre-booked time) without our champagne, (which was no great loss as we were certainly in no mood to celebrate  by this time).All I can say is that if you pre-book tickets and a time slot, ask more questions to make sure you are getting what you paid for.The quality of staff training needs to be significantly improved with greater attention given to detail.The ride experience in itself however was OK, even in the rain, but our overall experience was extremely poor."
"Written April 24, 2018",What a Waste of Time and Money,"If you like sitting in a clear bubble for half an hour as it rotates slowly showing the exact same view, this attraction is for you.  Hated it.  We paid for fast track so that we could skip the lines at a cost of over $100.  Could have spent the money much more wisely. I should have donated the money to the Tate Modern."
"Written April 23, 2018",Many better ways to spend your time and money,"We booked ""Flexi Fast Track"" tickets because we visited on the day of the London Marathon.   We only had to queue for 10-15 minutes before being ushered aboard ahead of others in the much longer ""Standard Rate"" queue.  Although the views are interesting they are not that spectacular and the whole ride was nothing special. Wouldn't go again or recommend it to anyone.  Just watch some of the London Eye clips on YouTube and spend your time visiting Westminster Abbey and the London Aquarium."
"Written March 24, 2018",Wonderful view,"I went there one month ago and I loved that experience!I always thought that I wouldn’t like it because I didn’t like the idea of staying in a cab for an hour but believe me, it’s worth it!If you go to London, you must ride it!There are a lot of person but I waited for about 20-25 minutes and it already was my turn.The cab is big and you can also sit down.The view is fantastic!I loved it.I suggest you to take the ride at sunset or in the evening.The ride lasts for 40 minutes but the time flies.I loved so much that experience!"
"Written March 24, 2018",One of the top three must-gos in London,"The London Eye is not a ferris wheel. You stand in capsules and over 40 minutes, you see London from about 185 meters high at peak. It's astonishing as you are right across from Parliament and Defense. I took the ""champagne experience"" with a few tourists for a bit extra and a drink as we rode. It was a quick line, and Giovanna gave us a great verbal rundown on London. The pictures you can buy after the ride are first-rate. In the top three London UK places to go; the war room and the Parliament/Abbey are the others."
"Written March 24, 2018",It’s alright I suppose...,"Personally it’s much ado about nothing, yes there are some nice views, yes it’s an experience I suppose but now I’ve done it I don’t need/ want to do it again."
"Written March 21, 2018",Second visit to London Eye,"London Eye is something you should not miss during your visit to London. A huge wheel hanging on two slanted poles supported by iron ropes carry the several capsules that houses visitors to the attraction. We had purchased the tickets at Madame Tussaud’s as combo ticket and had the receipts with us when arrived at London Eye.  There was long queue and after reaching the middle of the queue we were told we need to get the tickets as the receipt was not sufficient.  We went back to the ticket counter and to the kiosk where after entering the receipt number dispensed the 7 tickets.  Back to the queue again and finally to the front of the queue to enter the capsule. The journey took over half hour during which we had a good view of the London including the Big Ben, the Parliament Building etc.  "
"Written March 19, 2018",Madan Perattur ,"Great must visit, the view is fantastic from the top , this is one of the greatest experience I had with my family . Don’t miss it 👍"
"Written March 16, 2018",Head for heights,"Went as a couple, I loved it but my wife certainly didn't! You do actually need a head for heights to enjoy this. The views are tremendous even on a rainy day. The fast track tickets were very worthwhile too. We went first thing, as it opened, also recommended. "
"Written March 15, 2018",The big wheel,"saw the wheel at Night – was covered in red lights near to the big ben monument. The wheel structure is huge, did not got a chance to be on it as it was late but it is recommended to book online to save some cost."
"Written March 13, 2018",20/20 Vision! The London Eye!,"The London Eye, that big Ferris wheel that spins so slowly you do not know it is moving is one of London's most fascinating attractions yet! The view from the top of the ""ride"" is awe inspiring and it is relatively easy to get to and on. Buy tickets before hand and get there early for a fast moving line onto the vehicle. The wheel turns slowly and gives you a Samuel Pepys view of the whole city. The ""pods"" are spacious and give one the opportunity for many photo opportunities. Even if there are children with you, they will be so enthralled that they actually behave! A great thing to do in this wonderful city. A MUST GO TO when in London!"
"Written March 9, 2018",Best view of London,"Okay so I don't know how it works during the high season but we had practically no queue and the capsule was quite empty. The view was beautiful and the ""drive"" is smooth even in high wind. I have seen what the queue can be like and I am not convinced this is an experience worth waiting an hour and a half... of course, the view is better when everything is nice and green. However, for a smooth experience with no lines to speak of, consider low season."
"Written March 7, 2018",Overrated,"I would say that the London Eye is a must, but no more than once. The view is definitely great, but overall it's overpriced, overcrowded and overrated. I would strongly advise ordering your tickets beforehand, unless you want to spend an hour waiting outside."
"Written December 29, 2017",Okay-ish experience,The ride was too slow and long for the kids. The view was indeed spectacular with the river flowing below and you could see almost all of london. However with kids (5&7) they got bored within 15 minutes of the ride. The box was warm and about 20 ppl were accommodated for one round in one box.
"Written December 29, 2017",Best views ever!!,I went there with my ten-year-old son. He loved it and said it was one of the highlights of our trip. The views were very beautiful and great for selfies and panoramas. The staff were helpful and kind. We felt very safe. We got fast passes so we got to skip the queue. Great time!
"Written December 28, 2017",Ahhh.... Champagne!!!,"Unless you're doing the VIP champagne experience this is just another tourist trap.  You wait a long time in a queue to go around twice on this architecturally impressive Monument, and then you're ushered to the area where they trying to sell you the old photo on the mug nonsense.However, the Night-Time champagne experience was worth it because you skip the queue, and once near the top you get a glass of Champagne and are there with a much smaller group, if any, and you get to enjoy a beautiful sunset view of London."
"Written December 27, 2017",Gorgeous ,I went with a 4 year old and 7 year old. Excellent experience for everyone. Hands down do not miss this. 
"Written December 27, 2017","Pay for Fast Pass...it's worth the visit, but not the lines",The views of London are spectacular - but it's not tix you want to buy ahead as the visibility can be poor. We bought fast pass which cut our wait time down to less than 10 minutes on a busy holiday.  
"Written December 18, 2017",Worth the visit,Amazing experience. The views were fantastic. Well organized entry. Only queued for 10mins. Easy to reach from Waterloo Underground. The 4D experience was amazing
"Written December 16, 2017",Lovely ,I am a Londoner so typically I never do the 'touristy' things as you always take them for granted being that they are always on your doorstep. However for my birthday my boyfriend surprised me with a champagne VIP package and it was lovely. The sun was setting so the view looked lovely and the champagne was lovely. Nothing else much to say but if you are visiting it's worth doing  to take some nice pictures and have the experience  
"Written December 13, 2017",Are you kidding me?,"Going to London during the winter is a risky thing due to the weather.  First couple of days the weather was cold and overcast but no rain so it was great.  Big bonus to going at this time of year is that the lines are much, much shorter.  The last two days the weather was bad.  Rain mixed with sleet and snow.  We went to the Eye on a Sunday and it was closed due to bad weather.  You would figure that being in London they would know how to deal with this.  We went back the next day, same kind of weather, and it was open.  Why closed one day but open the next?  We stood in line for an hour and a half, and this was a slow day!  Most of the time that we were in line we were not under cover, but outside dealing with the bad weather.  We had coats, scarves, gloves and umbrellas but still got very wet and very, very cold.  The cost of a ticket per adult is about $23.  They fit at least 12 adults into each car and there are I believe about 20 cars on the Eye.  That works out to be just over $5500 per full revolution.  I don't know how many times this thing does a full revolution, but I think 10 would be a safe number.  $55,000 a day, conservatively is what they make.  So, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!, that they cannot afford to put up a proper canopy with some heat lamps during the winter months.  There were people in wheel chairs, parents with kids in strollers, all having to stand out in that bad weather for hours.  I don't care how prepared you are, when it's that cold and wet, and you are outside for that long, you are miserable.All the money these guys are making, they should be making more of an effort to make their guests comfortable.  The ride and the view from the Eye are spectacular, that's the only reason why I gave this three stars instead of one."
"Written December 4, 2017",Great experience,It was great experience and didn’t have to queue for very long! Nice to go once and see all of London 
"Written December 1, 2017",Worth a visit with the kids,"I presume it must be London’s answer to the Eifel Tower, although I don’t think it is as high as the Parisian icon. I would recommend this visit for parents with kids over 5, but watch out for the hefty price you would have to pay for the tickets. Beautiful views of London from a vantage point though!"
"Written March 5, 2018",to the top of london,The best way to see London from above. The pods are very spacious although if you don't like being closed in this may not be good for you. It moves slowly so you have a lot of time to see the amazing views over London. Make sure that you pick a clear day. Be ready to wait for your turn as this could be up to 15minutes or longer. Not suitable for people who are not good on their feet.
"Written March 5, 2018","""Big wheel keeps on turning""","Admittedly we did do this in style, amidst the hundreds queuing we went straight up to the VIP lounge, having booked it some time ago. A nice glass up bubbly in the splender of the lounge, then collected and escorted to the pod complete with its own mini bar and another couple of glasses to boot. Views of London f of a unique position on a cold but fine sunny day and only a five minute walk from Gilray's Steak Bar and all that County Hall has to offer, great night out and spectacular when the wheel is lit up after dark"
"Written March 4, 2018","Nothing special, disorganization, rude staff",I supposed it was a special attraction but it wasn't. We also did almost 2 hours queue to buy tickets. Staff very rude and completely disorganized as they should be cause the place attracts a lot of people every single day.
"Written March 4, 2018",pretty every time,I've been to the London Eye 3 times and I enjoyed it equally each time. It never gets boring! The only downside is the long queuing but I guess that's part of the experience too  
"Written March 3, 2018",Amazing,"This trip was amazing and benefited from London on a cold crisp morning. The views were fantastic, the organisation to get you on and off was fine and plenty of space in your capsule as you completed the journey.Great views of Westminster/Whitehall and as far as Buckingham Palace. The whole trip was one of great enjoyment."
"Written March 1, 2018",360 degree view of London,London eye gives the option to get 360 degree view of city. It’s looks beautiful from the top and you can have a bird eye view of all important places of London. There is an entry fee for this attraction and you have the option to book the same in advance through online. We visited London eye during snow and view was breathtaking. 
"Written February 27, 2018",Champagne Experience ,"My friends and I did the champagne experience to spice up the trip a bit. It wasn’t over the top as expected. Our tour guide was friendly, Asian guy. But didn’t talk at all during the tour. I was expecting him to talk about the buildings and be knowledgeable ... wasn’t sure if he was tired or what. Also- we asked for some OJ that was on his cart with our champagne and he gave us a hard time about it. Overall anyone should do the London Eye because it is beautiful and you see the whole city. I would recommend doing it at sunset . It was breathe taking views. "
"Written February 26, 2018",Amazing view!!!,"I went to London eye with a combo with London Dugeon, Sea Life Aquarium and Madame Touseeau, which is cheaper than by one by one and it was amazing, "
"Written February 23, 2018",Fantastic Views,A comfortable and educational way to get an overview of London.  Don't forget your camera! Friendly and helpful guides.
"Written February 23, 2018",Awful customer service. Illogical system.,"We purchased tickets online. As backpackers staying in a hostel we did not have access to a printer so could not print the tickets. However, we downloaded the PDFs to our phones. Most other tourist attractions in Europe now accept PDF tickets displayed on smartphones but evidently the London Eye is behind the times! The employees at the ticket office cut us off mid-sentence and sent us on our way down the road to a Coca-Cola branded convenience store (coincidence?) to pay a further £3 per page to print out our tickets. Then we lined up again so that we could exchange our paper tickets for new tickets that the employee printed on site. Impractical process and rude staff - a real shame for such an iconic tourist attraction. "
"Written February 10, 2018",Amazing experience - birdseye view of London,"If you've got little time in London, do the London eye - it's a great view over London, with a flight-like experience, which is quite thrilling really.I had been many years ago but London's skyline has changed so much - I loved it, again.Downside: in peak season the queues are annoying - try to book early in the day and make sure you arrive with plenty of time to pick up tickets (if collecting). We queued for an hour."
"Written February 9, 2018",Slow but Cool,"It takes about 35 minutes to get around on a good night- sites are beautiful though, I personally don't like heights, but you do get used to it as you go around.I recommend doing it in the night time because the lights are stunning - worth doing and nice to take a break after a busy day :)"

I highly recommend walking around and seeing the views. Once we arrived at the London Eye, we purchased our tickets about an hour before sunset and made our place line. Sunset is usually a popular time so please get their early. There are a few places to eat around the mall area. It is definitely a ""must-do"" while in the city."

Easy, no line up to buy tickets, well worth it.  The wheel moves so slowly, even the most squeamish can take a ride on the London Eye. At first my 79 year old mom was worried, but then she was quickly at the window looking out!"
"Written January 26, 2018",London’s Main Attraction.. Oddly,"Me and my mother were recommended to book tickets before actually arriving in London as it can get quite full on the day so to avoid disappointment! you However, we booked this specific day as it was the only day available out of the days we were visiting which obviosuly suggested it was going to be busy but it was also the only day out of our visit that the heavens opened and absolutely chucked it down ALL DAY!We got soaked queuing because the queue was so long that half of it wasn’t under the shelter and that kind of ruined it as we were cold and wet in the capsule. We couldn’t see that far into the distance because it was all dark and cloudy!Although the weather is uncontrollable, it would be good to have open tickets and a bigger sheltered area! We would’ve chosen not to go but it was £48 for 2 of us which is a lot just to throw away! This price is ridiculous for what it is! Not at all worth it so I wouldn’t waste your money unless you get one of the packages with multiple attraction tickets but we’d already done the dungeons and madame tussaud’s on a previous trip! "

"Written October 4, 2017",Sold out London,This was my fourth time on the London Eye. Was horrified to discover it's now sponsored by Coke and along with it it's become more like a Disney attraction. The views are still as awesome as they were 15 years ago but all of the advertising on the lower windows of the pod means photos are impeded if you're trying to get a shot downwards. What a disappointment. If you're going to sell your soul to a brand at least make it an English one. 
"Written October 4, 2017",The London Eye,"This gigantic Ferris Wheel is the best way to get a ""Birds-Eye"" view of London. It even takes a picture of you if you stand on the red foot marks on the floor. You can purchase the picture once you get back on the ground and visit the gift shop."

"Written October 1, 2017",What a view,I visited with a group of Guides. Great views of London along the Thames. The Qs are a bit long but it is constantly moving so it doesn’t feel that you are waiting a long time. Definitely book a fast pass so you can jump the Qs
"Written October 1, 2017",Looking tired ,This was on my 8 year olds wish list so we used our Merlin passes to get on. We went at 2pm on a Saturday and joined the 50 min queue which did move quickly. I went on the eye when it first opened but feels like more people are squeezed in the each capsule and the only one Samsung info pad was working so we missed so much to look out for. It's one of those activities to be able to say you have done but do it on an offer and don't pay full price! 
"Written September 29, 2017",What a View!,"I decided to ride ""The London Eye"" after some hesitation. The line seemed awfully long but I gave it a shot. I was surprised at how quickly the line moved. In 15-20 minutes I was walking aboard. I found it interesting that the London Eye never stops rotating. It rotates slowly enough to let folks embark and disembark with time to spare. One is aboard for one rotation and I forget how long that takes, maybe 30-45 minutes. The view was fantastic and I'm very happy I took the time to ride ""The London Eye."""

The queue was huge but that said it soon went down and we didnt wait too long to board. The views are amazing even on a cloudy day. This is a MUST do when in London. The 'Pod's were not too full so plenty of room to move about and get a full 360 look over the London Skyline. They even have information points inside. Lasted about 30 mins and well worth the money
"Written January 5, 2018",Good view from the top,Very excited to go to London Eye. Unfortunately very long queue (over an hour to get on) and was a little dissapointing. You get an excellent view but you would have to know what you were looking at in the first place. Unless you knew London really well or there was a commentary you could listen to about the area then is is just a mass or unidentifiable buildings. I had hoped I would come down with a general understanding of where everything was but was none the wiser.

Why were we not told before and what is the difference in having out Pram up or or it taking up half the floor space folded down inside the capsule. This is not being managed properly and it requires sorting.

"Written January 7, 2018",Goof views,Got tickets on the day. The que for the bag check could have done with someone explaining what was going to happen to speed up the process. There was a small amount of que jumping. However the eye gives scenic views. The best time to go is late afternoon. The crowds have died down and you can get both light day pictures and early sunset photos. The price has increased dramatically since my last visit. I would be wary to return unless visiting with someone new to London.

The 30 minutes drive was ok, assuming with better weather conditions the view might definitely be better. However, whole family enjoyed the additionally booked river cruise much more and also the short 4D experience afterwards. "
"Written October 26, 2017",Pretty cool but too much waiting time,Too long! You have to queue twice: first time to get the tickets and then to wait for the wheel!We waited for at least 50 minutes which is really too long especially with a young kid.
"Written October 23, 2017",Great Experience,"One of the things that you have to do when you go to London, I think. When you get to the top on a nice clear day, you can see the most of London. Its reasonably priced & you don't queue for long. Highly recommend it."
"Written October 23, 2017",A must visit to see the london from a higher view,It was a great experience to see the london from the highest point and everyone should visit london eye 
"Written October 16, 2017",Worth a visit,"Huge queues , moved quickly and efficiently. Packed with tourists but worth a visit. The views are wonderful and you get plenty of time to take loads of pictures. Another must if you visit the Big Smoke."
"Written October 13, 2017",If you do not have absolutely  nothing else to do,"If you do not have absolutely nothing else to see and do in London, then ride the wheel. It will take you an hour to go around. You may try it at night. I am glad we did it, so we do not have to do it again. "
"Written October 12, 2017",Great experience,"We purchased the London Eye package together with the London Dungeons and the Wax Museum, saw them in two different days, best price if you purchase online!"
"Written October 11, 2017",Appaling service,Was given this experience as a gift from family for our visit to London. We turned up to find a massive line of people waiting but despite having our tickets already printed we were told we could not have the experience that day as there were too many people there and we were told to come back the following day. Trouble was we were going home the following morning so never got to use our tickets. On speaking to the staff who were very polite and then going to the ticket office we were told to either come back the following day or contact red latter days to get a refund.... makes me feel just what is the point of buying your tickets beforehand if your just joining a massive line of people then told you cant get on. very disappointing!!!!
"Written October 10, 2017",Been there....,"A nice once only kinda attraction to visit. The queue management was efficient. Once you're in one of those thingys that go up, you get a nice view of the London city.  The space are big enough so you don't feel claustrophobic. Best to go during the day if you want nice photos unless you've got a great camera. "
"Written October 5, 2017",Fantastic view and service,We got the Champagne deal which I highly recommend... you get to sit in the lounge with a complimentary glass of champers as you wait to be collected by your host/ hosts.. Our hosts were Jake and Jeanie and they were exceptional in their roles...We then got fast tracked to our pod where we got another glass of champagne... overall a great view and experience and well done Jake and Jeanie

"Written November 20, 2017",What a view!,"The London Eye was erected since my last visit to town, so I gave it a chance. It was a beautiful sunny clear day, and you could see for miles in every direction. You're in a car that holds 25 people or so, and the ride is one circuit which lasts about 25 minutes. Great angles for photos."
"Written November 18, 2017",A good visit,Had an enjoyable time taking photos along the way! Lots of photo opportunities with surrounding shops and attractions
"Written November 15, 2017",Interesting but overpriced,London Eye. Well it was alright but I would say overpriced and underwhelming. I would suggest some audio feed would make it more interesting but to each his own as I am  sure others would prefer the silence. I am not sure I would do again unless it was at daytime and I was with someone who really wanted to go on it. For a seasoned traveler to London I might think it would be underwhelming and would serve only to check off your bucket list. That said it depends on the age of rider(s) and might be cool for youngsters and those wishing to pick off seeing London landmarks from great heights.Side note- my picture once appeared in one of the booths/ capsules back in 2015 out of pure chance! So was cool to see that and to then actually go on the loop/tour years after the fact.
"Written November 7, 2017",Just a Tourist  Stop,"Vacillated about doing this because it felt so touristy but finally broke down and went, It was ...okay. The view is spectacular but easily done at other places. It was efficiently organized and there was no wait involved at all.Do it cause you are supposed to but don't get too excited"
"Written November 6, 2017",Great day out ,Best views in London depending on the weather! We got lucky and had a cloudless day fantastic! Combined with a trip to London aquarium afterwards.... south bank is a great place to take in the sights!
"Written November 3, 2017",Cheated by London Eye website.,"My mother sister and I decided to book online to get the tickets for the London Eye, but were in for a nasty shock.When I went to pick up our 3 tickets, I was given 9 tickets, to my horror. I told the ticket booth girl I needed assistance, as I only bought 3 tickets, so she brought the manager over, who stated that I could try to get a refund if I sent an email to customer service.I did, and received several unhelpful emails before I finally got a reply today, November 3rd, 2 days later, only to be told they cannot help me.Meaning, I have lost 156 Great Britain Pounds of no fault of mine, even though the customer service person emailing me apologized for ""my error of buying 6 extra tickets."" I am a tourist visiting London with my mother and sister, making us a party of 3, so why would I buy 6 extra tickets?  And are you really going to blame me instead of helping me? Are you really going to keep my money, 156 sterling, without shame?   "
"Written October 30, 2017",Spectacular views! ,Would definitely recommend a trip on the London Eye. Take your camera and go on a clear day - you can see for miles. Gently climbs to its full height. The pods are roomy with seating available. 
"Written October 30, 2017",London Trip,"Expensive really for 30 minutes queueing and 30 minutes in the capsule.  The views were spectacular, the tablets with information were Ok  but could have been a lot better."
"Written September 25, 2017","great views, shame about organisation","Decided to do the eye as we were in London for the weekend and weather was fab. Booked standard tickets online, arrived 20 mins before scheduled ticket time and then had to que for 40 mins to get on board. No issue with this, but felt it needed pointing out when booking. Yes could have paid an extra £10 per ticket for fast track when there, or online, but that is no more than que jumping in my opinion. The time on your ticket was irrelevant, the staff only checking they were valid. The ride itself was pleasant, air conditioned and great views"
"Written September 22, 2017",Great views ,Great views from the minute you get on to time you get off.TIP.use the fast track to avoid a long wait. Security is tight getting on but worth it in this case.Def recommend it to friends and family 
"Written September 22, 2017",Even better than our high expectations -- with the bonus of a Christmas card photo -- but buy tickets in advance,"My husband and I, and especially our nephew, were greatly looking forward to our ride on The Eye, and we enjoyed it even more than we expected. The pre-ride 4D film was very good (but too short).  The 30-minute ride itself was terrific.  It goes very slowly, so you hardly feel it is moving while you view spectacular panoramic scenes from well above the face of Big Ben.  The pod is very big and there are so few passengers (15-18) in each one so you have plenty of space to sit down or wander around to look at all the sights as the ride progresses.An earlier TA reviewer was critical of the photo process.  We found it very well organized, with plenty of time at each of the three photo areas to organize your group to ""look pretty.""  At the first stop one of the attendants even held my glasses for me (I'm too vain to wear glasses in pictures!).  The photos are expensive, as is always true in tourist spots like this.  The first print is 25 pounds but it comes with a souvenir book to hold your photos.  Then the second and additional ones are only 5 pounds each.  We happily purchased two, and one will be on our Christmas card this year.  On your receipt they provide a website address where you can access any photo(s) you purchased for your personal digital album and to share with others.Of course you can always take your own photos, not only of the scenery but also selfies (no sticks, please!).  But the official ones show you superimposed in the pod with Big Ben in the background, something that would be hard to achieve on your own.Important tip:  Be sure to buy your tickets online in advance -- and we highly recommend spending extra for the Fast Track to avoid long lines.  We chose the Flexi Fast Track for 40 pounds each so we could go any time on the day we chose. Book on The Eye's website (not Expedia, where people complained of hassles with their tickets).After your ride, you can enjoy a delightful walk along both sides of the Thames viewing all sorts of famous sights like Big Ben, the Parliament Buildings, 10 Downing and New Scotland Yard.  You also can take one of the guided cruises on the Thames; you buy tickets and catch the boat right near the base of The Eye."
"Written September 21, 2017",Touristy But Fun,"Although it is touristy, it provides excellent views of the city and photo ops.  No lines at all the day we went so it was very pleasant"
"Written September 20, 2017",Great if you get absolutely nothing else to so ,"I found the London Eye a little overrated given how long the queue is (even if you pre-buy your ticket) and how slow it goes around. The views were nice, but the glass wasn't very clean as there's sticky finger marks and lots of glare; so getting good videos and photos was challenging. There is a seat in the middle if you fancy sitting down which was nice, but if I recall, there was about 6 seats but 15 people per pod - basically, if you want a seat , FIGHT FOR IT! There's no denying the views are beautiful, especially if you're luckily enough to catch the sun setting over parliament. If you're from tourist, it's great! If you're from the capital and thinking of this for a date, hummm... you can do better! E.g  head over to London Cocktail Club (my fave spot) and then walk down the river when the city is lit up."
"Written September 18, 2017",Must see attraction ,"One of the most non forgotten experience. Best to ride in a sunny clear weather,Kids enjoyed it as much as we did. The view from the highest point is fascinating. Our trip was in September so no long queues in all attractions. Best to reserve your ticket online prior to visit."
"Written September 17, 2017",Nice experience. Highly recommended,"We booked the last hour of the cruise (4:45pm) on 16th September. The speaker Vicky told us the story behind all the spots during the trip (Houses of Parliament, Tower Bridge, etc). Then we went to London Eye (without crowds). I strongly recommend the experience. Perfect for couples and families."
"Written September 17, 2017",Beautiful birds eye view of London,Not for the faint heart. People with a fear of heights should avoid looking down once at the too or go to the edge of the carriage. The view at the top is breathtakingly beautiful. 
"Written September 14, 2017",There is no better way of seeing London...,I have been on the London Eye 5 times now and still love it more every time. Even when i drive past it or see it on TV i get a funny feeling inside! Its just perfect. I can't imagine London without the EYE!!!
"Written September 13, 2017",Lovely views,This is a great attraction that has great views of London. Best to book in advance as can be quite busy.
"Written September 12, 2017",Exaggerated,"I must say, this was one of the things tourists do while they Visit London. To me, the London eye experience was not as much as I expected it to be. It felt like there were a lot of people in each bubble and that there's no etiquette about how to be, act, and do things from taking pictures to loudness. I don't think I would ever be on that thing or even advise anyone to be on it. I don't see what the big deal is about going up and down."
"Written September 10, 2017",Not worth the price,A bit expensive. Like most of the sightseeings and things to so..Just Thirty minutes of Big wheel to take a few pictures. This is not a must see must do it. 
"Written September 10, 2017",A Big Ferris Wheel,"This is one of the attractions in London, essentially a big ferris wheel. It's at a pier and there are other activities that you can do there. We didn't actually ride since the line was long and it was hot the day we were there. There are a lot of photo places that you can take a picture to get that Instagram shot."
"Written September 10, 2017",Spectacular view of London,This was well worth it. We loved the 360 degree view of London.  We went late in the day  (5:30 pm) so there was no line.  This time of year it closes early (6pm) so make sure you sure allow enough time.
"Written September 9, 2017",Ho hum visit,"Nice view, but a bit of a boring ride. I would not say anything to recommend this ride. My wife and I were both very disappointed."
"Written September 8, 2017",Perfect way to start our London Trip,"My almost 7 year old son and I went to London this summer. We went on The London Eye on the afternoon of our arrival to get a feel for the city. I'm usually not a fan of heights, but the encloses pod made me feel totally secure. It wasn't too crowded, but still very busy. I thought it a little pricey for 30 minutes of entertainment (the reason for the 4 stars), but it was a great way to start our trip. We were able to point out some of the other places we were planning to visit. "
"Written September 7, 2017",Amazing view,"That's about it. there's nothing special, only a great view and it is a very long ride (because it is slow). Big line to go to the attraction! "
"Written September 7, 2017",Horrendous queues!!,Biggest mistake visiting during school holidays absolutely horrendous waiting time and queues was not enjoyable at all squashed in a capsule/pod with pretty much as many people that they could put it not enjoyable at all. Will go off peak if I visit again at a quiet time 
"Written September 5, 2017",A site to see literally!,"Since I had never visited London before everyone advised me that I have to do this.  The price is steep for a ferris wheel type ride, however the views you can see are remarkable.  I would suggest you pay the extra money to experience all the ""eye"" can see."
"Written September 5, 2017",Expensive but interesting,"So this is a great way to see the city of London but is quite expensive for the quick trip. Having said that if you are going to spend the money I would pay the extra 10£ and buy a ""fast track"" ticket to avoid the queue."
"Written September 3, 2017",Great views,"Pick your time. You don't want to be waiting forever to get on this. And hunt down some 2 for 1 offers, or at least discounted tickets. If you manage these two things then this is going to be a super sweet experience. It's an iconic landmark with a great view and a must do while visiting London."
"Written August 31, 2017",Super fun,Buy time specific tickets as it safes a lot of waiting time.  Very comfortable and great views of the Big Ben and surrounding area.
"Written August 30, 2017",Fantastic ,"Myself, my husband & 2 children recently went on the London Eye. We all thought it was brilliant. We paid with Tesco clubcard vouchers which was handy as I think it's highly priced otherwise. Views are amazing & would definitely recommend a visit."
"Written August 26, 2017","Interesting, a Bit Disappointing","We arrived 15 minutes after attraction opened and there was already a bit of a long line, so be prepared. The line moved fairly quickly, though. The ride takes you to the top in which you see the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Thames River, the Shard and other buildings in the center. However, having seen all these buildings already, I thought it was a bit disappointing. Nothing different from higher view, I thought."
"Written August 26, 2017",Great views of London!,Very happy we decided to do the London eye. The views are spectacular and present some wonderful photo opportunities. Be sure to purchase your tickets in advance and to pay extra for the expedited entrance. It will save you lots of time and aggravation. We did so online before departing the US. 
"Written August 25, 2017",Good view of river and big ben,Goes very slowly. I have height problem. Still did not feel dizzyy. Nice view. This time we got a day view. Next time will see night view.
"Written August 25, 2017",Excellent tour,London born and bred and found out loads of historical facts I wasn't aware of. Great way to see the sights along the Thames. Vicky (compare) was excellent and the captain and crew were good fun. Well worth it! 
"Written August 24, 2017",Something to tick off the list,"Went there with a 7 year old. It was exciting for the journey up. Took a lot of pictures, but the novelty wore off on the decent. I'm sure doing a sunset ride might afford a different scope, but it's done now, glad to have that ticked off the list of 'things to do in London'"
"Written August 24, 2017",No tickets,"We walked over to the London eye while on a trip in London to get tickets, despite the web stating it didn't close til 8:30pm at 3:30 the tickets had all sold out! We only found this out after queuing for tickets and being turns away at the ticket office there was no signs to say they had sold out "
"Written August 21, 2017",Excellent way to view London,"Highly recommend to book online ahead to avoid long wait in line. Otherwise, long line to wait. Package due with other 3 attractions are great value if you need something to kill time. You will enjoy the best view of London."
"Written June 24, 2017",Amazing view,See the whole of London from a beautiful high it's a beautiful experience and then walk down to Gabriel's wharf and sit by river Thames and enjoy a coffee or ice cream with cool breeze blowing on your face or rent out cycles for the full family and just cycle around the area
"Written June 21, 2017",Great service!,"Great service for a tourists and residents, organised and you can see all London from the top! Also give you all the informations about London building locations..  "
"Written June 21, 2017",Amazing views,"We booked a slot online using the national rail website using their 2for1 scheme, so we got 2 tickets for a total of £26 which is really great value for this experience! When we got there it was really busy and wasn't that obvious which queue you should get in as there were so many people but once we asked somebody we were directed to the right queue. We queued for about 25 minutes in total but if you were to just turn up without pre-booking I imagine the queue would be much longer. You can pay extra for the fast-track queue but we found 25 minutes really wasn't that long. The security is great and they check all bags and scan over everyone before they board. There are about 28 people in each pod so there is just the right amount of space. The views from the top were amazing and luckily we had a clear day so we could see across the whole of central London. The cycle takes about 30 minutes which is ample time to appreciate the views. Overall it was very good value and very well organised!"
"Written June 20, 2017",Worth the money... ,"We were there in a weekday in the beginning of June, so there was pretty much no line; we waited around five minutes.-Not very much people in the carts/capsules, so no problem moving around and getting a good look in each direction...I'd guess my rating would be lower, in case I had to stand in line for an hour and then be packed in with too much people, preventing me from moving... 😉"
"Written June 20, 2017",Ok ,Having done the boat ride along the Thames first there was perhaps too much for the eye to live up to. It's ok Views of buildings all across London. Luckily the horrendous queue only lasted about 15 minutes but the service in the shop afterwards was very slow. Only one counter assistant who wasn't in a rush. 
"Written June 19, 2017",Fantastic view,Fantastic view and a experience I would recommend. I would also encourage you to use the Skip-the-line option to avoid the long line which you could encounter.
"Written June 14, 2017",What an experience!,"The ""fast track"" is not so fast, so much so my father collapsed at the ramp because of the heat and standing for so long. However, the staff were really helpful and First Aid guys came promptly. Two days later we were allowed to enter again using the same tickets (which had already been scanned) and we could finally enjoy this wonderful attraction. Great views on a sunny day!"
"Written June 13, 2017",Beautiful View,"My daughter had been living in London for several months and this was on her list of things to do. We had advance tickets which I would strongly recommend. I liked that we could go anytime during a window of time rather than reserving a specific time. We chose to go on a beautiful, sunny day. Great views. We were able to add the boat tour at the last minute which was also great since it was an absolutely breathtaking day. "
"Written June 11, 2017",Worth the time,Amazing views and amazing engineering to get this thing up and running.   Maybe better on a clear dark night or around sunset.  But still very impressive during daytime. 
"Written June 11, 2017",Highlight for my 9 year old!,Big tourist attraction but worth it!  Terrific view of London and it continues to me my daughter's favorite event of our two week vacation to England and Italy.  She also spotted a super cool playground from the air so we hit that right after.  Tip - don't stand in the ridiculous ticket line. Buy the ticket online using your phone!

"Written August 16, 2017",Coca-Cola London Eye - GET wifi people this is 2017!,"Right the thing itself is really good... you'll enjoy it.  imagine a massive ferris wheel in the middle of London, its like that. HOWEVER, when you go online and buy your tickets it recommends ( several times )  you get the e-ticket to show the entrance staff your mobile phone when you get to the attraction as it will save you time - they lied... this is our story...My family joined the London eye queue outside, the guy said 'great' as I showed him my e-ticket, we joined the snaking line that to be fair only took about 30/40 mins to get to the front... not to bad I hear you say... Then when you're underneath the 'EYE' enclosed by glass and steel..that's when the fun starts - The attendant asks to see my tickets and as I go to show her my phone my heart sinks 'no service' its like being back in 1998, I hear Will Smith singing ""Getting Jiggy with it"" and catch a glimpse of a guy reading a newspaper the headline is Bill Clinton Denies having sexual relations in the Oval office...I'm horrified my son looks up at me a tear forms in the corner of his eye 'What-ever shall we do daddy' ? I hear him say  annnnyway... I suddenly remember I'm a genius to took a screen grab of the bar-code !! whoo- hoo my reputation as Super-Dad is going to be restored ( I don't have a reputation as Super-Dad its 2017 remember,  the kids have you-tube and in Russia someones Dad juggles chainsaws and in America there is that fella that dresses up as Batman 24/7.. I am to damn lazy for any of that nonsense. I show the attendant the photo she scans it all is good for about 3 seconds.... but NO,  OMG what could it be? - where are the other bar-codes !! what other bar-codes I say, I have to see the other bar-codes the attendant repeats Mmmhahaahah ( think Elliot Carver the 007 villain in Tomorrow never-dies the one with Pierce Brosnan, you know..   )  ... SOOoooo I'm there waving my arms in the air like a bored gorilla in an all too small glass enclosure trying desperately to get a phone signal...   My kids are now stood about like the cast of Big Brother on eviction night ( stay-with me its 1998 ) depressed and sullen as dozens of happy thrill seekers are hurried past us all,  I curse the poor phone signal... I mean its not like being underneath 443 feet of glass and steel might impair a 4G signal, it must be my phone - the attendant laughs in my face and points at me and my family ""HAHAHAHA she says you must go back to the ticket office HAHAHA..."" ( actually she didnt laugh but she was to good customer service what 'The Waterboy' is to the cinematic arts... ( BAD - the customer service was bad just to be clear ) So I ask to see a supervisor or manager all the time smiling and waving my arms like i'm Madonna 'Vogueing' my heart out desperately calling out to the future.. to the invention of a magic box that can send an invisible data signal to a mobile device, you know the one, you can get them in Tandys ( ermm on Amazon ) its called a wireless router or WIFI for the acronym obsessed Gen-X.The outcome of all my efforts... my grumbling, my being a nuisance, my arm waving was... I got a moments 4g signal and after what seemed like the wait for my 56k modem load up my MySpace profile but was probably just 5 mins we got in... Brilliant....However the Japanese family behind us didnt... after waiting in line patiently like the good and polite people they were they were sent back to the ticket office to start again... London-Eye - I say to you,  sort your WiFi out people ! But lets be friends and not fall out,  what's your handle maybe we can meet up in a MSN chatroom... or are you AOL ? I bet your AOL... nevermind..."
"Written August 16, 2017",Great Views,This now iconic attraction on the south bank is worthy of a visit on a fine day as you will get views of London that are difficult to find unless you can get in nearby high rise offices. Expensive though so see if you can get deal or voucher and book beforehand if you can.

The customer service team at London Eye were very inconsiderate and didn't send us a warning email notifying us that our tickets were about to be out of date and secondly, didn't offer us any kind of refund or extended tickets despite not being aware of an expiry date. Simply horrible customer service.Won't be visiting again."

"Written July 7, 2017",Great views - you should be ok with heights!,"Fun time, we purchased the Fast track from our tour company which had to be exchanged at the Ticket office in old county hall.  The tour takes 30 mins and gives you great views of the city.  We did our ride/tour in the late afternoon.   "
"Written July 6, 2017",Don't miss this ,"The line looked long but we were on after  buying tickets in about 40 minutes.  We had a member of our party who has some fear of heights and can be motion sick.  He had neither problem on the Eye. Watch yourself taking pictures. If you are too close to the glass, you are reflected into the photo.  They do have spots on the floor to help you with better photos. The 4# view helper was not a good buy.  For me, I could either try and line that up or actually experience the ride. They don't jam you in cattle style so you have plenty of chances to move around. This was my second time on the Eye and would do it again."
"Written July 1, 2017",Overpriced and Underwhelming,"My sons saw this and couldn't wait to go.  It was over a $100 for the four of us. We didn't purchase the fastpass because we didn't need to. The line was just about 20 minutes long. They placed a lot of people in one cabin. There are benches in the middle but you are mostly standing and meandering around others during the rotation.  It would have been nice if there was a recording in the cabin that highlighted the sights as you went around.  I think this may have been an extra you could purchase.  There was a dollar foldable map we purchased that identified different buildings. Super disappointing and not worth the value.  I'd skip it and get free reservations at the Sky Garden - They have amazing views of the river and skylines, too. "
"Written June 30, 2017",Good to check off the list ,"We felt the London Eye was a must-do & I still think that it is. We believe doing this attraction was good to do after we'd learned a bit of the city & knew the lay of the land - that way we could point to & pick out the what we knew as we rode. The ride itself lasts about 30 minutes. We purchased the fast pass for a Monday tour @ 1230pm. We'd been told doing this attraction during the day vs. as night would provide us with a better experience. I don't think we needed the fast pass, the line without it wasn't too long on that day @ that time, but the fast pass was nice to have - we didn't wait more than 5 minutes. The ride is not terribly exciting, but would probably be really fun for little ones. Overall, good experience. "
"Written June 30, 2017",Can see sights across London,"The London Eye is really nice for the whole journey, you can see beautiful sights across London from all sides and get great quality photos. I can't comment on queue times as I have a pass however with fastrack you can get on almost immediately so it may be worth buying if the queues are long."
"Written June 29, 2017",Great views!,"A fun way to see the city and the included 4d show afterwards was fun as well.  Call ahead to reserve a time, on really busy days they can sell out at certain times."

"Written June 26, 2017",Jump the queue tickets well worth it,Great experience beautiful views. The eye moves very slowly and is very stable. Jump the queue tickets are worth the money. 
"Written June 26, 2017",VIP Champagne tour,"We went on the VIP champagne tour.It was great, but we all found the tour a bit short. The 30 minute lap felt like 10 minutes :-)Maybe because there was one proposal on the top, and then we had to birthday passengers. I recommend this tour."
"Written July 24, 2017",Great views of London that you won't see anywhere else!,The London Eye was a great experience. They don't cramp too many people in to each carriage which is awesome because you can move around freely and see the views from each side. Beware: the only toilets nearby you have to pay for so go in a restaurant if you have lunch or before you leave! We also couldn't find anywhere to fill up our drink bottles and were there on a 30 degree day! Overall an awesome experience!
"Written July 22, 2017",One of the best views of London,"Revolves slowly so that you can take as much photographs or video shoots as you can. Takes around half hour, this is the most visited site in London. Pre book your ride since it is usually sold out especially on weekends."
"Written July 19, 2017",a view,"I was reluctant to visit the Eye, but I found a 2-for-1 deal with National Rail Service - one person purchases a ticket and another person gets in free if they have Rail Service travel cards for that day.Best advice, book in advance and research the 2-for-1 deal on the UK National Rail Service so that you miss the long lines and get a better price. A nighttime visit is better."
"Written July 19, 2017",Amazing,A great attraction. Worth paying for the fast track to avoid the huge queue. My confirmation email did not have any content but when I went to collect my tickets there were no problems and I was dealt with very quickly. 
"Written July 17, 2017",Fun on the Eye,"What a terrific vantage point to look down on so many of the tourist sites - parliament, the river Thames, Big Ben and more.  Well worth the visit.  Take the fast track option"
"Written July 16, 2017",Great view of the city,"It's pricey and tons of people go there, but seeing the city from that high up is pretty awesome. Recommended for first-time visitors to the city. "
"Written July 15, 2017",Guess You Have to Do Once,"If you are visiting London for the first time I guess this is one of those things you must do.  We purchased the fast pass online the day before.  Ticket downloaded to phone, worked great.  Expensive, but when traveling time is money.  I would not book this more than a day in advance as weather will be key to your enjoyment.  If you want to que, go early, but that applies to all the sites.  Best to check the weather and pick the best day for this."
"Written July 14, 2017",Nice view,"It is a nice view in London, but not a thing that you could not to do. If you have a short time, the length of the line is a problem, but was nice. Near the London eye was happening a African fair with some delicious things to eat."
"Written July 14, 2017",Great views of a great city.,"Organised and pretty easy to get aboard, we paid for the fast track service but we still had to queue for a little while. It was busy as usual but the pods were not crowded and you could move about easily and study London in every direction....a marvellous engineering addition to the London Skyline...put it on your to do list!"
"Written July 11, 2017",Panoramic View,It is a must do. The line are long but wroth waiting for. The cabins are big and spacious. The views from the top are simply amazing. A must do.
"Written May 27, 2017","just awefully long waiting, but worth it","We where here during summer, which obviousely is the time many tourists visit London, had to wait for a whole 2 hours or so, by the time we finally got to go on the ride we were out of energy. I have been on twice, in different years, so it is definately a must try in London, but beware of the waiting time and plan to take food or snack or something, you are not allowed or able at all to leave the line, since there are ropes around the line, so it's important to at least take some water during warm days.Good view, camera ia advices to take with you, and walk around and see the different angles and views.

"Written May 26, 2017",Historical. Movies. Fun in the sun!,"Lovely iconic must visit in London. This place will take you back to all the awesome movies you have watched all your life. Very suitable for all types of visits. Families, kids, couples, friends, even solos!"
"Written May 26, 2017",Not such a big deal,You will wait for hours to get up there and the view is unremarkable. It is over priced and underwhelming
"Written May 17, 2017",What a tourist night mare,"We went there on a Saturday around noon - the place was overcrowded with tourists running around without any sort of guidance. Went in to buy normal ticket, but the line was so long, that after some time we gave that up and looked for the Fast Lane office.Even that lane was long - and it moved even slower that the normal one - seemed to have only a few to sell the quite more expensive tickets.......So no - not a place for us."
"Written May 17, 2017",Queue isn't as bad as it seems,"Queues look unreal but it does go in fairly quickly, so I wouldn't let that dishearten you.  There's so much down there with the London aquarium, London dungeons and the Shrek adventures so you can easily spend hours here anyway. We bought the ticket that gave us access to the London eye, Madame Tussaud's and the Aquarium. What a fantastic buy."
"Written May 17, 2017",A memorable experience,"This is a definite must when visiting London, one of the best attractions, well organised, and a truly memorable experience. If you have the opportunity go and see the 3D show as well, its fantastic."
"Written May 16, 2017",Disappointed ,"If you really want to have a great view... go to the Shard for 30 pounds you can have two cocktails :) The London eyes is just a tourist attraction, an expensive one. "
"Written May 15, 2017",Over rated and over priced.,"The London eye is one of those "" Oh you must do it "" things in London that you look back on and wonder why you got so involved with the hype, yes you get some nice views, but it really made me feel as though I was at movie world or some other really commercial attraction, long lines, so if you must go for the ride probs a good idea to pre book."
"Written May 14, 2017",I finally got to go on the London Eye!,We went on the London Eye on Saturday the 13th of May. It took us a minuet to find the right queue but there were many workers there to ask for help just so many different queues! We thought it was great to see that there were accessibility for disabled users.We were told to go to point B and to us the queue looked rather large but thinking about it now it was probably not what it is like when it was really busy. We ended up queuing for 40 minuets which we all thought was impressive for a Saturday so we expected worse - we were very glad it was not raining! It was rather annoying that there were two queue jumpers but I cannot blame the staff for that as there was no one near enough to see it and you cannot help rudeness.The staff once we got to the eye were great and helpful. They were very efficient and helpful. It also made us feel more secure to see how seriously they took the security. We went up on a clear day meaning we could see pretty far. There was an interactive screen where you could look at what you were actually seeing. The views were great and personally I loved getting to see London in a new way. I'm not sure how long we were on the Eye but it felt about right. It was worth the queue and the money we spent in our opinion.
"Written May 14, 2017",Did not meet expectations ,"The whole experience of the event was underwhelming.I expected spectacular views but maybe it was the weather. Very touristy, seems they are more geared towards the tourists. "
"Written May 13, 2017",Champagne Experience ,Great way to see the city and kick off your trip in London. I highly recommend purchasing the champagne experience. You get two glasses of champs and skip the line! 
"Written May 13, 2017",Nice but crowded,"Nice attraction, good view of London especially if you are lucky to be there in a sunny day. Prices are high but if you purchase the tickets along with another attraction you can get a good discount.Instead of being a must do attraction in London, you must be prepared to stand some time in lines. So, if you dont have much time, i suggest you visiting a museum."
"Written May 10, 2017",You can do it once I guess. ,"Like all attractions like this, it's expensive for what it is. It's somewhat fun the first time. It's much more enjoyable viewing at as a work of art and unique fixture of the city. "
"Written August 10, 2017",Just What You Would Expect A Huge Ferris Wheel to Be :),The park leading up to the Eye entrance is nice and and full of street performers. The cars on the Eye are big enough for your whole group to get on and ride together. The trip to the top is slow enough that you can enjoy the sites and take lots of pictures. London is an amazingly historical place and you will get some remarkable shots.
"Written August 9, 2017","Nice, but not worth the time and money invested","The view was great, I can't deny that. But overall, it is not worth the time spent waiting in the Q and certainly not worth the money.Been there, done that. Period. Not going there again."
"Written August 9, 2017",Great View of London City ,"A lovely experience on the London Eye. I would recommend the fast pass as we queued for an hour but we were lucky it wasn't too warm so it was manageable. Great views of the City, staff were pleasant, would recommend this tourist attraction. "

"Written May 23, 2017",Over rated,"We had to wait in very very long line, people who are working there were not really friendly, became a bit expensive regarding to the needed time and cash.If you have much free time then try it.I loved the show with this 4D cinima as a way from them not to keep you waiting. "
"Written May 21, 2017",Champagne London eye experience,Had this experience booked for a 60th birthday present very poor organisation getting prepaid tickets booked for 1pm but queues so long missed slot and had to wait till 3pm for next available trip although we had allowed time to collect tickets ! Seems strange you can't print off tickets at home before you board. However staff at kiosk were  polite and helpful and young lady who was our host on the champagne trip made the whole experience an unforgettable one. 
"Written May 21, 2017",Crazy Busy,Nice on a clear day. Nothing really special other than seeing some of the notable close-by landmarks from above. Be ready to spend 20 - 30 minutes in a capsule with 15 or so strangers. 
"Written May 21, 2017",A must go,I've already been there twice and both times I've chose to go up just before sunset so we had this beautiful colours in the sky and the perfect pictures of the city going dark with all the lights from the buildings around river Thames going on. Incredible experience.
"Written May 19, 2017",Nice views,The best decision was to take the fast track tickets. The whole experience was nice and the view of London from the top is beautiful. I personally think the price is a bit higher than it actually deserves. 
"Written May 18, 2017",Nice view!,"If the weather is clear, i do recomend a visit. You will have a nice view of London. The capsule you travel is super safe and even the one´s that don´t like heights will be confortable siting in the middle of the capsule (which is totaly closed)."
"Written August 5, 2017",High-light,45 minute line to get in although they are reasonably organized. View from the top is excellent and was worth the money and time. 
"Written August 4, 2017",Beautiful Views,We did the London Eye at night which was definitely worth it. Seeing London lit up at night was breathtaking. A must do when you're in London.
"Written August 4, 2017",Great experience,"A bit expensive, but really great experience offering amazing views of London. I recommend purchasing the tickets online. This way the waiting times are quite acceptable."
"Written July 30, 2017",Typical Ride Around,"The ride was pleasant, the long line was not and my only reason for not giving five stars. Booked with discount by also doing Madam Tussauds (which we had planned on anyway)."
"Written July 30, 2017","Overrated, save your money","Not worth the view and the experience. You get bored after few mins as it goes really slow and there isn't anything outstanding to see. London is beautiful 'from the ground'. Honestly, save your money and got to Sky Garden instead for free if you really keen on London's views!"
"Written July 25, 2017",The Viator Champagne Tour,"We did the Viator Champagne tour of the London Eye. You got to skip the line, have a cocktail (out of pocket) in the Eye Lounger before boarding the capsule and having champagne with a view (included with ticket)."
"Written June 11, 2017",Skyline heaven,The 30 minute ride was just what you would expect which was perfect for me.   It is smooth and you actually forget you are moving.   Plenty of space at the windows for picture taking and ogling the sites.   Hint:  buy the skip the line tickets ahead of time.   Our line was a 15 minute wait while the other line was 90 minutes.   Definitely worth the extra money. 
"Written June 11, 2017","A great view of the city, from the top of The Eye.","Think of The Eye as a very slow moving Ferris wheel, but exceptionally much taller. Each compartment holds approximately 20 to 25 passengers at any given time.  The views are spectacular and there is an opportunity to get some great pictures of London. The only problem that we saw with this ride was that everybody else was trying to get great pictures at the same time. This is something you definitely want to do on your first trip to London or if you've been before and never had the opportunity to ride The Eye. Also, be sure to check the times that the ride is an operation, because it has different hours throughout the year."
"Written June 9, 2017",Nice view,"This is great fun to get on and get a panoramic view of London.  You can see Big Ben, parliament, all the important places and get pictures. There is even a place to sit as you slowly rotate on the wheel. "
"Written June 8, 2017",Great views of the city,"By buying our tickets a head of time, we were able to get on the Eye within 5 minutes.   A nice 30 minute ride, with great views of the city. "
"Written June 3, 2017","Expensive, but really worth the views","To avoid long ticket lines, buy time specific tickets online before you leave home. This is a bit on the expensive side, but really the views (especially on a clear day) are spectacular. Try this on one of your first days in a multi-day visit to London to get a good view of the city."
"Written June 2, 2017",Enjoyed trip. ,Great attraction i have not been on eye since 2000. Very busy.  Its not very clear on where to go which queue to join on pre bought tickets so it would be helpful to have it clear on tickets on which queue you join.Shop very expensive.  Very easy to get there from Waterloo which to me is the nearest tube.

"Written May 28, 2017",Nice but ticket experience awful,"The entire ticket purchase system is out of date and not from this century. If you have bought tickets beforehand, please remember to print out everything. The staff of this sight have not heard if digitalisation. Also, buying tickets beforehand does not mean you really have tickets. In our case the day was sold out many hours before the day was over and we were not allowed on the London eye. The only way to get it is to be there early morning"
"Written May 27, 2017",ok,"its ok though a little pricey, very sedate views of london.  depending on what you are looking to see "
"Written April 11, 2017",Classic view of London,"This is a gentle experience, allowing the visitor the opportunity to experience the (in my opinion) classic London view.  You can easily see House of Parliament, Big Ben, St Paul's Cathedral etc.  Only downside is it took us one hour to queue before getting on but I think this is to be expected at a major attraction."
"Written April 10, 2017",Best views of London!,"If you're looking for the ""touristy"" thing to do you have to do The London Eye!   Amazing views of the city.  And spend the extra $$ for fast track to beat any long lines!"
"Written April 10, 2017",Not very organised!,We had 10 booked for the champagne experience but due to huge queues couldn't get our tickets in time so missed out and wasn't allowed the champagne. Also the fast track wasn't very fast. But once on it the views were spectacular. Just a shame they couldn't be more accommodating- esp as we were on a hen Do!!!
"Written April 10, 2017",Great experience,"Fab experience a must when you visit London, expect to queue, but the queue's do move relatively quick, the pods do hold quite a few people, the views are fantastic, book online or with an attraction deal."
"Written April 7, 2017",The Icon of London,We have booked this from golden bus tours for 22.5 pound each. They gave a slip which we need to produce at the ticket counter to get the actual ticket. This took around 30 minutes.Along with the London eye ticket there was a complimentary 4D show. We waited for roughly 20 mins to board the wheel. Each pod accommodated roughly 10 people.We went after sunset . It has magnificent view of Thames and major London's attractions. Try to avoid on foggy weather. We did it at the last and it proved to be a right decision as we were able to pin point majority of the attractions from the top. Although its costly and crowded still a must to do in London.
"Written April 6, 2017",Amazing,The london eye is deffo a must see attraction when in london! You are able to look out onto the city and see different landmarks which was amazing! The eye goes round slowely so you are able to take it all in and it also offers the chance to take photos and also take a group photo when inside. There are long ques to get onto the eye but these go down very quickly and the staff have everything well organised. Verg pleased with how it all worked.
"Written April 5, 2017",Fun visit,"This was my second visit to the London eye and I loved it each time. I highly recommend visiting mid week and off peek times so that you can get a chance to ride. You get amazing views of the city Thames River, Parliament and Big Ben."
"Written April 2, 2017",Does what it's supposed to,"We have Merlin Passes and were in London so it seemed daft not to visit the eye.We only queued for about 15 minutes in what seemed like a busy period. It's all very slick getting people on and off, particularly the volume of people.On the Eye itself was as expected. Fantastic views and good information available about what you are looking at. Haven't given it 5 stars as if we'd paid then it would seem quite expensive for half an hour (although heaven knows what it cost to erect and to run)!! But it is what it is so 4 stars is more than fair I'd say and if I was in the area again with the Merlin Pass I'd go again."
"Written March 30, 2017",Fun for the first five minutes,I did enjoy it but it got boring pretty quick. The initial excitement and the view from the top were good. The 4D experience afterwards was charming.
"Written March 24, 2017",Fun first time or repeat customer!,"We arrived right @11 which is when they start selling tickets. The long line goes quick as there are multiple customer service agents to assist you. The ticket price is fairly hefty (25 pounds sterling per person), but the views from the top are unparalleled. Great for a first time tourist, or repeat traveler.  This was our second time at the Eye, and we enjoyed it just as much as the first time."
"Written May 9, 2017",Terrible Experience! Stay away...,"So I decided to take my son to the London Eye, so I bought tickets online. I really cannot do queues, so I chose Ultimate Fast Track tickets which came more expensive, but promised to ""skip the lines"". Only to discover, that in order to get the Ultimate Fast Track tickets I bought online, I would have to wait in the line for 45-60 minutes (my estimate, but pretty accurate based on what I saw and heard from other people) to pick them up. The same line as people who wanted to buy them. Total and complete fail by the London Eye! Do they know it is now the year 2017? Have they heard about electronic tickets? Do they know people check in online and receive boarding passed for transatlantic flights these days? Never ever again."
"Written May 7, 2017",Fun,"Crowded, touristy, but a lot of fun.  Great views. 3 D movie included for free with eye tickets so don't let any 3rd party vendor/website upsell you on this. "
"Written May 6, 2017",Completely underwhelmed,"What a waste of money.  I want a refund.We went on a beautiful sunny evening (5:15) so we had great views.However, it was very difficult to find where Togo because there were so many people.  Every staff member we spoke to have is a different answer (we pre-booked online).  It was very unorganized and I was really surprised that Coca Cola would attach their name to it.Once on board, it was so hot it was like a sauna - can't imagine it in August.  There is some technology on board so you can identify the buildings, but a lot of buildings I wanted to know about weren't labelled.  Also, the technology was slow and underwhelming.For some reason, a police officer was blocking the path on the Westminster bridge so we had to go all the way around the Marriott hotel which added about 6 blocks to our journey.  Give yourself an hour ahead of time to get there.Spend your money elsewhere - IMO this is a tourist trap."
"Written May 4, 2017",A must do,"Somewhat quick attraction, big lines, a bit on the expensive side, but definitely worthwhile view.A new classic for London, definitely recommend to do at least once."
"Written May 4, 2017",Well worth the visit,"Buy your ticket in advance online.  The queue was much shorter. They make you fold up your strollers before getting on, so keep that in mind...  "
"Written May 3, 2017",Champagne and Chocolate tour! ,Wow! What an experience on this engineering marvel!  We had 2 loops around and wonderful champagne and chocolate while we view on of the most amazing cities of history! A must do while in London! Bravo!
"Written May 2, 2017","Take your camera, pick a clear day!",This is really a fun way to spend an hour. Try to do on a clear day and be sure to bring your camera. The views are awesome. The capsules are comfortable.
"Written May 2, 2017",London on high,"Fantastic views over London, a commentary would have improved the experience though.As queues at ticket office were so long and we had pre-booked on line, didn't see the 4d experience or visit the booking hall until after we had been on the Eye - it was well worth the visit,Tip - don't join the end of the queue until half an hour before your booked time as even if you are only a couple of minutes early at the check point, you will be sent back to the back of the queue.Also, you need to be quite sure footed to get into the pod as it doesn't actually stop for you to get on, could be a bit worrying for anyone less steady on their feet.Would definitely recommend this as a visit though,"
"Written April 29, 2017","Good views, but time cost is too high","The view from high is good. However, even we bought the advance ticket in slotted time of specific 15 minutes in specific date, we still need to queue up and wait for more than 40 minutes. The time cost is very high for visitors with limited time in London.Actually, I think it is better to take a photo of London Eye from the ground (opposite side of Thames River), this can save money and time."
"Written April 29, 2017",Worst customer service and no trip,"If I could give this review zero stars I would - The worst customer service and experience to date.We purchased tickets in advance (March) for a particular date and had the voucher ready to exchange for fast track tickets. The voucher stated the date and that we needed to reedeem them by 6pm, no other terms or conditions were specifiedWe paid for 24 hour parking in Birmingham and purchased train tickets for this particular experience. We arrived at the venue just after 3pm (plenty of time, or so we thought) only to be told that there were no more tickets that day and to return tomorrow when they could book a ticket for around 2.30. WHAT???????????? We had purchased tickets for a specific date, we had travelled over 100 miles to be there and it appeared that our tickets had been resold.Could we get a refund? apparently not, we were told to just tell the online agent that we hadn't been able to take up the experience. We asked how could we prove we hadn't used the voucher, eventually we were handed a sheet of paper and told to ""scan it and e.mail it to the vendor""I asked how they could sell our tickets if we had purchased the voucher for a specific date online, surely it's like any booking facility, some tickets are made available to vendors (which we used) and others are sold on the day, quite simple I would have thought.Could anyone give a reason why the tickets were not there? No, only ""it's been busy""Were they sympathetic? No - all we got was ""come back tomorrow"" Wasted train journey, wasted tickets (purchased over a month ago), wasted car parking fees, and a spoiled day. Not even a decent apology - Dreadful!My recommendation to anyone thinking of going here - don't bother"
"Written April 14, 2017",A must! Get the fast lane!,Perfect! Nice vista of London in the nicest area of London. Sufficiently exciting for the kids and the adults too. Make sure to get the fast lane tickets. We bought ours as a twofer online when buying the tickets to Madame Tussaud's. It's really worth it to get fast lane tickets--especially when you're with kids. During Easter peak time we spent only three minutes from entering the queue to boarding a pod. Easily accessible from Waterloo station with a cool playground next to it and a nice riverside walk with the best view of Parliament and Big Ben.
"Written April 14, 2017",Boat tour great,"Very interesting way to see London. Good tour and information about all the bridges. Boat is massive so no fear of sea sickness! Pleasant in the evening when quiet, probably wouldn't be as enjoyable when packed with people.It's also a nice rest after walking all day!"
"Written April 14, 2017",Evening view of London,"Great view, really is spectacular.My advise would be to go in the evening. We didn't have to queue for longer than ten/fifteen minutes and to be honest the sunsetting over the city was amazing! "
"Written April 14, 2017",Great ride and views!,A must see if you visit London.  Highly recommend you buy a ticket prior to arriving.  It will save you a ton of time waiting in line.  The views are totally worth the wait.
"Written April 14, 2017",Tourist trap - not worth the money,Extremely expensive - not worth the money. Even with pre bought fast track tickets we were standing in queue two times. First when collecting the tickets. Secondly when entering the capsules. In addition to paying approximately 200£ for two adults and three children you are asked to pay extra for pictures taken before you enter the capsule. A tourist trap of massive dimensions.But nice view from the top. 
"Written April 13, 2017",Beware of the booking system,"I had read many of the London Eye reviews before I booked on the morning of the visit, but none of them really did justice to the length of the queues, or the complicated options you gave in trying to book when you're on a budget and wondering if you really can trust the optimists. Lesson 1 - get the TICKET and bit the ticket receipt on your phone or, on a piece of paper, before you visit. We spent 25 minutes in a queue to 'collect' or ticket from the ticket desk AFTER we'd paid for it at our hotel and had that receipt. Lesson 2. Buy the fast track upgrade and get your allocated time before you visit. You can pay even more for a flexi ticket, but lessons 1 & 2 will make the buildup as painless as possible. Unless you have 2 hours to spare, so anything else to save money. "
"Written April 12, 2017","Disappointed, it wasn't the treat expected ","Had looked forward for a long time to go on the ""Eye.""  I visited with my 2 children aged 10 and 12 as a treat in the Easter holidays, we went to London on the train for the day.I pre bought and ordered the tickets weeks before going to London using my Tesco vouchers and paying £10 each on top. I picked the time slot which would best suit our day.  However it seemed a waste of time on the day as we had to queue for over an hour to get on the Eye.  The only way to get in the shorter queue was to either have merlin passes or pay even more for ""fast track"" but I thought we'd paid enough!Once on the Eye,  the capsules are full of people, so unless you pick your view when you get on you could end up looking at the steel poles holding the wheel together for most of the ride. All together our trip took over an hour and three quarters, I think we could have spent our money more wisely and done something more interesting with our time,  the view wasn't great really either unfortunately. I would like to try the ""sky garden"" next time and apparently it's free! I don't know how much the Eye is usually for a full price ticket but I'm glad I didn't pay more than £30 for three of us. "
"Written April 12, 2017",Great view.,Enjoyed the experience of the London Eye during our stay. A must if you want to see the city from above.
"Written April 12, 2017",Fantastic,"Amazing experience!We purchased our tickets ahead of time using a coca cola attractions pass (£51 for Madam Tussauds, Aquarium and Eye... much cheaper than buying individually) We visited on Wednesday 5th of April at approx 5pm and only waited about 15 minutes.My daughter got very nervous and upset when the wheel started to move but she came around and really enjoyed the beautiful views on the journey around.I'd like to applaud the safety checks that were involved prior to getting on the wheel and the checks they done of the pods when everyone came off... very reassuring. I would totally reccomend the wheel to anyone visiting London."
"Written April 11, 2017",London Eye with kids,"The London Eye gives a great sense of the city. Get there early because the lines are long, even with ""fast pass"" type of tickets. My children loved pointing out all of the buildings and sites. Great stop for families!"
"Written January 1, 2017",Night time views,Myself my wife and our four kids had booked fast track tickets and it was worth it. We went straight in and the other queues were really long. We went on at 6pm and London lite up is beautiful. The views from the eye are amazing.
"Written December 30, 2016",Book the Champagne Ride,"For just a bit more you can book the champagne experience which includes waiting in a pretty lounge, fast track entry, and a nice glass of French Pommeroy Champagne to sip during the ride. Our only wish is that the ticketing would have been easier. We booked online, and then had to go very early to stand in the ticketing line to exchange the online confirmation for the actual ticket. Then, even with fast track we still had to wait in line at the ride for another 15-20 minutes. Extremely crowded! The ride itself was only about 20 minutes."
"Written December 30, 2016","The lines move well, and the views are spectacular","Many reviews complain of the ""multiple line problem,"" where you purchase a voucher online, then go get a proper ticket, and then get in another queue to get on the eye itself.  It is annoying, but they all move along quickly and regularly, as the eye doesn't actually stop except for wheelchair access.  It's a big traffic control system.  Getting our ticket and the other ticket and onto the pod took 1/2 hour, and it was busy.  Once on board, the views are great -- although you do have to watch out getting poked with a selfie-stick!"
"Written December 29, 2016",Amazing views!,"Visited on a december night around 6pm, wasn't too busy only had to queue for a rough 10 minutes, got our picture taken along the way too. Goes around in the circle for about half an hour, saw everything! Would definitely recommend going on this at nighttime because the view is really nice, could even see Winter Wonderland!Would 100% go again. "
"Written December 22, 2016",Brilliant,Fantastic views on a sunny day. Interactive tablets are great for informing kids of landmarks. We all loved the experience
"Written December 19, 2016",London Eye,"Was worth seeing, needed to queue but didn't take long to get on ride. Tickets not super cheap and apart from the tickets for the ride, additional photos are taken which you end up buying - ended up costing me £100 with ride for my son and I plus photos."
"Written December 16, 2016",Beautiful View of the City of London ,Must visit attraction at 25£ per person and   you get a good view of the City of London from the top. It takes approximately 30 mins for the ride to complete. 
"Written December 11, 2016",Beautiful views!,"Totally worth the visit. We went for the 2 for 1 deal via national rail. We went just before sunset for the best snaps and it was good timing as views along river thames were great. Queues were not bad and pod was not crowded so could take pictures easily. Tip : 1) It is just one round for 30 minutes so go around pod to see views every few minutes from all directions and do not just be at one location.2) If you want snaps, at one point when the wheel comes down they ask you to come to window for snaps. Make sure you all fit within window otherwise shadow will spoil it."
"Written December 10, 2016",Outstanding ,Great attraction. Incredible view. Queue not too bad. Defo buy tickets online as huge savings . 4d attraction very good as well. But the guide as it's a great keep sake and you know which buildings are which. Great way to see London x

"Written March 6, 2017",Too expensive. Not worth it,"If you don't want to pay for the express pass, you may need to wait in line for more than an hour. It's absolutely crazy, especially later on in the day. Your best bet is to buy the express pass. I though it was a bit too pricey for what you're getting. The view is good, but the pod is filled with other people and some may not abandon their sweet spots overlooking certain parts of London."
"Written March 5, 2017",Excellent Views Very Long Queue,"Its a once in a lifetime visit, to say you have been on it, The views are incredible for sure,  The whole thing is sadly disorganised,  the queue was so far back we joined it after 30 mins talking to others, you have to go to another building to buy tickets,  Where were the staff the notices etc,  so another Queue for tickets and its not cheap,  I thought Cocola did drinks ,  felt a little ripped off if i am honest, its not cheap!!!!!!!If in London you have to do it though.  Then back to the main outdoor queue, like 2 and half hours,   Not sure what this takes in a day  but somebody is making money, just felt it was not value for money"
"Written March 5, 2017",Worth every penny,This is now a recognisable land mark in London and is a must do attraction offering you some of the best views of the city however I would try and get there early as there is usually a long wait 
"Written March 5, 2017",HAS TO BE DONE!,"Being a tourist in London there is 1 thing that has to be experienced .. The EyeBought ticket & time slot prior but you still have to queue irrespective ... which is quite annoying when you see the queues even at 10.30 in morning when it opens at 10. So get there with plenty of time. I must admit the queue moved well. FAST TRACK is certainly a plus, but still be prepared to queue. Once on the views we're fantastic & you get a great view of london & all its glory."
"Written March 4, 2017",Boring ,A good view of london but lasts far to long and gets very dull being stuck up there . Not worth the money . 
"Written March 3, 2017",Amazing!!!,Last year was the first time I'd experienced the London Eye - it is utterly incredible and I would highly recommend it! I did Madame Tussaud's and the London Eye on the same day! The waiting time quite a while but it wa absolutely worth the wait! The views from up there are spectacular and the slowness of the London Eye means you can thoroughly enjoy the sights even more! I'm looking forward to going back soon - to overlook London during the night. 
"Written March 2, 2017",Amazing view,"The London Eye is spectacular even just by looking on it, but the trip in it is incredible. It is a beautiful view of the city of London and it is just amazing."
"Written March 2, 2017",A very long wait,Very disappointed that we had to queue for over 30 minutes to collect tickets and then a further 30 minutes to actually get onto the eye. Would have expected a better system in place to deal with the numbers and customers to be given the expectation that although booked for a certain time you wouldn't be on the eye at that time.
"Written March 2, 2017",CUSTOMER SERVICE AWFUL !!,"Don't book for this on line if you don't want to risk my experience.I booked tickets on line and they didn't arrive. It is virtually impossible to phone, so I emailed their so-called customer service. Unfortunately they take five days to reply and I was going in four days. Sure enough, the day after I had watched my friends enjoy the ride (during our supposed allotted time slot) I received an email saying they hoped everything had been sorted out to my satisfaction and that I had enjoyed the experience.Unbelievable.I have since written to tell them what happened (some weeks ago now) and have had no reply.I wouldn't book any of these London attractions online in future, if you do ...be warned!"
"Written March 2, 2017",Wedding proposal,Lovely wedding proposal venue!You take great pics too!Ride is 30 minutes enough so you don't get bored
"Written February 15, 2017",London eye and river cruise,Excellent venue. Even though visibility wasn't perfect due to weather the views were great. River cruise was very enjoyable. Worth a trip. The guide in the river cruise was excellent and very informative.
"Written February 15, 2017","Definitely would recommend, but expensive at full price","We purchased as part of a 2 attraction pass so only worked out to be £10 each. Good value for £10 each but expensive at full price. There are so many discounts for the Eye that nobody should be paying full price.We went on a busy day, but later in the afternoon so the crowds were low. Waited 20 minutes, but this is good for London.We did the 4D experience first, but wasnt to impressed with it. I think its just a way to try to justify the full price ticket prices. Would recommend just missing it.The Eye itself is great. Lasts 30 minutes and even in the poor weather we had was still good.I read some previous poor reviews and had to laugh at some comments.   'Takes ages to go around' - Well thats the idea, if you want a fast ride then go to a theme park.   'bad idea if you need the toilet' - If you cant last an hour without the toilet, then see the doctor.   'boring' - Its meant to be relaxing, away from the choas of London streets. If you cant stand still and enjoy a few minutes piece and quiet, then dont get on."
"Written February 15, 2017",Eye of the world,"Fantastic experience,  a must see and do when you are in London,  will be taking my granddaughter to London in July and will be going on the London Eye again with my granddaughter. "
"Written February 14, 2017",Amazing attraction,This is a must to see London! We booked out tickets online and paid for priority tickets. I recommend this as the queue for normal ticket looked very long that would take about an hour to hour and half to get through. The staff were very polite and the view were amazing. The day we went on was slightly foggy but still saw the beauty of London. The only down point was the purchase a photo was £20 for one which we felt was pretty steep. Apart from that amazing and we loved it. 
"Written February 13, 2017",Amazing,"We had trouble initially booking tickets to go on the eye, as when we tried to use the website on our phones you couldn't just buy a ticket to go on the eye it was only offering package deals i.e with a river cruise or a valentines champagne package.  When we eventually figured it out we decided to leave it till our last afternoon as you could pick a time slot, we chose 13:15 - 13:45 as we had a train to catch at 16:10.  When we arrived to pick our tickets up we were told to go outside and wait in the queue and it would take roughly an hour which as a bit strange considering we picked a time slot which turns out is only to pick up the tickets not enter the ride.  So just be a bit careful."
"Written February 13, 2017",Great views from the eye,Worth booking in advance as the queues for last minute tickets can stretch for what looks like miles!! Once on the pod the journey is really smooth and as it travels slowly so the view constantly changes. As it reaches the top the views are amazing across London and I would say do not miss the chance to go on the London Eye if you have never done it before.
"Written February 13, 2017",Must Do!,The queues can look quite daunting but they are very well organised and move quickly. The pods themselves are spacious and they don't load too many people into each one so you can move about and take in the 360 degree views of the City. There are tablets which you can use to find out about the Landmarks you can see. It is well worth the money (as long as it isn't foggy) and I'd recommend doing it during the day and of a night as London is just as beautiful then.
"Written February 12, 2017",Great area to visit for a family,We took our kids to the London Eye. Don't use Apple maps to get you there. It will send you to the hospital nearby. The views are beautiful and definitely get the pictures afterward. Well worth it!
"Written February 11, 2017",Wonderful night view,"No surprises here! A fairly expensive ticket gets you an excellent view. You likely know your families preferences and value/reward spectrum. If you really want to ""get your money's worth"" and are hyper sensitive to expense....this probably isn't the ride for you. If you spend money freely for experiences on vacation, then this is another solid option. I'll likely give ""The Shard"" a look next time. "

"Written March 1, 2017",Denied entry after an hour queing,"My Family visited the London eye on 25/02/17, after collecting several tokens from the Sun newspaper. We then proceeded to queue for over an hour.When we finally got to the front of the line, we were greeted by a rather miserable attendant who refused entry for my family and i due to the fact their booking system didn't have our booking code on the system. I then asked to speak with a manager, who was also not very helpful and stated there was absolutely nothing she could do to rectify the situation."
"Written February 27, 2017","VIP Champagne Experience ride very good but ""check-in"" a shambles.","We booked for the Champagne Experience. On getting there it was not at all clear where we had to go to check in. Lots of staff to ask but all said go there, go here, go everywhere but the right place. No signs except for normal and fast track. In the end we found a member of staff who told us where to go. Then there was a long queue and only two staff on the computers. All a shambles which could have been avoided by having  signs for the VIP type rides. For a special celebration it began as a great disappointment. However, once checked in it was very good. Our hostess, Ruby, was great. General queues horrendous so leave yourselves loads of time. For VIP go to the door overlooking the River Thames that has a faded scarlet awning. "
"Written February 24, 2017",Nice,Nothing special. There is a huge line. Price high. Good if you want to get oriented. Good only in sunny day.
"Written February 21, 2017",Family holiday ,Although i don't like heights and was frightened of going into a Pod that went that high I truthfully wasn't scared !! Was a great experience to see all of London !! Bought the photo too as a wee keep sake !! Although a huge queue was well worth the visit 😊
"Written February 20, 2017",So Expensive,"The London Eye is a lovely contribution to London's tourist destination's. I went on it once and never again. The cost of two adults and two children comes short of a £100,the actual cost today 2017 is £90 for a family of four. So ridiculously over priced I don't recommend it to nobody.. Go to a restaurant instead.. The price for adults should be £8 and children £4. The government should force the owners to lower their prices or shut up shop.. It's a rip off, just to go round in a circle.. The best of rip off London.."
"Written February 19, 2017",Definitely worth it,"The London Eye was our first attraction during our recent visit to London. The wait in the regular queue was about an hour, so we decided to buy the Fast track tickets (£34,95). In our opinion it was worth paying the extra £10, to avoid the queue. Please keep in mind that you also have to queue to buy your tickets (Fast track queue was hardly any wait, regular ticket queue about 20 min). We didn't book our tickets in advance because we were not sure about the weather conditions. Once on board you have enough space to move around and enjoy the stunning views. It gives a great impression of the city and all it's beautiful sites. The entire journey is about half an hour. We enjoyed it immensely!"
"Written February 17, 2017",Great experience ,"Pre-booked our tickets online well in advance and visited the London Eye on 14th Feb. We waited in line for about 20 mins. It was a great experience, lots to look at, the kids loved it."
"Written February 16, 2017",There are more important places to visit in London,"Londons eye view is always a perfect experience but you still have more and cheaper ways to enjoy it, ideally with a drink at one of the skyscrapers"
"Written February 5, 2017",Great view,Great view but the there was a crazy quew to get in. It is a nice experience to see London from the top but there are many other places that can give you the same view.
"Written February 4, 2017",Worth the wait!,Even though I am scared of heights I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The views are out of this world! We queued about 45 mins to get on with standard passes. Staff very efficient. 
"Written January 29, 2017",Enormous queue,"The London eye is brilliant,the only thing letting it down is the queuing system. I have previously visited on a weekday and walked straight on. This time I visited on a Saturday afternoon and was obviously expecting it to be much busier. I reserved tickets online and was told to expect around a 45 minute queue. The queue to collect the tickets was around 1 hour and then the queue to get on was another 2 hours. I even missed the train home. The queue is grim, outside on the pavement with overflowing bins. A better queuing system is badly needed. Its a shame as its an amazing attraction and the views at night are beautiful."
"Written January 19, 2017",Wow,"To be honest, I thought it would be boring with long queues and poor views. I was wrong. First thing in the morning is often quiet and our weight was less than 20 minutes. We could see all that there was to see. Usually souvenirs are poor quality and expensive. We were pleasantly surprised that they were far better than expected. Souvenir photographs are usually a rip off, so it was totally unexpected,that the price included a hard back book to hold the pictures.I thoroughly recommend the trip."
"Written January 19, 2017",See the city from a unique view,Well worth the time. Breathtaking views. Top attraction if you like a perspective from the air. Really enjoyed it.
"Written January 19, 2017",Beautiful views,Visited the London eye with friends on a hen do. The queues were long but went down very quickly. There were lots of beautiful views of London. I think it's one of those experiences that once you have done it once there would be no need to do it again but defiantly worth having one go on it.
"Written January 18, 2017",Enjoy from across the Thames,The experience was fine however not worth the money.  The area around the eye is very crowded and although we didn't wait in the queue I don't feel it was worth in.
"Written January 15, 2017",Great eye experience ,Just after the new year our family was given the ride the eye and river thames tours. As long as the line was the staff was well organized and efficient. It took 30 minutes to get on and we had a nice experience. The weather was partly sunny and we could see for miles. Both my girls were not scared at all. Thx it was fun and so was the 40 minutes on the river.

"Written January 12, 2017",Ticked Off the List: So That's That.,"Going up so high over a city like London you'd expect to be blown away. London is beautiful, but unless you know where you're looking, you're really not getting much. A major disappointment for me was not being able to see the Tower or Tower Bridge, I didn't realise they'd be blocked. Westminster and the Abbey were the highlight, with St. Paul's a lovely sight also.This would really be best for 'locals' as the sun went down. You get views in other cities, but these cities can have the backdrop of mountains and boast a promenade. London does not feature these. Perhaps you simply are too high on this? Or perhaps London is simply best enjoyed from the ground.I'm glad that I did it, but I won't be doing it again."
"Written March 22, 2017",Get there Early!,Officially opens at 11am. We were in the line at 10am and already 200-300 people ahead of us. The price is higher than the carousel goes.I was a leisurely 30 minutes rotation. We felt completely safe at all times. And the views are amazing from the different angles.
"Written March 22, 2017",Over priced,"I think the London eye is a bit expensive. I'm glad I have experienced it, but I wouldn't do it again. It's not very exciting and there isn't that much to see at the top apart from buildings! Very long queues so buy tickets online to save about 30 mins in the ticket queue"
"Written March 22, 2017",Long wait for an average view.,After a long one and a half hour wait in drizzly weather it was a rather dissapointing view with other passengers reluctant to move around the pod to allow others to view different directions. we had initially gone in the morning first thing as we had purchased an anytime ticket but 40 minutes after the advertised opening time we were still waiting tfor some action - no lines no staff giving any direction. Came back later in the day and a long wait in dismal weather. Had missed out on seeing some more worthwhile sights whilst waiting. 
"Written March 21, 2017",Disappointed by lack of care and attention. ,"Being disabled, my husband booked for us to have the champagne experience in the bar beforehand, so that I would be able to have a leisurely sit prior to being taken to priority boarding onto the eye itself. We arrived a little early so we could make the most of sitting and watching the boats on the Thames, but when we arrived we tried to find the bar but couldn't so enquired with the main ticket booths as the priority desk wasn't manned. They told us to wait until the priority desk opened but couldn't tell us when that woukd be. There was no seating available, so we finally flagged down another staff member and she very helpfully went to find out what was happening. During this time staff arrived to open the priority desk and when she returned she was inforned  that the bar was closed for refurbishment so the pre- champagne experience wasn't available any more. It was news to them as they hadn't been informed and it was news to us too as my husband had only booked it two weeks prior! She advised us to go for a walk and return later, easier said than done when you're struggling with mobility! Anyway, we had a slow walk around but returned as I was feeling unwell. As there was no seating I propped myself up against a wall, but eventually had to ask staff for a chair... I was bought a wheelchair! I've spent years trying to stay out of a wheelchair, but had no option at this point. After a while we were taken out to the eye (minus the wheelchair as there were steps down from the reception area). The priority boarding area for alighting was blocked off as they were working on it, so we were taken via the fast track method, which cut down the very long queue by about half, but still meant walking up two long ramps and queuing behind the others in fast track. (There appears to be three methods of obtaining access onto the eye: priority with it's own entrance, fast track where they open a gate halving the queue and normal, where you take your chances on the day.) When we got on, the pod was great and the view sensational.  The interactive maps are a great idea and we thoroughly enjoyed that part of the experience, albeit rather painful! By the end though I was too ill and tired to continue our weekend so we caught a taxi, took some more medication and headed home back to Yorkshire. Such a let down from somewhere you really would expect to be, a) better informed, and b) more disabled friendly. The motto: phone in advance to check there are no unscheduled hold ups and hope they have informed their staff accordingly. Poor show London Eye!!!"
"Written March 21, 2017",Worst visitor experience ever,"Booked this for my parents, the champagne experience to reduce queuing time and was glad about this - the 'fastrack' queue was almost as long as the regular queue. We hung around an unmarked area - no seats for anyone with any disability or reduced mobility - as we were told that we'd be collected soon. But what was worst was the person 'in charge' of our group left without making any announcement the group was leaving the building and as one of our party was using the bathroom at the time, we just saw the group exit the door and then we had to try find them in the crowds of people queuing outside. Communication between staff to try find the group was appauling - all we were told was 'you've missed your group's slot' and we were just fortunate that we spotted our guide. Worst tourist experience ever. "

They loved going up and seeing the views of London. They enjoyed going high and walking around the pod. This place does get very busy so expect to queue. Or it might be worth buying the fast track tickets. We had merlin passes and this let us to be fast tracked so we didn't have to queue for that long. This is one of the best attractions in London. "
"Written April 29, 2017",Ok.,On the must do list of things to do while in London. Was ok but I think the Sky Garden views were  better. 
"Written April 26, 2017",Mesmerising experience,"Thought it would not be interesting but I was totally wrong, buy a view guide to see all the buildings from a great view and height. If you can catch the sunset on the ride this is amazing. Only draw back is if you buy your tickets on the day expect long delays, in the school holidays you can take a couple of hours to get onto the eye. Buy before if you can. "
"Written April 25, 2017",Over-priced Rip-off,"I visited in mid April. Even so, the line-ups were staggering. I can't imagine what the crowds are like in summer. I bought my ticket online the night before £31.45 = $55.00 CD, so didn't have to wait two hours!! They insist that you first watch a 4D movie which I thought would be about the construction of it and various other facts. Instead it was basically a 5-min. advert for Coca-Cola, since they are not allowed to advertise along the Thames. Twice I was confronted by professionals who wanted to take my photo to sell to me later. I refused and they were horrified. The ride itself is a very slow-moving view of a not terribly interesting area of the Thames South Bank. The duration was approximately 15 minutes of riders crowding for the best views and remaining there so they could take pictures. I was embarrassed that I'd been sucked into such a silly scam. Even children in my pod were bored after the first few minutes. Don't get taken in. There are far more worthwhile attractions for your hard-earned cash in this amazing city."
"Written April 22, 2017",Fast track well worth the extra money ,"An iconic tourist attraction which is very very popular. We booked online combining it with a trip to the London Dungeons which is literally 2 minutes walk away. We opted to collect our tickets from the venue and had booked a time slot. The web site does not give you an option for time slot for the dungeons so if anyone uses this facility bear this in mind. In addition when you collect your tickets, despite the staff saying you couldn't ... you can book your time slot at your other attraction. I spent time sprinting from location to location trying to sort timings. And queuing .... this brings me nicely on to the queue. They are massive. Book fast track for the eye. It's worth it. There is no queue. You just jump on whenever you want. It enhances your experience. The eye is amazing. The views breathtaking. The experience not to be missed. "
"Written April 19, 2017","Not what I was Expecting, But the View was Spectacular!","I honestly thought I had this planned out so we could get in line and do the ride without a hitch. Unfortunately I needed to go one step further. I bought the vouchers online for the ride, but I didn't finish by getting the tickets online before I was done. So, my friend and I ended up standing in line to get our tickets for the vouchers I'd paid for ahead of time. That took an hour.You have three lines at this ride. One to buy tickets when you get there (that's the longest line). One to turn in your online voucher to get your tickets for the ride. Then the line to get on the ride.After you get your tickets, they also have a 4-D film to watch that lasts about 5 minutes. If you want to take the time. It is a history of how the Eye came to be.They have security at the beginning checking to see if you have tickets to get on the ride. Then security before you go on the ride checking people with wands like at the airport. It took us an hour to get the tickets, then another hour to get on the ride. The line to the ride was continually moving, but it still took an hour to get on.The ride never stops unless someone in a wheelchair or otherwise handicapped needs to board. Then they stop the ride long enough for those people to get on safely.They board twelve people per pod.There is a center bench that people can sit on to enjoy the view. Or you can walk around the glass enclosure and get a panoramic view of London. From beginning to end the ride takes about 30 minutes once you are actually on the ride itself.It has a wonderful 360 degree view of London and you can take some wonderful pictures.We were there in February and it was busy enough then. I really wouldn't want to try going there in the middle of summer. It's probably a madhouse.They have a couple of gift shops for souvenirs. Mostly aimed at the kids. But there are a few items adults would enjoy.So this is one of the many tourist things to do. And a lot of people enjoy just sitting and looking at the view.But be sure to buy your tickets online and save yourself the misery of having to stand in line to get tickets, Even in February, with all the bodies in the building buying tickets, it was very hot in there."

That being said, it is a neat experience, and my kids loved the interactive i-pads that showed them where the landmarks they were interested in were located."
"Written December 4, 2016","A must ""touristy"" attraction ","Despite being cheesy and a total tourist trap, the Eye is the great way to kill an hour and see the bird's eye view of London. I've done it twice and enjoyed it both times. "
"Written December 1, 2016",Terrible commentary,"The Eye itself - well run, good views (if it is not cloudy) and only downside is the Coca Cola livery that obscures the views in the capsules. Wonderfully, there is no commentary so you can just stand in the capsule and look out. The river cruise run by the same people was ruined by a terrible commentary by a gushing young female with a voice that was aping ageing TV star Davina McCall. Truly annoying stuff from Sheira. Most of it was irrelevant and it included a huge plug for a restaurant called Coppa. Dull stuff. Yes, we all want to sit on a boat in the Thames to hear about a restaurant - that's exactly what we all paid for. Good views from the boat (any boat in fact) just book a different one."
"Written December 1, 2016",You Gotta Do It!,"When in London, you have to go on the Eye. We bought tickets in advance. I would highly recommend because lines can be really long. The staff was efficient and polite. The Eye moves slowly, so it doesn't make you dizzy. The glass cars  are large enough that you have a chance to look at the city from all sides. The views were beautiful.  far as touristy attractions go, this was one of my favorites."
"Written November 27, 2016",A must do while in London,"I originally wasn't going to do the London Eye while I was in London last July but, the sun come out so I decided to do it. Very glad I did. Line moved quickly and wait time was about 20 minutes. Views were amazing, great way to see London when you don't have much time. I did the combo ticket with river cruise for only a few pounds more, worth it."
"Written November 23, 2016",Great tour of london,We had a nice tour in London and visited London eye. Great view from the wheel over London. The que was not that long and we had a nice tour in London and visited also other places.
"Written November 22, 2016",Take at least the fast lane champagne experience,"We went on a Friday evening at 6 and the lines were quite long so invest a bit in the fast track with the champagne and drink before in the lounge. In that case you avoid queuing in the cold and get a hassle free entry and exit experience. The 4D movie you can also skip in my opinion, it´s nothing spectacular.  The views and the champagne in the Eye it self are a super combination."
"Written November 22, 2016",Meh...,Visited on a Tuesday afternoon. Attraction was quiet so no que. 4D film was uninspiring and didn't really see the point of it. London eye itself was over pretty quickly. We also did the View from the Shard and would recommend this as opposed to the London Eye. 
"Written November 21, 2016",Hotel Chocolat and proseco event,"Decided to treat the missus to an early birthday present and took the hotel chocolat package, which included chocolate samples, an informative tasting guide, two glasses of prosecco and  revolutions round the wheel. Worth every penny and not expensive if you consider the price of one rotation on the wheel. Cant recommend it enough."
"Written April 18, 2017",Kind of a Must-Do Whilst In London,"It's a Ferris Wheel. In the end, that's all it really is.It's fun for a family trip to London. Our kids (ages 11 and 13) really enjoyed it, but it's certainly a ""do it once in your life and probably never again."" Definitely not something I'd feel the need to do again in future visits. The views really are incredible though (especially of Big Ben, Parliament, and St. Paul's Cathedral, and especially in the evening light.) The gondolas themselves are spacious and not over-crowded, and if you get a nice group of people in yours, everyone takes turns at the ""best"" windows and takes photos on each other's cameras. Coca-Cola sponsorship creates a bit of a carnival atmosphere (the line is required to go through a kiosk selling stuff including Coke drinks, and there's a mandatory group photo that you can buy later). The lines are HUGE, and we were glad to be able to spend the extra money on Fast-Track tickets.All in all, a very smooth ride that lasts about a half hour. We had planned to do this toward the beginning of our trip as an overview/welcome to London; instead, it worked out better to do it toward the end as a goodbye. Either way is totally fine.We purchased our tickets as part of a package with one of the HOHO bus tours. Be aware that you get a voucher that needs to be exchanged for actual tickets. We got there one evening to find this out, and found out that the tickets for that day were already sold out. The staff there was very friendly and helped us on a Wednesday exchange our voucher for tickets on a Saturday. From there, it was smoother sailing."
"Written April 17, 2017",Great view,Great view of the city. I would recommend the VIP experience with champagne! Go little bit early to have an extra cocktails away from all the tourist. 
"Written April 16, 2017",Great View,"This was a great start to our London vacation. We pre booked the champagne experience, and this lets you skip all of the lines. It would have been better if there had been better directions as to where to go to show the tickets, but we found our way. We had a 14:00 (2:00pm) time, and were directed to the private bar area to wait. Our guide was late, which was annoying, but eventually arrived and took us to the eye where we bypassed the lines and went right in. It was great to get a bird's eye perspective of the city to get our bearings. It was a beautiful, clear afternoon...and the champagne on board was a nice touch. It would have been perfect had the escort not been so late, and if the majority of the other 24 passengers in our car hadn't been a bachelorette party! But I would definitely recommend this."
"Written April 16, 2017",Champagne Experience,Went on the Champagne Experience package for my wife's birthday and it's definitely the way to do the London Eye! The pod only has half as many people which is great and obviously having a drink on your way round is good. Tip: make sure you collect your ticket from inside at the VIP Experience desk!
"Written April 15, 2017",What a huge waste,"The London Eye is the biggest tourist trap in London - literally. You wait on line for at least 30 minutes to buy a ticket to get on another line for at least an hour to get on the eye for approximately 20 min. Not worth the ticket price, not worth the views since all the windows are dirty. They should've left the skyline of London alone..."
"Written January 6, 2017",Thought would be better?,"After the over an hour queue with prebooked timed tickets, we climbed into a pod. Lots of noise, in all languages, pointing out the sights of London as as we slowly started to circle. Perfect day sunny/cold so had great views. Halfway through noise and excitement levels had dropped, as you can only look at the same views from different heights for so long?!Tick that off!"
"Written January 4, 2017",weekend in london,went for a trip round london.. bought tickets b4 we arrived . to save queeing on the london eye so was easier ..glad we did
"Written January 4, 2017",A 'Must Do' experience,"We eventually got round to doing the London Eye. We booked on-line but don't waste time trying to shop around for discounted tickets, they do not exist unless you are travelling into London on the over ground train network. We booked a time slot but still had to queue for about 35 minutes. Of course you can not guarantee the weather, so clear sky's and sunshine is a bonus rather than a necessity.Drinks and sweets are available to buy, but we took our own as we were celebrating my wife's birthday. Once inside your pod, don't be shy. I got everyone to sing Happy Birthday and everyone joined in. There is a lot to look at in every direction so move around as much as possible.Terrific views in every direction but the whole experience is over far to quickly. Having said that, you only need to do it once!"
"Written January 3, 2017",Great Views,"We booked ahead of time before arriving to London and got a deal for 3 attractions. Our first attraction was the London Eye and it was pretty impressive. So we tried to book it for a sunset view, but to our luck the sun wasn't out that day. + the check in experience was smooth and quick, they move the lines rather quickly. We waited about 15 minutes before we were able to board. + amazing unobstructed views of London from above. If you're lucky, there won't be too many people in your capsule or hopefully they alternate so everyone gets good shots. Overall I would recommend doing the London Eye. Be mindful, that the capsule moves slow, so once you get a full lap around you'll be getting off. The capsule never stops unless their are kids or people with disabilities. Getting one while it was moving, was pretty fun too!"
"Written January 3, 2017",Always Fun,Went at sunset over the Holidays.  Beautiful views of the city.  Get fast track.  Go in the evening.  Big tourist destination but what isn't in London
"Written January 2, 2017",Great View of the City,"A nice way to see the City from a birds eye view.  The line was short, no need to buy the express pass tickets when we visited.  We did unknowingly, not a big deal but unnecessary.  Fantastic views with good photos of Big Ben.  Nice place to walk in the evening as well."
"Written January 1, 2017","London eye was good, the Eye lounge was not! ","Me and my other half decided to treat ourselves to the champagne experience on the London eye, the deal where you get a glass of bubbly in the Eye lounge beforehand and then another glass when you're on the eye.The queueing was a bit of drama. I wasn't aware that I could use the fast track queue so went to the normal queue and waited but once I got to the front, they couldn't help me and said I had to use the fast track queue, so again I had to wait! I don't know why they couldn't get the tickets for me seen as I had already queued!I was very disappointed when I saw the Eye Lounge, I was expecting something quite luxurious seen as it was part of the London eye! But looked like they had just rented out a function room in a hall and had this very cheap looking pop up bar and chairs randomly spread out! The London eye itself was good made better by the bubbly and lovely tour guide."
"Written January 1, 2017",View with Champagne ,"So glad we booked the London Eye with the champagne experience.  Make your reservation in advance and avoid the wait in line and it's limited to 25 people in the capsule.  It's a slow and smooth ride with a guide explaining the sights. We booked late afternoon and saw the sunset, perfect timing.Warning:  be sure to let the staff know upon checking in the line that you have advance reservations for the ""champagne experience, fast track ticket"".  We were advised by two staff members to wait in the wrong line and almost missed our boarding time."
"Written January 1, 2017",Wouldn't pay full price - we have a merlin pass,"We've been up the eye many many times. In recent years we've had a Merlin pass so it's effectively free. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it as it's jolly expensive. With the Merlin pass you can skip the huge queues which is rather convenient. Our 10 year old loves going in the eye and seeing the sights of London. There is always something new to spot. I would certainly recommend going on it. If you are scared on heights, once you sit down you don't feel/see the height. I wouldn't recommend it if you were claustrophobic as you are in the pod for 30 minutes and can't get off."
"Written January 1, 2017","OK, but pricey ","It is an interesting ride, but it is very costly for a family of 6 to go around a ferries wheel one time."
"Written November 19, 2016",Great Experience ,In London for the weekend and decided to put a ride on the London Eye top of the list of things to do. We weren't disappointed as it was a fantastic experience with great views of all London. Such a smooth ride you really didn't notice you were moving or how high you were. Happily recommend a ride for all London visitors. 
"Written November 19, 2016",Eye,Everything it said it would be.I went at night which was magical. Worth booking online to plan your trip and time slot. Take a bottle of water for summer visiting. 
"Written November 19, 2016",Very nice view... that's all folks!,"This is certainly one of the best ways to have a panoramic view above the Thames. We did it at sunset, it was really beautiful! But the queue is relatively long for an attraction that lasts about 20 minutes... Furthermore, the windows are excessively scratched, which spoils a little the observation and the photos. It's expensive for what it is."
"Written November 15, 2016",view of city,went on the eye after a days sightseeing trip at first thought a long queue but it was fast moving when we went on it was still light but time we were on it got dark so got the best of both daytime and night views would recommend you went on at same time capsules very spacious so you can move around with ease and see all the landscape at 20 pound not to dear for a london attraction
"Written November 14, 2016","Pricey, but it's an experience!","Thought it was a bit pricey to simply get into a capsule and go around once. However, I did splurge.  Highly recommend going at night...my daughter and I had great views. The lights made the scenery come alive versus drab gray buildings."
"Written November 10, 2016",Eye of the Beholder,"Able to be seen from many parts of London, on clear days, is the London Eye.  Its enormous wheel with support spokes and glass pods moves through the air with ease.  It is a must for a grand finale in London.My niece and I booked tickets online.  It was for a ride in front of the line with a glass of champagne at 8:00 PM.  We waited no more than 10 minutes and got on.  Don't expect to ride this package alone.   We were with at least 12 people.  So, for a special occasion, request to be alone.The ride is as smooth as silk.  The 360 degrees view is spectacular.  You can see how impressive the landmarks are from the air.  Our tour guide took pictures and was very hospitable.   He also had a great wit.The tour is approximately 30 minutes or less.  There is a bench to sit on.  No lack of views on this ride and it has computer screens to check what you are observing.We went on Halloween night and it was wonderful.  Purchase your tickets online to avoid lines.  There are also souvenir shops and food close by.  Don't miss it, but hold out for the final day if your stay, but check weather first!  Beauty is in the Eye!"
"Written November 2, 2016",Fantastic views,"Thoroughly enjoyed this , we did go in october half term week so yes it was very very busy, but to be fair the weather was good and it didn't actually take that long to board. Views are amazing the ride goes just a good enough speed to enable you to view everything possible. Very clean and spacious inside.All the staff were very friendly too."
"Written November 1, 2016",Nice view and nice attraction,"Nice view of London, you can see all interesting and beutiful buildings of the city. Maybe a bit expensive for what it is, but worth going once in a lifetime."
"Written October 30, 2016",BRILLIANT EXPERIENCE,Booked our tickets online for the London eye and river cruise (saved 10%).  Collected our tickets from the machine in the box office.  You just need to swipe your card that you used to book your tickets and the tickets are printed there and then.  The queue was about 30 minutes long for the London eye but was well worth the wait.  Amazing views of London.
"Written October 30, 2016",Love the view,Every time I visit London I make sure that I visit London eye the view from the top is amazing you can see the river and all the major landmarks of London. That's suitable for all ages and I'm guessing the best time to visit would be right before sunset that would be very cool
"Written September 30, 2016",Great views of London ,Not for those afraid of heights I'm not and my legs went a tad like jelly.  Great views tho and plenty of photo opportunities. Suitable for all ages and wheelchair access. Loved it and would do it again 
"Written September 29, 2016",Must visit,"London Eye is a definite must if you've never been. Yes, it's a bit expensive but it's so worth the money. The views from up there are amazing and you have plenty of time (about 30 minutes) to take some lovely photos overlooking London or just admire the view. "
"Written September 28, 2016",Wine Experience ,"I did the Wine Experience package with my fiance. On the one hand I was disappointed with the organization, because the wait is in a messy room, with staff very, very weak and unprepared. On the other hand I was very happy with the service within the London Eye, the boy who accompanied us and stayed in the two rounds we were entitled was fantastic as the sommelier (both in the photos, I forgot the nomes...  Sorry about that).Now no doubt that waiting in the hall have to improve, because a bad first impression. The grade that I put here is only because the staff inside the London Eye. "
"Written September 28, 2016",Exactly what I expected!,Went for my 21st birthday back in February. Had been over 10years since last time I'd been on it. Loved it!! Was a week day so walked straight on.. was really lucky with weather and could see for miles! The pod was clean and basic. Would happily go back again 
"Written September 22, 2016",Must do !,It was an amazing view of London & i highly recommend it for anyone visiting.  You get an awesome view of the entire city.
"Written September 15, 2016",Brilliant,"I have been on the river boat cruise twice and I loved it both times! The commentary is very interesting, with great facts about London and the River Thames. The boat tour lasted around 50 minutes and boarding was prompt. Well done to Joshua! He was our guide on both trips and provided alot of information, very funny and enthusiastic!"
"Written September 13, 2016",A Bird's Eye View,"Even if you are not crazy about ferris wheels, this enclosed gondala gives a wonderful view of Big Ben and lots of London.  All in comfort.  Not to be missed."
"Written September 12, 2016",Way overpriced.,"Or good for nights. Really this ride is extremely overpriced at 25 pounds each! I've done it once during the day, the vistas are nice, and once at night, again nice vistas. But the price surely can be brought down because it really is just a slow moving ferris wheel. "
"Written September 10, 2016",Is now a must do attraction,"There are certain things in certain cities around the world you must do, this is now one of them.Ok there are large crowds and you may have to wait to get on, but tell me an attraction like this that you don't have the same issues?The ride itself is smooth and quiet, I'm not the greatest with heights but had no issue here. Pick your time of visit and you can catch the lights coming on some of the other famous buildings.I would advise getting the tickets in advance."
"Written September 10, 2016",Well worth the visit ,"Have been a few times and every time have enjoyed it. Very professional in how they operate it and whilst there are queues, it's very well organised. The views themselves are breathtaking and it gives a really good layout of the city making it easy to spot iconic landmarks. The trip is long enough to see everything you need to and the pods are spacious, comfortable and clean. Would recommend to go this first when visiting London as it will help you decide what you want to visit while in the city."
"Written October 18, 2016",panoramic views!,"I've been on this four times - My son enjoyed it when he was and it entertained us a couple of times more recently - and my husband wanted to experience it so we went on together. Don't be put off by the queues - it moves super fast. It is pricey for 30 minutes but you do get to see the whole of London and can recognise the sights. It is not frightening - even if you hate heights, although I see one review does not agree with this. The glass all around feels v safe and no, it does not swing about! The only odd bit is jumping on and off while it is in motion - the movement is very very slow and there is no way you could fall but psychologically a bit weird, like one of those paternoster lifts only slower. I liked seeing old London juxtaposed with new and you can see the tops of buildings - St Thomas's hospital and the whole of the river from a unique angle - you can see Buckingham Palace and even Canary Wharf. Get the 'Map' postcard to tell you what you are looking at. Don't bother if there are heavy clouds or fog though! (It's air-conditioned if it is hot!)"
"Written October 18, 2016",Amazig views of London,Got to see London from above. If yoyu are afraid of height or claustrophobic don't try. It takes 30 minutes to go all they way around. You get breathtaking views from up above.
"Written October 18, 2016",No good if you don't like heights,"We went on the London eye this summer.. we didn't queue for long and when we got on it , it travels really slow.. as the chamber started to climb I was ok until just over half way .. when we reached the top I felt so ill I had to sit down and it's a shame really as my husband took all the photos which he's not good at and I could only see what I had missed out on looking at a few photos... I wouldn't go on it again ad it's expensive for the ride . But at least I can now say I've done it.."

"Written October 16, 2016",It's a big Wheel,"The problem with this attraction is that it's more impressive on the ground than it is on the wheel. the views are not great, the queue to enter is long and the price is high. Oh wheel, if you've not done it you my feel you've not 'done it', but be happy wondering what it's like from the embankment."

"Written October 15, 2016",A 'must see',"Heard a lot, both positive and negative experiences but I am glad we went up anyway. We got the tickets online combined with Madams Tussauds for 78 £ for both of us. Eye is worth the money. Lines can be a bit long, but moving fast. Capsules are not crowded so you get a pretty good view. And the view is absolutely divine. You're up in the sky for half an hour, so you get a good perspective of beautiful London and how huge it really is."

It's a shame there's so many people bunked in to one capsule at a time and the picture taken at the end is usually shared with other randoms however the views are beautiful and it makes up for it all! "
"Written October 11, 2016",Weather dependent,"We booked the river cruise and the eye experience which I would recommend. We sat inside on the boat because it was cold and felt as if it was going to rain (which it did), the tour guide had a dad sense of humour and engaged with passengers well, trip was scenic and covered main tourist destinations. We then qued for the London Eye, it was spitting rain but we were prepared with rain jackets, the que moves at an okay pace but I wouldn't be booking anything afterwards as its unpredictable. You're in the capsule with a group of other people so be polite offer to take pictures for them and you'll have a nice ride. Unfortunately we had left the eye until the last day in London which happened to be cloudy and raining it was still great and we were able to see everything it was just harder to take pictures and not as aesthetically pleasing."
"Written October 10, 2016",The best way to see London,"I booked my ticket as part of a package deal online with a visit to Madame Tussauds for £40 online, a value for money deal. The tickets were valid for up to three months. I visited Madame Tussauds in July and decided to save the London Eye for another day as I was too tired from travelling to visit both on the same day. So I visited at the beginning of October, when the weather was still reasonably sunny and mild. At Madame Tussauds they gave me a voucher for the London Eye with my purchase, so when I visited the kiosk near the London Eye I exchanged the voucher for a priority ticket as I had already paid in advance. The queues are very long, mind you and if you buy your tickets at the desk on the day, it's a long wait. You will be body-scanned before entry into the pods and your bags checked by security. I don't recommend buying food at the kiosk though as it is likely to be expensive, as it always is with attractions like these. Once inside the pod, the ride takes about 35 minutes. When soaring above London, you are guaranteed wondrous views of Big Ben/Houses of Parliament, Horse Guards Parade, Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, OXO Tower, BT Tower, London Bridge, River Thames and many more sights synonymous with London. There are photo opportunities too. Prices a rip-off at £20 per photo, but if presented in a special keepsake photo album, it's £25. All in all, an enjoyable day out. I'd recommend this attraction to any tourist who wants to visit London."
"Written October 7, 2016",London Eye,"Best tip is pre-purchase tickets as the queue was very long for a week day visit. Quite expensive for a short ride about 30mins but spectacular views down the Thames, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben etc. Likely a must do in London (as per Eiffel Tower in Paris)."
"Written October 7, 2016",Slow and boring,It doesn't worth the money and the long queue.You have much better places to visit in london. No doubt about it!!!
"Written October 6, 2016",A pricey but fun tourist activity ,"We did it as the end of our last day sightseeing in London. The access to the Eye always seems crowded and the surrounds dirtier and cheesier than other parts of the main tourist areas but once you overcome this obstacle, even the longest queues move fast and before you know it, you'll be soaring above the City in a pod. We had about 15 people to the pod, which didn't seem crowded. The height is surprising and the view gorgeous - and it's a different  icon to throw in the mix of your London pilgrimage. "
"Written October 4, 2016",Spectacular ,Spectacular view of the city and all its attractions.  Located on the banks of the Thames river you get great unobstructed views of the city from a birds eye view.
"Written October 4, 2016",Fantastic views but......,"We were stuck on the Eye for 4 hours due to technical difficulties.  Information from staff  on the ground was useless.  16 people in the pod with a guide,  Klaudia, who was fantastic but unprepared for this situation.   Emergency provisions brought out which included 5 foil blankets, Lucozade tablets and paper potties.....not enough for everyone.Very frightening when all emergency services arrived and area cordoned off. When we finally got down, we were offered a diet coke and a bar of chocolate! !!!"
"Written October 2, 2016",Overrated ,They charge an arm and a leg to get on this Ferris wheel and you have to share the cabin with about twenty other people. There are plenty of other (cheaper/free) places to get a birds eye view of London from. Not worth it.
"Written October 1, 2016",Did the Champagne experience- do it!,For an extra few £ to the extra pass you can get taken on the Eye by a host and have a glass of bubbles. Why wouldn't you?!
"Written September 9, 2016",Awesome way to see London,"I visited the London Eye with my daughter. We pre booked, which to be honest was worth it although taking a chance on the weather. We both really enjoyed it and would like to do it again at night. "

"Written September 1, 2016",A little dull and overly touristy,"Having taken our children on this and having been ourselves as 2 adults before previously,  I'd say the experience is a little dull. I think there are far better ways to spend your time and money sightseeing in London personally.  I guess it has become one of those experiences to tick off however and if you decide to go,  then of course make the most of it, particularly by hanging out in the Southbank area. There's a children's playground close by, often fun buskers, lots of great places to eat and just enjoying taking in the ambience. "
"Written August 31, 2016","Big Ben, Parliament......","What a view from the London eye...the trip takes probably about 20-30 minutes, and the views of big ben, parliament, and the rest of London are breathtaking.

"Written August 31, 2016",London eye,"Brilliant view, and champagne package allows you to sit in the lounge area and have a quite drink before departing into the cabins. Our guide Andrea was kind and helpful. Though the ques were long even on the express and fast tracked and in someplace stagnant we were not waiting too long.Once you've boarded into the cabin it moves so swiftly and gently upwards, no jerking or swaying was noted just gliding into the air. The view is just amazing and a chilled glass of champagne promptly given was an added benefit. Many photos opportunities and highlight is when you are at the top and view of the Thames river and surrounding London area is just fabulous. "
"Written August 29, 2016",Worth the price,We would definitely recommend especially for the young. Fun. Hardly any wait time. Saw great views of the city. Staff helpful.
"Written August 28, 2016",Good but not what I was expecting,"The London eye is good if you want to see London but it's not really much of an eye, it's more of a Ferris wheel. I traveled 4 hours to get down to London to sit on a Ferris wheel I could have gone to Dudley to sit on. It was alright though, I'm not taking away from it.. But it could be called ""The London Ferris wheel"" as it sounds more appealing. Also, I am terrified of rides and this didn't have any warnings so I started to panic when I asked a member of staff if it went upside down and they just laughed at me. I am still, to this day, trying to find out what was so funny. Will be wanting my money back "

On the Champagne Experience U have a personal host who accompanies U on the fast track entry and receive a chilled glass of champagne on your 30 minute ride."
"Written August 26, 2016",Not worth the time or money hit the Shard instead.,"Anyone planning to go to the London Eye over the age of 21 I say stop!  It is a waste of time and money, because of the way the pods are shaped the view is not actually as spectacular as you think.  Also instead go to one of the restaurants on the 31/32 floor of the Shard.  The view is better and you are actually higher then the London Eye.  If you are still going to do the London Eye, don't choose the EYEBAR experience.  Not worth it...the bar is weird and plays terrible techno and the pod is too over packed to be able to relax with your glass of champagne, everyone is just pushing around you to snap every possible selfie. Hope this helps out someone! Enjoy London :)"
"Written August 26, 2016",Great attraction but you pay for it,Enjoyed the experience as did my 13 year old. The website just didn't work so we went to the ticket office early and in the end didn't wait long. It isn't cheap though. The included 4D experience was fine but not really necessary - designed to distract from the queue? Various photos and whatnot fun but too expensive. That said unrivalled views of the Houses of Parliament. Enjoy. 
"Written August 25, 2016",Great if you don't have a really hot day or someone stinky in your group,Loved the view.  It took about 30 minutes.  It gets hot in the bubble.  Bring a drink.  Unfortunately I had someone who didn't smell good in the group.  That is hard!
"Written August 24, 2016",A fun morning,"The eye was one of our ""maybe"" activities so we did not pre-book tickets which would have saved us money. Despite the high cost, it was fun and the views are wonderful."
"Written August 23, 2016",very nice,this was my 2nd visit to london eye the 1st visit was a few years back and i never moved the whole time this time i moved around a bit move we had my 83 dad with us who was on wheelers for help with walking we want threw the fast track and have to say the staff were brill with him
"Written August 23, 2016",Great view but possibly not worth full price ,"Using my tesco clubcard vouchers I got tickets for £10 each so I feel I got a great experience for that price. I think I'd have been disappointed if I'd paid £22+ each, especially if you're paying for a family. In terms of the experience itself it was an amazing view! I bought the 360° viewfinder for only £1 which was very helpful. This points out all of the places of importance on the landscape. I (stupidly?) thought if I'd booked tickets for 10am I could turn up at 9.55am and walk right on but there was a queue to get on. Waited about 20 mins but it does make sense that's how it'd work so go early if you are on a tight schedule. "
"Written August 14, 2016",Lovely view but boring,"Got bored real quick but cool to see whole city.  Not really worth the spend.  Did not find any particular aspect worthy of pictures, and that is what I was hoping for.  More impressed just looking at the expanse of the ride!"
"Written August 11, 2016",Huge ferris wheel,"Visible from many points in London makes a great background for a selfie, not sure I want a ride. Great views"
"Written August 11, 2016",Excellent,This was definitely on our to do list in London and it lived up to our expectations. Phenomenal view right around. Moves at a good pace for you to appreciate the whole 360' view.
"Written October 29, 2016",Great views of London and a good experience,"My wife and I visited on a recent trip to London and choose the champagne experience. We were fast tracked to our pod but still had to queue when was a bit disappointing. However, our guide Arnie made the whole pod experience great with his knowledge and affable manner. It made the 30 min trip go quickly. We then went to our cocktail at the Eye Bar which seemed to be a pop-up bar in the London Eye building.All in all a good experience I would recommend."
"Written October 28, 2016",Brilliant ...even if terrified of heights!!,"Second visit to the London Eye but did a twilight/night ride this time which was better for those with a fear of heights!!   We used our Merlin passes and were able to have priority whcih meant avoiding much queuing which was welcomed on such a busy half-term Oct afternoon.   Be prepared to get frisked, bag searched but all good and to be expected.Beautiful views on a clear dusk evening and saw many lit up landmarks of course, Big Ben and Houses of Parliament but also further afield too.Staff very friendly too."
"Written October 28, 2016",Don't be upset if you miss it,Its a London landmark and its fairly cheap especially if you mix it with other attractions. But if the queue is long and you have seen a sprawling city I would suggest not waiting in line for an hour for a 20 min ride but head to another attraction. Its average 
"Written October 27, 2016",Have the champagne!,The London Eye.  A worthwhile attraction particularly if you pay the NOMINAL upcharge to add champagne and go to the lounge.  SKIP THE LINE and have a great experience.  Two thumbs up.  
"Written October 27, 2016",Loved it!,You can't visit London and go on the London Eye.  We went on at night and the views of the city all lit up were amazing.  We queued for about 20 minutes and weren't disappointed'
"Written October 27, 2016",Fun,Good view from Above . we had great weather so clear views all around. Lots of photo shots and very smooth ride.
"Written October 24, 2016",Champagne and breath-taking views!,We decide to splurge and have the champagne tour- it was totally worth it. We also didn't have to wait in a cue- probably a function of the fact that it was 5 pm on a Wednesday in October but in reading other reviews I was surprised that we just walked right on at our reservation time. The views really are spectacular and it was the first thing we did after we checked into our hotel.  Great way to start off a wonderful trip.
"Written October 24, 2016",The London Eye,It is one of the landmark in London which you should visit it. They have tow types of tickets ( normal and VIP). You will see both Thames river sides. You will enjoy.
"Written October 23, 2016",A must for first time with children,Fantastic view of London from above. If you orderered your tickets by the internet first you have to get them from the ticket office and then stay on the second line to enter.
"Written October 19, 2016",Really Amazing Structure! Well Worth a Visit! Great Views!,"This wheel is really an amazing feat of engineering. We purchased our tickets online in advance, which I would recommend. We also paid extra for the ""fast track"" tickets that allow users to cut the line, as well as the ""any time, any day"" option. This gave us flexibility in case it was raining or overcast. A handy thing since the queue area is not covered, and there was a long line for the stand by tickets. We were loaded into our capsule in a fairly short amount of time. There was approx. 20 people in the capsule and the wheel moves continuously. It's a very well run attraction. The views are really great. You can walk around in the capsule and take pictures. The capsule is air conditioned and the trip is very smooth. Would do it again when in the area."
"Written August 10, 2016",Needs better Q management with shelters.,When compared to Singapore flier the Q arrangements is very poor. There must be protection shelter from rain and Sun. The souvenir sales section is crowdy and it can be relocated.
"Written August 10, 2016",Interesting tourist visit site for family.,"The great Ferris wheel near the river with 443 feet (135 m) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 394 feet (120 m). It's a great place for family or couple to go. The wheel spins slowly and gives you view from a great site to the whole city, including the Big Ben which is near to the London Eye. They also take pictures before boarding and in the cabin as a souvenir photobook or keychain, which you can decide if you want to buy or not. The average waiting time to get on is about 30 minutes. Would not recommend you're travelling alone."
"Written August 9, 2016",Great Experience,Did the London Eye Champagne Experience. There were 9 of us and it was so much fun. Great views and great company. Time went by very quickly. Kids enjoyed it as well. Definitely worth pre-booking.
"Written August 8, 2016",The bird's perspective,It is definetly worth a visit. You get to see London from a totally different perspective. It moves really slow so you don't miss the shots. I would recommed to book your tickets in advance and combine it with one or two attractions. This would make it cheaper and booking the fast lane is also a good idea. The queues can be very long.
"Written August 7, 2016",A beautiful view of the city,"An iconic structure in itself, the London Eye on the south bank provides a beautiful view over the city. At almost £25 for advance tickets it is not cheap for the 35 minutes it takes to complete a circle, but worth a visit."
"Written August 4, 2016",Nothing special,"You pay a lot, you queue long, but you see whatever you already saw just from a slightly different angle. Spend your money better for the street artists just below the London eye."
"Written August 3, 2016","Boring, not worth the wait or money ","Would not recommend unless you are a tourist with money to burn. The queues are long, it goes far too slowly.  By the time we got to the top we wanted to get down. Better off taking s photo from distance and spending money on something else. Kids were bored and ended up playing on my phone. "
"Written August 3, 2016",Great views,"Great views on a clear day, if you don't like heights, like me, it's fine. Been on it 3 times now. Tickets - don't queue up in the big ticket office we got ours as a joint ticket at the river cruise ticket office, under 4's go free."
"Written August 2, 2016",Gin Tonic Experience,"I booked a GinTonic experience which includes fast track, 2 rotations, 2 GT's and some savory snacks. This was a lovely experience, thanks to our guide who explained a lot about the surroundings. The 2 rotations were perfect, since we were all taking pics at the first rotation and did not actually fully enjoyed the view. The second rotations allowed us to fully sink in the breathtaking views. Highly recommended!"
"Written August 1, 2016",Great visit - ,"staff very helpful with small children, go fast track if you can - it's worth it. Kids loved it and nice air conditioned cabins on what was one of the hottest days of the year. "
"Written July 31, 2016",Badly organised,"If you're like me and don't want to waste a second of your trip you'll probably think it's a good idea to purchase your tickets online.Don't bother!! If you do that you'll still have to wait in a line, a longer line than the one to buy tickets to pick up your actual tickets before getting in the queueThe online reservation  isn't enough, this is crazy in this digital age and just wastes time.To be fair the queue to get on the Eye moves quite fast and the views are good across the Capital but I think the organisation could do with some work, especially as it's not cheap."
"Written July 30, 2016",Must-See Top 5 Leaves You Wanting More,"Iconic attraction giving stunning views to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, the parliament, Oxo building, St Paul and the Thames during the day as well at night. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the ride is too short (20-25 minutes) and some of the staff are a bit lacking.Tips for a good time:- do bring a camera for some great shots of the best views of London- do book ahead and do take advantage of the multiple attraction discount - we got the eye and Madame Tussaud for £39- do upgrade to fast track when you get there unless you want to wait up to 1.5hrs in a queue- make sure you don't get in the same capsules with Spanish or Italian people, they are sometimes really loud and the capsule magnifies the sound - don't get tempted to buy the photos from the eye"
"Written July 30, 2016",Be careful of Gypsies scammers and pick pockets,Be very careful when visiting the South Bank and around the area especially near the bridge. Many Gypsies scammers and pick pockets. Don't be fooled by even the old women. She will even try to sell you a piece of leave telling yopu is bad luck if you do  not buy it. I can understand now why Gypsies are  so hated in Europe. They have no dignity and morals.2 tried to scam me. Quite often they work in 2 or 3 and near a busker. They use the busker as a distraction and a second person to further distract you. 
"Written July 29, 2016","Very nice, queues properly organized","We booked fast track tickets online. So it took us literally minutes to get it. Standard tickets stand in long lines. Pods were not crammed (better to avoid the weekend) so we had great opportunities for selfies and photos. We took some lovely pictures up there. As with all the attractions, they take a picture of you and try to sell it for 25 GBP, which is literally a trip-off. Very few people end up buying them. On the whole, it's a must-do when in London."
"Written July 28, 2016",Just another viewing deck,"Nothing special. Stayed 30 minutes in the capsule for a birds eyeview of London.I bought the voucher for fast track entry from Original Hop on hop off bus but we still have to claim the ticket from the ticket counter. The ticket when printed was only Pound 25 but we paid Pound 31 at Original tour bus.Tip, buy your fast track ticket direct from London Eye ticket office because even if you buy from other resellers you still have to get the vouchers changed to ticket in the same counter."
"Written July 27, 2016",Fast track to avoid a long stand!,"This was my second visit to the eye, and I didn't prebook tickets nor was I able to arrive early morning, so I rolled up about 2pm on a Sunday, definitely not the best time to arrive!  The ordinary queue was horrific, so I went to the fast track kiosk and bought tickets there for both the eye and the aquarium.  We got on the eye fairly quickly compared to the ordinary queue and thoroughly enjoyed the views out over the city on a lovely clear day.  Definitely would recommend at least one visit to this!"
"Written July 26, 2016",A must do while in London.,"I bought a 2 for 1 in advance to try and save time during a short visit last weekend. The weather was perfect and the location was very easy to find on foot. I thought I'd book in advance to try and avoid the queues a little but when I arrived the whole place looked packed with the kids on their first day of many off school.I went to collect my tickets and tried to use the dispensing machines to avoid the queues at the counter. Beware that these machined don't accept Amex cards that have been used to prepay the tickets. We ended up having to queue at the counter anyway! The queues look very long but they do move along quite quickly. We also had an allotted time but we started queuing for the actual Eye an hour early because this queue also looked horrendous and the officials didn't mind. The capsules can accommodate many people but they only allowed about 16 in each capsule so there was a lot of room to meander around for the different views. Even with these numbers in the capsules, the queue moved along quite quickly. The views were fantastic and the pace of the rotation spot on. The weather was very warm, for a change, but the capsules are nicely air conditioned. I don't see the point of the tablets inside the capsules, why look at these when there are such beautiful views through the panoramic glass area?The whole journey from the start of queuing to board the capsules to stepping off after the rotation took us only 35 minutes. And that's with the whole area looking packed out with visitors! So don't be put off with what looks like a nightmare queuing session, because this attraction  is really well organised and the whole process is surprisingly quick with very polite and friendly staff.I would fully recommend this as a must see while visiting London."
"Written July 25, 2016",one of the most exciting experience,"I saw erection of this icon 16 years ago and have since been to this a few times!  It is an amazing experience, I guess anyone who visits London won't miss it."
"Written July 24, 2016",Just another giant wheel,"The line wasn't very long, we were in in about 20 minutes of waiting in line. The cars were fairly large and fully enclosed, so of you want to take pictures, you will have to make sure that there is little reflection/glare.The sights were really good. I will recommend it. We bought the London Eye and Madame Tussauds combo."
"Written July 22, 2016",It's a ferris wheel,Good views but the rotating nature of it means you won't get to spend much time enjoying the views. They also sell overpriced photos of you in the cabins - both a fake one and a real one that you pose for on the way down.Be smart and book your tickets online beforehand since its much cheaper and you can avoid one of two fairly long lines. 
"Written July 10, 2016",Fab Experience. Read the Smallprint ,A breathtaking experience with fantastic views of the great city of London. Only one  minor dissapointment. When booking I booked a skip the line ticket thinking that it was a fast track. It was skip the booking line and not the que for the Eye! We qued for around thirty minutes before getting into our pod. Worth the wait.
"Written July 9, 2016",Expensive but a must do,This was number 1 to do on my teens list for our visit to London. It was great and the views are really great. Not a cheap exercise but worth doing.
"Written July 8, 2016",Over Rated,Expensive and over rated! The attraction was very busy and queuing to pay and then queuing to enter was to much very disappointing.

"Written June 19, 2016",First time in london,"We arrived on a Tuesday morning around 10:00am. We purchased our tickets at the booth nearby.  We did purchase regular tickets, not fast pass. We were surprised the area was not very crowded. Within an hour we had purchased our tickets, waited in line and were set to board.   Our party of five boarded with eight other people.  We really enjoyed the experience and the views from the wheel.  This was the one thing we did that everyone wanted to do again."
"Written June 19, 2016",Quality,"Did this yesterday and when we turned up and saw the queue, we nearly fainted. These worries were dumbfounded and were gone when we jumped in the queue and it went down so well, the staff there are very efficient keeping the wheel going constantly as well as cleaning it and checking for dodgy things between people getting off and on. Overall, breathtaking views of London and very recommended. Stay away from the 4D show though, worst 5 minutes of my life, purely just a vanity project from Coca Cola."

"Written June 16, 2016",Loved the London Eye!,Way better than I imagined. The views are fabulous from start to finish and it moves at just the right speed to give everyone a chance to look around and take photos as well.  We paid the extra to skip the long lines and felt it was worth the extra money.
"Written June 16, 2016",A Must For Visitors,"I finally succumbed to the temptation during my most recent visit to London.  I purchased a ticket online that allowed me to jump the queue of those who had just bought their tickets at the Eye ticket office itself.  I showed up at 10:30 am in early June and almost literally walked right on.  The regular line looked like a bit of a wait.  The crush is probably worst in August, which is a bad time to visit London because it is twice as crowded.  The carriages move delightfully slowly giving plenty of time to pick out the sights, including a straight line view of Buckingham Palace and part of the Horse Guards Parade.  You can also pick out the top part of Nelson's Column and other landmarks if you know what to look for. And, of course, the Houses of Parliament and the Thames just below.  Make sure you orient yourself before getting on. And definitely pick a sunny day.  I found it well worth the money and time."
"Written June 14, 2016",Hotel Chocolat!,"We did the Hotel Chocolat chocolate tasting experience and loved it.  Well organized, small group, and pleasant presentation.  Also, the two revolutions provided plenty of time to taste the chocolate, drink some (constantly filled thanks to the good service) prosecco, and see London."
"Written June 10, 2016",An absolute farce,"Visited on the May bank holiday weekend with friends, this was a planned visit and we had purchased flexi, fast track tickets online before visiting. Arrived around 4pm and to describe the whole place as chaotic is an understatement, we were told we had to change the online ticket at the fast track desk, stood in a queue for 20min, one girl, doing her best, was not nearly enough staff, got the tickets changed and when we went back outside, if anything the chaos was worse, we were told we would have to wait for at least another 30 min to get on and as there were so many private parties and the wheel kept stopping so it could be longer, we had two elderly friends with us who couldn't possibly stand in a chaotic queue that long which was why we bought the more expensive tickets, to avoid this very situation. We were told to go to the priority desk and we would get a refund, we were greeted with a very of hand attitude from the girl behind the desk and basically told to go away, she could do nothing, I asked to speak to a manager and he at least explained how to get a refund, gave me phone numbers and was pleasant and I would say was the only member of staff that seemed to know what they were doing. This is not my first visit to the London Eye, my last experience was very different, pleasant staff who knew what they were doing and very helpful. I don't know what has happened since then but I suggest the management sort it out, it took over 2 weeks to get the refund but I have now."
"Written June 5, 2016",What a View,We got tickets last minute through our hotel concierge and when we arrived the line was not that long. My mother was with her cane and we were fast tracked. That was an unexpected nice surprise and well appreciated. I was concerned about the getting on/off but the attendants offered help. It was a little before sunset and the view was phenomenal. You can see for miles. Spectacular photos of Parliament.  
"Written June 5, 2016",London eye,Fab. Been a couple of times. Day and evening. I love the fact that it goes slow enough to have time to appreciate the views. Will go again too.

"Written July 21, 2016",Third time on the eye - love it every time,We visited on a hot July day using the Merlin Annual Pass - which was excellent as we were put straight in the fast track queue. Even though it was 31 degrees outside the pod was lovely and air conditioned.Fantastic views and a lovely smooth ride as always! My small son (4) was less interested in the landmarks but liked to look down at the nearby play ground and the water feature by the Royal Festival Hall that we had also visited that day so that kept him busy.Planning to go again and see London lit up at night in the future.
"Written July 20, 2016",Incredible!!! ,We came on the hottest day of the year and thankfully I'd pre purchased tickets for the champagne experience on the London Eye. We didn't have to wait outside queuing for ages in the scorching heat but instead picked our tickets up and were directed upstairs to the champagne bar where we bought a drink and waited for our host to collect us. When collected we were taken straight onto the London eye and given a glass of champagne! Lovely experience and so glad we upgraded as it meant we weren't melting outside!!!!

"Written July 20, 2016",Use your OWN EYES instead!,"The London Eye was recommended by a woman we met at one of our hotels so we decided to go. The lines and prices are so crazy, so we splurged and paid for the expedited line and £10 per person upgrade to bypass the line.The facility is pleasant enough and the air-conditioning was lovely.The weather was great so we could see far, but honestly there was nothing that we saw from above that warranted the tremendous cost (both money and time). Big Ben is gorgeous from the ground, so it's not necessary to see it from the air. Buckingham Palace looked like a grey library from above and wasn't impressive at all. When we walked to it and saw it on foot from the proper angle, it was lovely.In retrospect, we wish we hadn't done the Eye; it was a total waste of time and money."

"Written July 16, 2016",Unexpected short wait,"Fabulous view, of course.  Take a very up-to-date map to work out all the newer buildings.We were recommended to visit around 6.30 for a shorter wait time and it worked perfectly.  There were just 3 of us, so we were moved forward in the queue to fill a space.  Total wait time was under 10 mins.  Be ready for the photo just before the finish."
"Written July 11, 2016",A GREAT VIEW OF LONDON!,YOU MUST come if you want to see the beautiful City London from the sky above. And it will be also GREAT if you can come at night which will be 10 times beautiful! And Big Ben under will also look great. And it's really a place that you MUST go.Good luck 
"Written July 10, 2016",Overrated,Ok you get a nice view but so you do from any one of the tall buildings sprouting up in London. You queue up for 45 minutes (having already reserved and paid) and get into a pod with about 50 (?) other people.Just a waste of money.You can a wonderful romantic view of London for free from the middle of Waterloo Bridge and no crowds.
