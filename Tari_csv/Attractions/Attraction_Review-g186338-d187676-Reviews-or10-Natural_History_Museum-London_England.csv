"Written August 8, 2021","It Was Good, That","I very much enjoyed this trip to the Natural History Museum with my three pals. We hadn't booked tickets, but arrived at 10am to queue for about 10 minutes and then were released into the exhibits (we were overjoyed to find it was completely free!). First stop, the bogs. These were located at various points throughout the venue, which was a huge relief seeing as I was travelling with someone with a slightly weaker bladder. We then went to the Human Evolution section, which was really interesting. There were so many real-life skeletons and reconstructions of our distant relatives. We then went up to the Volcano and Earthquake section - best part was probably the earthquake simulator. We also enjoyed seeing the huge whale in the main hall and learning some more about the planets of our solar system. Another highlight was the gift shop as it provided lots of giggles.My biggest disappointment was the dinosaur section as I found it quite boring (apart from the big T Rex). Good for all the family, free and lots to see and do, which brings this museum's score to a 4 out of 5 on this occasion."
"Written January 16, 2020",Magnificent building!!,"The Natural history museum is not only for children or nature scholars. The amazing building is worth the visit by itself, and remember that the entrance is free!Don't miss the blue whale skeleton in the main hall of the old building, the dinosaurs section, the huge moon replica, the red zone with the earthquake simulator, or the treasures in the top floor, with the moon stone or the first edition of Charles Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"".You can stay an entire day here, depending if you have kids interested in these subjects, or if you are an aficionado yourself.Enjoy!"
"Written February 17, 2020","In a word, 'WOW!'","Having visited the Natural History Museum in Oxford, this was a long-awaited visit for me, personally.The museum is enflesslely brilliant and interesting. As a FREE site, it is up there with the top things is recommend to visit.The Volancoes and Earthquakes section is truly fantastically executed with an earthquake simulator near the end of this area. We had an excellent level of dialogue between myself and my friend's nephew!The blue whale skeleton is absolutely breath-taking and really dominates any visit in a pleasent way.The dinosaur section is really well done, as well.This needs to be on the top of everyone's agenda when visiting London!"
"Written March 17, 2020",A hugh collection.,"In my travels I have come across nothing that compares to the Natural History Museum as a museum of the Natural World. The building is impresive in itself and is seen at it's best entering by the main entance hall where a real Blue Whale skeleton hangs from the ceiling. The mammals hall nearby contains a full size model of a blue whale among it's many excellent exhibits.Other good sections include Human Evolution, and a section for Fish Amphibians and Reptiles and Mammals.Down one of the corridors runs an impressive collection of Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur (extinct reptile) fossils.And there are there are the dinosaurs. These include motorised moving models of dinosaurs. There is also some fossil skeletons of dinosaurs, this best of which in my opinion is Sophie the stegosaurus. What I think gives Sophie such class  is not her size, she probably was not full grown in death, but the fact the skeleton overwhelmingly comes from one fossil unlike most dinosaur skeletons which seems to be mostly made plaster replacing what is not found in the ground. Oddly Sophie is held away from the main Natural History Collection in the Geology Museum part of the collection.A good feature of the museum is that you are not obliged to pay an amount for visiting you pay what you think the visit was whorth. Which is useful if you do not have time to to have say a £20 whorth of visit."
"Written October 28, 2023",I just  had to see Titanosaur .......,".....the main purpose of my visit. A £16 exhibition fee but I had pre-booked a timed visit the night before and just strolled in, a short queue into the exhibit at midday but the museum seemed fairly quiet for a Saturday. The exhibit opened a fair few months ago so now you can queue up and pay to see this amazing exhibit. Since the pandemic pre-booking and timed visits seem the orderly way to go almost everywhere and takes the chance factor of getting in somewhere away, there's pro's and con's to that but I made it in and WOW.There are a few information screens to pass before getting to see Titanosaur but when you do it is an amazing moment, similar to when I first saw ' Dippy ' on School visit many years ago.Titanosaur is massive and amazingly 3 or 4 times the size of ' Dippy '. What made this visit unique was that you can actually touch the skeleton of this 100+million year old dinosaur. putting the palm of my hand on one of the thigh bones of Titanosaur was a magic, almost spiritual moment. We've all seen those DO NOT TOUCH signs but here you can. I had a bit of a wonder elsewhere on the ground floor, the ' Hintze ' hall is always a special place but Titanosaur stole the show today."
"Written August 13, 2023",Interesting but far too busy. Needs restricted entry. ,"I hope the NHM takes on some of these reviews as constructive criticism.I love the NHM and I value highly that the UK provides free entry to museums. However, I do think the time has come for the NHM (and possibly V&A and British Museum) to started a ticketed entry system in order to reduce the number of visitors per day. It was far too busy. Not only the queue outside but once inside it was damn near impossible to see anything and explain things to the kids. People just see it as a tick list of places to visit and just crowd to take photos of things without even reading anything. Plus the heat in there!I feel the place needs a refresh. The dinosaur section has proved what can be achieved. If a section was closed to change exhibits and signage many would welcome it.  Doesn't need to be drastic, the plesiosaur wall will always be impressive, but the hyena and Panda look like they are 200yrs old. By all means continue to show taxidermy as it is historically interesting but a better comparison of new science would be welcome. The kids found it interesting. Aided by our knowledge of natural history more than the signs but they tired quickly due to the crowds and the heat. Only saw two sections before giving up as it was overwhelming for everyone. Sort out the crowds and this place will stay a gem. Currently the museums are turning into places to avoid. "
"Written April 17, 2022",Uncomfortable,"We went in the Easter holidays on a Saturday. 2 adults, 3 children and 2 babies in a double stroller. We booked in advance The best experience we had there was the picnic area downstairs which we used as soon as we arrived as it was lunch time. We started out tour at the bugs and walked round ok was a bit crowded, we then got in the line to see the dinosaurs, it was a bit of a slow moving queue but we got in and I wish I never did! We had no time to look at anything as we had NO choice but to keep moving around and follow the path around I had 5 people step over my daughters legs in the stroller to get past even tho I was walking as fast as the flow let me! My children hated it and wanted to leave, they were getting pushed past by grown adults to see a trex they can see from behind them. I didn't blame them wanting to leave and we felt uncomfortable as them, so after an 1hr in the actual museum we left. But the picnic area was lovely 😅 dinosaur theme tables, highchairs there's toilets and baby changing down there definitely recommend taking your own food."
"Written February 22, 2022",Sadly poor and exhausting!,"Very sad to be writing this but a family visit today was terrible!Staff were great but the crowds were horrific, the queues were unbelievable and while visit was stressful and exhausting.Queued for 30mins to get in for our booked time slot just to have non-ticket holders walk straight past and get in before us.Queued for 30mins or more to see the dinosaurs, just to be packed in like sardines, having to shuffle around with hundreds of others.The museum is fine but please explain to me what the point is of having a limited number or time slots to then just let anyone and everyone in."
"Written July 26, 2020",Need a whole day to explore,"A remarkable museum. The displays were great with good signage and explanation provided. We tried exploring the whole museum but couldn't manage it in half a day. The main part which houses most of the displays were very busy while over in the Orange Zone which hosted the wildlife garden, spirit building, and Darwin centre was much quieter. Do pay attention to the building itself as sculptures of different plants and animals can be found everywhere from the columns to the ceiling. To top it all off, entry is free of charge. Will definitely return for a revisit if we're back in London."
"Written February 17, 2020",Birthday Trip to Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition,"The main purpose of our trip was to see the WPOTY exhibition as part of my Birthday celebrations. The galleries were well presented and it wasn't too crowded.We had limited time to see the rest of the museum, but know from previous experiences when the children were younger that there is something to appeal to everyone. Of course, the Cetaceans Hall is not-to-be-missed for the Blue Whale!"
"Written August 12, 2020",Not all exhibits are open due to COVID-19 restrictions,"As a measure to reduce crowds during COVID-19 you have to prebook a time slot for entry, this can be easily done online. You also have to wear a face mask while insideThe museum building is beautiful. For us the main attraction was the dinosaur exhibits and the animal exhibits in the main hall. I will probably return when it is no longer necessary to wear a mask as I felt uncomfortable so didn’t spend as much time in the museum as I would have liked. "
"Written January 13, 2022",It’s okay,Another good day out I loved the gems stones i could have spent all day in there looking at the different stones and crystals.  It’s another big museum make sure you give your sled plenty of time to go round it. I would say go to the entrance with all the dinosaurs first because that’s the best bit. We went through the other entrance where there’s staff pressuring you into paying a donation. I understand that times are tough but not everyone can afford a donation £5 or £10 can go a long way to quite a lot of people. I understand that you need donations to keep the place running but please don’t pressure people into it. I was annoyed at the fact that you are happy to take my money off me when i walk through the door but as soon as I want a bottle of water and hand you over a Scottish note you screw your face up and say your not accepting it. When the last time I checked Scotland is apart of the UK but you won’t accept it but your happy to take money off me as soon as I walk through the door. 
"Written January 10, 2020","Great Adventure, lots to learn","Went there on New Year's day and there was a really long line, but it took only 10-15 mins to get in. The museum itself is totally free, but you can donate to help the organisation. It was a great adventure for both kids and adults, we had a great time. We had very limited time there, and will return for sure. Keep in mind this place will take at least 3hrs minimum."
"Written January 3, 2020",Simply outstanding,"Even though it is free to enter this mirage of wonderful exhibits, there are plenty of opportunities to be able to donate, which you are encouraged to do.  So much care and attention to detail has been given throughout this museum that you really need to visit more than once to absorb the magic.  London should be proud to have such a fantastic venue within its acreage.  The building is enormous and there are so many life-size exhibits that it really brings home the enormity of what was on earth all those centuries  ago. Information is clearly stated and you could tell by the variety of ages in attendance that this place caters for everyone. This has to be on your must-see list in London."
"Written January 23, 2022","As always, an extraordinary museum!","I have always loved coming to this museum - visited with my boyfriend for a museum date. The classic exhibits were as always amazing, particularly would recommend visiting the Vault to see some beautiful gems!The cafes and restaurants were quite expensive so would recommend going out to eat for lunch or bringing a packed lunch (we asked if we could leave and come back, we could but would have to queue outside again).The new exhibit about climate change was particularly eye-opening, and would definitely recommend going to look through it. The Natural History Museum has always been a favourite of mine!"
"Written October 3, 2021",Wonderful museum but too overcrowded,"A fantastic selection of exhibits, covering a huge range of topics.  Lots of interactive options and wonderful architecture in itself. We hadn't booked in advance, but didn't have a long wait outside.  After an hour or so we found the museum got really busy and quite crowded, which made it difficult to enjoy some of the areas.  We did think that the Fantastic Beasts exhibition was far too expensive at £25 per adult"
"Written August 10, 2022",Overcrowded…overheated…underwhelming.,"Don’t go if you don’t like crowds! We visited during the summer holiday and it was horrendous, packed in like sardines, hot and really uncomfortable. We couldn’t view anything properly as people just get in the way, rudely walking around in trances straight for you! Far too touristy for my liking. They need to start charging a hefty entrance fee to weed out a few of the arrogant people."
"Written February 20, 2020",Very busy but excellent,"A family half term visit, the queue to get in in the rain was around 1h15m! I seriously considered feigning illness, toilet desperation and joining with a family membership to skip the queue. The queues for both exhibition road and Cromwell road were massive there was no quick way in. I seriously think the popularity now means some kind of ticketing system is required.We had a lovely few hours in here, primarily the blue dinosaur section and the red geology/mineralogy/stars and so on near Exhibition road. It’s world class. Just go."
"Written October 24, 2021",Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition,"Visited solely for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition this time, due to time constraints, but wish we could have gone round the museum too!The building itself is so impressive, and the entrance hall blows you away with its suspended skeleton of a blue whale. The Wildlife Photographer exhibition needs to be booked in advance and there is a charge to get in (unlike the museum, which is free). It was mindblowing, like stepping into another world - the quiet, dark surroundings with the illuminated, otherworldly photos is so special and moving. We just took our time, read every word of every caption and marveled at the absolute miracles of nature captured on film.Spent about an hour and a half there. Simply marvelous."
"Written August 15, 2021",Fantastic Beats exhibition not worth paying for,This exhibition was not worth paying for. Me and my nephew love the movies but this really did not have much to do with them and we both got bored quite quickly. Only a couple of props on show from the films. Quotes which have come from Newt’s “book” are displayed to describe some of the “fantastic beasts” and then there are a few bits to show how the so called beasts link back to real and mythological creatures that we may have heard of to show where JK Rowling got her inspiration from. A lot of reading to understand what is on show so not very good for younger children. The rest of the museum was good but very crammed with people considering you have to book a time slot which I thought was so they could monitor the amount of people visiting at any one time. 
"Written July 19, 2021",Not an amazing museum but something to do while in London I guess,"Honestly, I was expecting a little more from the National History Museum. There just didn't seem to be much to see and given the size of the building I was surprised. The animal and dinosaur section is probably the most interesting but given the size of the building I felt like there should be more to see, especially when a huge section of the museum was dedicated to rocks which I'm sure some people loved but it just seemed odd. I've been to other ""National"" museums and they've been a lot more interesting but luckily it was free so really can't be too angry about it. Stop by if you have a spare 2 hours but I wouldn't go out of your way to fit this in."
"Written August 13, 2022","Beautiful setting, but far too crowded to enjoy it.","The NHM is a beautiful building with so much amazing history. The entrance hall is simply breathtaking. It is also wonderful that there is no entry fee, so that everyone is able to visit the museum and it’s exhibits. However, this presents a problem…far too many people are being allowed entry to the museum. We pre-booked our tickets as we assumed that there would be a cap on how many visitors would be allowed into the museum at one time. This is could not be further from the truth and it was completely unnecessary as anyone can walk in at any time and we felt like sardines in a tin continuously throughout our visit. It feels like cattle being herded through the exhibits and it doesn’t leave any space for you to explore freely or read any of the information. We visited on a warm day, and the heat was stifling. Although this isn’t something that can be helped in such an old building, less bodies might be a good place to start. We had also pre-booked Dippy, again, a completely pointless exercise as everyone was just allowed to crowd into the room at the same time, and then you can barely see any of Dippy.The cafe is extortionate, £9 for a basic cheese & tomato sandwich, can of Diet Coke & some crisps is simply a rip off. Overall the visit was ok…but I don’t think we’ll be rushing back."
"Written January 3, 2022","Dino Snores for kids , NOT worth the money","We visited Dino snores for kids event in decemeber.  We paid around £60 per peron including tickets but the activities done during dino snores were really disappointing. Event was crowded and chaotic.Gates open at 6.30pm but by the time we went in it was nearly 7.45pm, there were only 3 staff to check 100's of guests.Except T-shirt making other activities were not really interesting to kids who had been to these museums many times but were attending dinosnore for first time.You can do most of these activites during day time in the museum for free, sleeping experience wasn't nice.There were 4 activities in total, three in the night and one in the morning which you do on your own.1. Visiting Fantastic beasts portraits around the museum with an activity sheet.2. Making Dinosaur tshirt (you use a coloring pen to draw on a white T-shirt).3. Night trail, we expected more from this, you just go around the museum to find a name about a dinosaur and the instructor was bit boring , it was late, many kids fell asleep.3.  In morning, you will get another activity sheet which you do on your own.Sleeping-Sleeping experience wasn't great, they give you thin mats. There was social distancing here.  Breakfast was not great , one pastry and orange juice , there was no fruit inside our bag.I was intrigued as to why it is booked out but couldn't find any decent review , after reading this I hope you make your decision wisely.Overall it's not worth the money. DO IT during day time for free"
"Written August 21, 2022","Amazing as ever , with a new icon","I have been here several times , but this is the 1st time since they moved dippy out of the main hall , and brought in Hope the blue whale . Everybodies reaction to the impact of stepping into the main hall , is one of awe and amazement .  I didn't miss Dippy , especially as it is back for a limited time in a near by hall . I strongly advise pre booking for free for both Dippy and entry to the museum , as it is a long queue to get in "
"Written February 23, 2020",Definitely worth a visit!,"We had a brilliant day at the natural history museum and couldn’t believe how great it is given that entry is free! The exhibits are interesting and varied and our children aged 6 and 4 really enjoyed it! Our children were blown away by seeing Andy’s clock and the staircase from CBeebies Andy’s Dinosaur Adventures! The dinosaur hall was naturally and as to be expected, very busy. It could do with being a bigger space so you can view and read the exhibits better without feeling rushed because you’re being pushed around by the crowd or getting in someone’s way. The route round the dinosaur hall is narrow in parts given the amount of people there so you just get pushed along by the flow! However don’t let this put you off, it’s definitely worth it! There is so much to see and do in the museum and the escalator to the volcanoes and earthquake hall is very exciting! There are plenty of cafes and restaurants spread out around the museum with lovely food and refreshments which is great as it means it’s easy to stop for food or drinks at several points during the visit and it spreads the rush for lunch around the museum rather than everyone trying to get food all in the same place. It’s an absolutely brilliant day out, we were super impressed, all enjoyed it and will definitely return next time we visit London."
"Written July 4, 2021",Fantastic! ,Last minute decision to visit as we arrived in London earlier than expected. So very glad we went. The whole museum is so well thought out and the descriptions and explanations of exhibits are all well done. Staff so helpful. Personally I thought the price of £16.10 per adult was excessive for the wildlife photography exhibition and so we didn't do it but I know the museum needs to make back huge sums of money lost during the pandemic. Liked the idea of the donation stands at the end and being contactless very practical. Recommend to anyone and everyone.
"Written April 13, 2022",Day out,Fantastic place to visit all of the exhibit areas are very good but if you want to see the dinosaurs- who doesn’t get there early queues were very very long and inside the exhibit it was rammed no control on how many could enter at a time bit like playing sardines. Although free entry you do have to book a time slot have to say way way to many people being allowed in today it does detract from the enjoyment when it’s as packed as it was today. Gift shops also very busy gifts not cheap but then it’s London and I have to say not as much choice as I expected. Managed to get seated in the cafe area but restaurant again packed.All staff were very polite and helpful. Definitely recommend as a fab day out if you don’t have children try term time when it’s maybe not so busy.
"Written August 22, 2021",Some bits were excellent,"I’m a history teacher, so you would think that I would love this place. However, I found some of the displays a bit dated, especially where there was the stuffed mammals.  On the other hand, some parts of the museum were exceptional. Hintze Hall and the giant whale skeleton are a must see. We also loved the collections of gems, minerals and precious stones. We had pre-booked but they were accepting walk-ins too. I did feel that some areas were too crowded and it made it difficult to see some things. The T-Rex skull needs better lighting in the area that follows a timeline. The dinosaur exhibit area was very crowded and dark but it was amazing to see such a large collection.The museum is free but there is a suggested donation of £5, if you want to contribute. We didn’t pay for any of the special exhibits. Maps cost £1 and I really think you need one. There quite a few shops dotted around the museum. Toilets were a little harder to find, even with the map."
"Written January 12, 2022",Dino Snores - Amazing experience,"A small group of us went to the NHM for an adult DinoSnores event - it was amazing and would recommend to others.The event starts around 6.30pm and you leave by 9.30am, during the event there is a 3 course meal, quizzes, talks, films, pop up bar and breakfast.Some of the exhibitions are open including the Dinosaurs and Wildlife Photographer of the year .For the whole event there are up to 300 people, which means that as you go around there is so much space to view things (only about 10 people in the Photography exhibition).A yoga mat is provided, you bring your own sleeping bag and get to sleep under Hope the Whale (although don't expect much sleep!)There were plenty of staff on duty to help find your way around (and serve drinks)A fabulous experience, one I feel quite privileged to have been able to attend."
"Written August 21, 2020",Excellent day out,We visited post COVID as we were in London to see family.  I was a little apprehensive about visiting at this time.  However tickets were limited and had to pre booked ( essential).  This meant that visitors numbers were limited but gave everyone inside much more space.  There is one way in via a side entrance which is clearly marked from the tube by way floor stickers.  Staff outside were on hand to direct and ensure you did not miss your timed entry.Once inside there was plenty of hand sanitizer spread throughout the attraction.  Food inside was limited but understable.  Every where clean.  As ever the museum never fails to amaze.  Last visit was approx 13 years ago when I lived in London.  We travelled as 2 adults and 1 12 year old.  Highly recommend.
"Written August 29, 2022","Too crowded, feel like you're always in someone's way","I feel a little bad giving it three stars given all of the hard work they do behind the scenes (and how helpful the staff are) but as an overall experience it's quite mediocre.You can't argue with the price (though a donation is always a good idea) but it's quite an uncomfortable experience. It's extremely busy, even on a Sunday, and you always feel like you're in someone's way. Around certain exhibits (e.g. the dinosaur section) it feels more like you're in a flowing river of people rather than a museum you can genuinely engage with.I would advise turning up an hour before they close because it thins out quite a bit then and you can walk straight in and focus on the things you really want to see (like the dinosaur or the whale). I would advise skipping the weaker exhibitions because you aren't going to see anything special (endless numbers of fossils and rocks mostly).Take a bottle and fill up from their water, too. The selection of drinks to buy is quite poor."
"Written July 5, 2022",A Good Time,"I thought this was a fantastic museum given that it was free. It had a nice mixture of exhibits about a variety of topics - weather, planets, gems and more. I think this is more geared towards families, so if you are expecting a quiet museum experience, please know there were a lot of screaming and children running around. I highly recommend visiting Dippy and the gems, as those collections were quite unique. I also would note that I was impressed with how handicap accessible this museum was compared to many others in London. I don't think I would recommend more than two or so hours unless you have children - then a full half day may be warranted."
"Written October 30, 2022","Overcrowded, too hot, badly laid out and not worth visiting","What a nightmare outing! Please don’t go unless you’re happy to be roasted alive because of the awful heat, crushed half to death in overcrowded small spaces or suffocated through lack of fresh air. There’s plenty of better museums around the UK that are less crowded, better laid out and with more interesting, interactive exhibits.  The NHM is feeling dated and amateur compared to other museums we’ve visited.We took the grandchildren after having happy memories of at least 3-4 visits when our own children were young.  It used to be a fabulous destination, but something has gone very wrong. To say the museum has gone downhill is an understatement.  It was dreadfully overcrowded, despite us booking timed tickets in advance. It was virtually impossible to view exhibits, made worse by most attractions being in too small areas on one floor, with crowds of people being funnelled through fairly narrow corridors to get to each zone.It’s free to get in, but there are annoying staff at the entrance shouting at everyone to pay a £5 donation for each person on entry. If it was worth it, I’d be happy to donate, but it wasn’t even worth the train fares getting there.We gave up battling the crowds and left after less than 2 hours.  One child was feeling very sick and ill (close to fainting) and the rest of us were seriously overheated and uncomfortable.  We didn’t stop to queue in the overcrowded cafes, nor bother to spend money in the overpriced shops, although we had initially planned to.  The management need to get a serious grip on the situation. We were so disappointed and definitely won’t be back. It’s such a shame that such a beautiful museum has deteriorated so badly, mostly it seems due to poor planning. It would attract far more income from the public if they sorted it out."
"Written January 23, 2021",The Best museum in the world,"If the collection didn't impress you, the building sure will. This is where you can combine your love for nature, science, history and architecture. This magnificent building that looks like a cathedral/palace, has millions of objects that are million year old. From most famous T-Rex, rare animals/birds to some exotic plants whose tiles decorate the museum's ceilings, this is one place that I can never get tired of.We should all be thankful to the father of dinosaurs Sir Richard Owen who wanted the building large enough to display the skeleton of the largest animal on earth, The Blue Whale.And we should also thank him for scrapping the entry fee because in olden times, these super world class attractions were only for the super rich but he wanted everyone to have access and enjoy the natural world.What a nice gesture."
"Written June 22, 2021",They just want your money!,So my partner and I were going back home and we did not have anywhere to keep our suitcases. When we arrived at the museum (already with our tickets) we were advised that we needed to leave our bags at the cloakroom. Imagine our surprised when a guy there told us that we needed to pay 21£ in order to be able to visit the museum without our suitcases. We said that we were not going to pay and that we would carry our visit with our bags and we were neglected from that choice. So basically they don’t care about you they just care about your money. I did not have the chance to visit the museum and even if I had I would never donate (if they are just like this with bags imagine what they would use your money to).
"Written January 16, 2022",Never fails to amaze,"A firm favourite with tourists or for those who wish to visit this brilliant museum. It is free to enter, but it is worth booking a time slot online as those with time slots get in quicker than those without. Once inside you can purchase a map for £1 which helps you navigate around. There is a lot to see, it is not all about dinosaurs and blue whales! Usual facilities are available onsite and friendly staff are on hand to help if required."
"Written October 2, 2021",Amazing experience,"I visited here in august with my husband. We pre booked which was definitely a great idea as it was raining when we arrived and a huge queue outside but we walked straight in the pre booked entrance  so was well worth that. We spent over 5 hours exploring the museum, it really is an amazing experience to see all the history there"
"Written January 13, 2020","Amazing, but overcrowded","We visited on Sunday afternoon - the place was full of tourists... The Darwin Centre was a highlight for us, though we didn’t have time to explore all sections of the museum. Hope to be back one less crowded day."
"Written February 25, 2020",Don’t miss the clever architecture.,"On this visit I mainly looked at the amazing architecture of the building. I had never particularly noticed all the different flora and fauna incorporated into the outside and inside of the museum. Once you spot one thing eg the monkeys running up the inside columns, you start to spot other things. I went right to the top floor to get a closer look at the painted ceiling too. There is a small exhibit in one of the corners about the architect and the building. Such a clever, exquisite design.Entrance is free but they rely on donations for upkeep."
"Written January 6, 2020",Please charge an admission!,"It would seem that most parents here think this is some kind of crèche, letting their children run riot. Just because it is a free space, shouldn’t mean you can let your kids run around shouting. I could only bare to spend an hour hear. Every time I went to read a info board, I couldn’t concentrate due to some of the children around me. I think a small charge, would at least eradicate this problem and if parents were actually paying for something, they might feel their kids should actually be looking at the exhibits. Rant over."
"Written July 7, 2021","No control,  kids running riot. Masks under chins. Not a member of staff in sight. ",This is our 2nd visit to this amazing museum but this time I feel we have been let down emmensley.Making your way around and there is no control over anything. People ignoring the one way system parents letting their kids run riot whilst there busy on the phone or talking away. People walking around with their masks hanging off there faces or under their chin. Nobody around to manage what is happening.We decided to visit the Central Cafe to get away from all the noise and unruly children. No wonder the museum is free because the prices you pay are extortionate. £6 for a baguette which is okay but no basic rolls all fancy. £2.30 for a can yes a can not even a bottle of coke. Bring you're own food and drinks.Why are they doing time slots when I know people were arriving at 10.30 with 11.30 appointments and are just let in.  No order no control a total shambles of an experience. 
"Written July 25, 2021",Will keep you entertained for a few hours,"Visited the museum on a recent break to the City. Having been to London many times before, have never ventured as far as the museum. With Covid restrictions in place we did secure our free entry before turning up just in case numbers were high and we got turned away. Upon entry the iconic hallway is breathtaking with the Great Blue Whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling. The museum is broken down into colour co-ordinated areas so you can navigate and complete sections at a time. We did find some areas more interesting than others though it wasn't fully what I expected. We did visit the on-site cafe whilst at the museum for snacks and a drink. Prices were slightly expensive there but then I do appreciate its a captive market. Overall it was a pleasant place to visit for a few hours however now I've done it once I wouldn't rush back to return. "
"Written August 27, 2020",Stunning Museum,"The family and I visited as one of our many points of interest during our 4 night visit to the capital. Set in the rather boho area of South Kensington, the museum is literally a 5 minute walk from the tube station (Circle, District and Piccadilly lines).An incredible piece of architecture containing some magnificent sights and artifacts, this a place that will keep both young and old engaged and fascinated. Be prepared to use shanks pony though as this place is absolutely huge with so much to see, my feet were in bits at the end of the day. Plenty of local amenities in the surrounding area, parks coffee houses, shops, restaurants and places to rest the legs.Definitely worth a visit."
"Written April 2, 2023","Some great collections, but design and flow could be better","Above all, the building inside and out is gorgeous and it’s worth the visit for that alone.  The staff is friendly and the booking process was easy.  The collections of minerals, rocks, and elements as well as the sea creatures I found to be very interesting.  Most of the blue zone and the mammal exhibits feel quite old and physically outdated, including the rooms themselves, even if the information is still accurate.  Stained ceiling tiles and bleak hallways complete the image.  Ultimately it was a positive experience for me but I highly recommend avoiding going on the weekend unless you’re absolutely desperate to go.  I understand more people through the door = more potential donations but the least enjoyable part of the experience is just how incredibly crowded it is.  It would greatly improve the ability to experience the collections if they allowed just 10% less people inside at a time.  Currently you wade through rows and rows of people in tight areas to even get a chance to see something.  There is no organization or flow and thus there are groups moving in both directions, often with strollers, making it impossible to even bypass the more crowded areas."
"Written October 20, 2021",Fantastic beasts and the wonder of nature at the natural history museum,"The natural history museum has some great exhibits, but the fantastic beasts exhibition is ludicrously overpriced and very lame. The obvious movie tie-in elements will interest young Harry Potter fans, but there’s precious little in the exhibition for anyone with more than a cursory interest in nature. I feel well and truly rinsed."
"Written December 30, 2022",One of the worlds’ best,"We absolutely LOVE The Natural History Museum, it always boggles my mind that museums and galleries are free in the UK, but that’s one of the benefits of living and visiting here. We were lucky enough to just by walking by the museum, knew that we had nothing planned for the day and thought why not see how big the queue is… as it was just after opening we were lucky enough to get in super fast and without it being too busy. Please please please make a donation on your way in or around the museum so it can continue being amazing. We spent half a day here and you can easily spend a whole day and then come back the next to continue, there is so much to see and educate yourself with! Some of the displays have become rather dated, and it shows, they need a bit of an update, but the information they provide is still valid and the ‘main’ pieces are well maintained. All the staff are friendly and happy to help if needed, the cafes have tasty food and coffee at decent prices and the shops are very reasonably priced for gifts / toys etc. actually cheaper than some normal stores. The Natural History Museum is a must do."
"Written August 29, 2021",Too crowded!,"Booked our tickets online in advance and gave a donation, which was all easy.  Arrived at the museum and didn't have to queue, which was nice considering it was still the summer school holidays.  The museum building is impressive.  When you first walk into the main entrance, you cannot help but be amazed by the huge whale on display.  But,,,after 2 hours, we'd had enough.  I'm sure it's not entirely the museums fault but I feel they could have done a lot more to keep people safe during covid times.  It was very crowded, especially in the dinosaur exhibition area.  It was a one-way system through a very dark and small area (they have packed so much in to what felt like quite a narrow walkway) and people clumped up together, many with bulky pushchairs, also lots of young kids running around unsupervised and bumping into people, and I very quickly felt rather claustrophobic. So we didn't actually stop to really look at anything in the dino area, we tried to get through the crowd as quickly as possible and out of the exit.  My 7 year old son had also had enough - it was simply too crowded, he couldn't see anything and could never get to any of the exhibitions to really look at anything properly because there were too many people in the way.  Such a shame.  After that, we made our way back out to the main hall and asked my son if he wanted to see more but he did not and we decided to leave.  I've heard so many people say that you could spend a whole day at the NHM, and i'm sure you could....on a nice quiet day without children.  But when it's busy, I personally couldn't wait to get out.  We only actually did the reptile, mammals and dino exhibition areas.  In all honesty, it was more interesting watching the behind the scenes tv series / documentary.  We've come away just feeling a bit disappointed and deflated by it.  We had rather high expectations after having enjoyed the NHM in New York."
"Written March 21, 2020",Beautiful atmosphere. Disappointed by some aspects.,"The atmosphere is amazing. One feels like one is transported back to the 19th century. Well worth a visit. I was disappointed by the dinosaur section. Although the emphasis is put on education, the skeletons are mostly suspended above the walkway and not so easily visible. There is a definite effort to move away from a stuffy old museum layout towards a modern educational experience for youngsters (and adults), but doesn’t one come to this museum to be plunged into the old stuffy, dusty era of the great British discoveries and expeditions? That was just my own personal desire, so I’m not complaining.HOWEVER I was shocked to discover that there was absolutely no entomological section in the museum. There is a “creepy crawly” exhibit which is only educational. I wanted to see show cases of some of the world’s millions of fabulous fascinating insects. It took me a long time to discover there weren’t any, I asked one young employee where the entomological Section was. She said “the what?’. I asked another young staff member the same thing. She said “entomology. Is that insects?” and directed me towards a part of the museum where there were volcanoes. In the end someone told me that insects were no longer on display for the last few decades. Such a shame!"
"Written October 23, 2021",It was ok ,"I'm sorry but I really wasn't impressed, for starters when we arrived we were made to leave a small hand luggage bag in the "" cloakroom"" and charged £7 ! They actually weighed the case ! Why ? Nobody is carrying it around ! The other thing was you could leave a pram or buggy for a £3 charge !? Work that one out. Most of the hand sanitizers were empty which was surprising.I understand the museum is free entry, we would have made a donation had we not been stung by the bag charge. "
"Written September 9, 2021",Perfect Activity.,"Wow! What a day out! This place is amazing for couples, friends and families and there is so much to see and do. Lots of natural history and different monuments to study, look at and enjoy. Everything is examined in short brief points that don’t over complicate things. Everywhere was clean, tidy and the museum was just stunning! As a FREE place to visit in London that will cost you nothing more than a tube ticket, £1 map and a cup of coffee, this museum is definitely worth exploring. The Blue Whale skeleton in the main hall is just spectacular to look at. Take your time, take it all in and enjoy. It wasn’t too busy and crowds were controlled too. We will return as they are always adding to the museum."
"Written August 2, 2020",Always something new to see!,"I have been to the Natural History Museum a few times now and each time there is always something new to see. The exhibits are fascinating and so varied, plus there is plenty for younger visitors too. It is easy to spend hours wandering around the museum and as entry is free (recommended donation only) it is brilliant value and a must-visit attraction for those in the city.I don't doubt that I will be back again in the future!"
"Written July 27, 2021",Great free visit,As we visited during Covid restrictions we had pre-booked a time to visit to ensure we could get in. Although we have visited London many times we had never been to this museum and thought it was time we did especially after seeing TV programmes about it.The building is a beautiful setting for these exhibits. The blue whale is the most impressive display and the one most people will remember although the dinosaurs are a favourite with most children and the part they want to see. The museum is divided into different coloured sections to help you navigate your way around. Personally I was not so interested in the rock displays but appreciated the way they had been displayed.During our visit we went to one on the cafe areas. It was nice and open and clean but the as with many places with a captive audience prices tend to be priced higher than any local cafes for a similar standard of food.
"Written March 20, 2020",Amazing collection,"All I can say same thing: This is one of a number of brilliant museums in London, and one of the best I have visited anywhere.  It is free to enter, but donations are encouraged and gratefully received.  It has some amazing collections and exhibitions covering most aspects of life on earth and its history.  They provide the general public of all ages with a very stimulating and thought provoking educational experience.  It is housed in a beautiful old building with generous spaces and elaborate architecture.  Enjoy the special shows, such as the Wildlife photographer of the year exhibition (for a fee), and replenish afterwards in their pleasant coffee shop cum buffet restaurant.copy."
"Written April 11, 2020",IF I WAS YOU I SHOULDN´T  GO TO THE RESTAURANT,I went with a group of teenagers to London for five days. One day i went to this museum and i had a bad experience because the restaurant was too expensive and the quality of the food was so terrible. After five hours i started to throw up all the food. And the museum was like a cathedral because in there i was very cold. I got the flu and i went to Harrods and i throw up in the expensive bathrooms for rich people. I don´t study biology and i don´t like minerals... so it wasn´t interesting for me. So in conclusion i don´t recommend this museum because is a raste of money and you can buy something more useful in other spots of the city.
"Written March 14, 2022",Too busy,"I haven't been to the museum since I was a teenager in the 80's & really wanted to have a great day out with my kids (between 10 & 23!).However......We had pre-booked tickets (free) which is just as well as there was a sign stating walk ups not available (it was term time I think in London). We still had to queue.Once inside it was in a word, heaving!!The blue whale in the main hall is OK, but not as good as 'Dippy'. Talking of dinosaurs, we headed there first. You are herded through a one way system where the displays are either above you or difficult to read. Full of school groups.We then headed to get an early lunch at the adjacent cafe. We were lucky to get a table straightaway and the food was OK.I can't really remember what else we saw but it was all busy, busy, busy and hardly a mask in sight (yes, I know restrictions have lifted but......).Best bit that I do remember was the Volcano and Earthquake bit, but we got there towards the end of the day and everyone was tired.Not sure I'd want to visit again any time soon. Such a shame."
"Written February 13, 2020",A Fantastic FREE Museum,"Aside from the British Museum, this was on my ‘must do’ list while in London sightseeing. I certainly wasn’t disappointed. The range of artefacts is bewildering. The staff again should get a special mention as they are polite and helpful. The building has a fantastic front aspect and the additional rooms marry perfectly with the grand old structure. The staircase in the main hall was superb and looks not too dissimilar to Harry Potter Hogwarts, which I’d guess they’d come here for inspiration. The museum is nicely divided up for the myriad of natural categories. There are a few areas, such as the preserved specimens in jars, which I came across by accident around the garden and at the back of the building (I think). As with any museum, it is always best to plan your visit to get the most out of a fantastic experience. Use a map and the internet to highlight your ‘must sees’. Don’t forget to donate at the museum as free entry is great, but we need to support these excellent establishments. I had a really healthy lunch while there consisting of chicken, potato salad with broccoli & bean sprouts for lunch with was fresh, tasty and good value for money."
"Written April 9, 2022","Fantastic, but make sure you book in advance","This place is a great, fun-filled & educational day out for all the family. Plenty to do & see, & particularly impressive given that it's a free entry! I've always enjoyed visiting, my most recent visit with my 8 year old daughter was enjoyable for the both of us.It's worth noting that you can't just rock up without a ticket if you expect to gain admission. Until now that's always what we've done, so I was surprrised upon arrival that we were not able to gain entry to the museum without a pre-booked ticket (still free, just a bit more of a faff). Luckily I was able to jump straight on my phone & get a couple of tickets for entry a few hours later - & filled that time by grabbing lunch & nosing around Harrods. Just be aware if you haven't visit since befor the pandemic that you may need to be a bit more organised than in previous years!"
"Written April 23, 2022",Too busy it took away all pleasure from the experience.,"So busy you cannot enjoy it. Have been to many museums around the world and this one, whilst the most impressive in size, was the worst in terms of experience. It was too busy to be able to walk around at a leisurely pace. You cannot read anything or look at anything. My toddler was overwhelmed by the amount of people. In the dinosaur area you are funnelled in to little barriers to walk around in a line. We left after a short while. I would prefer to pay and access to the museum be more restricted in terms of numbers at a time. So disappointed as I have wanted to visit here for years."
"Written February 21, 2020",Highly recommended ,"The building is absolutely gorgeous! I love coming here just to sit and people-watch. You could spend all day here looking at the vast amount of exhibits. Unsurprisingly, the cafes are expensive and be aware of the school holidays as it can get crazy busy."
"Written March 2, 2020",Fantastic day,"Excellent day outWish I had had longer to go round was there 3 hours and still could have stayed longer, my kids are 12 and 10 and both loved it. It's so interesting and fun and free entry is great one of the best places we have ever visited and will definitely be going back again.The advice I could offer is take your own drinks and snacks as its quite expensive and the coffee is not too great, the kids meal deals are good value but unfortunately one side of my daughters sandwich was stale, cakes are good though.I would strongly recommend this museum we loved it "
"Written August 3, 2022",OK for free but busy and hot,"A lovely building with great exhibitions and facts all around but sadly sooooo busy and overcrowded that we felt we didn't have time to stop and actually read or interact with anything. The dinosaur areas were heaving with children and if you go on a hot day be prepared to be sweltering!!!Sadly we left after an hour.Glad it was free as paying would've added to the frustration of how busy it was.Also tickets are not checked so timings/quantity of people booked is irrelevant just had to turn up and show booking on phone, a quick glance and we were waved on through."
"Written January 2, 2020",A must,"I love the Natural History Museum of London, but oddly enough, I enjoy more the building than the exhibitions. Some temporal exhibitions are great but the permanent collection is average compared to other major natural museums around the world. Being free as the rest of the public museums in the UK, however, the value of visiting this museum is extremely high and the government should do better together with donations to revamp it to a higher level."
"Written February 18, 2020",Wonderful mix of old and new.,"Britain's Natural History Museum is gorgeous. It combines the esthetics of a classical and historical building with the blend of newer spaces connected to it.I spent the better part of an afternoon here, and would definitely recommend it.A lot of the museums in the U.K. are free, with suggested donations and even the convenience of tap pay to get a few pounds. I love walking through this space. It is spacious for those needing mobility equipment."
"Written January 19, 2020",Wonderful,"Simply an awesome place to be, helps appreciate the work done over so many years by scientists of many disciplines. Fascinating displays from stuffed animals through fossils to minerals, visitors could spend a day here and still not appreciate all this magnificent place has to offer.Absolutely recommended to anyone interested in the natural world, past and present."
"Written February 23, 2020",Excellent content but very crowded,We did visit during the school holidays so it wasnt a surprise to have to queue to get in. The building is so beautiful and the exhibits are well displayed although I was  bit disappointed that the dinosaurs seemed to be in quite a small area when it seemed to be the most popular.It is many years since my last visit and the building has obviously been extended quite a bit. There are good interactive activities for kids. A bit crowded for me but still love it
"Written March 8, 2020",Incredible quantities of exhibitions ,"I visited the museum on a Saturday, got there just before opening and only had a short queue.The museum itself is in an excellent location being next to a tube station and the building is incredible. It took me around 2.5hours to go around all the exhibitions, although you could easily spend around 4 hours! Such a varied selections of things to see and interactive parts too! The dinosaurs were incredibly impressive, especially with the animatronics!The only downside was going on a Saturday it was pretty busy - I think I may have gone on a scouts day as it was full with kids. "
"Written January 25, 2020",Don’t stop for coffee,Shame that a great museum is spoiled by sloppy and almost insolent service. We stopped at the central coffee shop where the ordering system is totally disorganised. Orders are taken and then brewed indiscriminately so customers were picking up one another’s orders leading to confusion and irritation. Add to that a young man with real attitude. Polite requests as to missing drinks were met with a scowl and one drink thrown into a waste bin with a snarl. Methinks he is in the wrong job. 
"Written August 11, 2022",Magical,"Wonderful as always. Highlights included the dinosaurs, the dodo skeleton and the bird displays. Let's not forget Andy's clock from the CBBC show. Incredibly busy in the school holidays which is to be expected. Excellent picnic area in the basement.We arrived early but queued in front of the building gates only to realise the queue starts at the corner of the building. Worth knowing for the future. Worth booking ahead to skip the queues."
"Written June 20, 2020",Very interesting!,"Have visited the museum on many occasions, primarily to see the dinosaurs. The museum has a great variety of displays on offer as well as excellent amenities (shops etc.). The museum is worth a visit, even if you are on a short timescale."
"Written February 3, 2020",Dated exhibits but worth the visit,"It’s beautiful, and worth going to for the building alone. But a lot of the exhibitions are looking really tired and in need of some update. The human lab in particular needs some modernization. The geological exhibits were much more interesting and certainly felt current (maybe its the taxidermy on the biology side of the museum that gives it that dated feel as well). I loved the main hall and the volcano/earthquake exhibit especially, maybe that’s the Californian in me ;)"
"Written August 11, 2020",Not just for children,Returning to the Natural History Museum after lockdown seemed a logical step.  It was reassuring to see the familiar dinosaurs her had survived the pandemic!  The building itself is fascinating echoing the skeletal structures. There is plenty here for adults as well as families and children and with the booking system in place browsing is a little quieter.
"Written October 16, 2022",Wildlife Photographer of the Year,I recently visited the Natural History Museum specifically to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition entries. It was £17 which I kind of thought was a bit expensive but was willing to reserve judgement. Needless to say I thought £17 was way too much after having visited. The display images were too small and simply having them close together in lines encouraged queueing and bunching. The images should be staggered in diverse places to encourage natural movement. The crowds and being unable to see the images properly or read the text - all too small - was really frustrating. I enjoyed flicking through an online picture gallery on The Guardian website much more and only booked because I expected something special. A total disappointment.
"Written October 31, 2021",Obviously very good - David Attenborough likes it!,"Does what it says on the tin, a history of nature and evolution. I would have given it 5 if they hadn't let so many people in. I couldn't understand the point of the booking time slots system if they were just going to let anyone in at any time. We were there at 10:00 with a 10:15 time slot, the people in front of us had an 11:45 time slot but we all went in together. We left earlier than we would have liked as it became very crowded and uncomfortable."
"Written January 14, 2020",Dino Snores,"My ten year old absolute loved his own night at the museum event. Activities included creating your own dinosaur t-shirt, a torch-lit trail, a shark show and in the morning a brilliant interactive live animal display.It is very busy with lots of children and families attending but the Dino Snores team are very well drilled and keep things organised and, most importantly, fun.It is an incredible experience to sleep underneath the blue whale in Hintze Hall. But be aware that the sleeping mats provided are not the softest and if you have your own you would be advised to bring them along.When it has all finished you can store your bags for free in the cloakroom and look around the museum before the doors open to the general public."
"Written June 11, 2021",Always a treat,"Not my first visit and won't be my last!I was very keen to see the blue whale in the foyer, but did feel it needed to be lower to fully appreciate it.  I get that it has a curve in it but it is a bit of a dangler and doesn't have anywhere near the same impact as the diplodocus.They have managed the CoVid stuff well and it's good to see so much still open.  I did miss seeing the glyptodon as that one is an old friend!  Generally it was all very good - I liked the new (for me) route into the geology section but was pleased to see that the old rock room is still there.  Overall it was another enjoyable visit.Two displays were there and I do like that the museum is free with paid for exhibitions.  I hadn't realised the photographic one was still on as I would have booked that - although it's not cheap these days.  Even more expensive was the Harry Potter themed display of Fantastic Beasts, it was extortionate.  I know they use these to raise funds but I'd much rather they charged a little for non-UK residents at the door and then made the special displays cheaper."
"Written January 2, 2020",Really consider alternative place on busy days,"We were lucky to arrive very early so no cue to enter. Nevertheless, walking through the dinosaur exhibition was a very crowded experience. When getting out of the museum, workers were trying to disuade people to do the waiting with children, the cue was huge. “You do not have to put your children through this. There are two more museums very near.” - was their honest advice."
"Written May 9, 2022","Lots to see, really awesome","Very fun to go to and a lot of things to see. The top floor with volcanoes and begining of the earth has small experiments and things that show you what is meant with the explanation. Very big escalator to the top of the building is also very nice. Make sure to go during the week or it'll be very very busy on Saturday. I went on a Friday afternoon and could walk around in peace. I recommend having some sort of plan how to go through the museum if you want to see everything, because it's really big. Staff was very friendly, some parts were closed or the specific item was somewhere else at the time I was there, but most of it was really nice to see."
"Written October 26, 2020",Birthday visit ,"Great places, a lot to explore, the staff were nice. COVID 19 safety procedures were great.The only thing we were left standing in the rain & cold for half an hour pass our booking time as there were to many people in the museum, I suggest maybe doing a wristband system so everyone gets a fair chance to lot around the museum and unfortunately a lot of bits were closed of but that’s understandable with the current situation. "
"Written August 19, 2021",Tired and dated,"I have been visiting here every few years for nearly 4 decades and other than temporary exhibitions it has not really been updated. The exhibits are tired, and interactive elements are mainly broken or tatty, and the museum just does not offer a 21st century visitor experience. This is such a shame as the science and research carried out by their staff is rightly celebrated- but this is not apparent at all in the exhibits. Queuing for some time in a stuffy and crowded room to see an animatronic T Rex is neither surprising nor educational these days."
"Written January 25, 2020",Natural History Museum - must see,"Visited the Natural History Museum in London, a natural history museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. There are many things to see for all ages from children to adults. Expect it to be very busy and packed as people bring their families for a day out here and the entrance is free. "
"Written August 3, 2021",Probably best on a quiet day,"My husband, teenage daughter and I visited yesterday and like other reviewers said there is lots to see and also quite narrow places at times and as it's low cost to get in there were lots of young children who are not necessarily stopping to read all the information and as a result there were times when it was very crowded and difficult to keep any distance from others. There were lots of signs to wear masks but many adults weren't and based on the high volume of people I'd guess they weren't all exempt and this was disappointing as it made for a very uncomfortable experience. Overall it would have been better having less people there and spread out so restrictions on the number of people in each area."
"Written April 5, 2022",Favourite museum in London,"I love the Natural History Museum; so pleased that it’s free entry. Exhibitions are great and informative, there is something for everyone here. Over the years they’ve spent a lot on renovation and expansion but they’ve kept the core exhibits like the fossils/dinosaurs, mammals etc. The wildlife photographer of the year (paid) exhibit is worth going to. Recommend booking a ticket online, no matter what day or time of the week it is busy with yours or school trips. Still love this place though."
"Written August 3, 2021",Great visit,"Was with three under 10’s who was amazed with the museum, we could have spent a week there as there is a huge amounts to see.  If you are a member or patron there is even more to see.  Great for large groups too.  Lifts are available to get other floors.  Places to eat and drink with toilet facilities in two zones.  Museum shops have an array of minerals/ gems and many other items to buy, the gem stones we found are very reasonably priced.  Plenty of staff around if you get lost or need assistance and all are super friendly. Loved the day there and the family too."
"Written January 4, 2020",Nice Museum - VERY busy,"We went as a family to this museum. It was early July, and even though we expected it to be busy, as all the main museums are free, what we experienced was something else. The museum was so busy it was hard to enjoy anything. You had to keep going at all times, otherwise you would get stampeded by people behind you. The museum is beautiful in that there are lots of places and things to explore, however I can't get over how crowded it was."
"Written August 15, 2020",Nice Day Out In London ,"I haven’t been here since I was a child and a friend and I decided to meet here as it’s a great location and I wanted to revisit some exhibits. Due to covid you have to book a free ticket which honestly is a great idea, there was virtually no queues and we got in hassle free. The staff were all really nice and all wearing protective gear. The museum is clearly marked and the sections are easy to follow which made this whole trip unproblematic as we felt very safe. Some of the more interactive exhibits were not open but the dinosaurs and other core parts were open for viewing. A great place to spend a few hours."
"Written August 18, 2022",Fab day out but bring a packed lunch!,"A great day out! Some fantastic exhibits (it was great to see Dippy the Dinosaur back in the museum!) and so much to see. Was quite warm in some parts (partly because it’s an old building, and partly because it was so busy)Despite being very busy, we were able to see everything we wanted to. We spent 4.5 hrs there and it flew by. If we wanted to read and see everything we would probably want to go twice, we were shattered after the time we had been there so we’re very happy with what we had seen but you could spend so many more hours there immersed in different parts of history. Would recommend this as a place to visit for all ages.  We didn’t visit the garden as it was chucking it down with rain so hopefully will see that next time we go but I hear that’s beautiful and there’s lots to see and learn about.Only criticism we would have would be the price of the food in there so id recommend bringing your own packed lunch or going after you’ve had lunch. We paid £15 for two cans of Coke and two cheese and tomato sandwiches. But considering it’s a free attraction, still a cheap day out. I am sure the profit from the food adds to the donations they receive that keep it running and fund the amazing research they do there."
"Written September 23, 2021",Museum great but magic memories not so,"The museum was great, our son loves watching Andy on CBeebies so this was a really exciting trip, we had our photo taken by magic memories, in fairness the photos were good so we chose to buy one which wasn’t cheap £10.. and also paid extra to view the photos online which they said would be emailed to us within 24 hours. Today I received a link to access the photos which is wanting me to pay an extra £7 to “view” each photo online, that’s a slight con since we’ve already paid for this when we purchased our printed photo.. £49 to view 7 photos online is daylight robbery. Ive emailed magic memories and await their response but please be warned."
"Written January 21, 2020",Great Museum ,We wanted to do something different so decided to visit the natural history museum. The entrance is breath taking and for me the best part of the museum. The building itself is stunning. We did not realise how big the place was and only was able to spend 1 hour here. I would most definitely return and next time with the children as it would be a great day out. A token donation is well worth the experience and I would highly recommend.
"Written August 5, 2022",Far too busy,"We booked on line as requested but there is no point. No checks made and no queue (despite it being about midday) they just let everyone in. Consequently, the museum was far too crowded. It was like being on a conveyer belt of people in many areas, not just the dinosaurs. We just all shuffled along together. The whole museum was overly busy and hence unpleasant.It is also very hot. Whilst this is down to the weather and the museum did have a few large fans around, it is not helped by the cheapest drink being £2.50!The idea of booking a time slot to avoid the infamous queues is an excellent idea and one I hope the museum continues with, but the museum needs to check these bookings and limit numbers to a more reasonable amount."
"Written February 2, 2020",Entertainment for everybody.,"This is my favorite museum in London. The vastness of different exhibitions will suit interest of every visitor, and above everything else, the building itself is a beautiful wonder. Tip for those who are planning to visit, go there as early as possible, as it is getting quite crowded closer to lunchtime."
"Written June 16, 2021",Really good Covid-safe experience,We went here on Monday 14th June and pre-booked tickets for the 10:30am slot. The museum managed the number of people really well and it felt super safe with lots of staff walking round and washing down the interactive exhibits and glass fronts. It was honestly lovely to be in here when it's so quiet.
"Written January 26, 2020",You can actually sleep here!,"Spent an amazing night with my 10 year old Son (there are also adult only nights) lying on a yoga mat in the great hall (you have to bring pillows and blankets) several activities took place during the evening which started around 7pm and went on until 11pm, then back o the hall to sleep with around 400 other people (but you could hear a pin drop as he kids where exhausted). Choose wisely where to sleep, we chose a quiet corner by the gift shop but right by a a huge dinosaur exhibit, away from the glass dome that in the summer would wake you up around 5am! Lights gently came on around 6.30 then headed for breakfast and the final activity before leaving just before the museum opened at 9. We got to see parts of the museum you don't normally get to see. The whole experience was better than any theme park I have ever been to."
"Written January 2, 2023",Prioritize in London and skip this one,"US Natural History museums have this one beat hands down, prioritize and do not spend your time on this one. The building is stunning, it’s free, you can get advanced tickets which I would recommend as the museum was “full” by early afternoon and they stopped allowing anyone to wait for admission if they didn’t have tickets. If you choose to go you should know that the T. rex isn’t real, it’s animatronic. Most of the whale skeletons are authentic, but dino’s are replicas. There is so much more to see and do in London and you can see real dino’s in the US."
"Written March 7, 2020",a lot to explore,I‘ve been to the Natural History Museum twice so far and upon every visit I had loads to explore. the exhibits are very deliberate for all ages.It is quite busy in the entrance hall as it is the main meeting point yet within the galleries the crowd disperses.the dinosaur gallery is fascinating and the information given is well edited- for children as well as adults.the galleries upstairs are more interactive and it makes a nice change to get to explore some of the specimen rather than solely passing by.I‘m eager to come back and explore more of their fascinating
"Written May 2, 2022",Wonderful visit,We had a wonderful visit to the museum in April. We pre-booked our tickets online and was able to enter the museum little bit earlier than the stated time to start exploring. Recommend checking in your items at the cloak room. The most expensive item is a bag over 4kgs which was £7. The busiest part of the museum was of course the dinosaurs which can get super crowded in the one way system. Look forward to returning again soon!
"Written September 30, 2022",Museum Mooch,"I visited London for the first time and this museum was at the top of my list to go to. We had ordered our free entry tickets online the night before which I would highly recommend doing as we skipped easily an hour queue to get inside. The first thing we did was eat at the cafe - very expensive - but satisfactory food.  We explored every single part of the museum which took 3 hours in total. There is so much to look at from space to dinosaurs. Our favorite expeditions were the sea life and birds which completely blew us away with how many pieces they had in their collection. The architecture of the building alone is worth the visit, and this is noticed all throughout the museum. This is a MUST visit in London if you have time to spare!"
"Written September 14, 2020",Fascinating celebration of the Natural World,I left things rather late in my holiday to get an online booking but fortunately on the day I visited there was an entry slot available at 1445. It was a great way to finish the afternoon. Not all the sections are currently open but this still leaves plenty to enjoy. The museum was busy but social distancing didn't create too many issues. My favourite sections were the dinosaur and the mammals. Service at the cafe and the gift shop was quick. Tickets are free but online donations can be made when you book tickets. 
"Written March 12, 2020",Short visit but looked even better,"We were really excited to go to the Natural History Museum as our children enjoyed the similar museum in Washington DC. Unfortunately our kids were nit feeling great so we really had to abbreviate our visit.  From what we saw we really enjoyed the museum. On top of the central exhibits we toured the rock / gem hall, and dinosaur area. We went on a Sunday in early March and it was probably one of the busier locations we visited. Even then we got right in without a wait and were able to visit displays without feeling crowded.  The building itself is a fantastic visit on it’s own. The staff were friendly and there was plenty of areas to wander off to. The rock and gem exhibit was massive and if you are interested in such things you could easily spend a day there alone. Definitely worth the visit!"
"Written November 26, 2022",The best museum that I have visited,"This is the best museum I have ever visited. I loved walking round the human evolution section with outstanding fossils and remains on show. Also enjoyed the geographical section on volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis. The standard of this museum is great and well worth a visit. Entry is free, book a time slot online in advance to avoid a slight queue (although we queued for 15 minutes but it was well worth it). Thank you for a great visit!!"
"Written January 1, 2020",Favourite! ,One of my favourite museums in London. This was my second visit and first time for my 6yr old. He loved looking around and enjoyed the interactive exhibits. Only negative was that it was really crowded when we visited so it took longer to get around. Would definitely recommend a visit here.
"Written January 10, 2022",Dinosnores for Grown Ups,"Dinosnores for grownups was a truly excellent event.  We could camp anywhere in the massive Hintze Hall, including upstairs in the galleries, so there was plenty of space for all participants.  The event was run in a very covid-secure way and felt well-organised.  The ticket price included all activities, a drink on arrival, tea and coffee, a really good quality three-course meal and a hearty breakfast to send us on our way.  We were spoilt for choice with the activities, with particular highlights being meeting geckos, spiders and snakes up close, crafting and pub quizzes.  I was pleasantly surprised that we could roam around many of the galleries and exhibits as well.  No wonder we didn’t bother turning in before the lights were dimmed at 3am!"
"Written February 16, 2022",Heartless members of staff,"We saved up to take our 3 & 4 year old on their first trip to London which takes 3 hours door to door. When we arrived, they wouldn’t let us in and said we had to pre-book a ticket in advance - despite the museum being free. In my 40 years of visiting the museum I have never had to do this!! The staff on the gate were absolutely heartless, I explained our situation and they still flat out refused. The children were devastated. Appalling behaviour and a waste of money for us as a family."
"Written April 11, 2020",Fantastic and free London attraction,"A fantastic, free and iconic London attraction with something for everyone. We visited with friends (a family with three children under 12) who were staying with us in London. The museum is huge! You could easily spend a whole day here exploring the various exhibitions and learning. So much to see and do. Will hopefully return at some stage and spend some more time. Highly recommend."
"Written August 30, 2021",Brilliant FREE day out but please donate if you can!!,"From the outside the building is very impressive. And on the inside it is even more so! We booked online tickets for 10am and headed straight to the dinosaurs. We explored the museum for 3 hours and could have much easily stayed longer but my youngest didn’t want to stop and actually read anything, he just wanted to flit around and quickly look at each exhibit. Yes it was busy but not over crowded - we were still able to see everything we wanted at our own pace. The museum relies on donations so in theory, the more people they let in per day, the more donations they will receive. So I’m happy it was busy, it would be more worrying if it was not! If you’re concerned about covid then wear a face mask and pack your own sanitiser. All staff members wore masks and were very helpful and hands on when approached. Excellent free day out but please donate if you can!"
"Written January 10, 2020",You'll need more than one day,"We visited on a weekday to avoid the crowds and were very pleased we did. Even early on a Monday it was filling up quickly so we went straight into the Dino section as that was our must-see. It was amazing! So much so we almost missed our train home.Definitely allow a very long day, or two, if you want to make the most of this incredible museum."
"Written December 14, 2022",Well-organized and varied exhibits,"This was such a wonderful museum! I really enjoyed the organization of the exhibits and it was free (!!) It was so wild to be able to visit such a great museum for free. They do have an area to tap your credit card to donate, which I recommend so that this museum can be around forever. We were fortunate to be visiting the museum when they had dippy (the dinosaur) on display. There was so much information on the history of dinosaurs and all the fossils were amazing. I was also really impressed with their gem and mineral exhibit. It was so incredibly well organized and the display was set up well."
"Written April 21, 2022","Massive museum, full of so many amazing things!","Amazing museum full of so much to see that we came twice during our trip to London! While the museum is free, you have to book a time slot online. Despite this, the museum was extremely busy when we went and it's hard to see everything in less than 2 hours with that many people. The dinosaur exhibit constantly had a  line, and most other exhibits took awhile to get through. Definitely plan to spend a few hours here if you want to see everything, or go early in the morning!"
"Written August 26, 2021",Prebook tickets,"Museum has some excellent displays and areas. However I didnt enjoy my visit as much as i have done in the past. As its free you cant really complain, but its lacking something.It was busyBring your own anti bac as most of the stations were emptyLots of kids running around screaming unsupervisedThe dinosaur exhibit is very popular, and is therefore crowded. I found it very dark.We paid for the fantastic beasts exhibit which was good but expensive for the additional cost.Minerals gallery was impressivePrebook tickets 2 weeks in advance ."
"Written April 26, 2022",Greta but during the Easter Holidays,"We booked to visit (which you can actually do on arrival if you have a smart phone, rather than prior to arriving) so sailed thought into the museum to be met with a HUGE queue which we joined thinking it was for entry to the museum. After snaking up and down and up and down and up and down, we found the queue wasn’t for entry to the museum but for the dinosaur gallery! It was very crowded and hot in there and it didn’t seem to have the walkway open so you could see the skeletons which was disappointing. There was a couple of areas in the museum where the exhibits had been removed for restoration which was disappointing.We will be back but not during the school holidays"
"Written December 3, 2021",Overall amazing!,"Overall a really amazing experience. Spent 4 hours here! Definitely takes longer than you think and we didn’t even get to see all of it.The food in the Kitchen area was okay. While I was able to have some chicken, cabbage and wedges in the end, staff had very poor knowledge of catering for gluten free and there were very slim pickings. The food itself was ok - chicken was quite dry but not bad at all for £12.Unfortunately huge parts of the exhibits were missing sometimes, each room had multiple areas with signs about the exhibits being removed or under renovation. And in areas the lighting / interactive parts didn’t work or were out of order. However that didn’t sour our experience much at all and we had an amazing overall experience."
"Written February 26, 2020",So glad it was raining,"Hadn't intended to visit but as the weather was so wet, like a lot of people, we needed inside entertainment. So glad we opted for the NHM. Spent a few hours wandering around a beautiful interesting and informative museum. Well laid out into sections so you can miss out bits or double back and do some bits twice. Our granddaughter was fascinated but not overwhelmed as able to take on board all the info. It was half term so very busy but they did stagger entry so didn't feel too crowded. Cafes served lovely food and cakes. Shop was huge and reasonably priced and some great little souvenirs for kids. All in all a great few hours. "
"Written February 28, 2023","Great day out for all the family, rain or shine. Expect it to be busy & pre book book tickets","I came here on Saturday, alone, to explore the museum. It is such a great collective of scientific work catering to all ages - it really is great for children and adults alike & explores a range of different topics (ie: animals, dinosaurs, earthquakes, human body, solar system) to cater to all interests. My only disappointments with my visit was that I hadn’t realised there was the wildlife photographer of the year exhibition taking place which was prebookable and so I could not enter as hadn’t bought the ticket. Something I will definitely check and attend in future. I would offer four pieces of advice.1. Book online ahead of your visit. It is still a free ticket when purchased online (with an option donation option) but you’re guaranteed a speedy entrance and bypass the crowds to enter. The queues were massive when I arrived but I walked straight in. 2. Expect it to be very busy. This museum is great and well known, it’s also linked to Sir David Attenborough. It’s a great activity for all the family and kills a good few hours, rain or shine. Therefore it’s always going to busy. Expect that and give yourself plenty of time.3. Do not expect everyone to be courteous. I found this quite frustrating during my visit, but many times people would just walk in front of plaques/signs you’re reading, stand in front of you, push in front of queues, and aren’t polite. I actually saw a group of teenage girls push past a group of people giving way to an elderly man with mobility issues and a walking stick on some stairs to the point where he was almost knocked over. It’s very frustrating but if you’re prepared for it, hopefully it won’t spoil your day.  4. And finally, expect to rack up lots of steps exploring all the exhibits so wear comfortable shoes!"
"Written March 27, 2023",Huge museum; book in advance,"There is so much to see in the Natural History Museum! We spent several hours there and only saw a fraction of the exhibits. It was a Saturday morning and there were a lot of families as well as visitors from all over the world but there is room for everyone to see something they will like. We found the fossilised sea creatures particularly fascinating, perhaps because we did not previously know much about them.The displays are well presented and explanations are clear and easy to read. One tip we were given and would like to share: book tickets online in advance. Entry as free if you book in advance or at the entrance to the museum but if you reserve beforehand you will not have to queue up to get in, and the queues can be very long."
"Written October 1, 2020","Loved it, whale’s pretty cool",The museum was pretty awesome. However my friends hyped up that there was a big T. rex when it’s actually now a blue whale skeleton- still very cool. However not quite reliving night at the museum to it’s full extent 
"Written February 12, 2020",Natural History Museum  ,Nestled across the street from the Victoria and Albert Museum is another marvellous piece of architecture dating back to our ancestors. The Natural History Museum is a wonderful place to take children. As you walk through the skyscraper doors into the entrance way it is a feast for the photographic lens and if your lucky a display of a dinosaur or something that is magical and unbelievable will meet you upon your arrival. I Highly recommend this place when visiting London. Give yourself at least a minimum of 5 hours to visit if not a whole day. Oh and get there early before the crowds 
"Written January 19, 2020","Illustration, education amid grandeur","My wife and I along with my daughter's family with four kids visited this place on a dank, rainy Sunday.  Although busy, this cavernous facility swallows any crowd.  Many, many of the displays are simply stunning.  The architecture of the building is as well.  Kudos to the curators for imparting such a wide variety of knowledge to children and adults alike."
"Written January 5, 2020",Wild life photographer of the year,"As always an excellent portfolio of photographs from around the world. Especially stunning underwater photographs. Terrific pictures of penguins. Some of the photographers went to great personal hardship to achieve excellent images, putting up with extreme conditions in freezing temperatures for days on end to achieve their objective - a stunningly different take on animal behaviour."
"Written October 4, 2022",Go online and book in advance,"The museum has a lot to offer for both adults and kids of all ages. There's a fair share of reading in English involved, so be prepared for that if you're with kids. There's typically a longish queue in front of the building, but if you have made your reservation online - you just walk right past it and show it to the people at the enterance."
"Written January 4, 2020",Visit the T-Rex,"This place is phenomenal. You can see galleries of all kinds of taxidermy animals and insects. They have amazing exhibits on minerals and metals as well. But the dinosaur exhibits are my kids' absolute favorite, especially the animatronic t-rex that roars and stamps it's feet. Such an amazing exhibit and worth the crowds to enjoy."
"Written June 28, 2022",A must for family days in London,"Great museum for kids and adult alike. Displays are always being refreshed and updated, great hands on displays for kids. Restaurant is a little pricey but there’s are a couple of cafes onsite that offer more reasonable food and drinks. I still thinks it’s amazing that museums like this in London offer free entry. Arrive early to avoid the queues."
"Written July 31, 2022",Great Exhibits!,"We visited the Natural History Museum whilst on holiday in London. I'm not overly into museums, however I was impressed with my visit to this place.The first thing to note is this place is full to bursting with exhibits, which is always good to see! There are dinosaurs on display in the main hall, which makes for a good photography opportunity! The exhibits themselves are well kept, detailed and informative.The NHM is also set in beautiful grounds, which makes it aesthetically pleasing, and the interior is just as well kept. Even the loos wouldn't look out of place in a fancy department store! There are also a fair few benches if you need a seat for five minutes.I notice that some reviewers have remarked that this place is 'overcrowded'. Whilst I cannot comment on anyone's individual experience, and whilst I agree this place was busy, you were still able to look round it without people getting too in your way. It is a spacious and large museum at the end of the day, so it can handle large crowds pretty well.The only drawbacks were one of the exhibitions was closed and the gift shop was extortionate, with NHM keyrings costing £6, which is a plain rip off!Overall, I would recommend a visit to this museum if in London."
"Written October 24, 2021","Lots to learn, discover and explore","Haven't been here since I was a child, visited at 2:15 yesterday and also booked tickets for the 'Fantastic Beasts- Wizarding World' exhibition. The building is beautiful, just stunning. The museum is amazing, so much to look at, explore, read etc, I took my nephews (8 and 4) and they loved it too, lots of hands on areas for them to touch and explore. I liked the earthquake simulator, very interesting. The cafe we visited was spacious, clean but very expensive (£3 for a bottle of orange!). As the family are big Harry Potter fans I treated them to a visit to the 'Fantastic Beasts-Wizarding World exhibition, this area is great, with lots to explore, discover and learn about the films.  The only thing I will say is the museum does get very busy so didn't feel covid safe (I kept my mask on) and some of the hand sanitizing stations were empty."
"Written February 21, 2023",Fantastic museum,"Our family absolutely loved the time that we spent in the museum, looking at the dinosaur exhibits, mammals, sea creatures, creepy crawlies, and the volcanoes section. I feel that we only touched the surface, with so much more to see. The queues were quite lengthy to get in, having to wait about an hour, so timed entry booked online is the top tip; we will do that next time!"
"Written September 12, 2021",Pretty good.,"NHM is a staple of London Attractions, but it never seems to change, which means that having done my 3rd Visit in 9 years last month, I'm getting a little bored. If you're a first timer, do go, but for many, it is diminishing returns, I feel, because the exhibits never change. Cafe run by some surly Italians, for some reason. Not great, that bit. Allow up to 3 hours."
"Written November 4, 2022",Lacklustre for a London museum,"We visited, as a family, during the October half term and booked a time slot online. The website warned us that email confirmations may late but the staff accepted a screenshot of the booking and the queue moved quickly.The museum was quite crowded and difficult to move around but our biggest issue was that our ticket included a chance to see 'Dippy' as soon as we arrived. There was no signage and 'Dippy' wasn't located with the dinosaur exhibits.In a bit of panic we asked a member of staff for directions. The staff member was really helpful, providing directions and explaining that no one was really bothered about tickets for 'Dippy' or select times once inside the museum.We did find the 'Dippy' exhibit but is was just the Diplodocus skeleton, in a room, lit by colour changing lights. We couldn't see any information or facts.Many of the other exhibits were missing. My stepson loves animals but all of his favourites - seals, bears, lions, wolves were all missing.Of the exhibits and artefacts that remained, many of them were showing signs of age or damage. There was a good layer of dust on anything that wasn't in a glass case.The only areas that seemed to be well looked after were the numerous gift shops. Each area had it's own gift shop. We thought we would pick up something to remind us of 'Dippy' but despite making it a key attraction they had sold out of most of the souvenir paraphernalia. I think honestly, the best part of the museum was the staircase and glass roof made famous once again the Paddington movie."
"Written August 25, 2022","Too hot, too crowded!","Unfortunately, we would echo the recent reviews. This is a fantastic museum but at no point did we feel like engaging with any of the exhibits as the crowds and the heat were unbearable. I would suggest a ticketing system for school holidays to enable the experience to be remotely enjoyable. Weirdly, we were encouraged to book for the museum and Dippy but at no point were our tickets checked 🤷‍♂️On a positive note, a shout out to Captain Charlotte who ran a BRILLIANT ocean dive show which had our two girls captivated. It was creative, informative and a lot of fun. Well done and I hope you get to read this!"
"Written March 3, 2020",Still so much to see,"Hadn't been here for quite a while. Liked the more up to date style of presentation in some areas but then others look really dated. So much to see and take in, always happy to make a donation and would have liked to visit the wildlife photography exhibition but that seemed rather costly. Hard to know when best to visit, but i would guess out of term time in the middle of the week"
"Written June 23, 2020",Natural History Museum,"A very interesting and informative museum, where you will definitely not be bored !!! Interactive boards are everywhere: you can listen to the sounds made by insects, feel something by touch, play with something. If you get tired, then there is a cafe where it is fashionable to eat and relax! Great museum! A very impressive building, similar to a palace. Amazing sizes. You can put your own various experiments. There is a moving model of the Tyrannosaurus Rex and other monsters. This exposition is organized in an interesting way - first you go through the gallery and look at the dinosaurs' skeletons, as it were, from above, and then you go downstairs and examine various details.A few hours are enough to get a general idea. If you come to London with children of any age, then you should visit such a museum, in addition to what is interesting, also informative."
"Written June 29, 2022","A Dippy Whale of a time, needs 4 hrs for half the museum","What an experience for a family with children not yet addicted to hand held devices. And FREE, wow. For the 10am slot you queue to get in and the side (rather than corner) entrance does get you into the building sooner. Great if you have a 10am slot to see Dippy (the nations favourite large dinosaur bones) you can get straight there for your appointment. It is best to get in there early to avoid crowds and queues. We had 2 hours and barely touched the surface. Maybe do 10-12, have your packed lunch in the wildlife garden and do 1-3. We stupidly booked the Science museum for 2.5hrs after Natural History entrance. I would definitely recommend doing that the next day in the morning and spend the afternoons doing the fun things of London. The nearest tube station was South Kensington and the walk through the subway was 10mins. Amazing acoustics so baba and I sang Frozen songs on the way in and out. There was a table with dinosaur bones you could touch and two staff members interacting with the kids. It was a great way to draw the child in and very good. The main hall architecture was divine, beautifully carved animals everywhere and the tiles on the floor were stunning. The enormous whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling was so impressive and interesting. A must see!There were benches in wildflower garden which make perfect restful recharge spots for lunch when seeking shade and if too busy in the garden the amphitheatre like seating just at the entrance to the garden would be lovely for sitting in the sun Where you see tap signs on the map you can refill water bottles as the water fountains are closed for covid."
"Written April 23, 2022",Out of Hours Dinotour,"My daughter and I opted for an out of hours Dinotour, and I’m very glad we did! The tour lasted an hour and was delivered by Mason, who was a great guide! He was very knowledgeable, passionate and inspiring. He answered our questions and provided fascinating facts about the dinosaurs on display at the museum. I highly recommend this tour and best of all, it is conducted before opening, so no crowds, you have the museum to yourselves! Loved it!"
"Written February 2, 2022",Worth a visit if you’ve not been before,"Well worth a visit if you’ve not been before. I visited 6 years ago then again more recently, not much has changed in that time. My other half spent hours in the mineral room looking and cabinets full of rocks, I lost interest about halfway through. I suffer from osteoarthritis in my knees and struggled with stairs, also I noticed a shortage of benches and places to rest. The Dinosaur exhibit is always very poplar but it’s hard to look at anything for long because you end being swept away by the throngs of visitors. This area was very narrow in places and claustrophobic. The restaurant offers lunch boxes and hot drinks, it’s really expensive for what it is (maybe be acceptable in London but came as shock to me)."
"Written September 23, 2021",Fantastic,"I have visited this museum before and I am very impressed with its management and organisation.  This is a fantastic place to visit and with free admission it has got to be one of London’s most impressive attractions.  Its architecture is exceptionally beautiful.  The interactive learning experiences for children are very accessible but much is to be learnt from all of the display areas.  Facilities are excellent and the restaurant and cafes offer good value for money, cater for food intolerances and offer a healthy range of food.  I shall definitely return again and again."
"Written May 8, 2020",Great time,"I have been to museums all around the world and yes, of course, this is by far one of the best museums in the world. It is also one of the most comprehensive museums I have been to. This is a must see. We went there 3 days in a row just because we kept getting there late during the day and wanted to see everything b/c it was so niceThere is just too many people"
"Written April 18, 2022",A MUST SEE for adults and children alike,"The most outstanding natural history museum to see. We didnt event get to any of the paid temporary exhibitions and we spend hours (and could have spend many more) at  the museum. Vast and interactive, with an exciting dinosaur section and a huge minerals and stones section.Do come early as there are queues and despite the free entrance, do consider donating to the museum which is crucial to its sustainability. "
"Written October 9, 2020",Impressive building with the wow enrance hall,"The building itself is worth a visit, purpose built and with lots of fascinating details like the climbing monkeys around the columns. Signs explain why the tatty, faded exhibits have not been replaced due to the delicate balance of preservation and curiosity.  However some are so bad they really should be removed even if not replaced. The dinosaurs are impressive, and without the high numbers being allowed in it is easy to walk around and read the information available. And it’s FREE, amazing, the online booking was simple and we walked straight in at our allocated time ."
"Written November 4, 2021","Fantastic day, here from 10am-3pm","Visited during October half term with my son, I had Booked tickets for 10am and when we got there the queue was SO LONG but thankfully because we had already booked we where directed to a shorter line around the side. Tickets scanned, quick bag check and we where in. Boy what an amazing place, we spent hours here looking at everything. Stopped in the cafe mid day for a quick drink. Then carried on exploring the museum. My son was in awe at hope and the earthquake simulator. Early afternoon we took a break to visit the gardens where my son did the trail that was on looking for clues attached to trees, I took a break and sat on the bench and just took in the fresh air and quiet away from the hustle and bustle (I have anxiety and crowds often get the better of me, please note my son is 12 and was within the gardens with me at ALL times, he also had his phone on him) the trail wasn’t long but was just what he needed to burn of some pent up energy and to enjoy some fresh air and safe open spaceBack into the museum where the queue for the dinosaurs was finally shorter so we got into the queue and visited the dinos which are amazing. Then up to see the birds and the giant sequoia and then we left at around 3.30 after a visit to the gift shop and another crushed penny for my sons collection."
"Written August 18, 2020",A Good Welcome Back to Museums,"To be frank I rarely write reviews of anything in London since I live here and keep my reviews for my travels, However, in this peculiar year my travels are restricted to London so it seems reasonable to write reviews. I regularly visit the NHM for special exhibitions but here was an opportunity to visit the permanent galleries now finally reopened. You cannot do it all in one go so we visited the birds, the earth galleries upstairs and (of course) the dinosaurs. Book on-line. Enter on-time. Straightforward. Not a place for a specific route except amongst the dinosaurs. Busy there and with lots of children. Lots of hand sanitizer. Cafe open."
"Written May 22, 2022",So so,"Visited with 2 children age 6 and 9. Kids liked the exhibits they saw, but it was really far too busy for any of us to see much at all and it really took away from the magic of the experience of visiting this iconic museum. We had booked timed entry tickets in advance, but no one was paying much attention at all to tickets as we went in and many of the areas were far too busy. Kids were looking forward to seeing the dinosaur area but were really disappointed by the conveyer belt feel to it that prevented them stopping to look as they went through. Less popular areas needed some TLC and the volcanoes and earthquakes section was so hot it felt like you were at a volcanoe. Fabulous that you the museum is accessible to all and free but i think that there are better museums in London that are all free to visit and handle visitor flow much better. We went to visit the british museum the next day and both children commented that they enjoyed it much more than the natural history museum due to it being less crowded. We won't be planning on visiting the natural history museum again."
"Written August 29, 2021",Great exhibits but bring your own sanitiser!,"The museum itself is lovely; the building is magnificent and the displays are some of the best I’ve seen. It’s easy to spend a whole day in here. However, visiting during COVID wasn’t as enjoyable as it has been in the past. I’m not sure the museum itself is responsible for all of this, but I do think more could have been done to make the museum feel safer. This was one of the few places we visited in London where most people weren’t wearing masks, and it was busy. At times, it felt uncomfortable. Most of the sanitiser stations were empty, meaning people weren’t sanitising as much as they should. Lots of children were running wild and seemed unsupervised, which was a shame. I’d still visit here again as I love the museum and the exhibits, but I hope they do more to encourage COVID-safe behaviour."
"Written October 28, 2022",Disappointing setup,"We took a day trip to the museum yesterday, and had booked tickets in advance for a specific timeslot. Initially we were pleased thinking that timed entry would mean a controlled number of visitors in a popular attraction. We couldn’t have been more wrong. First off we arrived early expecting to queue to get in and were waved in before our slot, and were met with instant chaos. There were people everywhere, literally all spaces taken up with people. From what I could see of them, the exhibits are well maintained and interesting, but you cannot get near most of them! At points we were stuck at a standstill with no way forward or back, with no evidence of staff around to control the crowds. We had booked to see Dippy with out ticket, something that is an ‘extra’ but the staff member on the door was waving people in shouting “I am not looking at tickets just go in”. We had planned a few hours for the museum but we left as soon as the crowd would let us as it was deeply unpleasant, uncomfortable and I suspect unsafe. There were families and groups sitting on the floor in front of display cases to have a drink/snack causing people to trip and veer into others, also meaning you could not view some exhibits. Again there were no staff around to stop this selfishness."
"Written June 11, 2021",Needs air conditioning and better cafe,"The dinosaur part is particularly good as is the Earthquake/Volcano area.The rest is pretty much as I remember it as a kid which is fine.It was ridiculously hot in there. Didn’t appear they have air con or if they do it certainly wasn’t working. Pretty uncomfortable walking around in the heat, especially when we are required to wear masks (which I’m not against)The restaurant is a disgrace. The sandwiches were dry - barely buttered - and overpriced, the coffee although made barista style certainly didn’t taste it plus no Coke Zero? What place doesn’t sell the 3 Coke flavours? Far, far too expensive and the range of food very limited."
"Written September 23, 2021",Always a great day out.,Visited to particularly see the Amazing Beasts exhibition as my kids are big Harry Potter fans.   Really well presented and held their interest for ages.  The museum itself is always great and recommend just to get ahead of the queues and access to the Anning Rooms.
"Written January 2, 2020",Photography exhibition,"Fantastic. I really think everyone should visit this exhibition. It’s really beautiful and really important. Go early as it gets a bit busy in there and there’s not enough room between the photographs so you need a quiet spot to see and read everything. It’s really brilliant though and worth the jostle. The photographers are amazing, and I’m always blown away by the finalists. So good."
"Written September 18, 2020",Birthday - Day trip,"Architecture of the building is amazing,  we were both really looking forward to the visit,  prebooked timed ticket entry, staff very friendly and helpful, hand sanitiser points frequently positioned.Downside which resulted in us leaving earlier than we had planned,  too many mums with pre school children who seem to use it as a crèche,  some displays were very crowded as staff were just letting people in without checking space, and there was no social distancing in places.  Felt unsafe in the dinosaur and whale sections,  staff should have ensured appropriate numbers entered. Children running everywhere and too young to have or maintain any interest in the displays.  Such a shame as love this museum but won’t be back anytime soon!"
"Written October 28, 2023",A good day out but pre-book!,"We brought the children here during the summer holidays, so it was naturally very busy, with all the usual tourist traffic in addition to families.  Firstly, I need to point out that you cannot just walk up and go inside (which is how I remembered it). After fighting our way through London traffic and people, we were shocked to find two lines to enter the museum; people who had ""pre-booked"" and people who hadn't. So even though you don't need to actually pay to enter, you will want to pre-book a timeslot to avoid having to queue outside, for over an hour, in the pouring rain, just to get in.... What made it worse, was that when we finally made it to the end of the queue, we were seemingly just waved through without any checks at all.To top it off, once we entered the building, we were met by a sinister looking gauntlet of card machines that we needed to run in order to actually make it into the entrance lobby. With the huge number of machines creating a bottleneck of people trying to get in, it felt like we were almost climbing over the machines just to get past. It was flanked by several members of staff who were also encouraging us to donate. I get they need income, but after queueing outside for an hour just to get in, it felt a bit dirty.This was my first time here since the removal of Dippy. I remembered it being a place packed with wonder and all manner of historical artifacts and on that score it did not disappoint. Needless to say, it was extremely busy, so expect the usual at these types of events; queues to use the toilet, people pushing and shoving, long queues to order food and then no tables to sit at. For us it was an exhausting day.We did pay for an extra set of photos with the children with the dinosaurs in the back ground (green screen type setup). It cost us £20 for a full set of three physical photos, keyring and fridge magnet, as well as digital access to all photos. We considered this pretty good value.So overall, it is an excellent source of information and education about the natural history of our world, for adults and kids alike. Definitely plan to spend the entire day here as it's a large museum and you will likely spend the day packed into the middle of a large herd very slowly moving through the museum."
"Written April 7, 2023",Trip,"Went in the morning we got there earlier than anticipated but we were still allowed in before hand so that was good. There was a big line for those who didn’t already book so definitely make sure to book before hand. It’s super close to the underground station so that’s handy and there’s a lot of museums close together so you can’t really get bored. There’s somewhere that will take your bags and coats if you pay, however it does cost £ so if you won’t want to pay make sure your bag is light. In some areas it does get packed but overall because of the size it isn’t too bad. The food is really good for the price and was very quick considering how busy it was. Found it really nice that there was people who worked there going through some extra information and even had fossils we were able to hold. If you want to do it all in one day you definitely need to be there for opening as there just so much to see. They have a really nice gift shop that has Jurassic Park merchandise which were all reasonably priced. The toilets were cleaned. There is plenty of space for wheelchairs when going around as well that was good."
"Written January 5, 2020",Spectacular tour of the NHM!,"My daughter and I did a Private Guided Tour of the Natural History Museum. We really enjoyed the morning with our tour guide Craig. He showed us many of the museum's treasures and explained in detail why they were relevant. The crowds were massive that day (December 28), especially in the dinosaur area, so we greatly appreciated Craig guiding us from exhibit to exhibit. The museum is so beautiful and I look forward to seeing it again. I highly recommend this tour and Craig!"
"Written November 1, 2021",Wear Comfortable Shoes!,"Had a great couple of hours here & really enjoyed seeing the dinosaurs & mammals - everything was so cleverly presented & all seemed so real!The building itself is absolutely beautiful, inside & out - by far the prettiest of all the museums in London.Make sure you wear comfortable shoes as the building is huge & there are are lots of steps to negotiate! There were lots of people there when we visited, but then it was half term week. I was charged £3 just to hang up my coat in the cloakroom, so that was my donation as I thought that was an excessive charge."
"Written January 7, 2020",Beautiful building,"The best thing about it is the building itself.. An absolutely stunning piece of architecture. There is a surprising number of things to do as well as just look at stuffed animals, insects and dinosaur bones. There is a large interactive display about human senses which is very interesting and great for kids of all ages. A museum like this really should get 5 stars but I've knocked 1 off as it gets so busy.. I walked past it on January 3 and there was a 1 hour wait to get in. The day I went was not so bad but even so it was rammed. Try and go during term time, lots of schools do trips there but it is still quieter than the holidays."
"Written September 14, 2020",National Treasure ,"Booked on a Sunday for an 11am slot. Security and entrance was a breeze. Felt very safe, and didn’t feel busy due to the limited people allowed in the museum. The Charles Darwin Centre was great but disappointed that others didn’t seem to be visiting this part of the museum. Zones are very well sign posted and lost ourselves for 3 hrs looking at the different exhibits. Been here tons of times throughout the years and will continue further more "
"Written August 18, 2023",Disappointing visit to a probably great museum,"My family and I went to London for the first time and all of us were excited about one thing. Mine was this museum. I booked in advance and was puzzled to realize that the entrance was free. When we got there, there was a huge waiting line from where we were taken out immediately by a staff member as we had tickets. For us the entrance was fast and easy, however, the rest of the people on that line must have taken hours to get in.Once in, the first impression was spectacular and I got even more excited. Which, unfortunately, vanished quickly. The museum was so so crowded that it was impossible to see anything. The area where I was able to walk without being dragged by people was actually the gift shop. In my opinion, the purpose of a museum is for people to learn. Well, I learned nothing besides the fact that the building was very very hot. I don't understand the rationale for letting that many people get in. The museum shouldn't be another checkpoint in a tourist checklist and that was what it was. Since everything in London is paid ( even lounge chairs in a park) I don't understand why this museum would be free and dependent on people's donations. From a business perspective, I would say charge the entrance and control the number of visitors. For those who really want to visit despite facing this challenge, book ahead!!"
"Written July 16, 2020",I love this place,"I have been to the Natural History Museum countless times - taken as a child numerous times, taking my own children numerous times and this time just with my husband. I never tire of the place. So much to see and learn and done in a great way. The fact it is still a free museum is fabulous. Go go go"
"Written August 12, 2023",Wonderful museum but can get uncomfortable inside,"This is a wonderful museum. Many amazing exhibits and my young kids (aged 10 and 6) had a great time. I last went here many years ago before they had a booking system and it was absolutely jam packed then so was expecting it to be a bit less congested having to book tickets. This wasn’t the case, it was still absolutely packed in there and the glorious weather outside meant very uncomfortable conditions inside with no air conditioning in this historic building. We booked tickets for 4pm so an earlier morning time slot would probably be better. Despite the issues it’s still definitely worth visiting."
"Written August 7, 2022",Awesome place to visit,"My sister and I paid a visit to this awesome venue, it started off from when we got off the tube at South Kensington.  We followed the signs for ""Museums"" and was led into a very long underground walkway.  This is impressive I thought as it meant no waking or crossing busy roads.  This tunnel leads to many different attractions and you have to admire the Victorians for their insight in creating this safe and pleasant way to get to where you are going, this alone is a great feat of engineering.  About half way along we turned left at our exit which brings you up into the grounds of the museum.  Wow your breath is immediatley taken away by this very impressive and very large building in front of you.  The granduer and bearing of the venue is very very impressive and it is just a wonder to behold.  The building took seven years to build and you just can't help but think wow.  We entered the museum to a vastly large entrance hall with alcoves along both sides with exhibts in each one.  There are three floors to explore and several areas to eat and drink there is also an outdoor area to just chill and relax.  The exhibits are more than breathtaking and a wonder to behold, it is very hard to comprehend the enormosity of what you are veiwing and that this stuff was around millions of years ago and here you are lookinig at what was on Earth at that time.  The whole museum is very well laid out, very informative and some lovely staff whole are more than willing to either help or impart their knowledge.  The inside of the building is just as impressive as the outside with beautiful brickwork and stone carvings along with an impressive staricase.   I loved the way that in the enclosed cases of some of the artifacts they have been replecated and placed alongside so you can run your hands overthem giving you a sense and feel of the real thing.  There are loads of things for children to turn, pull, answer so they don't have  a chance of being bored.  Of course I must not forget to mention my visit to seeing Dippy, I stand infront of this massive creature and bow to it's magnificance and you immediatey think of the film Jurassic Park and remember their graceful gate as they slowly walk, a massive gentle giant.  I have visited many places in the past but this place imprints a very lasting memory of our world over the millions of years and of those intrepid explorers with their never dying thurst for knowledge and for preserving our past.  My thanks also go to the 300 scientists who are still working hard in the background at the museum still unlocking those awesome parts of our worlds history.  Thanks for a great day out and very impressive and humble five and a half hours of our visit.  P.S if you love expensive jewellery you must visit ""The Vault"" wow these baubles are very impressive."
"Written February 18, 2020",Wonderful free day out!,"Really enjoyed my time in this huge free museum.You could spend all day here alone or with your other half / family.It's amazing with all the things on display from T-rex, Wales and many other things such as diamonds and more! If you are in the area there are another 2 museums next to this the area is a 5 minute walk away from a huge park."
"Written February 19, 2020",Great exhibits but so busy/hot,"Albeit it is half term week so I expected the busy aspect but oh my goodness it was so hot inside, sweltering nearly fainting hot. We targeted the dinosaurs which were a great crowd pleaser with the kids and started on the mamals but had to abort as all the cafes were packed and we were all too hot. I recommend an early morning start we went after lunch. Still one of my favourite museums though!"
"Written July 5, 2023",Great for kids - Titanosaur exhibition ,"We visited the Natural History Museum in July 2023 with ours kids aged 7 and 11. Our kids love dinosaurs, so we paid to enter the Titanosaur exhibition. The Museum is a beautiful old building which is impressive in its own right. The day we visited was pretty packed but that's to be expected at this time of the year. We were a little short of time so had to rush through most of the exhibits. We spent more time in the Titanosaur exhibition which was great and the kids loved it. It's quite interactive which keeps the kids engaged. Overall we would recommend the NHM, especially if you / your kids like dinosaurs 🦕!"
"Written July 22, 2023","Nice museum, shame about the cake?","Sadly I would have given this more stars had it not been for the fact it was utterly heaving with school trips, several at the same time, surely a better suggestion would be to limit one school trip per day so that the general public can enjoy it too, not all of us are kid friendly and would genuinely like to enjoy the museum without shouting/screaming kids shoving past me and acting out. The other thing I was a bit shocked at, was the prices in the café! My partner and I were all set to enjoy a coffee and cake until we saw the price of the cake! Having already spent a ton in the gift shop, I was reluctant to spend £7 on a small slice of cake. We can afford it, but think of the families with several kids, who are on a budget - just two kids having a slice is nearly £15 for cake, that's not even with a drink. We also chose not to visit the new exhibition of the Titanosaur after again seeing the price, for my partner and I to both go in, it would be over £30! for something we would probably spend ten mins in and apparently was more for kids anyway, which btw also cost £9 each..I know the museum itself is free, but this doesn't mean, crank up everything else, everyone should get to learn about animals and life and be able to get a piece of cake without breaking the bank."
"Written August 30, 2020",Less crowded during Covid,"Ok so perhaps the museum isn’t quite as great during Covid. Some attractions are closed and not all the interactive exhibits are available. However, when you weigh this up with no crowds, timed entry, no queues etc I prefer this way of viewing the museum! Last time I came I had to leave it was so busy, so prefer it with restricted numbers. We visited on a Saturday at 2pm and felt like we were the only ones there at times! Felt really safe too. Kids loved it, which is the main thing. Can’t wait to return!"
"Written June 11, 2022","A fun, educational and interesting place to visit","Such a great day out, the fact this place is free entry baffles me, I’d recommend donating if you can to keep places like this open for all to enjoy.Obviously it was extremely busy, but not to the point where it was uncomfortable to move. It was well managed.The place has something for everyone. It has really detailed information for people who it interests if you look for it, but also lots of fun activities and exhibits to interest the younger audience.The cafe was a little expensive but let’s not forget you are in the middle of London.The place was overall extremely clean and filled with friendly staff to guide you and answer any questions you may have.I definitely recommend a visit and also to take your time and learn something new."
"Written June 13, 2021",My Favourite Museum,"I love this place. I hadn't been for years so when we visited London with some friends we kept one morning free to revisit. It was an absolute joy. The staff are great, every room of this massive museum is stuffed full of great exhibits and superbly presented information and it's free to get in. Amazing. My best experience of 2021 so far. I cannot wait to come back soon."
"Written March 19, 2020",A Must to Visit!,"From the beautiful renovations to the outside of the building to the carefully laid out exhibits the museum makes for a great day out. While we were there there were a number of school parties on a day trip to the museum. They were just mesmerised by the scope of the natural world. Cannot do it justice in one day, there is just too much to see so be selective about where you visit. It has the added advantage that it is free.l"
"Written January 5, 2020",very good and educational,It's free to visit but a donation should be made to help with running costs. So much to see you could spend a full day in there.Big que to get In but well worth the wait in my opinion
"Written November 8, 2022",Amazing place for children and family!,"Simply stunning architecture sets the stage for one of the best museums in the world.I was very pleased to see that Dippy was back in pride of place and I enjoyed the exhibit on earthquakes and volcanoes.I recommend you, it is better to go in the morning when it opens or else there will be many children in the dinosaur exhibition.A great day. 👍🏻"
"Written January 19, 2020",Was in awe of the beauty and magnificence of this museum.,"A visit I’ve wanted to make for many years, and was not disappointed. Got to the museum mid morning on a Saturday and walked straight in, but was busy with families excited to see the dinosaurs. Loads to see and very informative and fascinating. Spent several hours wandering around, when we came out about 1.30-2 there was a long queue to enter, stressful if you’ve children, so get in early."
"Written November 25, 2021",Quite disappointing really,"I don't really know what I was expecting, having not been to the NHM since I was a child, but the experience left me somewhat underwhelmed. Yes it's free, I get that, but the experience wasn't what I expected. We are a family of 4 of us (2 adults, 2 kids aged 6 and 9). One of the main issues was just how busy it was. It was absolutely heaving, to the point where I felt uncomfortable, espcecially with the potential to catch coronavirus as so many people weren't wearing masks. This together with the fact it was so hot inside (due to only having fans and no air con), made it a very uncomfortable experience. We were all glad to exit to get some fresh air by the end. One of the issues I have is that despite booking a time slot, it was very obvious that they let anyone in at any time and didn't even look at the booked time. This is why it is so busy. Absolutely pointless booking a time slot! The exhibits were OK, although the map was a bit confusing and didn't explain what was where in each room, so we ended up going up and down the stairs frequently to find specific things.  "
"Written November 15, 2021",Festive ice skating visit,"Have visited the museum a number to times over the years but this was the first time we'd been for ice skating. We'd booked online so had a slot, all very organised, a little bit of queuing but moved quickly. It was pretty busy but it was 5pm on a Saturday so to be expected. I looks beautiful as night falls with the building lit, fairy lights everywhere and a Christmas tree in the centre of the rink. The ice was in good conditions, the little ones can hire the penguins (£6 extra charge). Plenty of staff on the ice to help. There's a carousel, stalls with sweets and a cafe for hot drinks etc. You get 50 mins skating time which is plenty. It's worth a visit as I think this will be the last year the NHM will have a rink."
"Written January 7, 2020",Visit it for sure!,I visited the museum with my two kids and adore it. The exhibitions inside are amazing especially the dinosaur and zoo area. The blue whale skeleton is amazing and also like that they have a lot of dinosaur skeleton hanging from ceiling. Visit it especially with kids they have a lot to learn. The entrance is free and that's why the museum is too crown from the very morning but if you' re patience you gonna see everything. There is also a shop in the museum and another one close to dinosaur section especially for kids who love dinos!
"Written August 23, 2020",Average. Not as good during COVID,"We came on a flying visit to London and have never managed to brave the queues, so COVID advanced bookings seemed like a great time to book.Booking was free, easy and we arrived in advance as requested to hardly any queues. I couldn't fault the accessibility of hygiene and hand sanitizer.A lot of the exhibits which were interactive were closed, and to ensure social distancing, any exhibits which can't offer a one-way system were also closed off, which included some of the aerial dinosaur walks which get you closer to the skeletons. This was a shame.It was enjoyable, but we hsipped through really quickly and didn't really pause for long at the exhibits. We live in Cardiff and we're surprised that the National Museum there had better exhibits.Good for a quick visit, hard to fault when it's free, but not as engaging as we had hoped and an hour and. A half was plenty for a wonder round. Wouldn't want to come here during COVID with young children who are not of reading age.Good for: a quick visit, adultsBad for: kids, kids who like interactivity, dinosaur fans. "
"Written October 31, 2021",Not what it used to be,"When I visited this museum as a child and then with our children the exhibits were accessible and could be clearly seen and understood.  How disappointing to find returning with grandchildren that  most of the museum is in almost in  total darkness and that exhibits are remote , often hanging from the ceiling rather than at eye level  and with  information boards  often too small and detailed  to be read at a distance.  The mobile  T-Rex mock up was really the only stimulating item for young children.  This museum, has become too crowded, too adult and only really suitable for students, I do not recommend  a visit if you are accompanied by children as it  does not   have  a suitable level of prestation for  them.Too much razzmatazz and not enough thought for  the simple needs of young children. "
"Written November 8, 2023",What a place! Beautiful building and superb exhibits,"We visited NHM during the recent October half term having pre booked tickets (absolutely essential if visiting during school holidays) and we were greeted with an enormous queue of people who didn't have pre booked tickets arranged. Huge tip right there!!The museum as all within London is free of charge with donations welcome, maps, children's guides and adult guides all available upon entry. If you are visiting for the first time I'd definitely recommend at least a map (£1) as this place is vast, very easy to get lost or miss sections if you aren't careful. Our kids both wanted to see the dinosaurs and we really weren't disappointed with the recreations and rebuilt skeletons giving true perspective to the size that these creatures actually grew to. So much to see and do. We were here for around 3 hours and realised afterwards that we'd missed an enormous eection"
"Written July 4, 2023",Overrated,"They made us queue in the rain for 30 mins even though there appeared to plenty of room inside at the time.  They could at least provide covered waiting areas if queuing is the norm.  Inside the days of it being a natural history museum are long gone.  It’s now a children’s playground with space once displaying amazing real specimens occupied by shops selling stuffed toys and tat.  The exhibits are extremely tired looking and haven’t changed for decades.   The dinosaur exhibit contains few actual exhibits and is mostly poor quality and poorly lit reconstructions.    Extremely crowded later in the day with school groups sat around on stairs blocking everybody and staff not caring.  Food was a total rip-off, don’t even think of purchasing without taking out a mortgage.  The only great thing about this place is the stunning building.    This place was built to house the great natural history collections, it has utterly failed in this task and is now sadly little more than a theme park.  RIP NHM."
"Written August 26, 2022",Free but busy attraction,"It’s great that they still have free entry, but a lot of exhibits need free booking. We went to see the dinosaur Dippy, but there weren’t any tickets left. Would recommend going in the morning as it gets very busy during the school holidays. There was a nice picnic area in the garden and the children’s food boxes at the cafe were priced at £6. It’s easily reachable by tube and a short walk away from Hyde Park."
"Written January 2, 2020",Amazing museum and free,"The museum is very good. It offers great experiences and it becomes very easy to explain to children earthquakes or dinosaurs. Museum has coffees and restaurants. The queue was long but it doesn't take to much time to enter. And with this quality, we then find the price is excellent: the museum is free!!"
"Written February 25, 2020",Beautiful free museum in a stunning building!,"Love the Natural History Museum! I would avoid going here on a weekend though as it can get incredible busy and could face a bit of a queue. I recommend going into the science museum as well which is actually connected. Nice day out for solo's, families friends, any occasion! As you can imagine being in the Kensington area of London the actual building itself is stunning so for any architecture people out there...! The big blue whale skeleton in the main hall is incredible!! Well worth a visit."
"Written March 6, 2022",Great visit with kids,We had a wonderful time at the museum over half term with a 6 and 8 year old. It wasn’t too busy (it was busy as it was half term but we could get around easily). The kids enjoyed reading about dinosaurs and then the other animals. I would say it’s suited to 4-10 year olds most but there’s plenty to distract younger kids. We brought our own lunch with us and sat near the canteen/coffee shop. There’s usually a queue outside when you have tickets (they are scanned) so bring an umbrella if it’s going to rain. Overall we had a lovely time and lots for little ones to see and learn. Highly recommend (especially as it’s free although we made a donation).
"Written October 27, 2022",Too commercil and too focused on Dinosaurs for my liking.,"went to the Natural History Museum last week and was I'm afraid, very disappointed. I had been before many years ago when I loved it but now, I feel it has become way too commercial and not very scientific or educational. After entering the museum, I had to walk past TWO people shouting in loud voices at visitors to donate £5 which I thought quite honestly was a disgrace. Yes, I appreciate that the place needs money but I would like to decide if I want to donate after I have seen it and if I had enjoyed the experience which sadly, I didn't!At the back of the main hall is a very uninspiring cafe and the display halls are also dull and uninspiring. I really get fed with the ridiculous focus on Dinosaurs which again is so commercial it is untrue! Yes, they were amazing creatures and yes, the kids love them but apart from them and a few stuffed birds and some mineral displays the rest of the fossil world seems to be ignored. I walked around trying to find trilobites, corals, crinoids, ammonites, etc but only found a few of these fossilised creatures even though to me they are far more interesting than dinosaurs although admittedly, not quite so in your face. The only thing I liked about the visit was the beautiful and amazing building (the Victorians were simply astounding) and the example of Archeopteryx which was fantastic to see."
"Written July 22, 2022",Frequent visitor,"I am really happy to see Dippy, the first Diplodocus, arrive back on centre stage.It has always amazed me when I enter only to be greeted by the magnificent creature that lived all those millions of years so.The museum is surrounded by dinosaurs in literally every section you walk into. From reptilian to mammalian era as the stages of evolution passes. I would highly recommend parents to take there children here to learn and give credit to living animals all those years ago. For those less interested in fossils, the museum holds a dedicated section for insects. If you are lucky enough, there is a special zone for fossilised creatures which have been kept in a unique saline to preserve them. I have seen the giant squid that got uncovered several years ago. I would however, like to try out the new option to stay overnight and experience things coming to life. The package offers groups or individuals to essentially stay overnight and enjoy the works in complete silence. "
"Written October 28, 2021",Half term visit,"Booked well in advance for October half term but could only book 4pm so had less than 2 hours  in the museum . It was very busy at 4pm around the dinosaur bit which I would say was the most interesting for younger children.Overall a good visit but the kids did get a bit bored, lots of reading and looking at things, not interactive enough for children. The earthquake was good in the shop though! Kids loved that!I think we were rushed and didn’t get the full experience. We will return and book more than 8 weeks in advance to get a better time slot!"
"Written August 3, 2021",JUST DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!!,"My wife and I visited last week as the country was starting to come out of lockdown,we had secured tickets and booked weeks before so we thought that the museum would be quiet as they were only allowing in bookingsHow wrong was I ,it was jam packed, we went to see the dinosuar exhibition which was narrow and in a  one way system,there was so many people in this small area ,banging into us,trying to get past us and the flow of people was such that if you slowed down to read or look at the exhibit someone would walk into you . Most people I believe ,like us were attempting to get out of this rat race and were jostling and bulldozing their way through.We never saw anything in this exhibition and decided it was far too busy.Had there been no pandemic and social distancing I would still been intimidated and bullied into leaving.I would suggest limiting the amount of people entering this section, we are patient enough to wait or perhaps be directed to something less busy ( I can not tell you if such a section exsists here as we immediately left)The nearest subway station was closed and we spent longer walking from the nearest open station to the museum than we did inside it.we spent longer waiting in the queue outside the museum than we did inside it.(did all these people have a booking at the same time as us ??)I would not recommend this ""attraction"""
"Written January 18, 2020",You need a whole day here,This is our 3rd trip with the kids in the last few years and but each time we only spent 4 hours there. You need a full day.You can get caught up in the Dinosaur and Mammal exhibitions but these should be done at the start of the or the end of the day when it’s quieter.I still haven’t explored the Darwin section of the museum which is the most recently built section.The robotic T-Rex is not accessible at the moment and this is a good feature for the kids. The queues to get in can be be big midday but these take around 20 minutes usually.
"Written July 28, 2020","Great during school, awful during holidays","I love this museum and have been going here periodically since a child. It's a really fun day out however...Do not, under ANY circumstance go during school holidays. It goes from being 5 star to 1 star. It becomes horribly overcrowded and you will spend hours queuing, starting outside just to get in. You will not be able to move about freely and are just shuffling along inside a mass of people.This may actually be one thing that coronavirus improves."
"Written May 17, 2020",Great Museum to wander.,"The Natural History Museum in London is a great place to visit, for any age. There are wonderful displays of huge skeletons of dinosaurs and huge sea life plus models of a number of extinct creatures like the Dodo. As well as the permanent displays in various galleries there are always special exhibitions and on our last visit, we loved seeing the display of wildlife photographers – great photographs. Entrance to the Museum itself if free but one may need to pay for entry to the individual exhibits. There is a very good on-site shop not only for souvenirs but great books, DVDs and other resource materials. There is an onsite café which, frankly, was a huge disappointment, you’d be best to eat out in our experience. You need to allow around two hours at least to sample the delights of the Museum, longer if you visit one of the exhibitions."
"Written February 28, 2020",Outstanding wonderful museum ,"This stunning building is well worth a visit, with so much on offer to view there is something for everyone to enjoy!My favourite part was the 78 stone monkeys carved into the arches of the ceiling. The disabled access was brilliant through out, lifts to upper floors (3 floors in total) We came from Manchester and it’s nothing like we have currently in a way of a museum! My husband, 7 year old son and 9 month old daughter, so we had a buggy. went on a week day and it was still busy but we didn’t feel it was over crowded.It’s free to enter, (donation is asked) we bought the £5 child booklet they had on offer with everything to keep your kids entertained while exploring the museum! And we made a donation for the Map for a keep sake. The dinosaur exhibit is by far outstanding! It was brilliant!! It’s by far a MUST SEE!The public toilets were good and clean and baby change also had a private curtained room for breast feeding. The cafe was in a lovely room to the left for the entrance, the staff was brilliant and very helpful! The lady who served my husband and son was so lovely making them a hot chocolate with marshmallows and costs were reasonable. Plenty of seating and tables also.They also have large shops we went into the dinosaur souvenir shop and had fun looking at the items.And the large museum shop which we couldn’t resist picking up a few souvenirs for us and the kids. Again the staff were very friendly and we would defiantly plan a visit again!  "
"Written March 1, 2020",The history of the planet ,This i a must visit especially if you are visiting London not very often. You will probably need day to discover the hidden natural treasures of this museum but i would strongly recommend to spend a whole day for the first visit. In most areas its free of charge entrance. Highly recommend. 
"Written January 31, 2020",Not Enjoyable,"Visited on Saturday 25th but this was not an enjoyable visit far too crowded and no control over queues,especially bad in the dinosaur rooms instead off allowing so many in at the time, half way through a worker was shouting for everyone to keep moving meaning you could not stop to view any thing, the amount of people made it very unsafe. Was glad to leave. Maybe they should think about a charge for entry."
"Written January 1, 2020",New Years Day visit,"After visiting London numerous times we decided that we had to visit this museum on our recent trip & I’m glad we did.We got in early (not long after they opened at 10am) & I would advise you do this to miss the massive crowds that line up outside in the cold.There are many rooms to visit & the big ticket items (dinosaurs) are on the ground floor, but make sure you make your way upstairs to the other rooms/exhibits. This museum is free which makes it even better, especially when you are trying to escape the cold! "
"Written January 4, 2020",Dated museum,People often rave about this museum but it tends to leave me a little cold.  The displays are very dated and the layout of the museum leaves you feeling it is cluttered.  Disappointed that the Wildlife Photography exhibition was so expensive (and not free).  
"Written January 1, 2020",Interesting day out.,"It's rare to find something cheap to do in London with kids, how about free! It's free entrance to the museum however, some exhibitions may have a fee. Loads to see and do around the museum.  Plenty of eating places. You can take your own lunch and have it in the picnic area."
"Written January 6, 2020",Natural History Museum winter fun,"We visited the Natural History Museum after seeing the Victoria & Albert Museum across the street. There was over 1+ hour wait to go ice skating at their rink located on the side of the building. Despite the wait, the crowds gathering were in a festive holiday mood and the atmosphere was great! After ice skating, we went inside the museum and saw the oceans and space collections, among other things. The addition of the ice skating rink made this museum worth visiting - not sure I'd return again any other time of the year."
"Written July 5, 2021",Fatntastic Beasts Superb - Rest not so much,"We came to see the Fantastic Beasts exhibition and it was absolutely amazing, so well done in the way that they wove the Harry Potter films with the natural world. The room setting was lit atmospherically and the range of displays was varied and captivating.Really worth a visit, we also managed to see some of the dinosaur exhibits while we were here.That's the positives..now for the negatives:The amount of people walking around either without masks or with them around their chins was absolutely astounding, even though it's still mandatory inside buildings etc.No clear signage to get to the exhibition.Weren't able to use the cafeteria earlier than our tickets, no real loss in the end as we ate elsewhere and I'm pretty certain the food we had would have been better than at the museum."
"Written August 21, 2021",Fun free morning ,"Spent a morning here with 2 teens who are very interested in natural history. Currently they are asking people to book ticketed time slots, which are free. All these were booked up for the weekend we were in London, but we heard they have a limited number of walk in spaces each day so arrived just before opening, joined a short queue and quickly gained admission. Some really interesting exhibitions within a lovely old building. We spent a good couple of hours looking round. A number of the hands on activities however were rather dated and several were in need of repair. We used one of the museum cafes for lunch and did find this rather overpriced."
"Written August 13, 2022",Get there early in peak season fantastic day out & free!,As you walk up to the building it’s just amazing and as you walk in your immediately hit with history and the exhibitions. A fantastic day out for all with so much to see. It gets very busy in the holidays as you’d think it would but take your time as you’ll miss some beautiful exhibits. The cafe is extremely expensive though and not worth the money (sorry NHM) £3 for a small juice is just wrong! so definitely take your own drinks/food if you’re not willing to spend a fortune on refreshments
"Written January 14, 2023","Interesting Visit, but very busy","Amazing museum, a great range of interesting & details exhibits and items on display, with some truly amazing items. Too much for one day so have done over multiple trips, doing a 'zone' each time. Museum is extremely busy, recommend booking an entry slot to avoid waiting, but inside it is very crowed & noisy in places making it difficult to see the exhibits. Museum is clean & well maintained, good facilities & helpful staff."
"Written December 21, 2022",excellent,"What a fantastic museum - the collection is amazing, the layout engaging and the building is very well kept. The museum is free but I booked online to avoid queuing as I wanted to see Dippy before it went on tour again. Enjoyed seeing the T-rex with his Xmas jumper and Santa hatplan ahead for holiday seasons as the museum does get quite busy"
"Written November 30, 2021",kids and adults will love this place,"if you are with kids, defintely a place you want to bring them to. The centre piece is the blue whale which i took many photos with it. you need to pre booked the free ticket and only pay if you wish to visit the special exhibition.I do like their different collection of their gem stones, dinosaurs. really enjoyed my visit there."
"Written March 17, 2020",Perfect for family ,I took my daughter here a few times now. So much to see and much time is needed however one thing I will say is over the years the dinosaur exhibition keeps getting smaller which is upsetting as its the best part of the museum. I remember days where I used to walk around for ages seeing all the wonders of the dinosaur world. But unfortunately it's been reduce to a mear information point. It's upsetting but regardless the whole museum as a whole is amazing. Highly recommend a visit. 
"Written January 9, 2020",Creepy crawlers and Lon leggety beasties,"We all know there are bones, insects, animals and ruddy great dinosaur in this museum, so I can’t shed any light on what you should see - that’s entirely your choice. What I would say is take time to savour the stunning architecture beginning with the external of the building. The elaborate brickwork, colour and massive scale is truly beautiful. Oh but when you get inside, just take a minute, draw breath and look up and the great hall. Salute Charles Darwin and enjoy the tour."
"Written January 5, 2020",A must do.,"One of the best indoor experiences London has to offer, you could easily spend a whole afternoon here. The architecture of the building is mind blowing and the exhibitions a different and interactive, good attraction for kids. Very impressive, best thing about it is that it's free to enter. Donations welcome! "
"Written June 17, 2022",Really nice day out,This is a really nice day trip for families and people visitong Lonfon. The entry is free but you can pay for some of the exhibits online. There is a lot to see and there are some interacrive parts for the kids. The museum is seperated into different sections. There are baby changing facilities and a few different bathrooms around. There is also a really nice cafe and a massive giftshop with a variety of thongs to choose from from soft toys to childrens toys and figures and stationary. 
"Written September 15, 2021","Must do the Treasures Museum , many miss this !!","I have been here many times here and can’t believe I haven’t been up the stairs at the back of the great hall to visit “The Treasures” which are the Museums greatest collections. Such as the first ever recovered fossil in the world that led to the discovery of the Dinosaurs and a Penguin egg that was one of three to survive being brought back by Captains Scott’s mission in the Antarctic. There is also a QR code that you can go to , to get an audio guide for more information on each exhibit. Just phenomenal."
"Written January 19, 2020",Even better than expected,"We were very excited to visit the Natural History Museum of London. First of all, the building itself is gorgeous and a piece of art. The inside is also stunning, especially that blue whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling. We were very impressed with the exhibitions - the mammals, the dinosaurs, the different birds, the stones and other minerals. There are so many things to see, we spent about 2 hours there."
"Written April 18, 2023",Like Ikea with rocks in.,"This place is like a massive ikea but with rocks in it.  The queue to get in was ridiculously long but I had pre booked so that was ok, pleased I didn’t have to stand in the queue.  Inside was just so crowded and hard to navigate and see all the exhibits.  The way finding signage inside was terrible as trying to find the toilets was a challenge in itself.  In the end I just got too hot and irritated by the crowds that we had to leave. Sad to see that the special exhibit that is in the news had to be booked and paid for to be able to see, it was fully booked the day we went.  Will not return."
"Written July 7, 2021",Lovely museum,"Pre booked our tickets (which I think they should keep by the way!) and walked right in. No one checked our bags even though the people in front of us were being checked. Managed to look at all the exhibits which we enjoyed. Even though social distancing was there (signs on the floors and walls etc) barely anyone was adhering to it. We had brought sandwiches with us and went to the dining hall to eat them and it was closed! Both the website and the map said it was open so was a bit put out having to eat outside. Good job it was dry and not too bad as there was only 3 benches. Glad we came, my child had a great time and that’s what matters"
"Written July 26, 2022",Great place (avoid hot days),"Amazing museum, but take our advice and avoid visiting on a hot day in summer during the holidays. Just so stuffy and overcrowded. Booked a time slot but no one seemed bothered about that and the dinosaur section becomes overwhelmingly crowded."
"Written February 12, 2020",A great place to see history,My kids love going to the museum and seeing actual remains of historic creatures.  As they are homeschooled we see this as an educational experience for them and have become members.  This provides discounts and access to the peaceful Anning rooms when you need a break.
"Written February 15, 2020",Cool visit,"We visited Natural History Museum on 14.2.2020. I must say that average time spent there is 2,5h. Well we stayed for 4 and still skipped some places. I am so happy we went. Time well spent! In cafe behind Hintze Hall were delicious desserts and in shop in geology section you can get various types of stones as tiger's eye, amethyst etc."
"Written March 10, 2020",The Photo Exbition was a special experience,"Our visit to the Natural History Museum was concentrated on the nature photos exhibition. The pictures of different creatures was fascinating, wether marine life, mamals, environment, small and large creatures. One could envisage the pacience in which the photographers approached their subjects resulting in an extraordinary good quality."
"Written April 8, 2022",Terrible dinosaur exhibition,"Parts of the museum are great - the section on earthquakes is really good, and the mammals and creepy crawlie rooms are really well done. But the dinosaur exhibition is awful. The fossils, models, and info are great but it's crammed into what feels like a tiny space with very narrow walkways. Staff make it clear that they don't want you hanging around to actually read any of the information about what it is you're straining to see through the darkness, and it's so unpleasantly claustrophobic that you don't really want to hang around anyway. Honestly, it's so terribly done for what should be the NHM's crown jewel, and what 90% its visitors will be visiting to see. Huge skeletons tower above the walkway but it's so tightly packed in that there's no chance of appreciating it, and the T Rex skull is stuck up on some shelf in the ceiling. Really can't get over quite how badly the exhibit has been put together. Our autistic child had no chance, completely inaccessible to him and the environment was overwhelming in a bad way. NHM should be able to do better than this"
"Written January 24, 2023","Must see London stop, and it's free!","I suppose reviewing the Natural History Museum is dangerous,  as it's always difficult to review iconic places. However, I'm just putting this here to say do it! It's worth setting aside at least half a day of your London trip to walk the iconic halls of this slightly updated Victorian Museum. With everything from dinosaurs to human ancestors,  stuffed birds, mammals, insect displays, rocks, minerals, and we'll, I couldn't list the thousands of exhibits and enlightening information.  It's like walking into a time capsule, and there aren't that many museums like this left in the world. Kids love it, as do adults and in the age of selfies, opportunities abound. There are also lots of eating opportunities as well as several excellent gift shops. The wildlife photographer of the year exhibition was on while I was there, and it's worth the add-on. By the way, there is no charge to enter, but being kind and giving a donation is the right thing to do. Docents wear purple and are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. For transparency,  I don't work there but things I've discovered are on display....A must see."
"Written August 21, 2022","Disappointing, hot and far too busy","Some amazing exhibits but sadly you don't really get to see them as you shuffle around as part of the long hot packed queue of people. Incredibly hot to the point of feeling sick, the number of people there very much ruins the experience. Not what it used to be due to too many people and a begging notice for donations every step of your visit. I was prepared to make a donation but was put off from doing so as I felt pressured into it rather than it being a choice. I would rather they charged an entrance fee and got rid of the begging - is just too much"
"Written August 15, 2021",Grandiose,"If you love natural history museums this is the Vatican of natural history, the building alone is an exhibit of exquisite craftsmanship and an honor to all living things. All its exhibits old and new are a treasure. A must see if you are in London."
"Written January 16, 2020",lovely big dinosaur skeletons,I really like the natural history museum they've got some terrific stuffed animals there and its really good for engaging with kids while also not being totally obvious to adults. all clear and informative. the big blue whale is also a highlight.
"Written February 10, 2020",Loads to see!!!,"A must do if your in London. This place is massive with loads to see,we went at lunch time after already doing plenty of walking around London in the morning and that was a mistake!! I recommend getting there in the morning fully energised because there’s a lot to get around also it gets warm in there so t-shirt is a must. All the displays are excellent to look at and also the the building itself is pretty special to look at aswell. Facilities are very good with plenty of toilets and seating."
"Written October 10, 2021",Keeping up with the times,"On entering, you are met with an amazing escalator taking you up into the bowels of ... well,...  there are volcanoes, magma, earthquakes, And then the rest of the museum. So much to take in but laid out in an amazing fashion so it all makes sense and is so interesting. Such an enhancement from my last visit, too many years back!"
"Written February 10, 2020",Brilliant day out,"Amazingly helpful and friendly staff.Great exhibitions. I went with my husband and my 3 year old son and we all thought the exhibitions were informative and interactive. My son loved the earthquake and volcano area in the red zone best. The architecture itself is breathtaking. The different zones are well signposted and the museum us easy to navigate.The only area that was busy was the dinosaur exhibition, the other areas were not crowded at a all.The food in the central cafe was rather expensive but to be expected. The food was good quality and again the staff were very helpful. The nature garden is lovely, even in winterWe ended up staying in the museum for nearly five hours and enjoyed every minute of it.My only con is the heating.  Some areas seemed quite cold, others far too warm and stuffy .Overall this is a fantastic place to visit and I would definitely recommend."
"Written January 14, 2022","Busy, hot, overcrowded in places","Maybe things always look better when you’re young but I wasn’t overly impressed.  My seven year old grandson however loved it.  I wouldn’t recommend visiting with younger children - his four and a half year old sister wasn’t interested at all.  Definitely worth booking your entry time slot as we went straight in.  Dippy is currently on display again but I don’t think he’s displayed in the best place.Very, very busy.  Too many people just taking “look at where I am” photos.  But that’s the scourge of all tourist attractions.DO NOT BUY FOOD OR DRINKS IN ANY OF THE CAFÉS.  The prices are extortionate and the quality very poor.  A child’s portion of dried up fish gluons and handful of stale chips cost nearly £7.00.  There are picnic areas so if you can bear it, bring your own food and drink."
"Written November 3, 2022",Do not go at weekend,Very interesting place with many treasures but trying to study or contemplate the exhibits is nigh on impossible when surrounded by children with parents trying to noisily explain the relevance of the items. Yes I too had children and appreciate the problems. All I suggest if you are not going with a young family do visit out of holiday times and weekends. By the way the cost of food here is considerable for second rate items. Our something and cranberry sandwich had a tiny pink stain which I guess was meant to be the cranberry content.
"Written December 29, 2021",Highly recommended ,If you have children this is a place to go. The exposition is very well organized and divided among subjects. The dinosaur part is very captivating and the vault is mesmerizing. The museum is free but make donations I am sure they will be very well used!!!
"Written January 22, 2020",A must do thing in London,"We really liked our visit here.  I would strongly recommend booking your FREE tickets in advance as you can skip the queue to the desk which was very welcome.  It was very busy and hot on the day that we were there and in parts it felt uncomfortably full.  This is not really the fault of the NHM as they can only control numbers entering and not where people go.  We did cut our visit short because of the crowds but again that is not a criticism, it was our choice.  It was a little chaotic getting a cup of tea in one of the restaurants but again this would not stop me returning.  The building alone is worth the trip!! It is spectacular so even if you didn't like any of the exhibits you could not help but marvel in the architecture and the atmosphere.  The great hall, the marble, the staircases, the ceilings etc are magnificent.  I have been a few times and I will visit again as it just marvels me.  The actual exhibits are just as impressive but do give yourself a good few hours to visit.  Exit tube at South Kensington and you are right beside the building.  Should be on everyones list of things to do in London - I still cant believe that it is free!!!"
"Written July 25, 2022",My favourite ,"This place is my favourite museum in London. I visit this place each time I visit london. Love their exhibits of extinct animals, fossils, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, marine lives etc. There are Sections for planetary system, geology, volcanoes etc. All in all I love this place. I would say for anyone with kids over the age of 7-8 years will enjoy this place. Kids will enjoy the exhibits of animals, the skeletons of whale, dinosaurs etc. There is a life size T. rex which is moves and makes noises. Kids love this. Very educational place for both adults and kids. I would always recommend this place. "
"Written January 1, 2020",24 years and still one of my favourite places.,Simply nothing too much to be said. I've been coming here all my life and it never fails to fascinate me. Sometimes I go alone just to take in the pure awe of all their exhibits. I would recommend coming here to anyone (entry is free!). It's a lovely way to spend your day and the food is reasonably priced and very decent for museum food!
"Written August 12, 2021",The place to visit in London,"Doesn't matter what age you are, you'll love it here. It's a surreal experience seeing dinosaurs skeletons tower over you, asteroids and star dust in glass cabinets dating billions of years ago and extinct wildlife exhibits. There's  information plaques dotted around so you can take a leisurely stroll at your own pace with seats dotted around.There is a cafe but its very busy, you will also need tickets in advance (free). "
"Written August 4, 2022","Interesting and interactive museum, extremely hot inside on hot days, drink lots!! ","We went here for the first time as a family. There is lots to see and do. Really interesting interactive aspects. We all enjoyed the dinosaurs and whales areas. The downsides were how hot it was, esp in some rooms.  Clearly August is a hot month but with the understandable crowds and the heat we didn't stay as long as we would have liked. Getting there as doors open is a top tip. We will come back another time as we did enjoy it. "
"Written August 6, 2023",Great visit! Strongly recommend visiting!,"My family and I recently visited the Natural History Museum whilst enjoying 2 days in London. This was the highlight of our trip, especially to see the Titanosaur exhibition.Some of the reviews of this FREE museum are very far fetched. This is a great visit with your family in London and you could spend hours here!I agree with most reviews that you should pre-book your tickets to skip the queue. There were staff on entry requesting a donation but in no way did I nor my family feel under any pressure to donate.It was the summer holidays when we visited, so we naturally expected it to be busy and it was. If you want a quieter experience I recommend not visiting during summer. Despite the amount of people, I was able to take photos without other people in front, and never felt like a sardine (similar to rush hour on the Tube)There are a wide range of animals, dinosaurs and other fossils to enjoy at the museum and the gift shop is extensive! All the staff are friendly and helpful.  Did I mention this museum is FREE?I would definately recommend visiting the Natural History Museum when you are in London."
"Written August 7, 2022","Stay overnight at the natural history museum, Dinosnores!","Having been gifted the Dinosnores evening, I was slightly apprehensive as to how this would play out but we were pleasantly surprised! This is is so worth doing if you have you get children, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to sleep in the great Hintze Hall under the blue whale and explore the dinosaurs by torchlight. It’s slightly chaotic but in an organised chaos kinda way. Once the lights go out at bedtime, it’s silent! Probably because kids (and adults) alike have been worn out by the activities and excitement of being in the museum after hours. I would recommend the following…we expected it to be cold (being an old museum and huge spacious hall)…it was anything but. Prepare to be warm, maybe stick a pair of shorts and a t shirt in to change into come sleep time. Even for when walking about it’s pretty toasty. But I can’t vouch for how this would be come colder months. Take a good snack…when snack time comes, we took crackers, biscuits, sachets of hot choc…being that the snack was scheduled for 8.30-9pm but being active and busy inside the museum throws you out and my young son was starving, bedtime snacks could’ve easily been a sandwich or small picnic! And drinks…there are water filling stations but if you need a juice or Diet Coke, bring it for snack time for a boost. Don’t overpack, we were more than well equipped with a sleeping bag each, snack, reusable water bottles and inflatable pillows. If you can, do it, it’s absolutely the unique experience you’ll want to do before the kids grow up!"
"Written January 10, 2020",Excellent and informative attraction,"The Natural History Museum was located close to transport links and easy to get to and from using the underground. The museum is large, spacious and informative. The items on display are interesting and would return to visit again. "
"Written October 27, 2021",Great museum. Lovely staff,"Where else would you see huge dinosaur skeletons, travel into the centre of the earth, experience an earthquake and come face to face with glittering priceless gems. And all for free too! The staff here on a busy day were exceptionally kind and enthusiastic. They made the visit even better. It’s a great place and we’re so lucky to have free museums like this.Top tip. Have a breather half way through your visit, There are loads of eateries and cafes nearby without the queue inside including Pizza Express. You can go back again then without any hassle and you’ll feel more refreshed for part 2!"
"Written May 30, 2022",Kids Everywhere,"We only had about an hour to get through here and since my husband is a huge dinosaur fan we made that a priority. Guess who else looks loves dinosaurs? Kids of course! Luckily he's a big man so he walks in front of me and basically moves everyone, including kids, out of the way. The exhibit was informative but it was sad that all the skeleton displays were at least 6 feet in the air or completely surrounded by glass so as to keep people from touching/climbing on to them. Wish this wasn't the case but everything that wasn't protected was being touched/climbed on. I think that they would do really well with an ""adults only day"" every once in a while. "
"Written July 31, 2021",Not for adults or children,"Boring boring boring. I could say as an adult it was better for children but l am sure a lot of children couldn't see, couldn't understand the buttons or understand the comments.  I did a lot of people watching and the majority of children - of all ages, looked bored stiff. Not allowed in certain entrances as ""ticket"" only - who knew unless you went online. So queued up and just got in. If you wanted to you could pay to see two different exhibitions but with the prices, l cannot see how families can afford it. Not again thank you"
"Written June 1, 2022",Disappointed - Avoid when busy.,"Booked tickets in advance yet they weren’t checked upon entry instead we had a member of staff shouting about making donations to the museum. Popular dinosaur exhibit is now a mess with top half now closed and everyone forced through the ground floor section (which had parts closed off). Too many people, no control whatsoever. A couple of areas in the exhibit saw some large and potentially concerning bottlenecks with no where to exit. The museum’s other standard exhibits were very busy as per school holidays but, generally, it felt like there was no control from the museum and it was a free for all. A lot of the exhibits are great and interesting but I remember seeing them in years past.Left disappointed, felt like the glory days of the museum are very much in the past."
"Written December 30, 2022",Definitely worth a visit! Top tip- prebook FREE timed entry tickets a couple of days before.,"The building is absolutely stunning, absolutely 100% worth a visit for that alone! We booked free timed entry tickets  a week before going, which is good because they were turning people without tickets away on the day, as its was at full capacity, so I'd advise going online and getting free admission timed entry tickets. The collections inside were all great, and although it was extremely busy in there, we managed to see all the exhibitions with no trouble. We had initially thought it would just take a couple of hours, but honestly could spend half a day in there easily (with 11 and 13 year olds). We grabbed some sandwiches and coffees from one of the cafes, which were nice enough, there were also areas to eat picnics if you bring your own food. If you go to London, it's definitely worth a visit."
"Written June 3, 2022",Stunning building. So much to look at,"Hard to believe that places such as this are free to visit. How lucky we are. Can easily spend 3hrs plus in here, looking at various different exhibitions and artefacts. The ice skating in the winter is great too...although obviously not free. Easy to get to. Spacious"
"Written January 30, 2023","World class museum, brilliant for ALL ages","There are so many great museums in London, including the next door outstanding V&A Museum, and I'd recommend this for all ages.  Highly recommend spending a little bit of time in the South Kensington area as there are quite a few good restuarants nearby, and Knightsbridge / Harrods is just up the road, plus Hyde Park is a stones throw.  Loads of kids events, so worth checking their website."
"Written June 2, 2020",Astonishment view,"The paintings, the animal replicas and last but not least the design of the skeletons is amazing. You simply walk through rooms with huge ceilings and marvel at everything you can see around you. This museum is an oasis of happiness for the soul, which gives free rein to your imagination."
"Written February 24, 2022",Mixed emotions - could be better,"We pre-booked a time slot and managed to enter the gardens a bit earlier. Very very busy, staff managing entry in 15 minute time slots. Once inside it’s not so clear what is where, signage could be a bit clearer at the entrance. The dinosaur area was very popular so much so that you couldn’t read many of the displays.  Other exhibits were good, a massive display of stones and minerals, but no real wow factor anywhere. Queue management inside was poor, with an and exit route crossing the entry queue. Outside you had to go against the incoming visitors, bottleneck at the entry point. Could be better organised!"
"Written January 15, 2023",Overcrowded and uninspirational,"I have been fortunate to visit many museums in many countries over the years on many different subjects but unfortunately  this is the worst experience ever. I booked tickets in advance and arrived at the correct time.  There were literally hoards of visitors going through the doors at the same time and the main hall was just a mass of visitors wandering around aimlessly.  There were so many families with buggy’s making it more difficult to walk around.   The signage was dreadful showing blue zone, green zone etc but with no details as to what you would find there!  Unless you had a map or managed to find someone to ask you were clueless.  The exhibits were tired and the explanations next to them looked like they had never been updated.  The lighting surrounding the exhibits were awful.There were just too many visitors and I feel that after going through the pandemic and security in general this was not overly a safe environment to be in.This museum would be more suited for organised trips run by schools, colleges and societies."
"Written September 11, 2022",Very busy,"We visited in august during the warm weather. You can book online and is significantly easier to book online before attending. It’s free, so makes sense. The museeum is absolutely massive, to do the whole thing will easily take most of the day, we haven’t anticipated how large it was! The dinosaur section was the main thing we wanted to see, so focused our trip on that section. The museem was incredibly busy and make it really difficult to move round, if anything they were letting through too many people, you couldn’t really read an exhibit or do any of the activities within the exhibit because someone else was either breathing down your next or pushing you put the way. We left after maybe 2 hours, it was so hot in their, to the point it was unbearable. I would love to visit again but not when it’s warm and not when it’s so busy."
"Written August 14, 2021",Lots to see. Take a picnic. ,"There is so much to see here. Something to capture everyone’s interest and well worth a visit. The tickets are free. People were packed in so tightly that seeing things properly was made impossible. Our 9 year old lost interest quickly after getting fed up of having to fight through crowds at every turn. That was a real shame, as it meant he chose to cut our visit short and we didn’t see everything he had planned to see.  We are going to try a term time weekend in the winter instead. The restaurant was closed, so we visited the cafe. They only serve sandwiches, slices of tray bake cake and crisps - so the choice is poor.  The manager was there and seemed to be the most miserable person we came across all week bless her. "
"Written March 3, 2020",Dinosaurs and Treasures Gallery,Museum provides a sense of scale as to how big dinosaurs were as well the blue whale.  Treasurer galley has Darwin’s first edition book and about another dozen various historical items. All free and friendly guides that can answer your questions
"Written May 30, 2022",Disorganised and too many people which spoiled visit ,Undoubtedly an Impressive museum. However when we went was so busy that it was hard to appreciate the items. The dinosaur section was so busy with many school kids visiting at the time we went. Due to the amounts of people you couldn't really stop and appreciate items or understand the information on display. Also we had precooked tickets but no one was checking these on entry. Also we used a couple of the machines such as the souvenir coins one and this was not working after taking our money.
"Written July 6, 2023",Such an amazing experience,"This is the most amazing Museum I have ever had the chance of going to, you have to block out a whole day due it being so massive inside. The exhibits are out of this world, from a full size (almost complete) Stegosaurus Skeleton to one of the earliest examples of human burials to natural disaster, this place has it all. I found the dinosaur exhibit to be my personal favorite and would recommend anyone with children to come here as there are animatronic dinosaurs and creatures in a few sections of the museum which is really engaging for them. There are plenty of places to eat while inside and benches to sit throughout as It can get tiring walking round there for hours. Overall, I would come here again everyday if I could and would recommend to anyone wanting a fun and interesting day out."
"Written July 29, 2022",Beautiful building,"The museum building itself is absolutely beautiful. Our favourite part of our visit was having a picnic in the grounds!There is a lot to see in the museum so you could easily spend a day there. Just be prepared that it gets extremely busy and incredibly hot inside the building, so can be tricky to spend time properly reading and exploring each exhibit without being jostled out of the way.My one disappointment - which will sound very naive -  is that I never realised the vast majority of the exhibits are replicas. I was expecting real bones etc but everything is pretty much a replica or mould - even Dippy!"
"Written March 15, 2020",Dinosaurs,My three year old daughter is dinosaur crazy and she loved this museum- especially being able to see a ‘real’ T Rex. My older children enjoyed the quizzes and interactive displays. The museum is free with donations suggested. My kids love this place
"Written February 13, 2023",Disappointing,"I appreciate it’s the school holidays and I knew it would be busy -that’s why I booked tickets for a particular time slot. Proved to be a waste of time, no-one checked our tickets on entry. The place was heaving, and yet they will still letting loads of people in who hadn’t pre-booked their tickets. The dinosaur section was absolutely rammed, there was no effort to limit the numbers of people going in. Once you went in you had to go with the flow of people and you couldn’t actually stop to look at anything. In the end we decided to leave early as we couldn’t actually see anything"
"Written November 10, 2023",Nothing much seems to have changed in twenty years," Hadn't been for several years, but wanted to see the Titanosaurus Exhibit which we had paid £16 each to see. The reconstructed dinosaur was great but the rest of the exhibition was a bit spartan with a disitinct lack of CGI to really make the dinosaur come to life. Also nowhere to sit but if it gets really busy I suppose they want to keep the crowd moving. As for the rest of the museum well nothing mnuch has changed in over twenty years. It looked tired and jaded. The signage was poor, and the place dominated by shops  selling pretty much the same goods and definitely aimed at children. The lack of books aimed at adults was  a real disappointmnet especually as there are so many brilliant pre history books around now.The display  on human evolution was good as were the sea reptile fossils, but the main dinosaur display was underwhelming in a darkly lit room with poor signage again. The visiting school children passing through seemed totally disengaged. The museum needs to invest in technology to make these animals come to life.  We went to the Oxford Museum of Natural History and the Lapworth Geology Museum in Birmingham. With a much smaller budget these places wefre far more engaging and less crowded too."
"Written October 25, 2022",Similar experience to the tube at rush hour,"I couldn’t really review the quality of the museum or it’s exhibits as you simply cannot get near them due to how overcrowded this place is. We had tickets booked in advance, but you don’t need them as they’re never checked. I do wonder how they keep a track of the number of visitors inside. There’s very few staff about no doubt trying to avoid the crowds.You simply cannot get near anything for the crowds. Constantly been pushed and pulled in different directions if you try and stand for a second to view an exhibit. There is simply no point in a museum if you cannot get near anything. I think the tube at rush hour is less crowded."
"Written February 23, 2023",Overcrowded,Really disappointed with our visit. We were looking forward to visiting here and pre booked our time slot online as was recommended. When we turned up there seemed to be no reasoning behind the entrance system with no evidence of people leaving and ticket holders/none ticket holders being let in in large numbers. The contents of the museum are fantastic and the building special but we didn’t have a chance to enjoy this as there was no time to stop and read anything with so many people being there at the same time. If you stopped you were holding people up. This was particularly bad in the dinosaur area where everyone was packed in like sardines in a tin. You couldn’t stop and read and instead had to go with the movement of all the people around you (literally shoulder to shoulder). Felt like a massive health and safety issue with an accident waiting to happen. We ended up in the lower ground picnic area just to get a breather. We gave up on the volcano and earthquake zone as again it was just too busy.We expected it to be busy but there’s busy and then there’s just letting way too many people in. Our little girl ended up having a complete breakdown over it (after being bashed too many times) and just wanted to go out. What is the point of pre booking time slots if it’s not to control numbers?Overall a fantastic museum which is let down by being way too overcrowded.
"Written July 18, 2022","Still worth a visit, but... ","Disappointingly dumbed down.A wonderful building, housing a wide range of fascinating objects, but overall in my view there is an overly modern focus on digital displays, animatronic dinosaurs and dramatic framing and staging of certain exhibits.Plenty of beautiful and historically important items, such as the marine reptile specimens, are sidelined to corridors to make room for more ""exciting"" models. The dinosaur gallery has some wonderful items but again the focus is generally on screens and models rather than the items themselves and their importance.Still well worth a visit but in my opinion it is less impressive than it was in times past. Then again I'm 58 and perhaps its aimed more at enthusing youngsters than entertaining fogies.I had lunch in the very nice T Rex Cafe, which is staffed by lovely helpful people.Who cant cook.I had the Fish Finger Sandwich, reasoning that that would be hard to cock up. I was wrong.Several bits of inedible dry fish hidden in an enormous chewy ciabatta. The side of fries were nice, as was the accompanying pint of Helles.Also, one last grumble. The museum was absolutely overwhelmed by school groups as I got there at opening time on Friday. Introducing kids to such a great institution is of course a very good thing.But the fact remains that it was impossible for other visitors to enjoy their visit due to the sheer number of pesky kids. Surely a compromise can be found? School-only times, longer opening hours, taping the kids mouths shut?Anyway, still glad I went."
"Written July 24, 2023",Too many visitors allowed at the same time,Museum was over-crowded even on Monday. Either visitors do not respect the times on their prebooked tickets or the museum allows too many visitors at the same time. There is absolutely no possibility to relax and enjoy what this museum offers. I am glad there is no entry fee since it would have been a waste of money.
"Written August 26, 2022",Crowded disappointed,"Visited 23 August, 2022. Travelled from North Yorkshire. We pre booked tickets which was great because we didn’t queue to enter the museum BUT far too many people were in the building. First stop the dinosaurs, it was so cramped that I left the exhibition, my son and his children did stay but it wasn’t a pleasant experience being pushed along by the crowds, no time to read and explore. We had pre booked to see Dippy, but no one managing the number of people visiting so again squashed. In the end my husband and I waited outside while son and his children continued to try and explore. But gave up due to heat and crowds. So disappointing, like many other reviews I felt numbers should be limited to ensure safety and a positive experience, especially if you have booked. A brilliant building and museum we just couldn’t enjoy it on this visit."
"Written August 23, 2022",Lots of things to see,"We visited the museum in July, and as a number of people have already said, it was very crowded and hot. The crowds are to be expected. I was hoping that the temperature would be a little cooler, but it is summer after all.That being said, there was a lot to see in the museum. We saw Dippy the dinosaur of course. The gems/minerals/rocks room was immense and one of the most impressive I've ever seen. It was worth going just for that room. The dinosaurs and skeletons were also very impressive and must-sees."
"Written April 6, 2022",Free Admission and Dinosaur Exhibition is great!,"Visited with Family, free admission and the exhibitions were impressive!We came to see the dinosaur exhibition so fantastic experience for families.Only problem is people moving along the exhibitions, this got very congested with far too many people and no distancing. The lifts were not working as told by staff members to take an escalator, thats o.k but what about families especially mothers with children in prams who had to take the stairs?  What about wheelchair access? and anyone with vertigo?The museum was very overcrowded and when it came to choosing your pictures with a dinosaur. The computer didn't work, the museum worker tried her best but I decided we would leave it, you can view it on their website instead and choose which pics you want.A great museum to visit but they need to sort out the distancing just to give us a bit of space.Overall plenty to see and we saw Andy's clock! ( cbeebies)"
"Written May 15, 2022",Plan on two hours,"Wonderful place to take children, but also great for just adults.  The  exhibits were delightful and certainly go to the wildlife photographer of the year exhibit.  The museum was free, but you pay a fee for the photo exhibit."
"Written January 8, 2023",So so museum,This is a fun museum for animal lovers but if your not interested in animals I would not recommend this. The dinosaur section is quite fun but that’s the only thing that really interested me. After being there for 2 hours it got a bit boring because there is only stuffed animals and fossils. The blue whale is also quite impressive but again that’s basically it. If your a tourist you might want to pop in to have a look considering it’s free. There are definitely better museums in London.
"Written October 25, 2023",Wonderful museum,"There was so much to see here. We were visiting with two young children (6 and 4) so we limited ourselves to a few hours in the galleries they were most interested in but could easily have spent a day.Our kids are obsessed with dinosaurs and they were certainly not disappointed! The main dinosaur section is excellent and we also paid to see the Titanosaur special exhibit which was well worth it. The kids were also very excited to find the original grandfather clock from ‘Andy’s Dinosaur Adventures’ (a CBeebies show which features the museum as a backdrop) and the iconic facade and entrance hall are stunning themselves.We visited on the first Saturday in the autumn half-term holidays, so it was not unexpectedly very busy. This didn’t really spoil our enjoyment and the timed ticket system seemed to work well, but it would be better to pick a quieter time if you can."
"Written January 23, 2021",Exceeded Expectations.,"Having visited London a number of times, we always prioritised other places to visiting the Natural History Museum...what a mistake that was! We managed to fit it into our trip this time and couldn't understand why we hadn't been before. It was fantastic. Easy to navigate, informative and fun interactions for children. It's immense, so either give yourself plenty of time, or tackle sections over a few different days if need be,"
"Written February 1, 2020","Educational, and free entrance. ","The museum has many sections i. e. human anatomy, dinosaurs etc. Kids walked around half of a day. It's free of charge and very aducational. We did some generous dinayion though. "
"Written December 15, 2022",Brilliant experience,"Brilliant experience, so much to see. Our first visit at the weekend was a bit busy and had to queue for the dinosaurs, but other exhibits were fine but Monday at 10am was almost deserted. My Grandson’s face when he walked through the door and saw the whale says it all! The quality of the exhibits is very good and I think it would be possible to spend several days there without getting bored."
"Written August 1, 2023",Overcrowded and warm,"Came here in early-July 2023 ahead of the summer peak and school holiday season. Nice exhibits categorised by a number of colour zones. The main issue was overcrowding, heat and humidity; it felt like rush hour on the London Underground throughout much of our visit. The crowds got progressively worse during the day and we left by late-morning. Although we booked timed arrival tickets in advance, these were not checked upon entry to the museum which may explain the overcrowding inside the museum. Due to the volume of visitors, it was impossible to actually spend time reading some of the exhibit descriptions which was a shame. "
"Written September 19, 2021",Fantastic museum but needs some organisation!,Visited the Natural History Museum as it’s a place I’ve always wanted to explore and my last visit was very brief. I booked the ticket a month in advance.The museum exhibits and building are superb! Probably the finest building and museum collection in the world. The main negatives we’re how crowded it was. It wasn’t pleasant! I thought booking tickets in advance was because there was limited numbers allowed in but it was packed. I planned to stay all day but after 3 hours I’d had enough!
"Written August 25, 2023",Needs a bit of an update,"We paid the extra to see Titanosaur, and it was fair for what it was.We love the building and how even it is all centred around the natural history. Parts of the exhibitions are looking tired and could do with a bit of an update-they were the same 10 years ago when we were there-thankfully the children were much younger so didn't remember them too much.Our favourite bit was and always is the mammals section, they do need some tlc though.The TRex restaurant was good, the pizzas were farily reasonable, although the scant bowl of chips was slightly over priced for what we got.The biggest issue I had with it was the overcrowding. There were just too many people in the building, I understand it is a free day out and the more people you admit, the more chance someone will donate and it really doesn't cost much more to open for 1 person or 1000 people, but maybe charging a small fee might be better and then control the numbers admitted."
"Written March 14, 2022",Photography Exhibit ,Went to see the Wildlife Photography Exhbition. I usually love this exhibition but to be honest this time it didn't blow me away. It seemed like a much smaller exhibition without much to see. Not worth nearly £20. The Natural History Museum was heaving at 10am on a Sunday morning but well organised. 
"Written September 3, 2022",Very Crowded And A Little Disappointing,"The museum is easy to get to from the South Kensington tube station, but it is quite a long walk from the station exit.  You book tickets (free) online for a timed entry however I don't see the point of this as there was no control of people entering and it was massively over crowded, which really spoiled the experience.I was a little disappointed to learn that the larger exhibits are recreations from the remains discovered. Perhaps I should have known that but, for me, it spoiled it a bit.  The main dinosaurs are definitely impressive but once I'd seen those, I was pretty much done inside 30 minutes.  Did I mention that the flow of visitors was very poorly managed, resulting in massive overcrowding?  That really spoiled my visit."
"Written January 11, 2020",Exciting but crowded,"There was a q to get in and it moved rather slowly. This was despite the fact we had reached the museum half an hour before opening time. The exhibits were interesting especially the dinos.  However, the layout for the dinosaurs exhibits was not smart especially for such a popular exhibit. The crowds were forced to go through a maze like corridor and it was really crammed and disorderly. You could not enjoy the exhibits because you were forced to move with the crowd. It was much too narrow and rather claustrophobic.  Need to find a good time to re visit."
"Written August 18, 2023","Great museum, but obviously busy","I went with 7 friends between school and uni. The exhibitions were very good, but it’s a busy place, as you’d expect. One of our group was autistic it was useful to know that they provide ear defenders and sensory packs, with a booklet showing the quiet rooms around the museum. The dinosaur exhibit was great, but the one-way path through was difficult as there were many less interested tourists and children who didn’t want to read everything! The marine invertebrates room was fantastic, and I enjoyed the pliosaurs and plesiosaurs on display in the marine reptiles corridor. We also paid for the titanosaurs exhibit and really enjoyed the immersive elements, and I think this was the highlight of my day. The picnic area was quiet at around 11:30, which was a useful place for a break, and the booklet on quiet rooms in the sensory pack was helpful. We used the contemplation room. Staff were mostly helpful, although some were less patient when the autistic person was struggling to communicate. Generally, an enjoyable day and given it’s London, the business is expected"
"Written February 4, 2023",Pretty good - get there early,"The architecture is beautiful, worth seeing just for that.  The dinosaur area was good, but very dark, needed more light.  Good displays and map directions were good.  Get in early though, it can get very crowded and noisy, difficult to get around.  "
"Written September 16, 2023",Not happy !!!!,"We visited yesterday 15th sept with my daughter and granddaughters who were over from Australia. Had we had just walked around the museum I’d have given more stars but I’m pretty annoyed that we paid almost £60 to visit the Titanosaur exhibit after being told how amazing it was by a staff member, what a total waste of money !!!  I’m stunned that the museum can charge so much money for this, it’s mostly screens with poorly animated dinosaurs some of which didn’t work and 1 dinosaur skeleton totally shameful, my granddaughters said “this is rubbish” !!!! out the mouth of babes.. please do not fall for this very expensive mistake just enjoy the rest of the museum and save your money "
"Written January 23, 2020",Great indoor  activity option for London,"This building is amazing in and of itself-- so beautiful. This is a HUGE museum, and the displays are wonderful. There is a great variety and something for everyone. We had a rainy afternoon and ducked in here for a respite, and glad we did. There are also plenty of small  cafe's throughout the museum for chances to grab a bite or a drink. Perfect for families!"
"Written April 23, 2020",Awe-Inspiring Visit to a Grand Museum,"Amazing fossils, skeletons and preserved animals on display in the setting of a grand British building. Many extinct animals on display there including the Dodo bird, dinosaurs and several giant sea creatures. Admired the gigantic  skeleton of a Blue Whale that is suspended from the ceiling in the Hintze Hall. Highly recommended! Definitely something out of ""Night at the Museum"""
"Written February 27, 2022",Great family day out,"Absolutely fabulous day out. Went with my 4 year old who has an attention span of 3 seconds and he loved it. There is so much to see, we spent 4 hours there and still didn't see everything. The kids guide book for £5 is probably one of the best we've had - proper hard cover not these naff paper ones that don't last.Cafe was nice, bit expensive but aren't they all. Food was good quality though and even though it was heaving the tables were cleaned straight away and rubbish cleared. The staff inside were really friendly and engaging with us. It's easy to get from the tube and we'll signposted. My only complaint was the staff outside directly the entry queues did not have a clue! We were moved 3 times by staff telling us conflicting information. I have to pick up my son as there was not enough space near the tube entrance and people were getting squashed. This was met by the rudest woman I've ever encountered shouting at the lady Infront because she got pushed forward by the queue the staff had created! Not what you need with small children. However the rest of the staff were amazing and the place itself it brilliant. "
"Written May 9, 2023",Heaving,"First off, the artifacts are amazing. No disputing that at all. I could go into detail but my entire experience was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people that made it near impossible to enjoy. Some sections were just a 4 people wide queue, channelled through sections of the museum with no escape, no possibility to get closer to anything to view. Just jam packed. It was overall a disappointing experience and even my child felt uncomfortable so we just left early. I appreciate it is a free museum but why issue pre booked tickets just to overload the venue"
"Written August 8, 2021","give a donation, free venue","okay, I reviews the other museum and think I meant this one. lovely helpful staff and they take covid and safety of people and the ornaments serious! the only reason I gave 4* and not 5* is as there is a shop there with toys and things to buy (like a basic writing pad for £5!!! with?!) but for children and parents no where to eat or get a drink. so you are stuck in there and once you leave you leave.i understand they dont want people walking round with dirty/sticky fingers but it is a big drawback when you are there for an hour tired and with children. "
"Written October 2, 2020",Trip with the kids,"Really enjoyed our trip but lots of galleries closed due to COVID, no David A!!!  Was also a little disappointed we couldn't get too close to some of the dinosaurs, they are hung from the ceiling and you can see the original walkway above but obviously not in use due to COVID.  Hand Sanitiser all around.  Only cold food available in one canteen.  You can take a packed lunch/picnic as there is an outside area within the museum especially for this.  Went for 11am slot and this was not long enough so will definitely be returning.  "
"Written December 13, 2022",Wildlife Photographer of the Year - great exhibition,"Went in there to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition and can only recommend. Luckily I was in there first thing at 10h, so it was quite quiet and there weren't too many people in the exhibition. Afterwards I went to see also the permanent exhibition and didn't get disappointed - only a bit lost as it is huge and so many things to see. But there is always somebody from the staff around to help."
"Written August 27, 2022",Amazing museum suitable for all ages,"This museum is huge which I believe one would need to spend more than 3 hours to visit all exhibits. The exhibits are categorized into 4 different zones. I personally love the red zone which is more about geology and planets. Other zones exhibits about the evolution, history and characteristics of dinosaurs, animals, insects, etc. It also got galleries on different stones, materials, gems, etc. The exhibits are interactive and the museum uses various ways to display. It is interesting and educational. Kids surely find it fun and as an adult, I found the presentation is clear, well organized, comprehensive yet easy to digest. The museum itself resembles a traditional British college, kind of Harry Potter type. The bricks, the arches, the stairs, the grand hall, the windows, all combines to make a great piece of architecture.  Good for photo taking of course!"
"Written August 6, 2023","Amazing institution but much, much too hot ","Only a 20 minute queue to get in - far less than expected in the summer holidays (at lunchtime which might have been why).  Did find it very crowded inside which would have been manageable (again, summer holidays) but it was absolutely unbearably hot and airless.  There was absolutely no respite from the hot, sweaty crowded rooms. The few fans dotted around were crowded with people trying to get some cool air.  We left after 40 minutes, the children started to feel nauseous and there was nowhere to sit down and cool off for a minute,  every sittable surface had someone on it, the café was rammed and the loos (ladies) was a gruelling 15 min wait in a claustrophobic, hot and smelly queue.

"Written August 16, 2022",Phenomenally crowded,"Visited with my 4 year old grandson, specifically to visit the dinosaurs.  Pre booked the tickets , both for entry and Dippy, really didn't need to have bothered as no one checked them anyway. Which may explain why the place was phenomenally packed - I suppose the more in, the more money!  The dinosaur section was disappointing - yes of course it is a popular section but it was ridiculous with the amount of people allowed in. I think the fact that my grandson (who is dinosaur mad) asked to leave after about 40 minutes summed up our visit perfectly."
"Written June 3, 2023",Skippable,"Visited on a rainy afternoon after hearing the museum was a “must visit” but was quite disappointed. The building is stunning but if you’ve been to a natural history museum anywhere else you sort of know what there is to see. There are some exhibits that have some cool elements but it is so big, busy and difficult to navigate with unhelpful signage that it takes hours to find the best things. If you’re only in London for a short visit, skip this and visit one of the many other museums instead"
"Written July 31, 2022",My experience,"We booked our time slot online. On arrival we noted the museum was very crowded. Our ticket for our time slot was not checked. We noted people could just walk in without showing their confirmations. This allowed for the museum to be over crowded. Walking around we could not stop to read information without being asked to hurry up and move on by other people, and also asked to move on by a member of staff. A friend I was with got literally pushed out the way, and another friend had problems in the toilet with another impatient person banging on her cubicle door. Sadly this made the whole experience not very pleasant and as a group we made the decision to leave early."
"Written February 24, 2020",What a place!,"To visit this place properly you would need to spend a couple of days here. We arrived first thing at opening so missed any queues and were there till about an hour before closing (there was still massive queues outside when we left). We only managed to see a fraction of what's there. What we did see was stunning, the place definitely lives up to its reputation and I highly recommend visiting. One piece of advice, stay away from the cafes around lunchtime, they are not friendly places!!!"
"Written April 21, 2022",Worth visiting,"Such a great place, you learn so much. It was very nice to visit this museum, it suits people of all ages. There are a few eating areas spread around the museum, making it easy to spend a couple of hours here."
"Written September 28, 2023",Natural History Museum ,"This was my second time to the British museum, and it was great to go with my partner again.  The only thing I would recommend is that maybe the museum dusts the exhibits, as when looking at the exhibit from the second level, the dust on the blue whale and the elephants is quite thick, and it seems that no cleaning is done. Otherwise it was not a bad visit."
"Written July 31, 2021",Excellent exhibits and very informative - and free !,My husband had been wanting to come here for a while so we had a few days in London as we couldn’t go abroad again this year. He was not disappointed. The dinosaur exhibits were amazing and I loved the architecture of the building - all the animals on the walls are extraordinary when you think they were put there in the 1800’s. Allow about 3 - 4 hours to have a good look around. Definitely worth visiting.
"Written May 26, 2021",Loved the dinosaur section,"Reliving my childhood by taking the wife to the museum.  Some of the stuffed animals have seen better days and probably need retiring.  Loved what they have done with the dinosaur section, it’s awesome especially the interactive big Dinosaur please remake the rest of the museum like this"
"Written May 9, 2023","Great for children, frustrating for adults!","This is an iconic museum, and it contains myriads of wonderful exhibits, but it is an ordeal to enter without pre-booked entry or membership and survival of the fittest once inside. It's great that so many children are being introduced to the world's wonders by their brave parents, but for other adults, browsing the exhibits is all but impossible. It feels like total chaos inside and accessing displays is a time-consuming challenge. Museum staff are probably delighted by its appeal, but for older adults it is not really worth the angst. We did get some brief reprieve on the World Wildlife Photography exhibition. This was well presented and engrossing but relatively expensive to enter. "
"Written June 1, 2022",It was ok,It was absolutely heaving when we went this week - I pre booked a slot as advised but no one checked it and so we were piled in with everyone else. I appreciate it’s half term week and covid restrictions are lifted but it was bonkers.The dippy exhibition was the quietest calmest bit. We felt shepherded round the dinosaurs so didn’t really get to look for too long. It felt quite stressful and chaotic for the most part. Some parts also looked quite tired and lacking in polish. Feel a bit meh afterwards.
"Written August 16, 2022",Great for Kids,"I'm a veteran museum goer, so I can be a bit critical about musuems. We took our two young grand children here, and they loved it. There are huge dinosaur skeletons and some animatronic models, as well as whale models and skeletons. The museum is large and quite extensive. My two issues were that in catering to children, it often seemed that presentations oriented to adult visitors were lacking. Moreover, its appeal to children meant that the place was crowded with kids, noisy, and rather hot in the London summer. The museum is housed in a huge, grand Victorian building. Many of the rooms seemed purposely to ignore their architectural heritage and had modern walls that hid the architectural features of the building. They were like rooms within rooms, and I preferred those displays that exposed embelishments of the original building. Since much of the building is devoted to research and not open to the public, one must negotiate long, winding hallways which were often not well marked. Overall, I enjoyed my visit but felt that more attention to the layout of the rooms and the design of the exhibits was warranted."
"Written August 15, 2022",Beautiful but too crowded and hot,"Had it booked for Saturday at 12:00 hoping it would not be too crowded. Unfortunately, it was super crowded and way too hot almost everywhere inside which completely ruined it for me.The emtrance hall looks amazing as well as the dippy part which was suprisinigly empt and cool. Everything else we rushed through.Not something I would recommend visiting in the summer."
"Written February 2, 2020",Great museum,"This is a great museum. Our 7 year daughter loved it. We arrived just after 10 on Saturday morning and had no problem to get in straight away,no queues. It started to get much busier after awhile. We spent 4 hours there,but you could easily spend all day if you wanted. Taking to consideration that it's free of charge I highly recommend it to families with young children."
"Written March 2, 2020",Photographer of the year  ,"Visited again after many years, and still in awe of the amazing entrance hall and intricate decor and stone work this beautiful building has to offer. We visited the Photographer of the year exhibit. Though a little pricy for what it is, it was still worth the hour spent reading into the story of each photo.Recommend if photography is your throng "
"Written August 19, 2022",My favourite place in the Country,I could spend many days in this place if I lived in London. I visited on a a very warm Sunday which I think is the best time as parking is free around the Museum. My daughters loved it lots of things to explore but our favourite was Dippy the dinosaur. The building is magnificent inside and out and is well looked after.
"Written January 6, 2022",Just a museum.,Average as far as museums go.Was a fun time looking at the dinosaur exhibit. Fair few things in this museum just don’t work due to covid and the interactivity is at a minimum.Fun for educating the younger generation though.Probably wouldn’t go back.
"Written October 25, 2021",Become a member,"Visited the Wildlife photographer of the year exhibition. It is well worth becoming a member of the museum as you get free access to any exhibition that is on. You don't have to queue to get in, you get discount off anything you buy and there is also a quiet members area to get a quiet drink and a bite to eat.The Wildlife photo's were incredible as brilliantly displayed. I have never been into photography but this has made me want to revisit this exhibition every year from now on."
"Written October 30, 2020",Excellent Attraction ,"Visited with my 14 and 9 year old sons. They had a ball exploring all the exhibits, especially the dinosaurs and the red zone which is about how the earth was formed. Loads to do, although most of the interactive parts are removed due to covid. Still a great day of fun and education  "
"Written August 4, 2023",Natural History day out,Everything is so dark and dated. Not enough seating in museum.Cafe seating very limited scramble for chairs.Only one WC near  cafe. Long queues.Very hot.Animated T_Rex brill as well as the two small furry ones.You must book a time on line it’s free and you jump the long queues to enter. However even though it’s free with a voluntary request for a donation inside you are met with a gang of staff pressuring you to cough up. Quite intimidating and put me off making a donation.The exhibits need brightening up and rethinking.Glass boxes after boxes of thigh bones is totally boring for children.
"Written August 25, 2022",Good but very busy and hot,The museum has some really interesting facts but today for us was far too busy and unbearably hot to stop and have a proper good look at anything.  The dinosaur bit was so hot and you where just getting pushed along. Maybe I would go back not in a holiday period and when the weathers a bit cooler
"Written February 24, 2022",A must do,"Wow.Loved every minute.Very informativeLots to see and doImpressive fossils, bones and history of themKids everywhere were kept interested.Plenty of cafes, gift shops were resonable priced.Free entry though had to book at half term."
"Written February 3, 2020",Excellent Free place to go,"Fabulous place with other museums within a few hundreds metres away. The building itself is enormous but inside are the most wonderful displays, interactive centres and beautiful places to eat. We visited approximately 2-3 hours and this wasn’t long enough. We would definitely go back to see this very interesting place. My 12 year old loved it. The shops were a little expensive."
"Written March 31, 2020",WOW!!! Just Amazing!!!,"You would have to spend all day here to see everything. It took me 2 hours just to see one section out of four, I didn't even dawdle or read everything. There was one section that I just skimmed through quickly. This place has exactly the kind of stuff I was looking for. I did make time another day to go back and see a little more but as my trip was almost over I couldn't see everything that I wanted. This museum is great for kids and adults. I would say this was the best museum I've been to in the UK and Europe."
"Written August 10, 2023",Book ahead and watch the weather,"This was a return visit for us, this time with younger children as part of our group. Booking ahead was definitely worthwhile as we were able to walk straight in and past the long queue standing outside on a very hot day. Choose your entry time wisely. We went at 1.30 pm and it was very busy. The building is very impressive but it isn’t air conditioned. There are some big fans in some places but these did little on the day we went. The hot day and number of visitors made the museum very uncomfortable in the most popular areas and  it got too much for the kids. We didn’t get round everything on this visit unfortunately but the main hall and dinosaur exhibit were hits."
"Written March 8, 2023","This place is great, but far too many people.","I love this museum, it's been my favourite for a long time, hence the overall score. Unfortunately, I hardly get to go anymore, despite living nearby. I have ASD, which in my case comes along with a lot of sensitivity to sound, and ADHD, which means that the tiniest of these sounds prevents me from processing anything else at all while it's happening. I'm not at all good with crowds, either.I used to be able to deal with this sufficiently enough to still visit regularly - in fact I had a membership for a while. But there are just too many people now - kids in particular. The scream and they shove and they block everyone else out of everything, and what used to be a mildly uncomfortable experience that I could tolerate well enough to still enjoy the museum has become an unsurpassable barrier.I understand that money is tight and free places are more popular than ever before, and I understand that a lot of kids love dinosaurs. And I truly don't want those kids to miss out. But there are just too many people let into the building at the same time. Multiple huge school groups every day during term time weekdays, and a flood of parents bringing them otherwise. It isn't just the kids either, there are too many people in general. As a neurodiverse person, it's just not possible for me to enjoy this space anymore.It would be nice to have a day here and there set aside for those who struggle with things like this, especially as dinosaurs are a particularly popular special interest for autistic kids. Booking in advance only to control the numbers, maybe? I really do miss being able to go. - My last visit was far before the earliest date I could select here, and I wish it wasn't."
"Written April 8, 2023","Two hours waiting to get in, really!","Not sure why we queued for two hours because it’s free? My daughter needed loo after An hour and half and went right in?It seemed unnecessary and when we got in needed loo and restaurant immediately which ruined whole experience,Staff members need to inform visitors without tickets that museum is free and allow people in, doesn’t seem right to keep visitors especially children and disabled people like myself waiting to get into a museum that is free!"
"Written February 7, 2022",Great Exhibition - Wildlife Photographer of the Year,"We went for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition.  This has an entrance fee, unlike the rest of the museum.  I have National Art Pass so it was half price.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Wildlife Photographer exhibition - the photos were stunningly presented with good captions.  Not crowded!  We also visited the dinosaur exhibition - appealing for both adults and children (especially the moving exhibits!)  We also visited Our Broken Planet exhibition (free to enter).  Lots of school groups and very interactive for the kids.  A wonderful building and stunning Victorian architecture, worth a visit in itself."
"Written July 6, 2022",Surprisingly very enjoyable ,"I'm not much of a fan of museums however; felt we couldn't visit London without a trip here and I'm so glad we did.We spent hours exploring the museum! My son (9) in particular loved the natural disasters area. He spent a good hour or more at this area alone. The museum was very busy however; as it is so big you don't feel overcrowded.  There were plenty of sanitisation stations and good access to toilet facilities. There was a lack of places to refill water bottles and we did not rate the cafe area.  Almost £10 for one slice of cake and a can of diet coke! Now we expected it to be pricey, it is London however; this was way overpriced! We would definitely return if we visit London again."
"Written November 3, 2022",A roarsome time!,"I visited today with my three young grandsons.  Easy to book our tickets with allocated time slots. We arrived late due to train issues but no one seemed bothered.  Tickets only briefly glanced at once.  Although not half term for most schools it was very busy, especially around the dinosaur exhibits.  There are lots of great things to see here, although layout is not easy to follow even with a map.  Kids loved most things especially the creepy crawlies.  We went to the T-Rex grill for lunch, queues were long and food took a little time to arrive but was very good, lovely salads and the kids meals were adequate. Gift shop had lots of options and prices were better than expected.  All in all a good day."
"Written August 5, 2022",Disappointing planning,"The actual museum is amazing! Sadly, we didn’t get to experience it. We booked timed entrance tickets, but on arrival no tickets were being checked whatsoever. Because of this, the museum was packed. We physically couldn’t move. If we tried to stop to view anything, we were pushed along. At one point, we were told to keep moving by a member of staff, how can we appreciate the museum constantly moving? We tried to get food in the cafe but the children’s lunch bags all had a bag of popcorn in. This is a major choke risk for under 4’s! Please revise. Overall, so disappointed. We’d come from york so unfortunately won’t be able to re-attempt anytime soon!"
"Written February 12, 2023",Great if somewhat packed visit,"First things first. The natural history is obviously a world class facility with numerous excellent exhibits and a seemingly endless collection of objects etc. You could easily spend 2 days or more trying to fit it all in and probably still miss plenty of things.It is also free (although a donation is recommended).  However, my one criticism is that it was overly busy to the point of being somewhat stressful meaning we cut our visit a bit short. This is especially true in certain exhibits like the dinosaur area. Of course, it is good to see the museum being well used after covid but be prepared for it if you are not a fan of crowds."
"Written May 29, 2022",Too much stuff. Too little guidance.,"I went at the end of the day, so not crowded. That said, many of the exhibition cases seemed overstuffed with anything and everything. It might be better to rotate some of the specimens rather that cramming everything acquired by the museum into the cases. I also found there to be no logical path through the museum. It might be nice to have a suggested route."
"Written September 5, 2021",A must when visiting London,"What can be said about entering this magnificent building but 'breath taking'.  The architecture if phenomenal let alone the exhibits.  We spent 2.5 hours in the museum. Unfortunately, we did not have time to visit every exhibit however as it was free to enter, this did not matter.  We would definitely return."
"Written October 2, 2022",Kids screaming and shoving people out the way,"Used to visit this museum repeatedly when I lived in London ten years ago, and have been looking forward to returning. I shouldn’t have bothered. Wall to wall with screaming children. I was shoved out the way by kids just for them to bang on the glass and have no interest in the very items I was trying to look at. Groups with pushchairs stood around having conversations and blocking exits. They should seriously consider adult only evenings on a regular basis for people who actually want to look at the exhibits and not put up with this chaos. It was ruined, I won’t be returning any time soon."
"Written February 25, 2020",Fun for all ages,Excellent dinosaur exposition. Beautiful building. Entry is free (although donations are encouraged). Went with a 4 year old who was very excited to see all the dinosaurs and animals. We also learned tons. Plan for at least 2h and arrive early as this place gets super busy on weekends
"Written May 10, 2023",Good Natural History Museum,"This natural history museum has a good collection of dinosaurs, mammals/sea life, and other things related to science.  It's decently sized, though I would say in terms of variety of subjects, other natural history museums (like the one in New York) offer more to see.  It's hard to complain too much since admission to the museum is free.  It can get pretty busy, so make sure if you plan to spend a lot of time here to come as early as you can to avoid the crowds."
"Written August 4, 2022",Super size museum!,"Great place. Free to visit, but we left a donation. Lots to see and do! Some very fascinating exhibits! Very easy to get lost! The place is massive. Sadly It was extremely busy and we could barely move freely , that coupled with the fact there is no air con, and it being incredibly hot inside didn’t make a comfortable experience.They advise to book a ticket to guarantee entry, we did this but don’t bother because they never checked our tickets, we just got let in."
"Written July 11, 2023",A museum in all its glory,"This was an unplanned visit and - as it happens very often with unexpected things - it was a marvellous experience. A friend took us there without telling us in advance, and we enjoyed every minute of it. It has to be said that the museum is huge, and if you wish to have an in-depth visit, two full days will not be enough. Actually, after a while you can easily start feeling dizzy and in need of refreshments. We opted for a speedier course, prioritising certain sections and leaving others, and we managed to see most of what we wanted in just under two hours, every minute of that time well spent."
"Written August 13, 2022",Too hot but stunning building,A balmy summers day meant the non air conditioned cathedral of knowledge was unbearingly hot. It meant I couldn't grasp the full wonder of the exhibits and treasures on display. But other than the unbearable temperature the actual facade of the building is breath-taking. A true paradigm of gothic architecture. Simply stunning
"Written May 3, 2023",Fascinating old building,Loved our visit and loved seeing this beautiful historic building. Would love to see them admit less people at a time. We reserved free tickets in advance and no one checked the time. The museum (during Easter week) was PACKED to the gills. People everywhere and a very long line outside. The museum would have been a much more pleasurable experience with about half the people there.
"Written August 6, 2021",For young children only,"t's a beautiful building, filled with lots of fascinating things but our experience was spoiled by several factors. I visited with my teenager on a weekday morning in the hope it would be quiet and stress free. We really wanted to see the dinosaurs, it was our main reason for visiting, but the exhibit was boarded in so the walkways were far too narrow and so dimly lit that we could hardly see. Social distancing was impossible and it wasn't possible to properly appreciate the dinosaurs as young children were running everywhere,  knocking into us and parents with no masks on not telling them to behave.  The museum is totally geared towards young children,  with basic information and interactive activities, consequently my fourteen year old daughter said she felt too old for the place! The invertebrate exhibit in particular was aimed at kids under 11 and as an adult I felt there was nothing for me to learn. Maybe we were comparing it to the New York museum of Natural history too much, which was so much better and more adult orientated. Great that it's free though as we only spent an hour there and would have been annoyed if we had paid for it."
"Written August 15, 2022",Great Free(ish) day out,"As many have pointed out that reviewed it lately it is crowded as hot. Well Dah, it is free entry during Summer holidays and a heat wave, what did they expect. I expected crowds, I booked entry but turned up 40 minutes early and just walked straight in. I expected that it would be hard to get a photo of world class exhibits with the crowds but I was patient and got some good ones. There was plenty of interactive things for the children to enjoy, the excitement did mean there was noise but that just meant the kids were excited and enjoying thing. The let down was the cafes, getting a table was easy but all of the free ones were uncleared and dirty, under our table were at least two burgers and other assorted meals, we used the clothes and cleaning gear lying around to clear the table, no staff members were seen clearing or clening. Our food was OK though. For a free day (and a donation) it was well worth doing, make sure you see the full size anamated T-Rex."
"Written February 7, 2020",Wonderful for anyone really,"The layout of the museum was superb. I went on a weekday around 11 and there were a few groups of school children but other than that it was not packed. I enjoyed several displays, the hummingbird collection which lovely. This museum also has a nice area for eating and affordable gift shops."
"Written June 5, 2023",Tad bit disappointing,We felt a tad bit disappointed with this museum and expected it to be bigger. It was pretty overcrowded and felt more suited for school children instead of adults. I would recommend families with young children to visit! It was still a fair bit interesting to see but we were out within an hour.
"Written May 9, 2022",Worth every second you spend there.,"Book online and go early to save time at the entrance and avoid crowds.Takes about 1 1/2 - 2 hours to see. I wish they had more stuff at the museum store as the availability of T-shirts for example was very limited in terms of sizes, which is a shame."
"Written November 18, 2021",Lovely,This was the best museum we went to on our trip. We went to the science museum and the British museum and this one was way better then the other two. Shame you have to pay soo much to get into the fantastical beats section I hope they know that the price they put on that is the same price to actually go to the Harry Potter studio tour ….. Found it cheeky that they still allow you into the gift shop to buy stuff though LOL!! The rest of the museum was really good and enjoyable ! Love ice rink outside too but way to busy to go on it
"Written February 13, 2022",Wonderful!,"One of the most stunning buildings in the world, and an inspiring day out for all ages.  Thank you for the left-luggage facility, the good food in the cafe and the interesting books in the gift shop. We especially enjoyed the Broken Planet' exhibition - very accessible and thought provoking."
"Written November 17, 2021",Waste of money and time,Terrible. Arrived at 7pm for 8pm session. Queued for 25 mins to still not get a drink at the bar. Joined queue for ice skating at 7:30 and waited past our session  (not option of session being extended because of their slowness!). Very disappointing. This is a Wednesday night - staff simply said “it’s busy”. It’s only busy because you oversold tickets. This is a money making scam. Don’t buy a ticket you won’t even get a full session or your free drink if you buy a deal.
"Written April 17, 2022",Needs modernising and quickly,"Far too many visitors packed in. Literally like a theme park with queues inside. Also, the museum needs to be modernised - very little has changed in the last 25 years (videos made in the 1970s still be shown upstairs). Sadly also the canteen was very dirty, with food/ drink stains splattered on the wall. A real shame and with someInvestment and modernisation this could be excellent but needs dragging into the 21st century"
"Written March 6, 2023","Brilliant, definitely worth a donation","I visited here with a friend a couple of weeks ago and must say we had a really informative and enjoyable time. There are so many things to look at and read about, definitely allow a good few hours to walk around here; we foolishly didn’t give ourselves enough time so it was a bit of a rush. My favourite part however (as I’m sure is the same for everyone) was the dinosaur exhibition which was brilliant. This museum is even more amazing considering there is technically no entry fee- it’s definitely worth a donation if you can afford it."
"Written August 3, 2022",Must Do London Trip,WOW what a place. So much to see and explore. I would recommend pre-booking your tickets to beat the queues and start at the beginning of the day. We spent nearly 6 hours there and could have spent longer. If you have the option of returning soon I would suggest just focusing on a couple of areas rather than trying to see it all in one go. We ate lunch there and it was tasty and reasonably priced. It is great for children who have an interest in the world or an inquisitive mind.
"Written April 25, 2023",Great Titanosaur exhibit at the Natural History Museum,"Booked to see the Titanosaur exhibition at the Natural History, a fantastic exhibition well worth going if you can. Booking is a must if you want to avoid the long queues outside. The only downside is that the staff were not particularly knowledgeable and couldn’t really answer any questions we had."
"Written September 4, 2022",Absolutely horrendous! Way too many people!,"I’m afraid I agree with previous reviews and found this museum to be one of the noisiest and most overcrowded places I’ve ever visited.I was really looking forward to my visit, having not been since childhood, but I’m afraid the sheer number of visitors made it an unpleasant experience and i left after only half an hour.People were tripping over each other, bumping into each other, whichever way you turned there was someone right next to you and I found myself wishing for the good old days of social restricting restrictions.Also, far too noisy and the sheer numbers meant that you could not even get close to many of the exhibits and as for the dinosaur section; forget it!How on earth can you be expected to enjoy a museum under these conditions? I have never in my life cut short a visit but I was so frustrated that I felt I had no choice.Management- if you’re reading this please consider controlling the numbers of people to provide a pleasanter experience."
"Written January 20, 2020",Great recent visit with family - a good day needed to experience it,"It was a great visit with the family. Its completely free  - a voluntary donation can be gifted at the doors. It's a short walk from South Kensington Tube station. With so much to see and I spent a few hours there and managed to go through the dinosaur, human biology exhibition. The Dinosaur exhibition felt smaller from what I remember but nevertheless it was still good. Definitely recommended."
"Written November 5, 2022",Great to see Dippy back,"Had a great visit here with the added bonus of seeing Dippy who was looking great. Came with two young children who both found different parts of the museum interesting.Yes it gets busy but you are free to roam so if a certain section looked crowded we went to another part then went back later when it was less busy. There’s lots to see so give yourself plenty of time, not the sort of thing you can rush through."
"Written August 12, 2021",Fantastic Beasts Rip Off,"Fantastic Beasts exhibition is a complete rip off at nearly £60 for a family of 4. It was short, dull with not one exciting feature. No idea how they are even charging for this. DO NOT waste your money."
"Written November 21, 2021","A great museum, maybe slightly behind the times?","A great museum with beautiful architecture and lots of interesting displays. They currently have a display about climate change which I found very interesting, I found it refreshing that facts about certain industries that are causing harm to our planet are being displayed for people to see at last. My husband and I visited several different areas of the museum, including marine life, dinosaurs, earth and volcanoes. All of which were interesting to look at. You could easily spend a whole day here as there is plenty to see! Great that entry is free too and there are optional paid exhibitions. The only reason I have given four stars instead of five is because I recognised many of the displays from visiting in my childhood, over 15 years ago! So I felt that perhaps many of the displays and information boards needed a bit of a refresh, especially if they want to capture the attention of children who may visit today, there could have been more interactive displays to get them involved and learning (talking from a teacher’s point of view). It’s great to have the info all written down next to each display but there is no way a child would want to read it all and they probably won’t even attempt to read it. I would suggest that someone at the museum has a think about how they could make things more engaging for children."
"Written April 2, 2023",Excellent free day out! ,"An amazing free museum! We drove to Richmond, paid to park on someone’s drive and got the tube direct to South Kensington from there - much cheaper than getting the train! Exhibits were excellent and really interesting! The dinosaur display was loved by us all but especially my six year old! The animatronic dinosaurs were a great addition! The whale models / skeletons were really impressive too and there were some hands on exhibits to boot! Didn’t manage to see it all as wanted to squeeze in a few hours at the Science Museum but was very boring in comparison - wish we had stayed here! Will be back! :) "
"Written December 7, 2022",Always magical and interesting,This place always has something new it seems.   A real national treasure.   So much to see ; as we were with quite young kids we focussed on the dinosaurs and mammals.We spent a good 2 hours and you can easily spend an entire day or more here.The animated T-Rex (with santa hat) is amazing ...even the eyelids move ... the earth quake scenario is also very realistic.Please make a donation - it's free to enter but it is worth a lot more
"Written February 10, 2020",London trip to see museums,"Went to the museums with children and grandchildren. The Natural History museum was fantastic,every member of the family found several things to interest them and we all learned an awful lot that day .A marvellous building especially with all the monkeys carved in the walls and animals along the roof of the building.Easy to access straight from the underground."

Evolution or full circle revolution? I’ll let you be the judge! "
"Written August 24, 2022",Fantastic museum,"Beautiful museum, so much to see and do inside.  We visited during school summer holidays which we knew would be busy, but it was a little too busy to enjoy and extremely hot inside.  I'm not sure if the museum would have off-peak season but if you can go during this - I'm sure it would be far more enjoyable."
"Written August 22, 2023",Pre-book and Skip the Line,"Prebook your tickets (for free) and you can skip the line and walk straight in. It was extremely busy in the late afternoon (I’ve been several times and never seen it so packed!) so perhaps better to visit earlier on in the day during the holidays as it did sadly have an impact on our visit. The kids (11,9 and 7) were jostled around in the crowd and it was so incredibly hot and stuffy that my daughter started to feel quite poorly. We enjoyed the exhibits as always but left sooner than we usually would simply due to how overwhelming it was for the kids. The Science Museum on the other hand was very cool and the big open spaces made it feel much less crowded, they could’ve stayed there for hours! I personally love the Natural History Museum and I’m glad to see it being appreciated by so many people, this is just something to consider if visiting in the holidays with young children."
"Written August 22, 2023",Good but busy,"I was looking forward to my visit to the museum as I had never been and love natural history. I had prebooked our tickets and was so glad I did as it meant we could avoid the queue to get in. I thought that booking a time slot meant admissions were controlled, sadly not.  Once inside it was so busy that we couldn't take the time to really look at some of the exhibits. It was a hot day outside and with the huge amount of people it was very warm inside. I was a little disappointed in my visit, but I got to see what I wanted which was the main thing. I will come again next time I'm in London but will not come in the school holidays"
"Written October 12, 2022",Great (but please put Dippy back where he belongs).,"We visited with children aged 9 and 12, midweek and teen time so during a quiet period and we had a great time. We booked online but no one checked our booking when we arrived so perhaps not a necessity. It was a full day and by the end when were a bit over reading all the information, so I think breaking it into 2 days would have been better. The rocks/earth/volcano section we didn’t fully appreciate because we were so tired but looked really good from what we could manage. The cafe wasn’t busy during the time we were there and did a decent selection of sandwiches, drinks, crisps. My only disappointment is that Dippy the dinosaur has been moved from the foyer. I remember as a child walking into the Natural History Museum and being awe inspired by the dinosaur towering over you as you walked in. Now it’s in its own dark room, off to the side. My children are from NZ and I’m disappointed they missed that same amazing experience which, to me, really set up expectations of how amazing this place is. It’s really missing that ‘awe’ as you enter as a result."
"Written August 26, 2023",So disappointed!,"Clearly an amazing endeavour, but so, so overcrowded and really hot. Couldn’t get close to any of the displays and had to hold to my children (8&6) for fear they would be jostled away.If you could visit when it’s quiet I imagine it’s wonderful. There’s no where to sit and rest and huge queues for the toilets. There’s no care about visitor experience.We traveled to London specifically for this museum and had pre booked tickets thinking that would mean there would be some crowd control, so came away really disappointed."
"Written March 19, 2022","Dinosaurs lacking, Temporary Environmental Exhibition a Let Down","It's hard to knock a museum as impressive as this and also discredit the fact that it was free. But, I can't give it a full 5 mark rating in good conscience. The dinosaur exhibit wasn't all that impressive. I've seen better ones with better organization in museums with less cultural clout. Additionally, I kept seeing hype for their exhibit on ""Broken Earth"" which I was really looking forward to. It was a huge let down, providing no real new information or inviting exhibition pieces. Mostly, just the same song and dance as everywhere else."
"Written August 24, 2023",So much to do and so cheap (it's free!),"So much to see and do, for a variety of ages. We came specifically to London for the experience, and whilst we had both been here before, we had only been as children, and had forgotten how much there was to do. We spent a lot of time looking through the space exhibit and learning about how the world was created and what different gases make up air before swiftly moving onto the dinosaurs and finding out about the fossils. While we were only here for three hours, if you decide to eat food or bring children, you could easily make a whole day trip out of the museum. "
"Written April 4, 2023",Outstanding and informative,"I ventured into London from Leicester alone on an adventure to see this museum, after being inspired two weeks ago when I read a fiction book, which was loosely based on the life of Joseph Banks.All I can say is, it exceeded my expectations. Yes it was crowded, but that's to be expected in the school holidays. I was so fascinated by everything, I tuned the other people and the noise out completely.My favourite section was the mammals, closely followed by the birds. The huge display case of hummingbirds was breathtaking, and a definite highlight, as was the cocoon - the entire space was almost empty when I got there, so I was able to see everything and it's fascinating seeing the scientists behind the scenes working.It's a trip I won't forget in a hurry, and I'm glad I did it alone so I didn't have to waste time. Be warned, you need lots of time - I had 5hrs, and I missed out a whole section and barely had 10mins to see the mineral section.The entrance hall is just majestic, pictures can't do it justice."
"Written November 20, 2022",Worth a visit just for the building itself!,"As a child, I remember watching ""One of our dinosaurs is missing"" which was my first introduction to this place. My mum subsequently took me more than once (we lived in Surrey) and I took my partner in 2009 when he first visited London. This year we returned with our 10 year old son (mainly to see Wicked but with a couple of nights stay) so we brought him here on our last day. Our time was limited due to catching a train home so we were only able to see the blue section on this visit. Nonetheless, it was all worth seeing and our son spent ages reading every sign at each display. We will definitely return just to do the rest at some point (especially given it is free!). There is a lot to see however if you are going to do it properly so I would allow a day as we were there just over 2 hours and did one section!"
"Written August 18, 2021",Disappointed!,We visited last week with our 2 children ages 7 and 5. They have been desperate to visit for such a long time so we travelled from the north east for a few days so we could take them along.We arrived to massive queues but luckily nwe already had tickets so we didn't have to wait. When we got in there it was rammed!!! To the point that my 7 year old started crying because grown adults were pushing him! How we made it through the dinosaur exhibition without my husband getting into a fight is beyond me! We left after that without seeing the rest!Very poor crowd management from the museum.
"Written May 2, 2022",Ruined by the crowds ,"On the surface this place is amazing and I would have given it 5 stars. The exhibits are out of this world and the staff are so knowledgeable and patient with children. We entered on Sunday morning so to start it wasn't too full so my son got a personalised experience looking at claws and teeth. The staff member was very knowledgeable and kept my son's attention and told my son how knowledgeable he was which made him feel amazing. What made it average was the amount of people the museum let in. Within 30 minutes you couldn't move in the place. The exhibits are not controlled so you can not enjoy and it makes it impossible for you to actually take anything in. Especially in the dinosaur area. It was completely ruined for our son who has ADHD and Autism. There was no control entering which means you couldn't read anything, the noise was unbearable for me let alone my child and people were pushing and shoving. My son asked to leave even though he wanted to see more. He couldn't cope with the chaos. I am very disappointed"
"Written May 17, 2022",Full of screaming kids,"First time visiting this place despite been to London for years. The entrance is quite impressive, one takes the escalator up the main hall. There's an impressive blue whale skeleton that's the main showpiece in the main hall. Some exhibits of the geological formation of earth are quite educational. There's also a creepy crawlie room that's quite interesting. Dissapointingly, I find the dinosaur room lacking any impressive exhibit. There are actually very few of them. What really spoiled this trip is that this place is full of screaming children, even when I visited during work day. The noise level and ear piercing sonic bombs they detonated was unbearable, esp in the dinosaur section. I probably won't return because of this as such places are not for me. "
"Written January 16, 2022",Brilliant!,"We took our daughters and their boyfriends for a day out at the museum and spent time both apart and together wandering round and met up for lunch in the central cafe. We all have different interests and we all found something of interest to us. The signposting was good, the maps were useful and things were beautifully displayed. There was a good mix of exhibits and information and many different themes were covered. My favourite bits were the world wildlife photography competition display, which was spectacular, and the vault of amazing rocks and gems. The rocks and gems was a huge section and then we found another huge section of rocks which was duplicated but never mind! Loved the dinosaur section, even as adults. It was a shame that many of the mammal exhibits were away for restoration. Just a great place to explore, free to enter and a full day out!"
"Written October 25, 2023","Whatever you do, book tickets!","We went here on Monday, half-term, so to be expected that it was busy, on approach to the front entrance, we were greeted by and directed to another location by staff as we didn't have tickets (you can book tickets for free, if you are planning a visit, even off of peak time please do this, it'll save you some time - no you can not do this on the day, as we cheekily tried to do 5 minutes into waiting in a queue). We stood in a queue for about 45 minutes to get in - this was managed fine and wasn't a hassle for us, having gotten through it pretty efficiently. Exhibits were great and well signposted, we also grabbed a map and walked ourselves around. Having been exhausted from 3 prior days of walking, there was a large queue for the dinosaur section (obviously and understandably), which we would like to have been informed of at some point, so we sadly just skipped past this."
"Written October 16, 2022",Wildlife photographer of the year,"Myself and my partner went to the wildlife photographer of the year exhibit. You have to prebook a time slot as well as pay prior to going. I’ve always wanted to go but sadly it was just too busy. I assumed by pre booking a time slot it would ease the crowd,  but that sadly wasn’t the case. The photographs were great of what I could see but I just didn’t enjoy being shoulder to shoulder next to strangers as well as kids crying - I struggled to enjoy the artwork for what it was as I couldn’t relax. After we attempted the rest of the museum but left after ten minutes as the constant crowds put us off. We both agreed we would avoid going on a weekend next time if we could."
"Written December 21, 2021",Amazing,"This museum spans a city block and as incredible as the displays are, the building itself is also a marvel. The dinosaur exhibits were great - just enough explanation without feeling like I was reading a textbook. Don't miss my favorite animatronic dino - the one that snores! But I think overall my favorite thing about this museum was the way they acknowledged the roots of the collections with older style display cabinets juxtaposed with more modern accents. There was so much to see and do here that I think you could explore it forever."
"Written June 21, 2022",Reunion visit to London,"I only gave it 3 stars because it was impossible to see anything.  The museum has a dinosaur exhibit that seems to draw busloads of school children on the day we were there.  It meant that you could not get close to many of the exhibits and  created a very unenjoyable atmosphere.      Maybe I am too old but I prefer my museum to be informative rather than a Disney show,   In contrast the V&A across the street is excellent. "
"Written September 15, 2022",Amazing museum & free access,The exterior of this building looks amazing. The great architecture even before you enter. And FREE entry !!Currently tickets need to be booked for a time slot & access to Dippy the Dinosaur.BUT it's not that busy so people were being allowed access.The museum is clearly marked with coloured zones covering all aspects of natural history. There is lots of interactive stuff for the kids. The cafes are not the cheapest but allow time for a break before exploring further.Would highly recommend this activity
"Written July 15, 2021",Totally poor,"I found the museum was a pale imitation of the museum I first visited thirty years ago. Where are the extensive displays. I found the dinosaur exhibition goodish, the mammel exhibition mediocre, the whales and large animals looked so bored, as to the rest of the museum given over to interactive learning and of no interest except to kiddies. "
"Written February 24, 2022",An amazing day out,"Been here so many times, and every time I see something I hadn’t seen before,  obviously the dinosaurs and blue whale is a huge attraction and the planetarium can’t be missed, but take in the Dodo, Canadian red wood, and the giraffe skeleton. Miss the ants/termites that used to live in the glass tank, would love that to return.   The earthquake room/shop is very very memorable.     Plenty of toilets and places to eat or get a drink and the gift shops are not extortionate!  Worth a twenty pounds donation! But good to see that families can only pay what they can afford so they don’t miss out."
"Written July 25, 2022","Dippy, dinosaurs and Paddington vibes","Went for Dippy, the dinosaurs and the Paddington vibes. Argued for 10 minutes that Dippy was real dinosaur bones, turns out ... its a mould! (Still beautiful, although I was annoyed I was wrong). It was extremely busy but that's our fault for going on a Saturday and at midday so best advice is to avoid these times if you're wanting a quieter visit."
"Written July 18, 2022","Great exhibits, but crowded","This museum has some fantastic exhibits, particularly the marine reptiles and minerals. However, the day that we were there it seemed as if every school kid in England was there, and the noise level was incredible. Very few people wearing masks. Also, most of the dinosaur fossils on exhibit were above your head, making it hard to see them."
"Written June 27, 2022",Great to  visit.,We were staying in Kensington and as my health had not been good I didn’t want to be rushing all over London.This was a short walk from our hotel on the flat so perfect.We spent a good few hours looking around the museum and stopped for a coffee and cake as well.There is so much to see so ideal for couples or families.We got our tickets from the website before we visited which was free but you can add a donation if you want.
"Written September 15, 2022",Fun Afternoon,"Like most museums in London, this was a FREE visit that we enjoyed tremendously.  The architecture of the museum itself was worth the visit.  Then again, natural museums are usually full of interested fossils, etc. that entertain people of all ages."
"Written October 27, 2022","Great museum, but too busy to enjoy","This is a fantastic museum, with so much great content, but you just can’t enjoy it. I appreciate the goal of the museum is to generate traffic, and thus revenue to keep themselves going - but It’s always so overly crowded, you can barely move - let alone stop and read or look at exhibits. You end up caught in the moving swell of people and it’s not possible to take any of it in. This was our second attempt in as many years at visiting the museum. I think it will be a long time before we try again."
"Written June 10, 2022",Great free day out!,"Rated as 5 stars because it's a great museum and it's free! We spent a good few hours here and did enjoy it - however we have enjoyed other museums more. Some of the exhibitions were a bit ""samey"" and the layout was difficult. Also quite disappointed the cocoon was closed! However saying that it's still great, it's free, and the escalator going up is amazing! We had a nice coffee in the central cafe, however food prices were crazy. It was massively busy, which is fine, however it did sort of take some of the fun out of it. Close to south kensington tube so access is easy!"
"Written September 25, 2022",Great museum for all ages,Awesome day out. The building itself is worth a visit for the architecture alone. We went on a Saturday and it was quite crowded with a lot of children. You can book tickets in advance online but when we showed up there was no que anyway.
"Written July 9, 2023",Need a second visit to take it all in,"The Natural History Museum, South Kensington, is a must see. The building that houses the museum collections is itself is an outstanding piece of Architecture. Inside is just a grand. The complex is so vast that I suggest you obtain the building exhibition map and brochure as soon as you arrive and plan your journey around the many floors and separate exhibitions so as to not miss any of your favourites.The day we visited there appeared to be literally thousands of school children excitedly touring the exhibits. This possibly happens every day, so be warned. We put in around three hours in the Museum and did not see everything we wanted to. A second visit would be ideal. The Victoria and Albert Museum is next door and the Science Museum is around the corner so you can fill your day easily just visiting the museums."
"Written August 18, 2023",Awesome!,We went on the Spirit Tour today and Matt was our guide. All I can say is fantastic! He was awesome and so knowledgeable about the museum and its contents he made all feel really comfortable and like we had known him for ages! I can't recommend the spirit tour enough and if you're lucky to have Matt you're even luckier!
"Written August 25, 2023",Overcrowded,"My low rating does not involve the exhibition per se which of course makes it one of the most important museums in the world where you could spend hours learning and admiring the exhibits. However, as much as the idea of a free ticket sounds great, they do need to find a way to moderate the crowds. The place was oooovercrowded and it was a real mess being around the popular rooms. Plus although we had pre booked a slot and rushed to be on time no one seemed to care to check if there was a pre booking and at what time. The Darwin center was unfortunately unavailable the day of our visit because the lift was broken."
"Written July 14, 2023","Interesting exhibits, bad restaurant experience","They have some interesting things on show, but like most things in London the crowds were just too much, and it’s difficult to get to see things properly whilst fighting a sea of people.We went to see the Titansaur exhibit which was very interesting, and the highlight of my visit.However, when we stopped for lunch in the T Rex Restaurant, we were very disappointed. We ordered some caeser salads and added chicken to both, however when the chicken came it was barely cooked (see photo) so we didn’t eat most of that which was annoying. The restaurant itself was not majorly busy at the time either so there wasn’t really any excuse for the cooks not to be checking things are cooked properly!!!"
"Written March 18, 2022",Amazing!,"I knew this place was big but not THAT big!! The building itself is just bloody beautiful,victorian artictecture at it's finest.We didn't get to see all of the exhibits but what we did see was fantastic,you need to get there early and spend the best part of a day there to really appreciate it there's just so much to see.I felt very humbled and a little ashamed at what we have done(and are doing) to this beautiful planet and I'm no Greta Turnberg fan!"
"Written June 18, 2022",Step back in time,"The museum is in need of a good cleaning.  Dusty exhibits everywhere, the price is right for admission (free).  The sections of the museum not related to minerals /rocks are worth while .  Unless a geologist avoid the rock section.  Kids will love the nature and dinosaur exhibits."
"Written November 5, 2022",Too busy,"I am sure that this is a good museum but unfortunately it was far too busy to appreciate or enjoy. I would advise to go first thing when it opens when hopefully it is quieter.On the website it says you have to pre book tickets for a time slot, but this is pointless as nobody asked to see ours at the door. Maybe this was why it was so busy"
"Written July 7, 2023",Amazing place to visit,"Beautiful building with lots of fascinating things too see. The skeleton of the blue whale is amazing. The only down side was how busy the dinosaur exhibit was, it was hard to actually see anything well in there, perhaps timed tickets would be an idea to reduce the number of people going through at once as it is clearly a very popular area of the museum and also splitting up school groups into smaller numbers as sometimes it was hard to get around them."
"Written March 31, 2023",impossibly overcrowded and so stressful we had to leave after 30 minutes,"We arrived around 2pm on Friday and there was no queue so went straight in. Walking into the main entrance it did seem busy. We tried to go to the toilets but the queue was so big we gave up. We walked up the stairs to the minerals section and it felt like every exhibit was just in busy corridors with people standing blocking the way or walking in different directions, bumping into each other. It felt exactly like rush hour on the underground and I saw one of the other reviewers said similar. On top of that, of the few exhibits we did see, many seemed to be merely replicas/models and not actual specimens which was very disappointing. The map/signs were also confusing and unhelpful as they have various colour zones but there is no explanation of what these zones are. The whole place just seemed in total disarray.In the end fighting through hoards of people just became completely overwhelming so we gave up and left. So disappointed as had high expectations. British Museum was much better, although we did visit that on a Wednesday and I don't know if that made all the difference. Will not go back."
"Written March 31, 2022",Have you heard of virtual tour to beautiful cultural place?,"I visited The Natural History Museum of London virtually. Yes, you read right. I visited this beautiful place at my home. with the help of Google Art & Culture Application. I got a chance to see those incredible dinosaur skeletons and beautiful architecture. it was a nice experience using that Google Art & Culture App! but I found it troubling. while moving towards a side, as when you try to move in a particular direction. the app starts zooming that particular area. The rest of the experience was good. this app has so many features like you can take a photo and transform it with classic artworks, you can Discover portraits that look like you, you can Find art by using the colors of your photo, you can Wander through immersive galleries and get up close to art and much more. Their visual qualities and architecture details were so good."
"Written February 15, 2023",Enjoyed my little tour,"I had some spare time and decided to visit this museum, found it quite easy, it's off South Kensington underground station and the way to it is clearly signposted, it's a fair walk but not too bad. Entrance to the museum is free of charge, but you can contribute by donating at the entrance, that is highly appreciated by the museum staff. Staff in the museum is friendly and helpful. There are plenty facilities and local cafeteria as well. "
"Written May 28, 2023",Not all museums are created equal,"Not all museums are created equal, this one stands out. The atmosphere created by the architecture and fittings are a bit special and the exhibits are beautifully presented.  It was too hot, but this might be to preserve the artifacts, it was also overcrowded, but that's not surprising given what's on offer. Well worth visiting. "
"Written August 28, 2023",Busy! ,"As with most places in London I was fully expecting the museum to be full of life. It is still as breath taking as I remember from childhood, but oh my just so so many people. With my disabilities I found this to be a really unenjoyable experience, people pushing past me, banging into me, not giving me enough space to view and enjoy the exhibits. It was a shame as I was very much looking forward to reliving some of my childhood. If you can stand crowds and noise it is definitely worth a visit though as its beautiful "
"Written June 24, 2022","""Gargantuan""","As a Jurassic Park addict, as soon as I entered the main hall of the museum. It just reminded me of a movie “Night at the museum” don't ask me why. It is a gargantuan museum that has a place to display skeletons of the most famous lived animal t-rex to the largest living animal whale. The museum has a vast range of fossils, also skeletons of dinosaurs and mammals. The mastodon skeleton is my favorite, which helped me connect with the movie Ice Age. Lots of stuffed animals to check out. There is a display of two giraffes where one is just the skeleton of a giraffe and the other is a stuffed one which looks real. Then there is an elephant family from big ones to small that is such a great site to watch. Other than the objects displayed, the architecture of a building itself is a fruitful site to visit. Overall a must visit place in London."
"Written September 9, 2021",Amazing,"Fantastic museum with plenty on interesting displays for all age groups. Interactive pieces to support the artifacts and keep children engaged and entertained. All housed in a stunning building. The Fantastic Beasts which was an additional cost ticket was ok, but the rest of the museum was far more interesting. Especially the the dinosaur displays and creepy crawlies for the children. Highly recommended!"
"Written July 20, 2023",Always a wonderful day out,Having been to the Natural history museum as a child and again when my children were younger we went back on our own to revisit the museum. Something haven’t changed but there is so much that has which makes it worth coming back! A wonderful day out which never disappoints.
"Written August 31, 2022",Amazing Place,"What a wonderful place to visit. History in every corner. Amazing for the kids as well, there is so much to see and achieve.The staff was very friendly and some of them we could see how much they enjoy working on the Museum.Congratulations to all for the amazing work and dedication!!!"
"Written October 22, 2023",Free day out,Visited for our birthday weekend drip for daughter. It was brilliant to have some free things to do as it all adds up quite quickly. We had a great time though. 21/10/23 queued for around 30 mins. They said 5-10 mins from where we were but it was definitely longer - although not moaning. Annoyingly you can book tickets to go in and fast track everyone else (we didn’t know this!! Highly recommend going). Exhibitions were really cool. Interactive. Food was reasonably priced (expected it to be expensive but wasn’t as expensive as thought). Great day out! 
"Written September 2, 2023",Disapppointed. Purely due to heat and overcrowding. ,"So, I booked online in advance (for free) … when we arrived no one looked or checked and due to it being free people just walked in which is great BUT… it was so crowded we could barely see any exhibitions it was also HOT, so hot. Our experience was ruined and we couldn’t wait to leave to be honest. There was so many people and it was so warm I ended feeling unwell. The museum in itself is huge and looks like alot of effort has gone in and could be a good experience. "
"Written June 30, 2021",Everyone should visit!,"We absolutely love this place! This was our 4th visit and there's still more to see. So many amazing exhibits and plenty to keep children of all ages interested. Would highly recommend a visit.The only thing that disappointed me was when a rude customer in the coffee house decided to be very difficult, the manager, instead of defending his colleague, decided to pander to the shocking behaviour and reward the customer with free coffee. He was so spineless, he would have fitted in perfectly in the invertebrates exhibition. The message was very clearly ""treat my staff however you want and get rewarded for it"". I hope the young girl is ok."
"Written October 18, 2020",Lots to see ,You cannot experience the extent of the museum in one trip. There is plenty to see and learn about. Definitely a must see for visitors. In the winter they also hold an ice skating rink that is pleasant but better to use earlier as it is full of puddles later on in the day.
"Written August 20, 2022",Highly Recommend!,"I was totally amazed by this museum and the fact it is FREE! It isn’t normally my sort of thing-but I went along with my partner to visit and I’m so glad I did! I was mind blown! There is so much to see here, and is something for everyone. The museum is split up into different coloured zones each offering something different from dinosaurs, fossils, mammals, Attenborough section, rocks and rhinestones etc. There is so much to see and take in you definitely need to visit for a fun day out in London! Lots of toilet facilities available and lots of eating places available, although these are pricey-however in respect to the fact that this is a free event that is to be expected."
"Written November 21, 2022",Welcoming,"The building is magnificent, so many interesting details everywhere.  The children with us enjoyed many exhibits, particulaly the Dodo and also the dinosaurs.  We had lunch in the restaurant and the food was delicious and good value for money.  A lovely visit."
"Written September 13, 2022",Everyone should go,No matter how old or young you are the Natural History Museum is a place for all. With a lot to see and learn. The grand hall is my favourite place the details in the works of the building are extremely intricate. DON'T FORGET TO DONATE
"Written January 6, 2023",London's wonderfully curated free museum that explores the natural world,"Here is another place I have been to many times but I recently treated my nephews and niece to a day trip to London and the museum, including a dinosaur mad nephew. The museum is still free and that is what makes the NHM such a wonderful attraction in London. There's loads for kids to educate themselves with and hopefully they'll learn something too.The only disappointment for me was how crowded it was and how stiflingly hot the museum was on a very warm August day. I'd been a year earlier on a solo trip and it had been January. I would actually suggest there is no reason why you can't visit the museum out of holiday season. Not that i blame the NHM for allowing the crowds to flock in. Hopefully they get a good income from all the crowds in the summer. It is a wonderful UK institution and hopefully remains free for all time.I will note that you can donate to the museum but it is wonderful that it will always be there for everyone to enjoy, regardless of income. If you can afford to donate then please do so. It helps keep these attractions going."
"Written November 28, 2022",Can't wait to go again,"Last week we went on a school trip to the Natural History museum. We came by train to Victoria station, then took the underground.  It was an easy trip and the walk from the tube station to the museum was quick.The museum was cool and the exhibits were interesting. My favourite was the mammal exhibit and seeing the whale. We didn't get to see everything, so i would like to visit again. The earthquake simulator wasn't the best, but the rest was good.I recommend that family, friends and children should visit the Natural history Museum."
"Written September 26, 2021",If you like this sort of thing,"A few people said to go here so we did, no queues we went straight in, first thing I noticed was the staff were quite pushy for everyone to leave a £5 or £10 donation on entry, this was at entry point and I thought well let me see what its all about first and how good it is and then I will decide.Sorry to say it was pretty boring for me, I did not see anything that really took my interest, volcanos and earthquakes along with loads of rocks and dust movements.Apparently they get over 5 million visitors a year which is great for them, possibly because its free admission though, but its not for me."
"Written June 5, 2021",Nature’s wonders in an amazing setting,"We took our little ones for their first visit and as usual it didn’t disappoint. The booking process was simple and effective.We visited several galleries including the dinosaurs and they loved every minute.  They had fun learning about the amazing exhibits and enjoyed some of the interactive displays, making a volcano etc. Throughout the museum is immaculately clean.  There are numerous well stocked hand sanitisers. The cafe has a range of well priced snacks snd light meals.The guides were very friendly, keen to help and great with the kids."
"Written June 28, 2021",Unfairly treated,"Felt like without pre booking tickets was penalized unnecessarily forced to wait longer in large cue whilst pre booked ticket cue was empty for while. When entered had locked suitcase checked, bottle of open alcohol was inside from a few days in london sightseeing trip. Even tho it was not hidden and remaining in locked suitcase going in locker before walking around, was refused entry unless disposed, which even Houdini would of found impossible to take sip from, especially annoying when other visitor where told behind me carry on in without bags being checked. Very disappointing after great experience with other attractions."
"Written September 24, 2023",Far to many people,"Very disappointed with our first ever visit to the museum. I appreciate that the museum is free to get in and donations are voluntary however the museum was ridiculously full. My 8 year old walked in and wanted to walk straight back out. We barely saw anything as there was so many people in there that you couldn’t get close to anything to look at, take pictures. Nothing. We were in there 45 minutes and left. Every one pushing and shoving each other, it was so warm in there it was over whelming. Real spoilt our trip there and to be honest we wouldn’t be in a rush to go back. Not with numbers like that in there. Real shame"

Fantastic way to spend a few hours.,"a month agoIconic London museum which is a must see for the whole family.This stunning building houses a natural history collection dating back billions of years. It's a huge place with many different sections and it's very difficult to do the whole thing in one go. It's free though and you can come back again.Dinosaurs, human evolution, volcano and earthquake zones are just some of the things to see and enjoy. With a number of cafes, plenty of bathrooms and gift shops, there is something for everyone. The architecture of the actual museum is beautiful and we had an amazing time."
"Written June 21, 2021",Pleasant to go now it’s now so busy,"During covid times, it’s a much more pleasant experience- not too busy and bookable slots. We haven’t been for 15 years, and back then it was so busy you couldn’t really see all anything with small children. Now the kids are grown up and times are different, it’s clean, spacious and well signed. The toilets are spotless, cafes available ( we didn’t use) . My only criticism is it closes at 6, so we struggled to see everything and we arrived at 2.45."
"Written December 3, 2022",Fantastic day,"I visited the Natural History Museum with my 14-year-old son and it was certainly a day to remember!As we visited on a Friday, the Museum was not too busy, which meant we could have a leisurely walk round without having to rush. To get there, we travelled to London Bridge Station and got a black cab to the Museum. On the way, we saw plenty of London landmarks such as Trafalgar Square, the Shard and Tower Bridge.The Museum itself was incredibly interesting; the best parts were the massive Blue Whale skeleton and the dinosaur area. We ate in the T-Rex restaurant which offers a wide range of lovely food. I had a naked chicken burger and my son had a fish finger sandwich, both of which came with salad and chips.We would definitely recommend the Museum to others. We will visited again!!!!"
"Written October 8, 2023",Where's all the dinosaurs gone,"Very disappointed as I couple we both saw the museum when younger as it was amazing lots of dinosaurs everywhere in every room big and small but this time when we entered in the first huge hall there was only one dinosaur hung up in the air the whole floor was empty you could easily fill the floor with at least 5 big dinosaurs. We then went around the rest of the museum and saw other areas, rooms but no dinosaurs, finally saw the dinosaur section but was so small and only a few dinosaurs in there but of course not on the ground up off the floor and you had to follow a boring stupid path around the few dinosaurs you saw instead of them just being freely open to see. We saw the TRex and a few other dinosaurs but it had really changed to the way it use to be. It use to be and was so much better so many more dinosaurs. So where have they all gone. They had filled about 6 rooms up 3 with gift shops and 3 restaurants which in the past where filled with dinosaurs so we were very disappointed and we had done the whole museum in less than an hour which we thought would take 2-3hrs. They need to bring back the old museum the way it was before. Some rooms had a few pieces of art in which was wasted should have been filled with interesting dinosaurs. The national history museum needs to bring it back up to a 10 by bringing all dinosaurs back in the museum as before by filling the rooms not with gift shops and restaurants or bits of art but interesting dinosaurs!!! We were both so disappointed!"
"Written November 2, 2023",Great museum but be ready for the big crowd,"A great museum  with lots of things to do, make sure to plan which area you want to visit as it is very big and has lots od rooms and alleys to go through. It was during autumn break /half term break when we visited so it was very crowded. We booked our tickets online and that was such a good thing because there were people who have  been lining up for an hour and half.My son randomly found a lego activity where he had to design a home for him and a place of refuge for migrating birds. The museum.staff were very friendly and assisted him throughout.  This was such a grrat surprise we.didn't know of when we entered the museum.Though he profited from.the hakf term activitiy, I would suggest for first timers to avoid busy times here or book an earlier visit. The crowd was a bit of a turn off because you have to quickly go around to give way for others."
"Written January 9, 2023",Must do with small children,"We popped in on our way back to our hotel. It is a huge museum and there is a lot to see but I think younger children will appreciate more that teenagers as it was not much interactive. Also some displays are old. I think the museums will build more on the imagination of younger children. If you have small children (<12 yo) then you are good if not, then there are nicer museums to visit."
"Written August 5, 2023",A True History,"In July 2023,  i made a £7 donation to the Natural History museum. I will never forget that,  i went there to visit with my Grammer school from Manchester in the 1980s. The reason i made the donation and will continue to make donations is because its very educational rocks, Dinosours etc. I love the Natural History Museum, after all i was born on 4th July American independence day when George 3rd lost independence to the Americans. I therefore have Provinance to George 3rd and my surname Sharief means in Arabic Noble. I went to Paris to pay my respects to Princess Diana where the statue of liberty was built and given as a gift to the Americans. Thank you."
"Written March 29, 2023",Simply Amazing!,"Where to begin? Where to  end? This museum is outstanding.  The displays are compelling and fascinating!  From dinosaurs to mummy’s to unusual rocks. We could have spent a week there, or a month, or a year and seen only a fraction of the collected items.As a special treat we took a behind-the-scenes tour of Darwin’s Samples. Our small group was led by an experienced guide who showed us  specimens from jellyfish to platypus. To see the samples in alcohol was fabulous given the impact that Darwin had on science and life on Earth."
"Written November 5, 2023",Dangerously overcrowded ,"you simply could not enjoy a single thing at the museum because it was so crowded. my son almost got trampled at one point. so deeply disappointing for him, an avid nature and animal lover, we travelled from Ireland to visit the museum. I felt so tense and uneasy the entire time we were there and he felt frightened of the crowd so we left after an hour"
"Written February 13, 2022",Night at the museum,"We went to the museum's Valentine evening at last minute due to another event being cancelled due to Covid. But what a great evening. A glass of wine, wonderful harpist and a jazz band, screen printed a tote bag, stroked a snake and spoke to psssionate museum researchers. Seeing the beautiful museum in all its glory but less crowded was amazing. Definitely recommend it for 14th or next year if it is on. Didnt feel rushed at all so good value for money with activities and complimentary drink."
"Written April 5, 2022",Fabulous museum but dodge the prams and pushchairs,"Its a great museum. Sadly as its free, which is great it is so busy. Huge family groups with babies in prams, kids running around and generally really really busy. I was there with my eldest daughter who has fond memories of this great place when she was old enough to appreciate how  amazing it is."
"Written November 10, 2021",MAGNIFICENT!,I remember visiting the Natural History Museum as a child and always enjoying the many displays.It was great to return and check it out. There are many amazing things to check out including the dinosaur exhibition and the Mammal room. I really enjoyed the earthquake exhibition and also the many natural rocks. There are a few gift shops to visit to get yourself a souvenir of your visit. Definitely worth checking out!
"Written July 27, 2022",Too many people,"As a geology and geography student I had been to excited to visit this museum. Firstly, some of the museum was closed, which is completely fine because it’s so big. However you could not escape people, there were way too many people in this museum. Many school children running around and ruining it for others. I left early and didn’t see many parts. If this museum wasn’t free then I would definitely of been annoyed if I had paid for it."
"Written April 2, 2023",Impressing - and the Great Hall is fantastic,"The Natural History Museum is a magnificent museum with so much to see - for everyone. Of course, the dinosaur skeleton was the highlight for many. Personally, I was actually most impressed by the large hall where the blue whale skeleton hangs. An absolutely beautiful building! I stood for a really long time and just looked at the hall itself, but also all the details. I was ""awakened"" by a guard who whispered: I cannot see enough of the hall either - it was obvious what I was so fascinated by."
"Written August 17, 2022",Worth a visit - but don't go on weekends,"Certainly one of the most amazing museums in London, and it's huge! You'll need at least 4 hours based on my experience to ""see"" everything, but not in detail. Better plan a whole afternoon for the visit. The best time would be in the morning. Don't go on weekends, as it can become super crowded. Some areas are quite warm, make sure you carry some water with you. The museum is okay for kids, but it's quite a long visit so make sure you plan for enough breaks and entertainment."
"Written October 29, 2023",All things nature,"I love natural history museums and the NHM is my favourite of all. The builing is beautiful, the Hintze hall utterly impressive, and the latest Treasure galleries mesmerising. It's easy to get around and every now and then staff brings out some artefacts to show you and let you hold.It tends to get crowded during the weekend, so a weekday visit is best.They ran a Jurassic Park 30th anniversary pop-up shop which was whimsically fun."
"Written June 11, 2021",Poor social distancing management,"The museum exhibitions were fine, however I did not feel at all  Covid secure in several areas of the building...* No social distancing whatsoever in popular sections such as the dinosours zone.* No attempt by staff to limit the number of people entering the popular / busy areas.* Many children not wearing masks.* Insufficient hand sanitiser stations around the building.I felt a lot less safe than shopping in a supermarket or travelling on a train."
"Written August 15, 2022",Amazing experience and delicious food in the cafe!,This was amazing - from the displays to the food.  Even though is was FULL of people (summer holidays) the experience was fantastic.  So much to see and do.  The food in the restaurant was the best I have ever had in a museum - so much choice of delicious fresh food - the chef/chefs obviously love their job! Thank you!
"Written October 21, 2020",Loved it!,"I loved this museum. I've been wanting to go for a long time now and I'm so glad it finally happened. Quite often you look at places and it says you will spend this much time at the venue and generally it ends up a lot less than stated. NHM say 4 hours. We were in here longer. There is so much to see, so much to learn. I think a forgotten area of the museum is the zoology area. Personally, this was one of my favourite parts but my interests are within this. But it is amazing to look in jars and see how well animals and plants have kept over the years. "
"Written August 7, 2023",Wouldn't come back.,"Absolutely heaving inside,clearly don't limit the numbers of people coming in to actually make the place enjoyable. Can't really see any of the attractions because of the mounds of people already looking at them,hence why limiting the number of people who come in would be a good idea. Boiling hot inside don't think there is any air conditioning. Place isn't clearly signposted to find where all the exhibits are. Did expect a lot more from this museum,and won't return."
"Written June 14, 2022",Loved the dinosaur and earthquake exhibits,"This is a must visit while in London.  We liked this more than the other museums.  The dinosaur exhibit was fantastic.  Very educational (as was every exhibit) and plenty of large scale models.  Felt like I was living in the age of dinosaurs.  The earthquake and volcano exhibits were also exceptional.  One of the rooms simulates the shaking that happens during an earthquake.  They also have insect exhibits, ""Sea Monster"" and Coral Reef exhibits.  All are excellent.  Best to allow an entire day for your visit.  "
"Written July 20, 2023",Titanosaur exhibition totally over gamified. Not suitable for adults.,"Sadly, the exhibition is totally over-gamified.  To find out information you have to play games, lift flaps, pump fake hearts.  Why can't we just read that information? The gamification just means it takes more time to learn anything and if you're in the middle of trying find something out, some little brat comes along unsupervised and takes over randomly pushing buttons or flipping things over not learning anything at all.  And of course you can't say anything to a child these days. Sadly, this is the way of most of the rest of the museum: not designed for adults at all, and pitched at children who are allowed to run riot and are unlikely to learn anything. The two stars are for 1) the art work of the titanosaur exhibition which is delicately beautiful and 2) the actual construction of the exhibition  in modular form so it can be transported easily. I'm afraid 0 for content.  It really is not worth the £16. "
"Written July 22, 2022",Not to be missed,"We took our 4 year Granddaughter here to see the cbeebies Andy's Prehistoric adventures clock, which we did. However, she loved every part of the museum, including all of the animals and interact activities. Will definitely visit again, not to be missed. Book your tickets online before your visit."
"Written February 23, 2020",Exceptional and it is free!!,"You can spend a full day here if you wish there is so much to discover and it is all for free, because of this it is naturally busy but the flow of people is constant and well organised.  There are places to get a drink and food and of course gifts too.  If nothing else just be in awe if the architecture."
"Written March 27, 2022",This is a wonderful place to visit,"The animatronics  are really amazing - makes the dinos look real. Its a great learning experience for children. We went to it as the V & A Museum ended up being closed that day and this is right next to it. Had not had it on our list of things to do, but we are sure glad we went and we will go back again"
"Written July 26, 2023",To busy,"We had booked timed tickets for 2pm but were told we could go in at any time!! What is the point of timed tickets?This resulted in masses of people, not really an enjoyable experience and the extortionate prices the cafes charge did not help things. A shame that Dippy was not there "
"Written August 2, 2022",So much to see,"We had a great couple of hours exploring the museum, lots to see and do. Being free however there were lots of people to compete with to see past! It was just too busy for us, you'd wind up waiting ages for a go to see something and then felt rushed when reading or whatever. It really was fantastic though, so many things to see and read about, but maybe limiting the numbers would benefit?"
"Written October 2, 2023",Amazing place to spend an hour or a day,"Fantastic place to enjoy as adults, teens and kids. We had not limited time so we concentrated on the Treasures Gallery and the dinosaurs. I loved the opportunity they gave to touch and feel examples of the objects on display. Don’t forget to admire the architecture and watch the stonework inside and out, there is a menagerie of animals carved lovingly into the stonework.Better still it’s free!!! So even if you only have an hour you can pop in and see a few items even if you can’t explore everything you might want to see."
"Written June 26, 2022",Very Busy Midweek ,"Very busy full of school kids (midweek in June) and not many maps to find your way around - £1 for a paper map.  We eventually found the dinosaur exhibit which was disappointing, a one way system round a room crammed full far too much info and not much exhibits, very busy and frustrating/hot.We then gave up and left as it wasn't a pleasant experience.No idea why we had to book tickets (free), stood outside and booked on phone and then someone glanced at it on the way in.I'm sure it would be better on a quieter day or if there was more room to allow people to walk more freely."
"Written February 19, 2022",The  Wildlife Photographic Exhibition.,"This exhibition was absolutely stunning. 100 protographs, displayed at one metre wide as backlit tranparencies.  The most amazing pictures There are many very talented photographers out there, some children's work on show too. If you like stunning photographs, go and see it. "
"Written October 13, 2023",Worst museum I‘ve ever been to.,"Worst Museum ever… First of all it was extremely crowded and loud. More like a theme park vibe than a museum. It was impossible to stand and read and look at the exhibits.But even if it wasn‘t so crowded, it would be dissappointing since most of the exhibits are replicas or cheap plastic figures.The building itself is extremely pretty and it‘s sad they wasted the possibility to create an amazing museum.The donation booths are at the entrance and they know why; if they would be at the exit, no one would donate a single penny for that.Safe your time and energy and don‘t go there."
"Written August 23, 2023",A PILGRIMAGE TO SEE DINOSAURS,"No wonder this museum is regarded as one of the most successful and important museums in the World; arguably, the best.Visiting, yet again, with our Grandson, who at nine years old, couldn't 'get enough' of everything - he was like a kid in a candy store!It's great to see cutting-edge methods of interaction, with the public, is being used, ensuring the quality of the experiences are maximised, whilst leaving a lasting impression of the knowledge gleaned during a visit.I feel, a visitor could come to London, and easily spend a week soaking up the knowledge and experiences!"
"Written August 25, 2022",Too busy,It was unbelievably busy and hot when we visited today. What's the point in booking for entry when this isn't adhered to and vast crowds are allowed in. We couldn't see the exhibits and it made for an unpleasant experience. Shame as we were looking forward to going.
"Written December 23, 2022",A historical wonderland.,"The Natural History Museum is a must-see when visiting London. I had the experience of a lifetime. It is a treasure trove of history. It has a large collection of dinosaurs, humans, animals, and insects. I witnessed the history of the existence of humans and animals. I also got to visit the massive sculptures of dinosaurs that were made up of real fossils and the real skulls of human evolution. It also has an earthquake room, where I got to experience a real earthquake. It has so many things that amaze me, and I don’t think any other museum has them. I recommend this place to every history lover out there."
"Written April 9, 2023",Great museum with loads to experience,"Loads to see, and clearly laid out and labelled.  Dinosaurs, mammals, sea creatures, insects etc.  Very informative.  We really liked the earthquake simulation and also the house of insects.  Free entry, but we were then harangued as we entered by a member of staff who shouted at us that the museum was a charity and we should make a donation via the card readers.  It was a bit over the top and not the greatest welcome.  Maybe better to ask people to give on the way out after an enjoyable visit?"
"Written February 24, 2023",Need to see to believe,"What a great venue for a day out for all age ranged. Interactive displays for children, plenty to keep their imagination active. Good food areas lots of choice not too expensive either. Free access therefore made a donation to maintain this invaluable experience for all"
"Written October 23, 2021",Great place but very Covid unaware,"The Natural History Museum well what can I say. The museum itself is a wealth of knowledge and great fun……however.  We booked tickets after the website assured us they were timing visits to avoid crowds and be Covid friendly. We arrived at our allotted time, joined a big queue and eventually got in. The place was so busy you could hardly move. We went straight to the dinosaur exhibit as that was the one thing we really wanted to see but what a mistake that was.. it was literally a crush of people most of whom weren’t wearing masks, no social distancing at all and once in you were stuck with hundreds of other people in very close contact. After we escaped from that hell we thought we would get a cuppa, no chance it was rammed. Off we went to the next exhibit making use of the hand sanitiser which would have been great if they had anything in them. We left the museum after less than two hours as it was a dose of Covid waiting to happen.I would absolutely go back but not while I didn’t feel Covid safe."
"Written July 13, 2023","Too busy, overcrowded","It would have been a good visit as lots of interesting exhibitions to see but difficult to look at anything properly and in your own time etc, mainly due to how over crowded it was.  Especially difficult when with young children.  There needs to be something done to control the huge numbers attending, through school trips and bookings.  We noticed no checks were being made on the pre-booked attendance time slots, so that could be a factor also."
"Written November 3, 2022",Good but way too busy,"The museum was extremely busy which detracted from the experiences.  A huge amount of kids jostling you to push buttons, stand in front of you etc etc.That said I really enjoyed what I saw but I did cut my trip short due to how busy it was, I entered on a pre booked ticket at 10.30.I would certainly come back and hope I was just unlucky about how many people were there on the day.  Some great things to see.I have given 4 stars on the basis this trip was free apart from the ‘voluntary’ donation.  If I had paid for it I would have been unhappy with the jostling."
"Written August 28, 2023",Must do when in London,"Absolutely utterly fantastic half day out (if id been alone I could have been there all day). Only downside was it was so so very hot inside, and so very uncomfortable. Paid extra for titanosaur, which was incredible and my 5 year old said was “the best by miles”. Although you still get a great experience in the “normal” dinosaur room. I could have spent hours in there reading every last bit. Staff so friendly, displays out of this world, cafe lovely but (obviously) overpriced but you don’t mind as they have to make their money some way. They had a Lego event on which was fantastic too and my son was thrilled beyond measure. It’s even a pleasure just to be stood outside the building as it is so very beautiful. An absolute must do."
"Written March 28, 2023",Dinsoaurs! Roar!,"It looks like a great place. I've been a few times but we never get further than the dinosaur skeletons. My cousin just stomps around and makes roaring sounds at the skeletons, pretending he's a big scary dinosaur like them. I've always worried they'll kick us out but they've always been really good about it all. We always avoid the busiest times though. "
"Written August 3, 2022",Hot mess,I have been to the museum previous times and had a great time but when I visited yesterday with my 3 children one of whom has special needs it was not great. Trying to cram everyone in like sardines which became a massive sweat box. Couldn’t even look at anything because way too many people. My special needs son loves dinosaurs but couldn’t get to look at anything properly so had to leave because he wasn’t coping. Such a shame
"Written January 1, 2020",Dino Snores overnight experience,"Dino snores is an appropriate name, snoring reverberates around the place during the night. Activities are well organised but feels much more like an educational experience than the adventure advertised. Overall, I love the museum and would consider this a once in a lifetime experience, happy I have survived it and less keen to do it again. "
"Written May 1, 2022",A huge museum full of many things to see,"The museum is huge, bigger then any museum I’ve ever seen! It has a huge selection of minerals if that’s your thing, not mine personally but wow, so many minerals it makes you get a bit dizzy trying to look at them all. You also have fossils, skeletons of dinosaurs and other animals and they are impressive! I didn’t really understand the wildlife part, seemed to not have many actual things to see and and the wildlife garden was nothing special at all. Overall a huge place with loads to see and it’s free!"
"Written December 17, 2022",The Building and its exhibits are amazing,Visited the museum with family and we really enjoyed our experience.Before going Dippy was the main exhibit we wanted to see but we were all mesmerised by the amazing building itself.Dippy and all the other exhibits were wonderful to see.
"Written August 23, 2022",Over crowded and unpleasant to visit.,"Way to manny people admitted and the poor air conditioning made the visit uncomfortable.  Limited seating through exhibitions for older people or those with disabilities. Not an enjoyable visit.  The positive was that there was lots for kids to interact with and look at, they appeared to be having a great time."
"Written December 14, 2022",A must visit for London!,"A must visit for London!The building itself is quite magnificent, and the museum has a large collection of dinosaurs, animals, insects, and even plants! The main hall itself will wow you upon entering. There is food within the museum - I visited the TRex restaurant which provides table service after you order at the counter. A much needed respite from all the walking in the museum!"
"Written February 25, 2020",Wonderful Free Museum!,"I wasn't really sure what to expect going in. I thought it might just be another dull museum full of glass cabinets of fossils, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The exhibits were beautifully presented in really creative ways that drew you in and made you want to learn about what you were looking at. Everything was really well kept and looked after and despite the exhibits themselves everything felt very modern and exciting! Loads to look at and interact with, all for free! Fantastic morning/afternoon out, I would really recommend it. Maybe just don't go on a Saturday. It was very busy and claustrophobic. I had to leave in the end as I was finding it hard to breathe in the dinosaur exhibit there were so many people."
"Written December 20, 2022",This museum is incredible!,"I can't believe I've never visited it. Plus, it's FREE. I went on a Monday at 2pm, it wasn’t too crowded. I didn’t book online and I didn’t waitIt is perfect for children, but also for adults! I loved it and will definitely go back next time I'm in London, also because this time I was in a hurry. I entered from the side entrance, so as soon as I entered I found this huge escalator that was really fascinating.What amazed me was the ""Kobe Supermarket"" where the disastrous Kobe earthquake that my family experienced was simulated. (January 17, 1995)"
"Written December 21, 2020",So informative,I had an amazing time at this FREE museum. I have been a few times but every time I go there seems to be something different. Despite the COVID restrictions shutting down some of the tactile displays I still had a great time with my friend. 
"Written January 6, 2020",The best place in London,"The best place in London, you have to go and see this great exhibition. Of course the dinosaurs has the main project but all the others was extremely wonderful. You have to go very early in the morning about 9:30 to avoid the que. The opening is 10:00-18:00.Have in mind to spend about three-four hours for the exhibition."
"Written November 7, 2022",Great for adults and children alike,"Free to access. Soo much to see: Dinosaurs, animals, plants, creepy crawlies, historical information, stones/geology and precious stones/jewels section. This is just what we managed to see, there were other sections we will visit on a future visit. Great for adults and children. Lots of interactive displays which engage the children (compared to other museums like the British Museum). We had a great day spending about 5 hours, but could have spent longer. The original building alone is beautiful and worth the visit, Several toilets available, all spotless despite busy with visitors. Staff very helpful. Definite must visit for anyone heading to London. "
"Written September 25, 2023",You're Letting too many people in,"This museum is amazing. Have not been for about 20 years, and enjoyed it a lot. But there are far too many people in there. You can not really stop and look at anything properly, becuase you ar ebeing shoved along by the throng of the masses. The only way to see something is to be ignorant and stand your ground, and that is not me. The building itself is also amazing, if you do go remeber to look up as well as all the exhibits. Didn't pay for any of the attractions, there's enough to see without that."
"Written March 30, 2023",Australian tourist in London,Amazing Museum to see we have a 10yr old and 12yr old child and the loved how interactive the museum was with dinosaurs and other animals. The Japanese earth quake was also a hit!! Also can recommend the pizza in the cafe loved it!
"Written October 5, 2023",Our oldest son loved it,"Last time we were was a couple of years ago and without children, since we did not have them ar that point. It was great to be back, this time with our children. Our oldest son loved the dinosaurs gallery, almost a week after our visit he’s still talking about it. It’s great that this is one of the wonderful free museums in London. My only point of feedback was that we had tickets with a time slot, but nobody bothered checking them."
"Written October 13, 2020",Interesting and informative ,"We had around 3 hours, nice and quiet, plenty of space, lots of touch point cleaning, so felt very safe. Spent most of our time in the Volcanoes and Earthquakes exhibit. Really well done and informative. Had a great time. Thankyou "
"Written May 1, 2023",Interesting museum - must visit,"The museum's premises are large, with various exhibitions. The entrance to the Earth evolution exhibition is interesting and unique, like enterning the core of the planet. One thing I enjoyed was the simulation of an earthquake in a mock-up store. I found it quite creative. Unfortunately, we arrived late and didn't have time to visit the other building, with the dinosaurs exhibitions. There is no entrance fee, which was surprising considering the exhibits."
"Written February 12, 2022",Great family day out,Loved the dinosoar exhibition. Was great. Jusy wished you could book accessible times for it and not have so many people in at once. was hard to see some of the attraction in that area. the staff were brilliant and helpful. the other exhibitions were really stunning and thought provoking.
"Written July 7, 2023",Excellent place to visit,"This museum is free to enter, although donations are encouraged, and worth it just for the spectacular classical building.The dinosaur exhibit was great - lots of fossils and life sized working models of dinosaurs. The other exhibits are slightly more mixed - plenty of stuffed animals, full sized models of animals and an interesting volcano and earthquake exhibit, although some of the items are slightly tired.There are lots of food and beverage outlets and shops and it is a brilliant place to take children for the day."
"Written March 18, 2023",One of the world's best natural history museums,"The Natural History Museum aims to educate and entertain. The range of exhibits is mind-boggling. The historic Exabition Hall is wonderful. Children love the dinosaur exhibits, which are very well presented. It's best to book tickets online to avoid the queue. Entry is free, but donations are welcome."
"Written August 1, 2023",Too busy! Couldn't enjoy it. Pre-booked tickets worked well for us.,"I visited with my 12 year old son. It was sooo busy! You couldn't move freely around exhibits, which made it difficult to view and very hot. The weather was wet outside, so I dread to think how it would be on a hot day. They had fans on but it wasn't enough. If the museum restricted visitors a little it would be a wonderful place to visit. We ended up leaving not long after getting there.We pre-booked our tickets which worked well - we walked straight in."
"Written February 15, 2023",Crowded!,"Was there on a saturday, booked tickets the day before and earliest was 13.15. To say this place was crowded is an understatement. Way too many people to enjoy everything. I found the dinosaurs the most interesting, but in that room you were stuffed like fish in a barrel. It's nice to have been there, but I have been to museums that I liked alot better."
"Written June 4, 2023",Great museum,"Beautiful museum, lots to see and we were lucky to visit during half term and there were a couple of dinosaur related activities and shows for the children, the show in particular was great and very funny. The museum building itself is stunning. Staff were helpful. Didn't have to queue as we prebooked tickets, but queue for those that didn't have tickets was crazy."
"Written September 8, 2023","Nice, but expected a bit more","We expected a bit more to be honest, we felt the museum is mostly for children and doesn't have that much on display, given the colossal building size  (for example no insects were on display in the 'creepy crawlies' and a large part of the museum is about vulcanos and earthquake). Does have a lot of rocks in the earth exhibition. None the less it was a nice visit, dinosaurs are worthwhile and impressielve main halls. "
"Written September 12, 2023",New gems everytime,"Decided to go late this time to try and beat the crowds, this somewhat worked, but still very popular. There is just so much to see here, it's really not just for kids. The formidable teeth and claws tap into my inner child (as this has been and is a family favourite). But these days I make a beeline for the small room just up the stairs at the far end of the main hall. This innocuous little room holds just a few objects but the greatest treasures in the museum, maybe the greatest treasures of natural history. My favourites are:The first discovered dinosaur bonesA first edition of Darwin's controversial masterpiecePressed flowers from Captain Cook's voyagePenguin eggs from Scot's trip to the Antarctic I would go on... but I really don't think you can top connecting with that sort of iconic history"
"Written August 19, 2021",A collection of history and science not to be missed,"Visited a few times before but took the kids this time, I’ll be honest this whilst still amazing was my worst visit. They haven’t relaxed enough post COVID, the missing dinosaur in main hall is a total disappointment and the rip off that is the magical beasts is not worth the money. That said the normal standard collections, information and history is amazing as ever"
"Written October 26, 2022",October Half Term Visit,"The Natural History museum is always worth a trip.  Visiting with my adult daughter who last visited when she was a young teenager brought back happy memories.  The dinosaurs will always be my favourite, Dippy is Back and I love the Blue Wale and the vast skeletons of these long gone creatures.  The earth zone is wonderful with its insight to Volcanos and how the earth works and is a home to us all.  The displays on the evolution of the human species are so engaging and interesting.  Always worth how ever long you can spend in it and always worth the short queueing time, unless you are smart enough to pre-book ticket entry.  Entry is free and you are ensured of wealth of memories of your visit.  "
"Written October 18, 2022",Old fashioned and boring,"I found the museum very disappointing. The building itself is impressive and the blue whale in the great hall is worth a look.The dinosaur exhibit is boring and very old fashioned. And you can’t have a proper look at the skeletons because most of them are behind glass, up in the air or in a cramped space.The mammal exhibit was closed when we was visiting.I prefer the national history museum in Berlin at all times, if you have been there skip the London museum and spend your time elsewhere."
"Written September 11, 2022",Excellent museum with items from thousands of years to recent collections,"A lot of exhibits to look at, very intresting, kids would also love it. Make sure you have good shoes as the musuem is massive and if you want to see it all, there would be a lot of walking.I would say give at least 3 hours planning time if you want to see it all, especially if you do read some items."
"Written August 22, 2022",Great Place,"Amazing that this place is available to visit for all (donation apply). Could easily spend a week here absorbing information! 4 star review given because the place is too dark and overbearing in places, packed with people and stifling hot!!! Not a comfortable visit. Food from cafe a bit pricey,especially if you have a family."
"Written January 9, 2023",Nice but old,"Educational and interesting. I particularly like the gem collection, which is the largest I’ve ever seen. However some information boards and interactive devices are old and sometimes not functional/broken, eg for some fossil display and the section on mammals. I hope they could renovate at least this section a bit because visitors might expect better."
"Written November 22, 2021",Don’t bother with the Fantastic Beasts Exhibition!,"Only leaving a review for The Fantastic Beasts exhibition that you have to pay for. Almost £100 for 6 of us. A complete waste of money, a few things from the film thrown in with other stuff. Don’t bother, just go and look at all the other stuff for free. I know they have to try and make money but charge far far too much for what it is. Very disappointing."
"Written July 3, 2023",Titanosaur exhibition ..........wow!,"Went specifically for the Titanosaur exhibition.  We were not disappointed. Having so much hands-on information was engaging for the children, especially having staff around to encourage handling and discussion about specific items, such as jaw bones, all leading to the main exhibit.  "
"Written July 5, 2023",Stunning Museum,"Stepping into the main hall is absolutely stunning - the architecture and huge skeleton of a Blue Whale suspended from the highest level provides endless views and photo opportunities!We really enjoyed the Gemstone and Mineral Gallery with the gorgeous oak  display cases from 1881, especially the 9,381 carat flawless blue topaz gemstone and real gold nuggets!Don’t miss The Vault at the end of the room for even more rare and beautiful gems."
"Written September 12, 2021",An attraction on our London attraction itinerary,Spent 3 hours here. The David Attenborough part for really good in respect to the current state of the planet. Not too impressed with the museum overall. Probably not what we really expected therefore more research prior to the visit would have been beneficial
"Written August 8, 2022",Good experience but ridiculously crowded,"Great selection of things to see, learn and do. Very educational and fun but the museum was ridiculously crowded. We felt like sardines in a can, you almost couldn't even walk through the people, not speaking about seeing anything. So come during week days/early (we were there on Sunday morning). However the staff and the organization are great, toilets and seats everywhere, water fountains etc."
"Written August 21, 2023",Titanosaur overpriced,"NHM has always been a family favourite and I am now taking my gandchildren. They are still at the dinosaur stage but do get something from other exhibits. Main focus of the visit today was the Titanosaur exhibition. This is well done and the kids enjoyed it BUT it was dear and there were few genuine exhibits - mainly  screen based exhibits. As an adult if I had paid full price for myself I would not have found it good value. Also it is ""exit through the gift shop"" which makes buying a toy hard to avoid - but be warned a model titanosaur is £22!!Overall I think some exhibits feel a little worn out and some have been replaced by shops. A bit more of staff explaining and interacting would be appreciated to add life to some galleries."
"Written August 28, 2023",History in a building,"It is astounding how much history you can cram into 1 place.   The exhibits are extraordinary and some breathtaking. I particularly liked the collection of gems and the gigantic tree as a focal point, but the whale dinosaur at the heart of the building is a nice touch. It is very confusing to navigate if you don't have a map and very easy to get lost due to the enormous size of the building."
"Written January 11, 2020",Truly horrible ,"I've been to many a museum in my life, and this was such a disappointment. I went there for the dinosaurs, looking forward to a waste selection of great specimens being displayed in various ways. What I got can be best described as a McDonalds display crammed into 1 small room where kids and adults were pushed through tight walkways while looking at plastic casts and just boring displays I was in Vienna, Austria and their museum before Christmas....1000 times better. Class, amazing pieces. This was utter garbage "
"Written June 4, 2021",Great place to visit,Came here with 2 five year olds and a 10 year old. So much to see and we had a fabulous time. After the kids had seen the dinosaurs however they got a bit bored but we had done most of the museum so not too bad. Such a good time though and would come back again. Would be great to see more interactive things for the children and I must say that the staff were lovely and very knowledgeable
"Written November 20, 2023",Patagotitan,"First visit for a long time to see the Titanasaur exhibition. Not the best signed exhibition had to ask to find out where it was. However, once there it was very well laid out, the displays before seeing the main exhibit were highly informative and interactive. You suddenly come into the central part and see the enormous skeleton, I especially liked the little fact boxes in the floor. Sadly did not have much time after the exhibition but will be back a lot sooner."
"Written October 18, 2021",Very Impressive.........,"I always wanted to visit this place especially as the Victoria and Albert museum is across the road to here an so if you have 3/4 hours spare it is perfect to visit both and you will not be disappointed, as i wasn't. I briskly walk around an that took me just under 2 hours.The amount of animals/skeletons that are on display here is amazing, obviously, everybody is different an so certain areas of this museum will appeal to different interests. Personally i found the dinosaurs interesting and the section on Earthquakes - there is a interactive Japanese shop which you stand in and it moves, so you get the full experience of what it is like in when an earthquake hits.Ideal for solo or family visits especially if you have children as there are alot of interesting things to see as this is a massive building.There are plenty of amenities with toilets dotted about and places to eat and drink.A big thumbs up - highly recommend a visit to anyone who is thinking of going - just go!, it is free and it is interesting too!"
"Written February 23, 2020",I love this place,"This place is amazing!!! You can’t see everything in one day, anyway if you have time only for couple hours it is fine. If you have more time will be amazing.I suggest to plan your visit a few month before, so you can find on website some extra activities as silent disco, yoga... it is an amazing experience!!!!"
"Written August 4, 2022",Extremely busy,"This is a great place to visit and Dippy was fantastic to see again! A great free trip out in London that I will more than likely do again.While this was a lovely experience it was damped by the fact that it was so busy that I missed a few displays. You don’t have to book tickets online you can just turn up though it will be a longer wait to get in if you haven’t booked online. Though this is pretty pointless as nobody checks your time-slot so I don’t really understand the point in picking a time. It is also very, very hot throughout. The dinosaur exhibit was unbearable at one point with us all cramped in their so if you are to visit when warm bring lots of water. I went to buy a drink and it was £2.50 for a single can of Diet Coke! However there was a free refillable water station that I and others made the most of."
"Written November 21, 2023",too many people ruined the experience,"The museum in it self is easily 5 stars! But the whole experience is really disappointing. They encourage you to book a time slot for entering, but they let everybody in. There were SO many people that you can’t walk anywhere without bumping in to someone. I love a free museum but would gladly pay if that meant there would be fewer people. we visited on a monday morning. i can’t imagine what it would be like in the weekend. but if you have lots of time and patience it’s an amazing place!"
"Written August 13, 2021",Good day out,"It was really busy which meant people were walking in all directions, getting in the way of what you are trying to look at. The museum is great and there’s a lot to see however we didn’t really know which way to go in order to see everything. Food was very expensive."
"Written June 15, 2022","Vast, wonderful, fascinating museum","I spent from 10 AM to 1:30 PM here but could've spent much more time! I visited on the 1st day back, though in temporary display, for Dippy the Dinosaur. For decades Dippy was in the main hall, then he went on tour & replaced by a whale. I don't understand why the plan is to place Dippy somewhere else that is not in the museum? I ate in a beautiful cafe, a sandwich, and only later found in the more modern wing, there's a cafe with hot food available. Directional signs need to be improved. In the mammal hall, I could not find certain animals, staff later explained those rooms were not then opened, but that was not clear from signs or map."
"Written May 17, 2022",Dinosnores for Adults,"Amazing experience, although had to queue, it was handled well.  They split you into different groups so that you have timings for you to visit the different activities going on and it worked really well..............go team Raptor.It was a fun evening and I even got to see exhibits I had missed before.  Only one downside.............the evening meal.  Aside from being cramped at the tables (a table that was for 8 had 10 people on it) and the slow service, menu choice was poor.   I could have understood if the food choices were for a reason such as sustainability or to encourage everyone to try vegetarian but it was an odd mix............starter Superfood Salad or Tuna Sashimi, main Duck leg, Baked Aubergine or Vegetarian Lasagne and desert (most normal of choices) of either Baked Cheesecake or Drizzle Cake.   Was definitely ready for my breakfast which was lovely and the organisation was much better.Would definitely recommend this once in a lifetime experience."
"Written July 12, 2022",Not even worth it for free! ,"OMG AVOID! Total joke, we booked tickets in advance because it said there was limited access due to covid. When we got there they just waved everyone in, didn't check tickets of anyone. The place was packed like a night club, we couldn't even keep the family together it was so packed. Almost imposible to look at anything. We had to leave or we would lose one of the kids. No covid precautions, nothing. I'm angry."
"Written January 10, 2020","Great Experience, Great Building, Will go again","Love the building, packed with dinosaurs, animals, rocks, something for everyone.Eating areas get very busy at lunchtime so would suggest you eat early or late (especially if you need several seats).One of my favourite museums, great bit of culture !"
"Written November 1, 2023",Great Experience !,"Natural History Museum is located West side of London’s Heart and few minutes walking from Hyde Park.From there, you can access Kensington Palace (Queen Victoria Birth Place) and Princess Diana’s Memorial.A very important tip is to book online. This is completely free and you will skip the file which can take more than 30mn.The Museum is very big with very nice areas to visit as Dinosaurus places, I ce Era zone or the Mineral exposition.You can do it in 1h00-2h00 depending on how we like it but it gives you very clear and easy to understand explanations about Animal Wild, species classifications….Definitely a visit to include during your stay even with Kids."
"Written August 18, 2023",INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE,"I was in this museum in July and I have to say that its contents are breathtaking. Here we can learn a little about the history of our species as Man, as well as its evolution. It really is a must. Reserve about 3 hours to be able to see everything. Best thing is that it’s free admission"
"Written March 14, 2022",TOO MANY PEOPLE !,"Had booked tickets as website stated no entry without, timeslot was 2.30 and  when arrived the queue outside was huge. No instructions about going to head of queue for admittance as imagined everyone had adhered to the rules!      Tried asking at head of queue and was allowed in with tickets.on entering the building it was heaving with people! This surprised me as not everyone had a ticket surely there where hundreds and hundreds of people. The dinosaur exhibit was a mass of bodies moving forward and at no point would you have been able to actually stop to see the exhibits.it was a more akin to an exodus from a football match!        We gave up and left ,so disappointed that the ticketing system wasn't being used ,seems all rules are off and coming out of a Pandemic I really felt quite uncomfortable. Disappointed  "
"Written May 6, 2020",Amazing!,"I have been to the natural history museum a few times, and each time I have loved it! It is great for any types of trips! eg: family, school, holidays etc. The exhibitions are amazing and really educational. And there is often a limited time exhibition on. I would definitely recommend!"
"Written June 18, 2022",Dont visit on a summer day - No air conditioning,"Hot Stuff Crowded.  No air conditioning rude staff and dated exhibitions.Went to see Dippy, what a disappointment!.  Had a ask at the information desk as to exactly where this famous dinosaur was located, as there was no signs anywhere.What a shock when finally located.  stuck in a side room, with multi coloured lights flashing on and off it.No where as re,emembered when it was in the main entrance hall.Museum not exactly disabled friendly steep steps everywhere inside."
"Written August 24, 2022",Go at a quieter time,"The museum itself is lovely, there is a lot to see and do. Unfortunately we didn't get to see hardly any of it as it was unbelievably busy. A lot of the time it was like herd mentality, we were just getting pushed along with the crowd not being able to stop to properly read anything or take it in. "
"Written July 24, 2022",Visit,It was amazing experience. One of the most beautiful building I have ever visited. I totally adore tiny little details of the museum building. Also exhibitions were really interesting. The one and only fault was The number of visitors. I think they could regulate it for better experience.
"Written November 6, 2021","Accessible museum, good variety of exhibitions, 3-4h visit","Good museum, plenty to keep you busy for 3-4h. Pay entry through donation. Very accessible for people with limited mobility (only 1 room had slightly tricky bumpy floor and there are plenty of lifts, although there could be improvements to the wheelchair accessible toilets). Note that the museum lends wheelchairs if you need one. The exhibition on the future of the planet was interesting, although I feel it just scratches the surface. It is accessible for people with limited previous knowledge, ok to do with kids too. "
"Written October 16, 2022",Unbearably hot,"We were really looking forward to visiting the museum with our 3 children and booked online as advised. We went on a Saturday and it was extremely loud and busy but worst of all it was unbearably hot, so much so that we left after about half an hr. A real shame. I'm sure it's brilliant...sadly impossible to take in under those conditions."
"Written March 7, 2020",Engaging for even the most restless of children and adults alike,"It's also extremely good to hire for a party if you're a company. By day, though, the exhibits are displayed in such a way to really engage everyone, and I can attest to this. It is the antidote for anyone who says that museums are boring, as this is absolutely not."
"Written February 14, 2020",A Treat for sure!,"You'll love this building, and the architecture is a must see.  For anyone new to the museum scene it is a great trip with kids.  Only draw back is once you have been to the Museum of Natural History in NYC, this one waivers a little, but still a beautiful place to see!!"
"Written July 26, 2023",Mornings recommended,Visited 21th of july. A long line got in fairly fast. I checked the dinosaurs first since I expected them to get crowded sooner or later. In about half an hour it started raining at the crowds came in. Good thing I was already out exploring the other exhibitions. Overall the museum was great.
"Written May 4, 2020",A must for children and adults!,Been a few years since I visited the Natural History Museum and it’s still a fascinating place. Good to see the massive blue whale skeleton was still there and the dinosaur area is a big hit with kids. Suggested donations at the entrance but it’s still free if you like.
"Written July 31, 2023",wide range of exhibits,The museum is fantastic with a wide range of exhibits. You'll need about 3-4 hours to see everything. It's essential to book your tickets online and select your visit day and time to avoid long queues.
"Written May 15, 2022",Visit was a hit but........,"No booking checks on arrival so didn't need to book an entry time. Some of the exhibits were taken off display for conservation.Very busy and a lot of the large exhibits needed a good dusting.Only saw hand sanitiser at the entrance and nowhere else.Still impressive in a wonderful building and kids were enthralled, so overall it was a hit."
"Written May 28, 2022",Avoid!!,"Horrendous experience never to be repeated. Like many others it seems this place left us fingers totally underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time. The crowds were unbelievable. I can't see how when there is a booking system in place? It was difficult finding the exhibits. We seemed to walk around for an hour without seeing anything of note. It was hot-, stuffy and very noisy. We will not return. "
"Written February 17, 2020",Overcrowded,"Made the mistake of visiting in a Saturday afternoon. Queued in the rain to get in. Inside it was heaving with people. Couldn't take very much of it as the crowds were too large, so stayed only about one hour. If you are going to go, go during the week when maybe there will be less people and especially less children."
"Written January 31, 2020",Great Museum,"My wife and I absolutely loved the architecture of this musuem....it's incredible. As far as the actual displays at the museum, very interesting and well presented for the most part. We were disappointed how small and awkardly positioned the dinossaur section is. Quite smaller and less developed than the one in the American Museum of Natural History in New Work. Overall however, the museum is great and it's a fun way to spend a few hours with your family. Kids seem to really enjoy it as well."
"Written July 8, 2022",Fabulous Museum,Another wonderful museum in the heart of London. The exhibits are just amazing and it will take a long time to see everything. Bonus for us was that Dippy the dinosaur was paying a short visit so we were able to see him again.
"Written November 2, 2021",IMG Ice Skating - rather than handing skates out they should be giving wetsuits and snorkels!,Booked to go Ice Skating outside the NHM. Looked very nice in the pictures. On arrival found that the ice was actually one giant cold paddling pool. Please see pictures for how bad it was. Kids falling over and landing in deep water! This all outside and at the end of October. Looks like the ice machine either broken or not fit for service in mild October weather. Woman in ticket office unable to give refund but gave us an email to contact who could. Same story from supervisor in the skating tent. On return home we have contacted the email address and so far no refund. Will fight this as not right to expect kids to try and skate in this depth of water. IMG should have equipment suitable for the job. Or rather than handing skates out they should be giving wetsuits and snorkels! I recommend you don't book and see what its like on the day. This company obviously only cares about its profit and not its customers. If I don't get any further with the skate company will hand over to my credit card company to sort. Would recommend anyone else effected to do the same.
"Written May 24, 2022",Great with kids,"We entered from Exhibition Road, this gave us logical tour throughout the exposition, starting from geology, volcanos etc.. Our tickets at the entrance was checked and people who hadn't prebooked a time was actually sent away. The beginning of out tour was reasonably packed - not too many people, I guess because everybody was looking the dinosaurs, which was crammed. You kind of move there in line. Can't really understand the popularity of that. Also I didn't like the arthropod room, which was mostly pictures and moulages. Overall it was great day with kid. The details of the building itself were amazing."
"Written April 2, 2023",Disappointing Displays but Amazing Architecture,If you want to see the large special dinosaur exhibition make sure you book it early as it was sold out when we got there. If it wasn’t for the fantastic animal photography exhibition we would have left very disappointed as a lot of the displays were poor (just models rather than taxidermy).  Worth visiting tho just to see the beautiful architecture.
"Written August 28, 2023",Doesn’t know what it wants to be,"I really had mixed feelings about the displays that left me feeling very underwhelmed. I knew about collection highlights and was looking forward to walking around a traditional museum with specimens in cabinets and enjoying the architecture. But the museum is not that. In an effort to be more engaging and draw in families, they have constructed big clunky displays that make the rooms truncated and impossible to comfortably navigated given the numbers that have poured in. You are constantly stuck behind large family groups pouring over some plastic interactive display. While I understand the drive for engagement, it gave the museum a bit of an identity crisis. It felt like it wanted to be a science centre for families and not a natural history museum. To the point where in the dinosaur section, the skeletal casts were in the rafters (almost as an afterthought) which cheap tacky displays ran supreme and a photo opportunity took up considerably exhibition space. Ultimately we left after little over an hour as we didn’t enjoy the majority of the displays and felt harassed and pressed in by the sheer numbers. Staff throughout were lovely, in particular, a very upbeat lady manning the front door (I believe this was on the 29th of July if it helps this feedback get back to her)"
"Written September 7, 2020",Must go with kids,"A must go place... and if your kids have interest in dinosaurs then it is top of it... Go on upper floor as well there is butterfly shows and different things hut it has ticket . Otherwise , its free. You can easily spend 3-4 hrs and then you can go for food  to al beruit express for labenese which is walking distance from there and snowflake icecream . Good day out."
"Written August 23, 2022",Not enjoyable,"Some very interesting pieces of history. However there was far too many people and the heat was unbearable. We booked tickets for the Dippy exhibit but these weren't being checked so it was a free for all. Its a shame they try and get as many people in as possible to get them to spend money in the restaurants, cafes and shops.... ruins the experience. They also need to limit the numbers and install some air conditioning or ventilation. I know its free but would rather pay in to be able to enjoy it."
"Written May 12, 2023",Weekday visit ,It was packed with hordes of schoolchildren and  very hot inside the main hall. The noise was also loud and nowhere comfortable for an elderly person to sit and rest. I decided to abort my visit as it was so packed and uncomfortable.
"Written February 18, 2022",Visit ruined by far too many people!!,"Visited on 17 Feb. Massive queues outside to both entrances. The front entrance seemed a better way in than queuing at the side. Passed 2 kids trying to kick a pigeon upon entry to the grounds (with parents?!) Absolutely cram packed full of people which made it impossible to enjoy anything. Hot and busy. Cafe had tables practically on top of tables to get more people in. Can of coke 2.35!! Scone & hot drink deal £5.50. Scone was dry. Beautiful building and entrance but completely ruined by screaming kids, queues inside and outside, how busy it was and the heat! Don’t go if you’re worried about covid no masks and absolutely no social distancing!! We did book on line and staff were shouting at the front that there were no available tickets for the day."
"Written February 11, 2020",Amazing displays of dinosaurs & animals,Family with young kids would love this Museum. Amazing displays & informative boards for kids & adults alike. Huge place.Fabulous gift shop too! So much to see & learn about...
"Written March 17, 2020",Breathtaking building worth a visit,Visited this beautiful building on walking up to the doors the architecture of the building from the outside is outstanding.  Must admit parts of the museum didn't interest me but that's just my personal view.  Although it was quite busy it wasn't over crowded felt clean and airy good wc facilities too.  Cannot believe this museum is free. Well worth a visit.
"Written April 24, 2022","Must see, but avoid school holidays ","This place is truly amazing! Full of historical charm and lots to see and do, plenty of interactive displays.  Gift shop was reasonably priced. We'll worth a visit, allow at least 4 hours. My only concern was the number of people in there, there were literally 1000's, it got very clostraphobic at times and we left sooner than we would have liked as it was getting so unbearably hot in there from the number of people. But would still recommend. "
"Written April 2, 2022",Poorly equipped to protect against COVD,A lovely museum but we were very disappointment with the COVID precautions when we visited this week. So many interactive exhibits and children touching everything and not one single hand sanitising station. Very poor. Every where else we went in London provided sanitiser everywhere
"Written February 24, 2020",Totally amazing,Took two13 year olds for a day out and wow wow what a day So so much to see and do We spent a few hours there and never covered more than a quarter of the place.We plan to go back and do another quarter So informative and the kids are talking about it and explaining to others what they've learnt. .not just them me as well Many places inside to eat and drink Thank you for awakening their brains and imagination We will definitely be back
"Written October 11, 2020",Amazing visit during covid time,"Amazing as always. Unfortunately during Covid, some exhibitions are closed and limited to viewing. Having said that however, it was a very pleasant visit recently and they took great precaution to keep everyone safe, constantly cleaning the surfaces etc.I salute your staff and cleaning staff for their work, thank you."
"Written August 27, 2023",Busy,"Wow! Perhaps it was our own fault for choosing a Sunday on a Bank Holiday and while I can appreciate its free… It was heaving!!!! As in, you shuffled around behind, next to, in the middleof, so many people. I was under the naïve impression that you booked a slot so that numbers were managed. I am not sure if this is the case. We booked for 2pm, by 2:15 we had left. The volume of people, the noise level, unable to properly look at the exhibits, really disappointed. Perhaps a mid week in the school term may be better, although I am not convinced. Disappointed that we travelled to London from Cardiff to visit."
"Written July 28, 2023",FAR too crowded ,So busy we could barely move. We saw more gift shops than exhibits initially. £4 to check a small bag at the cloakroom. A lot of the museum hadn’t changed since at least the 90s but there’s plenty to look at. A bit of an over reliance on taxidermy perhaps? Minecraft obsessed children may enjoy the geology section most. Maybe we’d have a different opinion if we’d gone at a different time but it was like being on a rush hour tube - so crammed you could barely move let alone see anything. Also didn’t appreciate two employees giving us the hard sell ‘voluntary’ donation as we entered. Not the greatest experience and not somewhere we will rush back to.
"Written June 29, 2022","Day trip of 12, ages 8-60 to see Dippy","I would normally have given the NHM a 5. The good parts which the kids age 8-14 liked were the creepy crawlies and the stuffed birds. We went to visit Dippy. Just a shame he couldn't go below the Blue Whale. He seemed a bit confined in the small gallery that he was in. We used the school lunch area as it was a Sunday. Really good as we had a large group of 7 kids and 5 adults. Our only wish was that we couldn't get a coffee or tea and really wanted on!My main problem was the dinosaur gallery. I've been to this gallery loads of times over the years with children. Unfortunately without the gantry being open means that you all feel like you are jammed together and don't really get a good view of the skeletons. Also, the moving T Rex caused a real bottle neck at the beginning. This section was much better when you use to walk in from one side and out the other. One of our group is a high functioning autistic child. He loves dinosaurs but couldn't wait to get out of the gallery because of the layout made him feel like it was closing in on him. He has never had this reaction before on the various visits we've had before."
"Written September 2, 2023",Free visit but overcrowded,"We visited bank holiday weekend (Saturday). Although this is free to visit, It is advised to pre-book your tickets as you will not have to queue. The queue’s were huge. It was very busy and overcrowded and just wasn’t an enjoyable experience. There is three floors to see but we didn’t view all the floors as it was just so busy. For a free day out, its still worth it."
"Written January 26, 2023",Busy with so much to see; it’s intense!,"We began our day with a trip to the museums, starting with this one. Of course, it has A LOT to offer, with so much content, and so much to explore. A lot of the time I walked around thinking what have I missed, which sections didn’t we see because it is quite overwhelming. It was pretty good, so much to see to the point you end up just walking past a lot of it. I think we were here about an hour and a half, and that time did go by quite quickly. The best sections were definitely those on the higher floors, so I’m glad I started there. The dinosaur section was just full of children, which was to be expected, but there was a lot of people in a pretty small space. I imagine it’s be the same any day of the week, but Monday was very intense. It was lovely to look at, I will say, but I doubt I’ll return anytime soon unless there’s a new exhibit that seems interesting."
"Written April 7, 2023",Not as good as expected ,Went during the Easter school holidays with my children and it was rather disappointing. Thankfully we had booked tickets as without the queue to go in would have been endless.I was expecting it to be busy being the school holidays but this was just too much. We lasted about 1 hr 30 mins before getting too hot and a bit fed up having just really been swept around in crowds unable to see things fully or take in any information. Unfortunately I am limited to school holidays so would not be returning as I would not advise visiting during these times. 
"Written January 13, 2023",Needs revamping,"A lot of the exhibitions are looking a bit tired.  Some were closed.  Very confusing to get around and even on a week day during term time, it is absolutely packed with small children running around and screaming.Nice to see Dippy!!"
"Written June 6, 2022",Dippy the dinosaur is back!,"What a perfect way to spend your time with your teens and younger children. Dippy the dinosaur is back! This museum will keep you and your kids very busy as there are so many things to see. My favourite is the mineral, rock, meteorites and ores collection. It's a must see. Love this museum ❤❤❤"
"Written August 11, 2021",Not that good anymore,Been here before 9 years ago and it was way better then. Bit of a disappointment this time and not that interesting anymore. Think they focused too much on the very expensive Fantastic Beasts exhibition. Real shame won't be returning.
"Written January 4, 2022",Dangerous Ice Skating Rink,"I ice skate regularly at our local rink in Chelmsford and my friend and I booked this session as a bit of winter fun. I use the public skates at my local rink so this isn’t me just being snooty about not having good enough skates, but the skates were not sharp at all. This meant you couldn’t cut into the ice making it so slippy and dangerous!! They have a responsibility to their customers and they are falling short. The ice wasn’t also Oreo perky maintained so I saw a lot of falls. Don’t go here. Go to summerset house instead as that is better run and maintained"
"Written October 27, 2020",Got us out of the cold for two hours,"I am happy it`s free, If I had paid to go inside I would have been annoyed.The place was a little overwhelming we didn`t really know where to go, even with a map it was pretty confusing- too much going on.So many of the interactive `games` or `experiments` were not working because of covid, maybe they could have them working and just provide sanitiser or a worker to supervise the area.Oh well, got us out of the cold for 2 hours..."
"Written March 3, 2020",Behind the scenes tour,When I went in to the museum I saw they had a behind the scenes tour. Booked a spot for the tour starting in an hour on my phone very easily with no issues what so ever. The tour was a fascinating experience and as someone who studied science at uni I found the tour deep into the bowels of the labs and private collection fascinating. Our guide was fantastic and easily answered all of our weird and wonderful questions. I loved seeing some of Charles Darwin’s private specimens. This institution really is a cathedral of science and nature!
"Written February 20, 2023","Too busy, avoid ","Way too busy, no effort to control crowd size and prevent over crowding. We booked time ticket entry but even so we were rammed in. It was like being at a rugby or football final. Couldn't read anything or stop to look at anything as it was a constant flow or people all packed together pushing and bumping. Loved this museum in the past but had to give up. Unenjoyable experience. I even had doubts around safety if there was a fire or any kind of panic"
"Written August 4, 2022",Love IT!,"I love this museum! There is so much to see,  make sure you do a full day there. Children will love exploring, it is educational and fun! Bring your own food as a bit pricey. Be ready to que if need be. "
"Written June 3, 2020",When dinosaurs ruled the Earth,"The Natural History Museum in London is a gem of history. It's an absolutely remarkable thing to see ages of history timeline compressed in a single place. It takes hours to see every exhibit in detail. I was fascinated by what is left of dinosaurs -  small tokens of what in the past was an animal kingdom. In an evolutionary sense, is like reading a book through images. This place is like a ""Mecca of knowledge"" , it holds a sparkle of knowledge.I recommend it to all of you."
"Written July 27, 2023",Above and beyond,Genuinely can’t thank the NHM staff enough! Took my 5yr old there who had found a “dinosaur bone” on the beach the week before…. Not only did I want to throw it away but already had and elaborate scheme to say it had gone.We got the the info desk and they took the bone and made my son feel like a superstar for finding it! He had the time of his life! It’s worth buying the £11 pack for kids as his got a VIP lanyard and gift bagThe fact that this place is free is crazy as it is a fantastic journey through time in a spectacularly mesmerising setting.A phenomenal place with fantastic people
"Written February 26, 2023",Wonderful place to spend a day at!,"The place had tons of interesting exhibits.  The only problem was there were lots of school field trips the day we visited, therefore it was crowded with kids.  Sadly not able to visit the Sir David Attenborough studio (closed to public, open to student/class pre-bookings only), I would have loved to see this as I'm a fan of his TV series/shows."
"Written February 26, 2023",Lovely afternoon out,"Helpful staff, greeted on arrival, organised well.The food court However was chaotic… could do with moving the fridges or roping them off as I witnessed people taking things an walking away without paying!!"
"Written January 5, 2023",A couple of hours in the museum,"Excellent museum for children. The different zones mean that you can pick and choose what you want to focus on. It was really busy when we went so the younger members of the group could get a bit overwhelmed at times but the exhibits were accessible, informative and enjoyable. We all learnt something from our visit!"
"Written September 5, 2020",Really good!,"With the social distancing had to book in advance to get a slot. Quite alot of exhibits closed or open but not fully,but to be expected. Social distancing was good generally. Such a great place to visit. The building is stunning from the outside and so interesting inside. The T-Rex is iconic to see when visiting! Some cafes and gift shops open. Really enjoyed"
"Written June 1, 2023",An enjoyable 2 hours,Easy to book in advance and admission was straightforward despite being very busy. You have to expect it is going to be busy during school holidays but it was still possible to get close to things of interest. The young children in our group enjoyed the dinosaurs and the earthquake simulation. My main criticism is there are too many small gift shops and interactive sections. Too many models and not enough of the real artefacts. It’s free though so it is value for money!
"Written February 19, 2020",Today’s learning.,We made sure we got there early to avoid the queue to get in. We entered from the South Kensington tube. There is a map on sell for £1. It’s your choice how you explore the museum. Unfortunately due to school holidays there was a large number of kids present.
"Written April 6, 2023",Ticket system is a joke,Don't be fooled by the ticket system. They let anyone in. They didn't check our tickets. We went in at 4.15pm on a Tuesday and it was so packed we couldn't stop to see anything. Imagine walking around in a sea of people and having to wait to view each exhibit. No doubt that this museum is excellent but the sheer volume of people ruined it for us so we won't be back. 
"Written August 13, 2021",Nice place but zero social distancing,I really like this museum and have been several times over the years two problems this time. that wonderful dinosaur in the middle has been removed and replaced with something weird hanging on the ceiling and I was shocked seeing the crowd in there with zero social distancing I found that appalling and it ruined our day. Our kids wanted to walk through the dinosaur section but we would have literally been climbing over the people to get through makes no sense whatsoever
"Written January 11, 2020",More Features than we ever imagined. Beautiful building,This is a must see attraction in London. For locals and visitors alike. We have been many times before and have found it to be a different kind of experience. Each time. Thanks to the hard working individuals who have been putting in much effort and time. Volunteers and paid staff alike. Thank you
"Written March 23, 2023","Vast, Impressive and Overwhelming - from the entrance walk through the architecture and each and every detailed exhibit.","Wonderful. Overwhelming! I spent a very quick 2.5 hrs there and barely made it past the massive jewel and mineral displays! I confess to being a bit spoiled as we live a stone’s throw from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, but from the entrance onward, London’s NHM holds its own and more. Plan to on my next visit!"
"Written January 26, 2020",Worth a visit but...,Travelling alone with 4 year old girl. I made a bee line for here. It was really good and she enjoyed it. We whizzed through a lot of it and she was enjoying it but was not massively blown away. I would recommend going though. Took about 2 hours of the day. TRex Grill. Massive let down. Got my daughter's order wrong three times. Staff too busy chatting tbh. Portion size good and cost was alright but staff annoyed me tbh. Been there and done it now. Deffo worth a visit though with 4 year old but don't make it the wow factor highlight of your trip.
"Written June 4, 2021",Wildlife photographer of the year exposition,"Always a pleasure to visit this museum, even with the current conditions. We went there with my daughter to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exposition and it was a great experience.First, the safety was really taken care seriously which is obviously essential today. Despite the location of the exposition was not really clear from the entrance (this hall is always so overwhelming by its size and beauty!), staff was very helpful and friendly so we made our way to it relatively easily.The ambiance was very nice and photos were beautiful, impressive and some what disturbing on the ""journalism"" part of the expo about what humans can unfortunately do to nature and animals.All the photographies were impressive in their way and it was very difficult to determine which ones would be the winner... it is so subjective to everyone sensibility, despite the techiaues and the work involved behind the photo itself.Great experience anyway which recall if necessary the beauty of our planet and creatures living on it."
"Written May 1, 2023","If you love crowds and rush-hours tube like vibe, go for it.",What happened to this once lovely and charming museums? Incredibly crowded and hot. I felt like fainting the entire time we navigated the narrow corridors seeing nothing but other people. The suspended catwalk that allowed for a close look at the dinosaurs is now closed and all is left is to look at them from below. I felt incredibly overwhelmed and worried about the safety of my 4 years old possibly getting lost or hurt. We will mot return to this museum.
"Written April 26, 2023","Overcrowded, lots of pushing and shoving","The exhibitions were interesting, the only downside was you couldn’t enjoy them! The museum lets in far too many people. There is an online booking service but that doesn’t cap the amount of people. I spent my whole day being shoved and pushed out the way. We came from Australia and were disappointed with how little time we had to look at exhibits. Disappointing trip"
"Written March 12, 2023",Incredible museum for kids.,"I brought my kids to this place and we had a wonderful time. The exhibits were a hit with the kids, especially the dinosaurs. However, it can be quite crowded with school groups, and the layout can be a bit challenging to navigate. Despite these minor issues, I would still highly recommend this place as a must-visit destination for kids."
"Written July 26, 2023",Great museum in a great building,"The museum is located in a great building. The entrance hall is huge and very impressive. This by itself makes it already worthwhile the visit. There is no charge at the door, but they do ask for a donation. For special exhibitions they do charge you extra. To get around you will need some time. They have the biggest gem stone collection I have ever seen, but also the other departments are very impressive"
"Written December 16, 2022",Amazing,Me n my husband went to eat something From the Kitchen which is inside the history museum and david one of their member helped us enormously and we just wanna say thanks a lot David from the kitchen from me n my husband . You are so kind and lovely and made us feel so comfortable and happy.Grace joy
"Written January 23, 2020",Awesome. ,My second visit and just one of the most beautiful museums you will ever visit. It's free entry with queuing times non existent during the week but long on weekends. Worth a visit alone just to look up at Dippy in the great hall. 
"Written April 30, 2023",Fascinating museum,"This is undoubtedly one of the greatest museums in UK and a real must-see in London. Dinosaurs, volcanoes, minerals, animals, earthquakes, there is all of this and much more. On top of that the building itself is wonderful. Natural History Museum is a real gem, worth seeing."
"Written January 6, 2020",Great few hours out. ,On arrival at the museum the queue was long but moved fast. It was very crowded and we were told that it’s normal for school holidays. My son absolutely loved the dinosaur exhibits. The architecture is absolutely stunning. Well worth the visit if you have a dinosaur obsessed kid like mine. 
"Written January 14, 2022",Got bored!,"Yes i have been many times before over the years and really enjoyed it, but this time i was bored and i'm not sure why.Was it the fact that you wore facemasks or that many exhibits looking tired now or something else, I don't know. We only stayed for less than 2 hours including half hour in cafe.  "
"Written September 4, 2023",Holiday visit ,"Pre booked free tickets, thank god as queue was around the block and the same when we left, we just went straight to the front and in . Went upstairs first which was the boring bit, all rocks , earth, space etc, we missed a lot out as my son was only really interested in the rest. Spent 2 hrs, was far too busy with people but managed to see what we wanted, dinosaur part the best, didn’t pay extra to see the touring dinosaur which I personally think should be free but there you go. He enjoyed the animals etc. would we go again, no, would we have been happy if we had to pay, no, slot of stuff of no interest and just too many people squashed inside!!!!"
"Written August 17, 2022",Like a war zone :( dangerous,"The NHM is aware of COVID right? And that right now there is an amber warning for heat?!There were people panicking trying to get out of the dinosaur exhibition, I had to half carry half drag my daughter out of there through an emergency exit (which I got told off for), because she was fainting. It WAS an emergency, if she’s gone down she would have been trampled!Kids were being pushed out the way of adults and it was just appalling. I’m going to send an email to the H&S exec as this is just dangerous. Totally ruined our trip to London :("
"Written August 19, 2021",Wonderful! Just need more crowd control in some areas,Beautiful building with loads to see and learn! A great time had by all! Seeing our dinosaur mad sons face light up was just such a beautiful thing. We loved it! My only negative point is that the dinosaur part and mammals should have been better controlled especially at the moment. It was very over crowded and that made me feel very uneasy. People pushing past and ontop of eachotherThe rest was absolutely fine
"Written February 15, 2020",Wau!,"I can't believe it's free access, so much to see!  I strongly recommend you to visit and experience.  we were on a rainy day and there were more people than normal but it didn't bother because the place was so big.  it's worth taking the time to see everything, because there's a lot of it."
"Written September 2, 2022","Busy, modern, warm, well organised apart from the restaurant.","I went with my 4yr old daughter and pre booked tickets to see Dippy. The museum was busy but not rammed. There was a steady stream going in but we didn’t have to wait. We headed for the dinosaurs first and went round twice to see the T. rex and then Dippy which was pretty good but I was probably more interested than she was. She liked the moving dinos. It is very warm inside so be prepared. Lunch was at the T. rex grill which was extremely busy with a bad design for ordering. We found a free table and got the number but both went to the till to order as I couldn’t see her from the queue and didn’t want to leave her at the table alone. Meanwhile, someone else sat at the table which could have scuppered our food ordering. Fortunately it was only two people do there was still room for us. Lunch took ages to arrive as it was so busy but it was pretty good and not completely extortionate. £22 for an adult main, kids main and drink. We then went to the volcanoes and earthquakes which was great. Much of it was beyond her conceptually but she liked the colours  and pictures and we spoke about the basic details. Toilets were clean without too much of a queue. We would go again and pick two areas again I think. So much there and really well laid out."
"Written January 11, 2021",Amazing place,"I went there with two classmates while studying in London in 2017. The place is huge, easy to get lost inside. The entrance was free at that time and the visit started on the Space/Planets area. There is so much to see there, you can easily spend all day there and don't even see everything if you pay attention to all the details."
"Written August 9, 2023",Excellent museum ,"What a STUNNING building ! We were doing the Paddington Tour and  decided this was an approppriate place  as some of the movie was filmed in the spectacular entrance hall. It's really breathtaking .The museum itself is wonderful with lots of interesting and well presented exhibits . It was VERY busy though, would prefer to visit again when quieter .Ensure you book in advance - there was a 2 hour queue for non ticket holders ."
"Written November 5, 2021",Wow Wow Wow,"We had a few hours to wile away before we headed to Heathrow. What a beautiful museum to visit.   The building itself is worth the visit.  So much to see and because it’s so large, you never feel crowed in.This is a must while in London. Easy to get to from South Kensington Tube Station 5 stars"
"Written January 27, 2023",Professional and very kind manager,"I am really impressed by the professionalism of the manager at the entrance. I was visiting the museum with a group of students, and he quickly and kindly solved our problem. Unfortunately, I don’t remember his name, but I would like to thank him very much once more. The museum is amazing and we really enjoyed our visit."
"Written May 1, 2022",Ridiculously crowded,"Unfortunately it’s impossible to comment on the exhibits because they allowed so many people in, there was not an opportunity to look at anything for more than a second, let alone ready anything or learn anything. The amount of people they allowed into the dinosaur exhibition was unsafe, it was like trying to escape a packed concert, I’m amazed their risk assessments allow such huge volumes because it’s a disaster waiting to happen. Such a shame, because I’m sure if we had been able to see anything it would have been great."
"Written October 16, 2021",A fantastic day out with the kids!,"There is so much to see and there is something to interest everyone.  The dinosaurs were a big hit and so was the Earths treasury, volcanoes and earth quakes area, especially all of the interactive parts including the earthquake.  Lots of things learnt on this trip, was very interesting., building itself is absolutely beautiful too. There were lots of little seating areas where you could rest for 5 minutes before moving on, plenty of toilet facilities and a few eating outlets as well as vending machines for drinks dotted around."
"Written August 17, 2023",Awful Visit,"Visited on 15th August, It was so busy that it was dangerous. Couldn’t see a lot because of it being too crowed. Also it was so hot in there we only managed the dinosaurs quickly. Think we were there for about 1 hour until we gave up. Luckily we booked tickets so queueing wasn’t a problem.NHM need to put something in place to limit the numbers."
"Written February 4, 2020",Looked great but very busy,Visited here on the 1st Feb (saturday) and it was crazy busy. It was just a river of people in the Dino section. You could not even try and stop to look at anything as yu would be crushed in the stampede.If you could get a day where it was not so busy then it would be a great place to visit.Settled for the Earth stuff and this kept us entertained.
"Written February 13, 2020",Very instructive visit on a busy Sunday morning,"I visited with my 2 teens daughters the Natural History Museum on a cold Sunday morning. The museum, which entrance is free, was crowded. My daughters loved the visit - the dinosaurs part or the science / biology part. They even wished they could spend at least an extra day there..."
"Written October 14, 2020",One giant crèche,I was disappointed to find that I couldn’t gEg a moments peace here. School children filled the museum. But it’s hardly surprising when the venue is free. I would have preferred to pay a bit and have some peace and quiet.
"Written January 29, 2023",Something for everyone,"I visited this museum today with my family, including a young child. There was something that caught all of our interests during our visit. The dinosaur room was our favourite, especially the real life, moving t-rex.The escalator where you end up in the moon/ egg was really cool, we all enjoyed this. The earthquake stimulator was cool, soo much information and videos. I would recommend pre booking your free tickets, we managed to skip a long queue because of this."
"Written February 20, 2023",Tooooo busy and dark,"Was absolutely packed. We had prebooked time slot but was toooo busy. 5 or 6 people deep at every exhibition. Also very badly lit , i know you want atmosphere but was too dark to see things, especially the dinosaurs which were also displayed far too high. Cafe areas overcrowded and uncleared tables . Various interactive stuff not working.  Left as my 7 year old was "" bored""."
"Written October 18, 2022",Amazing place. Highly recommended ,We went with our 10yo and 7yo girls. We all loved it. A great place for 3 to 4 hours at least. We didn't get round it all in the 4 hours we were there. It is free to enter. We booked online before but didn't need to. The exhibition to see Dippy also didn't need tickets when we were there. 
"Written February 17, 2022",It’s ok,"It’s Alright, once you’ve seen one Dino bone you’ve seen them all. Once you’ve seen one flourite crystal, you’ve seen em all. The big blue Topaz was stunning and the Giant Sequoia are worth seeing."
"Written May 7, 2022",Well organised but avoid weekends!,"I went to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year  which was just outstanding.  I try and go every year if I am in London.  This is a paid exhibition.  I made the silly mistake of booking for a Saturday afternoon.  The museum was super busy!  If you can avoid it and don't have children, then go at a quieter time!  The exhibition was really well laid out and easy to follow. Clean.  Loved it.  Staff were  pleasant and friendly.  Despite them trying to manage numbers with the ongoing C-19 pandemic, it was still super busy!  "
"Written November 11, 2022",Multiple visits,"We regularly visit this museum. It is for us the jewel in the crown. So much to see one visit is simply not enough. I first visited as a child, have visited many times as a parent and now visit just for my own pleasure. I have visited the NYC Natural History Museum which is hugely disappointing comparatively. If your in London it's the no.1 thing to do."
"Written April 8, 2023",Well worth a visit,"Please do visit, it was a great experience, we stayed for 5 hours!Some of the exhebitions are a bit dull, relaying on plaster replicas of animals, where as others are great, especially the display of birds. A bit sad that the garden is not open at this time, as it is being remodelled, and I would have liked a gallery on plants, maybe there were some that we just missed. "
"Written August 4, 2022",Spoilt by its own success.,"It's just too busy to enjoy, and we were there on a day with no queue to get in.Also the dinosaur exhibit is completely shut currently. Not much fun. I'd recommend the Science Museum next door as a much better alternative for kids or adults."
"Written May 15, 2023",Wildlife Photographer of the Year,"We went for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year with an 11 year old. We thought it was very good but she was bored there was nothing that we could see the interacts with kids. We also spent time in the Dinosaur room, which was great. The photography we have been before a few years back and thought this time lacked a wow factor. I would say its good to go every few years The Dinosaur exhibition I personally would have liked to see more real fossils and not models."
"Written August 22, 2022",Personal Favourite,"This is my personal must whenever I'm in London. It's free and fantastically curated. This time over, I went to see Dippy the diplodocus, which is ""back home"" from its tour, and had a walk down the dinosaur gallery.At the moment, tickets are free, but these days it's better to book them online."
"Written January 15, 2023",Absolutely fabulous well worth a visit,Absolutely fantastic what a brilliant way to spend the day kept the teens and the adults engaged. Free entry however you do need to book online. Really enjoyed the exhibits. The earth and volcano exhibit was great the escalator ride was a little hairy - very high for the faint hearted. So much information to take in and digest you need quite a few hours to see everything.  We stopped half way in the cafe for some lunch which was yum! There are other restaurants within the museum.
"Written August 26, 2022",Perennial favourite,"We always enjoy coming here, despite the crowds. Lots of interesting things to see (especially the dinosaurs and the blue whale!) and a fun time for children and adults.We did not book tickets in advance and had to wait in line outside, as apparently capacity within the museum is capped. We came towards the end of the day, so luckily the line moved quickly.It is quite warm and crowded inside. It's a bit chaotic. Only some of the rooms are air-conditioned.Lots of maps around, so you can easily find what you want to see. Dippy, the famous dinosaur, is temporarily back before going on another UK tour."
"Written October 30, 2023",Dinosnores ,I attended dinosnores with my sister and best friend. I've been wanting to go for years and finally a big birthday gave me the excuse! It was a fantastic experience. The staff were great and clearly put a lot of effort into the night. A special mention to the compare who was great! The food was surprisingly good for a large catered event. We enjoyed the animal meet and great and the quiz. The best of all was getting to roam around the museum at night. The harpist was a lovely touch to finish off the night. It was great to spend a bit of time in the morning in the titanosaur exhibition and gift shop. I'd recommend getting there early and waiting outside. We were near the front of the queue and had first pick of sleeping area
"Written February 19, 2022",A great museum!,"We visited with our 9yr old daughter who is obsessed with dinosaurs, so this is THE place to go! Stunning building, well laid out, loads to see and do. Yes it was busy but that’s to be expected. It didn’t spoil anything having to queue for a few minutes now and then. Already looking forward to returning."
"Written November 17, 2023",An Awesome Place that needs so TLC,Still an amazing and iconic facility. It is beyond overwhelming and would tak days to see in it's entirety. My only criticism is that it looks like the maintenacne and cleanming have been neglected for quite some time. There is a lot of work required to clean it up and restore the aging displays and signage etc.
"Written November 13, 2022",Great place to come.,As I was in London I thought I’d visit the museum. It’s very good and lots to see. My daughter who is 13 really liked it too. Just make sure to get a map as twice we thought we’d seen it all only to find another “hidden” room etc.
"Written March 20, 2022",Wow what a place.  Absolutely fantastic!!,"Went for the day and did the out of hours dino tour before general admission.  Our tour guide was fantastic and very knowlegable and we were the only ones in the museum.  We then explored and spent 7 hours in the museum.  It was absolutely brilliant and we feel privileged to have been to such a fantastic place.  Beautiful architecture, wonderful exhibits. Long may it continue and we will be back. "
"Written January 4, 2020",Excellent day out ,"We visited The Natural History Museum yesterday. We queued for about 20 minutes to get in. It’s a very large place, with lots to see and do. There’s a lot of information on dinosaurs. There’s a lift up to the red zone where you can learn about earthquakes.There’s a creepy crawly section."
"Written February 10, 2020",Fantastic,"Spent hours at the natural history museum, it was brilliant! So many interesting things to look at and learn about. The dinosaur section was really great. Lots of school trips there, but it didn’t interfere with our visit to much, just very noisy. Would definitely recommend a visit and it’s free o charge."
"Written July 7, 2021",Excellent Museum,"The last time I went to the NHM was a school trip some 45ish years ago and it was superb. We had a great time and the dinosaurs and blue whale were my favourite. Very busy with lots of children with their families despite it being school term which was surprising, remember you need to book."
"Written October 4, 2021",Brilliant,It’s free!!! I’m not sure what people are meaning about. I was heart broken when I realised I forgot to book and my son was sooooo upset. After looking online again we took the risk to tube it and walk ( as the nearest station was closed ) 😤 and we were not disappointed.  We walked straight in. The staff were amazing they sang happy birthday to my daughter and my son and I go is dinosaur mad was proper made up. Much made my day. It’s free so enjoy it for what it is.
"Written February 9, 2020",Brilliant,Went with family today. So much to see and learn for the children but also learn ourselves.Favourite part has to be the dinosaur exhibit for us but everything was still great to see too.Restaurant is slightly pricey but we took our own lunch.. Definitely worth the trip
"Written March 8, 2020",My favourite museum ,"The national history museum is my favourite museum ever! It's such a gorgeous building from the exterior but the interior blows you away. The museum is filled with so much history, it's such a delight. Plus the fact it's free means you can have an exciting day out for literally NOTHING. I highly recommend this place if and when travelling to London. Seek the excitement in this stunning museum. "
"Written January 17, 2023",Very confusing layout,"Signs need rethinking especially if your not coming in from the main entrance,  the zones (colour) don’t really match with what the signs say and the toilets are nowhere near where the signs say.  Even the staff where confused.  A lot of walking around on tired feet and getting annoyed.  Spoilt the experience.  What we did see we enjoyed though.  "
"Written January 21, 2020",Best Museum Ever!!!,"This is the best museum I’ve ever been to! It’s free, we paid £2/coat in the cloakroom. £1 for kids. £5 for a kids book which we used as a map. Use the cloakroom because we spent 5 hours in this amazing place, could’ve spent 6. Fantastic for kids!!"
"Written July 14, 2022",So much to see,"We only had a couple of hours to spare, but just going in to see the building itself is worth it! Amazing details built in.  We just had a quick walk round to see Dippy again, 48 years since I last saw him at the museum. We looked at the minerals room to see the cabinets as they were in the museum back in the 1800’s.  Who knew there were so many different ones and the Vault had some amazing contents. We could spend a day there no problem if it was nearer for us to get there."
"Written January 1, 2020",First time visit x,"Well what can I say wow, it was my first time and I throughly enjoyed the couple hours we were there.Was easy to get too and every single time I thought we seen it all we hadn't.Can't believe it's free. Would definitely recommend a visit if you are in the area  "
"Written March 4, 2022",The Building Itself is Beautiful,"The actually Natural History Museum building is amazing! It was made beautifully. The actual museum itself I don't think is laid out very well. This was my second visit and both times major sections were empty.It is a free museum, so I would say it's worth at least going inside. "
"Written November 20, 2021",Great family experience,"Dinosaurs, dinosaurs, dinosaurs! That's all we heard from our four children when they heard of this place. We easily spent 4 hours here, its big and so much to see and do. When we finally got to the dinosaur exhibition it exceeded expectations, there are some great animatronics used. The gift shops are also super. All in all our second favourite museum in London after the British."
"Written February 13, 2020",Birthday trip,My best friend and I decided to visit the museum as she had never been before. Even though I have been a number of times there was still loads I have never seen. The red zone was particularly incredible. The earthquake simulator was also fantastic 
"Written April 12, 2023",Hellish busy,"Booked in advance which gave immediate entry. There were hundreds of families in a queue waiting to get in! It was rammed inside and utterly hellish. Flow was managed along a route, like ikea, but a million times worse. Cafe in total disarray, tables not cleared.It was the low point of an otherwise fantastic weekend. Science Museum much better. Will def not rush back. Shame."
"Written August 14, 2021",Great visit - just as you remember from being a child,"Fabulous restless earth section, covering volcanoes, earth quakes and minerals....then a visit to to dinosaurs is always a must.Good coffee, but importantly you can take your own food in and use the cafe - great idea for families."
"Written November 17, 2022",Worth Visiting,We had a wonderful visit here. Dippy was impressive and we were lucky there wasn’t a long queue.  Sophie was also well worth visiting.The missus liked the human evolution exhibit while I enjoyed the gift shop - ended up buying a few gifts.It is definitely worth spending a couple of hours here.
"Written April 17, 2023",Lots to see,"Visited the museum during Easter Holidays - booked in advance (definitely recommend this!). Walked straight in and although it was busy it didn’t feel too crowded. Spent longer there than we though - almost 4 hours. Kids (age 13 & 10) really enjoyed it, especially the interaction."
"Written August 11, 2022",Crowded but iconic & impressive,"Firstly, what a magnificent building. You could spend all day here, we spent a couple of hours as young children need variety. Lots of Charles Darwin’s work/findings featured plus, of course, the family favourite: dinosaurs!"
"Written December 30, 2022",One of the greatest museums and completely for free!,Fantastic museum with a huge collection! It was way too crowded for a relaxed visit though. Offering this free of charge in this absurd expensive city was a welcome surprise. Great variety and the dino area was just packed with cool stuff. Don’t forget to enjoy the architecture too!
"Written August 21, 2023",The Amazing Spirit Tour!,"I went to Dinosnores back in April which was a bucket list experience. I went on the Spirit Tour then and decided to take my partner in August as I enjoyed it so much. There was only 4 people in the group which was great as it meant a more personal experience. MASON was our NHM Educator. He was very informative, enthusiastic amd friendly. He clearly loved his job and made the experience educational and interesting. We got to see behind the scenes including, specimens of all sorts as well as many of Darwin's items from his trip on the Beagle. I don't think many people know about this trip but it's truly worthwhile. Highly recommended amd great value for money. £25 for 45 mins to  60 mins. "
"Written April 8, 2023",Excellent but avoid the T-Rex Cafe,"One tip, book beforehand so you can enter through the fast track queue otherwise you’re in for a long wait.  We also booked for the dinosaur exhibition which was awe inspiring.  Worth a visit.  It’s all very well organised.  I’d avoid the T-Rex cafe. Lots of staff but complete chaos.  We had to keep asking for food/items which they kept forgetting. Seriously don’t bother. Go to the other one."
"Written May 30, 2023",Great but kids probably with cope with it all.,We enjoyed our visit. The dinosaur section was the biggest hit with the kids although they also enjoyed the other animal sections. The earthquake floor is great. It is a bit generally limited on interactivity though and we didn’t do all the floors due to that as the kids got bored
"Written February 16, 2020",Amazing Museum with so so Much to See!,"Arrived at this fantastic building and saw fabulous displays. So much to see we selected what interested us. The first was Earthquakes...terrific displays and information including a shaking shop from Japan! I have experienced an earthquake first hand and this display was spot on. The dinasours were fabulous, the rocks and fossils...it would be possible to stay for hours and I guarantee you would not be bored! Excellent for everyone."
"Written March 2, 2020",Must must visit,"Its a great place to visit in london. Its free. And its full of knowledge. U need to spend around 4 hrs here. If u have a longer stay in london, then i would suggest u visit this place in 2-3 visits. Each time covering a specific section"
"Written January 26, 2020",The most impressive was dinosaur section,Fantastic building but inside is equally great. Our kids were the most impressed visiting dinosaur section. Also mammals section was highly interesting for them. Worth to highlight that this museum is free of charge.
"Written January 31, 2022",Some real gems interspersed with tired displays from the 1980s and screaming kids.,"The original building is fantastic and the main hall with the whale made the visit worth it, however the majority of the displays are in need of an overhaul.  The mammals section hasn't changed since the 80s I'm guessing.  The colour scheme, text and displays in general were actually very nostalgic.  Highlights were the broken world exhibition, gem room, vault and treasures galleries.  Make a beeline for these displays and you will be happy.  If there isn't a cue, a zip around the dinosaur room is worth it, some great items spaced amongst the children exhibits.  By the time we made it to the evolution and red galleries we were spent and headed to Hyde Park for some fresh air."
"Written October 24, 2022",Great Museum,"Go early to beat the crowds and/or the school field trips. The building itself is just exquisite. The fact that it's free entry makes it even easier to choose it, especially if it's rainy outside. "
"Written February 16, 2023",Fascinating!,"What a great place! Has been on my bucket list to visit here since I was young, and to be able to stand in front of the Darwin statue at the top of the stairs where I have watched many things filmed was a real treat! The exhibits where fascinating and I could quite easily spend all day wandering about much to the wife's displeasure! Worth a visit if in London!"
"Written January 8, 2023",Loved it,Best part was that it was also free. We had to wait 15-20 minutes to enter the queue. It was a good museum covering almost everything but not as expensive as New York's natural history museum.
"Written March 12, 2022",Best museum in London,"Love this museum. I am a big geology fan and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good day out. The Natural History Museum is a great experience, much better than the London Dungeon. 😎"
"Written August 2, 2022",Free. Loads to see,"Lovely museum,  loads to see. And all free.Ok downside is the staff can't take photos, and please for the love of God put the ac on. It's so hot in there, We didn't stay long due how hot it was"
"Written February 2, 2020",History at its best ,Finally managed to visit the Natural History museum.The museum is a must visit location in London. It’s very informative with lots of staff available for consultation. There’s also loads of interactive features to keep you involved.You can easily spend half a day visiting 
"Written February 20, 2020",Still Exciting! ,Since moving from London almost 25 years ago this is the first time back. This time with my family. Still fresh and lots of things to do. Great taking me back to my childhood. Also a great exhibition on Human biology with parts on memory which will come in good use for my work. Must make sure it is not another 25 years till I come back again. 
"Written February 22, 2020",Avoid during the holidays,Incredibly busy at half term. Lots aimed at younger children. Hard to navigate way round. Will sim to go back outside of UK holidays and be more focused on what to see.
"Written July 10, 2022",Do not miss it!,"Excellent for solo or group travellers. I would recommend around 3h to stay there. Free to enter, its massive so it doesnt feel busy or crowded.Walking distance from Kensington South metro station."
"Written October 15, 2020",Amazing place ,Could spend all day here just looking at all the exhibits. Such an wonderful place.  Booking system was easy to follow and the timed entry a good idea.  Was able to wander at leisure to see everything there.
"Written April 26, 2022",Great museum,"The Natural History museum is as always a good day out, so much to see, and so much to learn. Not only the animals and birds but also the stones and many more informative cases to spends ages looking at. Need much longer than you think"
"Written October 3, 2020",Amazing place,"Free ticket in here, but need online book before you visit. Huge building with lots of interesting things. Dinosaur part is very cool. The materials part amazing and rich. Some part closed now to public. "
"Written August 8, 2021",Dinosaurs Rock,"The dinosaur exhibition is very good. Though it would be nice if there was more information and most activities for kids because kids absolutely love dinosaurs.Good experience but I feel aside from the dinosaurs, it is a bit boring for children.Gift shop was nice but a bit pricey."
"Written September 4, 2020",History lessons,"Booked a slot to the museum, on time and lovely welcome.Exhibits amazing, well laid out, just enough time to the dinosaurs exhibits and a few hours in the red zone.Will be back with our grandchildren soon"
"Written March 21, 2022",First Visit,I visited with my 8 year old nephew with additional needs.To my amazement we managed to stay for almost 3 hours (including lunch) despite his very short attention span. We had a great visit although not sure we saw everything as he was getting a little bored. He has even said he will come back!
"Written November 25, 2022",Best Museum of History,"Brilliant visit, one of the best museums I’ve ever been to! Yes does get busy but there’s so much space. Would recommend pre booking tickets. Free entry too which is just amazing. A must do for any London trip!"
"Written August 2, 2021",Enjoyed,"The museum was big and there was plenty to see (we did not see it all).  Enjoyed the red zone, saw most of the blue zone and a little bit of the green zone.  Would have stayed longer, but it was a very hot day."
"Written February 3, 2020",Not as good as I remember ,"We visited here for the first time in an awfully long time. We both felt it was not as good as we remembered it. Cannot put a finger on it, but somehow a couple of stuffed animals and a few bones looked tired. Also, there is a lot more opportunity to buy dinosaurs stuffed with recycled plastic bottles, than there used to be. Feel it needs to modernise."
"Written November 25, 2022",Lots to see for free,Wet miserable morning so where better a place to visit than the Natural History Museum. The staff were very helpful and we didn’t have to queue to see Dippy! It was a weekday and we were there for opening. Started to get busy after we’d been there for a while but all in all a nice morning looking around the exhibits.
"Written February 18, 2020",What an amazing place,"WOW. Everyone should visit NHM at least once in their life. Full of amazing exhibits and information. Lots of schools on trips but children need to learn about these important facts of evolution, so ""No Problem"" with this. Go and enjoy"
"Written June 20, 2022",A vast and interesting museum,"This is a beautiful building and a very vast museum full of information. I spent over 3 hours here and couldn’t get round everything. Lots of very informative sections on dinosaurs, mammals and much more. Staff were friendly."
"Written August 13, 2023",Very cool,"My husband and I enjoyed the museum very much. There are a few things that did disappoint. The main one was the fact that there’s not any benches for sitting as you go through the exhibits. For someone that has limited mobility in my hips, it made for a less than perfect experience. The restrooms are in awful places too. Very long lines and awful location."
"Written August 4, 2022",Not as good as it used to be,The experience is dumbed down by a reduction of exhibits and terrible lighting so you can't see the specimens very well - or they are artistically arranged but many are too high to view properly. Routes herded people through the exhibits. I remember when it was so much better as a child when the dinosaurs were in the main hall and you didn't need buttons to press or trick lighting to make the specimens impressive. You were also at liberty to tour the specimens as you wanted to.
"Written June 13, 2023",Day out in London,An interesting place but quite difficult to navigate around and cover everything if you ever can in a museum. If your into the contents of this museum the probably worth it. If I had to chose between this and the science museum next door this one wouldn't win. 
"Written March 6, 2020",A Must See!!,Amazing museum. Free. South Kensington underground station is right there. I must see if you were in London. There is a lot to see there so take as much time as you can. Make sure you check out the blue whale and the gray whale exhibit.
"Written June 14, 2022",Understanding how volcanoes work,"A very good set of models and displays to interest and educate all ages. A lot of thought and work has been put into this exceptional project. Having experienced tremors in Japan in the same year as the famous tsunami,  the shop model was very realistic"
"Written May 11, 2022",Good for families with young children,Enjoyable family day out at the history museum. Many interesting collections to explore and keep the my young children engaged. Was slightly short on time but it's worth spending a few hours to see more of the museum. Would recommend to families with young ones.
"Written March 9, 2020","College trip, FMP project","Great museum, astonished building architecture. Hudge whale in the main hall. Great Dinosaurs ehxib and sea life animal's, delphines, lungs and others. Can reccomend to everyone curious to learn more about animals and its history. Its free. But animals looks extremely dusty. Please donate £5 as you go in. They need it. As well as volunyary work."
"Written November 10, 2022",Nice Place to Visit,"I have never been so close to a dinosaur that much. Great experience to observe, learn and change. You need to book your spot online without paying a penny, this is why I love London so much:) Every parent must bring their kids here, I presume. Informative and impressive experience!"
"Written November 8, 2021",Amazing day,"Love this place, came with my 8yr old and her friend. Both absolutely loved it, the things they have in here are amazing, the girls enjoyed all of it. But I think their favourite part was the Earthquake room. We went on an inset day so not to busy. There’s plenty of shops to spend pocket money & places to grab a bite to eat/drink.It’s not our first visit and definitely won’t be our last."
"Written February 8, 2023",Maybe more exciting if you are a child,"Very beautiful old building with amazing statues and decor, enjoyed the open space and clean surroundings. Too bad that some of the things looked old and tired. Pretty much everything looked somewhat fake or poorly stuffed. Desperately needs a refreshing asap. Also a huge walk, propably missed couple sections, also some of them were closed. "
"Written January 26, 2020",Great place - and recommend the Behind the Scenes Tour,"This is a great place.  The collection and the building are well worth a visit.  We paid for a Behind the Scene tour this time, and it was a brilliant way to spend an hour.   Even without the tour, I would have still have written a five star review.   Although the tour is well worth the money and the time.  Great place!"
"Written February 19, 2020",Loved it,We were in London for another attraction and added the museum on as an extra. The museum quickly became the highlight of our visit. Very welcoming staff and friendly interaction with our children. Well informed displays and a great under the ocean family show. Clean toilets 
"Written July 28, 2023",Great visit - well worth it.,"Really a lovely visit.  My hubby and I had not been in a few decades since visiting before on a school trip.  It was amazing to see how much it had changed and improved from our visits. The various sections you can visit are all packed with lots of great and interesting facts and details and very educational. A well worth visit even if just to go down memory lane and refresh your memories, and of course knowledge!"
"Written September 25, 2021",very helpful Duty manager,"Fantastic place ,we visit this place 08.08.2020 but I reserved next Sunday but very helpful duty manager help us and let us see this place ,I would like to say again thanks to lady duty manager she is so helpful and friendly shame I cant remember her name.so much things to see and learn things  this museums . I am glad visit this place ."
"Written August 12, 2020",A great freebie in London.,We had time to kill before our coach journey home and I’d always wanted to go to see the whale here. It just so happens that Dippy was on display too. This was a great way to spend a couple of hours.
"Written October 20, 2022",All ages welcome! ,"A fantastic half day. Especially with children. It’s interactive, in a beautiful building and located close to the tube for easy access. If you fancy a walk I would recommend an early morning walk though Hyde park, head to Knightsbridge and take a look in shops which one simply cannot afford, head towards South Kensington tube station and you will be able to spend your day in the Natural History Museum, the Science museum and the V&A. If it’s a hot day there’s some great gelato places around South Kensington station. *please note that if you plan to do the walk then your legs WILL ache the day after."
"Written April 11, 2020",Just WOW!!!,The museum was the most unreal place I have ever been. It was great to see it so busy and things back to normal. My son loves dinosaurs but he loves whales too so we were amazed when we saw them also. Fascinating place and the building itself is stunning. Free entry just ask for donation. A breathtaking experience.
"Written April 16, 2022",When you visit London you must add on your list this museum,"We have spent half day here.We could stay longer as the museum is very big and interesting, but we had another plan for same day as well. When we entered and I saw the entrance I knew I will love this museum. My favourite part was the earth quake room where you can actually feel a strong one..."
"Written August 30, 2022",Amazing and Historic,An amazing Museum with a lot to learn from History. 20 minutes walk from the Earls Court tube station. It was packed with a lot of groups and the whole atmosphere was great. Its so amazing to see ancient history kept such an organised way. Great time we had
"Written January 6, 2020",Pre book tickets,Was a quick flying visit as we hadn’t realised as to how long it would take to get in as the queues were quite long. We just assumed it was free so didn’t need any although maybe if we Gad planned the visit beforehand then we could have spent more time there.Very busy although very interesting and what a fantastic building! Loved the blue whale Skelton
"Written February 8, 2023",Absolute Dollop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If pseudo science, fake evolution and fake dinosaurs is your thing - then knock yourself out.From monkey-man to over grown lizards this veritable feast of nonsense is sure to whet the appetite of those who prefer to be given their history rather than researching it.The minute I  walked in the door I couldn't wait to leave. Starting with 'Human Evolution', if you believe you used to be a fish (or whatever) then turned into some kind of chimp.  Then you are right at home in the museum.After a couple of fake dinosaurs I got so bored I'd rather catch  COVID.  No such luck."
"Written September 19, 2021",A great day out,"I have been coming here for some years and there is a lot to see and do at this musuem. The entrance to the musuem is free. You will also find several good cafes here serving a good selection of hot and cold foods, drinks and cakes."
"Written January 19, 2020",Well worth a visit,Really great time. Hadn’t been for many many years. Free or donation - great value . Many interactive exhibitions to keep all ages entertained. Well worth a visit.
"Written January 8, 2020",Lovely day out!,Free admission and a lovely day out for the family exploring the museum. The cafe wasn't great but there were plenty of highchairs and service was pretty quick. There was plenty to see and access to lifts was good for prams etc. 
"Written January 5, 2020",Amazing,Overawed could have spent a day here. Amazing exhibits from around the world for all ages. Just an overall wonderful experience we only had time for a couple of hours but which wasn’t enough so will allow more time on our next visit
"Written January 6, 2020",Annual birthday trip,What a brilliant place. Never get bored and could spend days here. All the staff are brilliant and the Dinosaurs never fail to impress us. First visit to the vault this year which was fascinating. The staff are great.
"Written January 19, 2020",Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition is Fabulous!,"I have visited several times over the years and again this past week. The museum is a fabulous building with a wealth of things to see and experience.The Blue Whale skeleton is fantastic. The WPoY exhibition is awesome.However, for a place so committed to preserving the natural world, I am not sure why the big front doors are continuously open, allowing a cold wind to blow through the huge entrance hall?"
"Written April 25, 2022",Not that OAP friendly.,"It would be good if OAP's like my wife and I, didn't have to walk around the side to get in the front door or all the way around again to get out. We were knackered before we got in. More benches please for quick rests. No clean cups for our tea which had to be served in paper cups. Otherwise, the displays were excellent and my daughter, her husband and grand daughter really enjoyed it."
"Written March 26, 2023",Still a brilliant museum but too crowded for me,First visit to the museum since 2015.  My son is 13 now and still loved it.  Plenty to keep us both interested and the staff were friendly and helpful.  Only downside is how crowded it was.  It made it difficult to see the exhibits.  Kids having meltdowns everywhere.  Not sure if it’s a post covid thing but I don’t like that level of busy anymore.
"Written March 5, 2020",Cant thank the staff enough ,I cant thank the staff enough for how they treated my family and especially my youngest daughter when we visited in the half term holiday. Lovely place filled with lovely staff who cant do enough for you. Absolutely amazing dinosaur gallery. The downstairs area for the younger children is brilliant too. Would highly recommend a visit. 
"Written August 25, 2022",Not good,"Really disappointed with our trip. Too many people, too hot and no obvious route around. The map (£1) is very unhelpful and I was upset that it now appears to be ok again to show stuffed birds if it’s showing how the Victorians used to do it."
"Written February 4, 2022",FREE to get in !,"Free to get in, they do advise to book your tickets online though, but these are still Free. Easy to get too on the tube. Massive place ! Lots to see ! Choice of various cafes onsite ! Staff informative & helpful, really clean place."
"Written January 11, 2022",Great visit,"Great visit.First time visitor but will be back.Great exhibits and plenty to see.Easily accessible with booked tickets, lovely team members and a great way to spend a few hours."
"Written July 15, 2022",Great Museum ,A worthwhile visit to the museum. Lots too do for the kids and I found it fascinating. Didn't try the coffee shop but looked nice and was always busy. 2 Mon walk from South Kennington tube station. Lots of places en route to grab breakfast 
"Written September 16, 2021",Sort the wildlife area out its a shambles,"Good place and a must do. The wildlife garden is a massive letdown, almost derelict,  ponds empty so no way for wildlife to exisit. This area lets the whole place down its a shambles. "
"Written August 24, 2021",Delightful experience,This museum never ceases to amaze me. We bought tickets for the Mystical creatures exhibition. It was so worth it. We got to by pass the que getting in. It was not overly crowded. The exhibition was great and the kids enjoyed it and so did i. It was well thought off and planned. Definitely worth the money. The busiest was the dinosaur area which was packed. I suggest doing that first. The food is pricey but expected. We didn't do the whole day but it can easily fill the day...missed some areas.
"Written February 15, 2020","When it rains, everybody seems to visit a museum","Although the were masses of people, I enjoyed the visit.  The building is awesome, and I have so much respect for what is in it and what researchers do there.  The exhibit itself is a bit too simplified and often adapted to children.  I personally prefer the good old days with lots and lots of exhibited specimen of anything...  But still it was overwhelming sometimes.  "
"Written November 3, 2020",Always worth a visit,Booked a slot due to COVID measures and were shown in promptly at the due time. We were able to see the exhibits better than before without the usual crowds. The dinosaurs are a must see as is the blue whale. Always worth a visit to here and the architecture is amazing.
"Written January 7, 2020",Lots of exhibits on many floors.  Air conditioning,"I spent over an hour walking past all of the exhibits on many floors.  I would stop and read about some of them.  Others were hard to get to due to the crowds.  One could spent many hours here.  The air conditioning was a relief from the heat and humidity outside.  The section about volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis was very interesting."
"Written April 13, 2022",Disorganized and poorly managed,Granted we were there at a busy time but it was so poorly managed. We went from one queue to the next and barely got to see anything. Wish I waited until after the visit to make the donation because our experience with kids was terrible. Probably for adults who have more ability to endlessly queue but poor experience with kids.
"Written September 22, 2020",Spend time wandering,"We should have visited this alone during this day we had here but we had already walked for miles looking at the neighbourhood before we went in. You do need to be more rested as the place is huge. When we went (sorry this review is a little old, Ive been busy) but the best was the Giant Moon exhibition. The dinosaus were a little bit for the kids, and we managed to find a Kiwi, which was kind of cool. All in all such a good place to visit but be more rested as there is lots of walking."
"Written November 25, 2021",Mobbed!,"Try to avoid rainy days, week-ends, high tourist days.  If you have to stand in line to get in, you don't want to go.  Forget the dinosaur exhibit if the place is crowded. . .I was crushed among the people.  "
"Written July 3, 2023",Confusion,A bit confusing prior to visiting I looked on the website and it requested I booked a slot. However on arrival the tickets were not checked and people came and passed. The venue was a bit overcrowded. So levels could have been controlled. Amazing artefacts though.
"Written February 15, 2022",So dull,Went as a kid and was bored now having gone back it’s no better.There is very little interaction with visitors. Lots of cardboard pictures and manny stuffed animal. Young kids looked bored beyond belief. Very dated. Needs more interaction. Also pretty crowded.Having visited Churchill war rooms and imperial war museum these are demonstrations as to what can be achieved.Maybe charge a proper fee and invest it in the exhibits ?
"Written January 23, 2020",Amazing day out ,"Amazing day out spent looking in the museums, very beautiful building with a lot of detail inside and out. Loads of different historical features inside for all ages. Dinosaurs, animals, rocks (space meteors) and biological information. Loved every minute, highly recommend if visiting London. "
"Written April 11, 2015",Falling further and further behind the best - it'll soon be history itself.,"Having visited with my grandchildren when they were 6, three years ago, I noticed the museum was looking dated and falling behind the times in terms of interactivity and excitement. Yesterday we returned and nothing had changed.It appears that all the money goes into the paid-for extras such as the coral reef exhibition which is an extortionate £60 for a family of four. Yes £60. In a free entry museum. Want to see the butterflies in the marquee outside? That'll be another £24 for your family of four please. Add à coffee or two and and this visit to a free entry museum will have stung you for about a hundred quid.So that explains why the working class kids get a different experience from their visit than their wealthier peers. And I'm fairly sure this museum has charitable status to ensure education for all.Sickening isn't it?"
"Written June 9, 2023",Lots to see in this museum,"There is certainly lots to see here. Sections on earthquakes, volcanoes, rocks and minerals, flora, and fauna and more. Many children are visiting. The entrance up the escalator is remarkable."
"Written August 26, 2019",Never gets old.,"I think I was fourteen when I first came here on a school trip from my home in the North of England. I remember being astounded by the scale and came away with bags full of new information, certainly enough to satisfy my teacher.I revisited in my late twenties with a close friend and thoroughly enjoyed it on a whole different level.I made a flying visit with my wife and first son in my late thirties and, although still lerning new things all the time, delighted in seeing them discover the place for the first time and watching what they took away from it.This time... well, now I'm in my forties and my wife and both sons, now both old enough to appreciate it fully, went along. We were there for hours and still didn't see everything yet every twist in turn has something to educate, enlighten or entertain.The sheer range of displays ranging through the natural history of our world is astounding and the variety of exhibits always reveals something new. This year 'working exhibits' showing how restorations and studies are undertaken were new to me and added a nice layer of depth to the proceedings. Of course, some aspects were unchanged from that very first visit however this is never to the detriment of the museum.Oddly, even with two children in tow I finally really got to appreciate the building itself. Somewhere I saw it described as 'A cathedral to the natural world' and this description is so apt. the building is, of course, beautiful, but the attention to detail throughout is astounding. I almost want to go back on my own and ignore the exhibits and just take in the magnificence of the building.Enough though... even though the refreshments are not exactly great value, even though there are more than ample opportunities to spend your money on all kinds of branded...stuff..., this is a peerless destination and represents perhaps the greatest value for money in London (unless you drive in, in which case local car parking might set you back a bit)."
"Written August 1, 2016",Microbes to mammoths...prepare to be amazed!,"A wondrous place filled with....just about everything. Spectacular exhibits everywhere you look. Microbes, mammoths, dinosaurs, lava and much, much, much more!One day isn't enough to see everything this great building had to offer, so we went back for a second day!Pros: free, spectacular insight into the world's history, something for all ages, amazing exhibits.Cons: cafe was expensive, needs more staff to assist in answering questions (out 7 year old had lots and lots of unanswered questions)Perfect place to visit on a rainy day."
"Written November 16, 2014",Cannot get in for the queues of children!,"I got as far as the queue this time, but gave up.  Sorry, but as a Londoner I feel really fed up that I can no longer visit my favourite museum because the numbers of school parties, tourists, or in the holidays just vast numbers of families make it impossible to enjoy – the queues and the noise are horrendous.  I absolutely agree that children need to visit this place, and it's great that it's free for them, but why can't we have just one day a week for grown ups, or perhaps for Londoners only – I am sure many old fogies like me would be happy to pay for this and it might help the museum to make some money if people knew they could get in and walk around in relative peace to enjoy the wonderful exhibits."
"Written October 31, 2012",Ideal day out for a two year old,We took our two year old grandson for a leisurely visit to the museum. We allowed him to wander and look at what he liked and what interested him which meant we ended up spending a good hour in the Dinosaur Section. It could be described as potentially frightening for a younger child but his enthusiasm overcame any fear. We went outside the school holidays and did not find the venue crowded. Children see lots of animals on TV or asleep in Zoo's but he was able to get a real idea of the size of the various animals close up. He was too young to read and go into any depth with the exhibits but the lay out and way things were exhibited allowed him to view things from his own perspective. He was talking about the experience for days. There is a very nice restaurant and coffee shop and you can also do as we did and take your own food. Well worth a visit and a place you can return to again and again. Something of interest for everyone.
"Written October 23, 2023",We're coming back for a full tour!,I think I took around 400 pictures in only 2 hours... Such a beautiful museum to visit. A must-see in London!

Dinosaurs can bee seen too what seemed to be really funny to children. I really love this museum. If you are into minerals (quartz, opal, obsidian and so on) you must visit the giganteous exhibition in the second floor."
"Written July 28, 2019",Great history,I personally really enjoyed the museum. It is free and there are no queues. It can get really busy but there are so many things to look at and explore. I would definitely recommend to visit at least once and learn about so many historic things.
"Written December 31, 2018",Good collection but very crowded museum,"We‘ve never been to a museum as crowded as the Natural History Museum in London. Although we were impressed by several rooms and pieces of the collections, it was not possible to enjoy our visit due to the crowds. Also, some rooms are highly interactive, which is good for kids but perhaps a bit too much for adults. At times, it felt like the museum wanted to attract nothing but children. For us it was very tiring, and we definitely prefer the natural history museums in Paris, NYC and that of Washington DC."
"Written May 16, 2018",So much to see,"The Natural History Museum sits side by side with The Science Museum and The Victoria and Albert Museum and though all are worth a visit, it is my favourite of the three. A beautiful building on the inside and out, it is filled with curiosities and fabulous displays from the natural world, past, present and looking into the future. A couple of favourites include ""Sophie"" the most intact stegosaurus skeleton ever found and a gorgeous display of hummingbirds, perched and in flight, which dates back to 1800.The museum is free to visit though donations are encouraged. Some extras you'll need to pay to enter like the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit which, incidentally, is worth the £12.50 entry fee. Fabulous, sometimes breathtaking photos, many with moving stories behind the moment of capture.It's worth taking time at this museum and it's easy to get around (though the dinosaur exhibit can get pretty busy, especially with school groups). Wifi is free as are toilet stops and there are a few places to stop for a coffee and a bite to eat. And if you need to grab a souvenir for someone at home, the gift shop is also worth a visit."
"Written January 5, 2016",Simply Amazing!!!!!!,This is a primer as well as an advanced course in natural history. Amazing exhibits with the Dinosaur section and the blue whale being prime attractions. Reach early to avoid long queues.
"Written June 17, 2023",Fun Museum,"I’m not one to gush over a building of stuffed animals, but this one is impressively done. Loved the animated T-Rex, don’t miss it. The Darwin center is nicely done with a bright room full of true to scale mammals. Such a varied collection - the oldest rock, a specimen from Mars, a full skeleton from Wyoming, an extensive mineral collection - don’t miss the super valuable vault collection. Housed in an ancient and atmospheric building. I expected old and stuffy, the old and stuffy remain true - though the content will awaken your awareness and appreciation for this amazing planet."
"Written May 11, 2019",My Favourite Museum,"This is my favourite museums not just in London, but the whole world. It's sheer size makes it impossible to do justice to the museum in only one visit. Since I'm lucky enough to spend a lot of time in London, I like to visit the museum in sections and today I saw an exhibition on human evolution. Some truly fascinating specimens were on display, with lots of interesting description."
"Written December 5, 2020",Great display in a beautiful building,I've been coming here most of my life and I still stand in awe of the building itself and also the exhibitions inside. Plenty of Covid precautions in place so a safe visit on a day out in London 
"Written October 31, 2020",Great visit,We visited here for the first time with our two youngest boys (aged 8 and 9). We were here about 4 hours and enjoyed our visit.
"Written October 18, 2020",Fantastic! ,"We took our 5 year old here and as we hadn’t been since being children ourselves we were extremely impressed. Covid safe management, when the dinosaur area got too busy, staff stepped in. Hand cleaning, plenty of space and mask requirement. Incredible building, great range of things to look at and a fantastic mixture of old and new. We loved the visit and have to say even the museum shop was a surprise with some items very clearly well priced which is not always the case with gift shops! Such a range to suit all interests and enough to keep the younger people entertained. Some of the interactive exhibits were of course not being used, totally understandable in the circumstances but we imagine it to be even better for kids when fully functioning. "
"Written January 14, 2020",Beyond our expectations,An amazing place. Just the architecture and building design take your breath away. The exhibits are unique and really give you a sense of the evolution of species. Not to be missed

"Written November 12, 2019",Wonderful ,"Firstly. The natural history museum is a majestic building it really is a stunning piece of architecture and a jewel in England’s crown. The museum itself is huge. It’s hard to take in so many great things in a couple of hours as it has so many points of interest  it’s a place for the whole family   The stairs are quite steep not sure if there are lifts  (didn’t help I had pulled my stomach and back muscles the previous week) but it was worth the climb  as there is a fantastic collection of historical artefacts stretching millions of years, the museum has something for all. And it’s  also free entry for all  donations are welcome though, the souvenir shop is very good too and also has something for everyone,  will be visiting again. To see the things we couldn’t fit in.  Highly recommended to all "
"Written October 7, 2019",Enjoyed,Great place to spend time. I think we need to spend few days just to go there. Everyone  may find some sections to enjoy.
"Written October 1, 2019",Fascinating,"I had never been to a Natural History Museum before, but this did not disappoint. Floors full of everything you could hope to see and more. I was there when the Museum of the Moon exhibit by Luke Jerrom was up for display and could have spent all day in there. Absolutely incredible."
"Written September 10, 2019",See the power of the pineapple,"I may only be a pineapple but I know when an establishment is deserving of respect and this is one such. I went to the Natural History Museum during the school holidays so obviously it was busy and to complain about crowds in England in August is the behaviour of a chump. I thoroughly enjoyed finally seeing the place where Paddington so nearly met a dreadful end. I was amazed by the dinosaur exhibits, enthralled with the geological displays and horrified at just how many furry and feathered friends have met their deaths at the hands of so called explorers. I tell you, if I ever laid my hands (metaphorically, as I have none) on anyone who engaged in such nonsense, they would feel the wrath of the pineapple. Sorry to get hot under the collar but it makes my juice boil. My favourite part of this magnificent museum though, was the moon (see picture). I was thrilled to be pictured holding it aloft. It was of course, not the outdoor moon but I assume, a slightly smaller version. Although, as I could not see outside at the time, it was somewhat a Schrodinger’s Cat situation. Haha. All in all, I would cheerfully recommend the Natural History Museum as a fine day out for people and pineapples alike."
"Written August 27, 2019",Good day out ,Really good museum can’t believe it’s free! The thought that has gone into each display is amazing would 100% recommend. Would just say to bring your own drinks and food as the restaurant is very pricey. It’s also right next to South Kensington underground which is so useful! 
"Written August 12, 2020",Shame not alot to do ,"Been many times and loved it, however and only because of covid this time sucked, understandable a lot is closed due to covid and everything else seems rushed. Its hard to social distance, especially the dinosaur and its very small now to view it as the raised platform is not in use. At the moment I would give it a miss just because I know how fun and good it can be, that's not take anything away from the staff who clearly have worked very hard to even get it to this stage, I will come back but when hopefully things are more settled "
"Written July 7, 2023",Outstanding pictures,Went to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition. Outstanding photography by children and adults in some unusual situations. Each backlit photo was accompanied by the name land country of residence of the photographer together with details of the camera and settings used as well as information on the actual picture. Well displayed  and extremely interesting
"Written July 19, 2021",Wish the dinosaur had taken some adults for lunch.,They need to work out a way to have adults only times. The whole place was like a giant crèche. I dread to think what it will be like over the 6 weeks summer holiday. I have no problem with kids needing to learn but there was no learning going on. Mums were mostly on the phone.
"Written June 4, 2023","Lots to see, nice way to spend a morning","Went by myself, it was half term so very busy, not sure if it's always so busy.  Great morning though, went round each area, Hope was magnificent this was my favourite part the hall was beautiful, but loved the animated dinosaurs too.  Tried out the earthquake simulation too which was fine but wished it lasted longer.  Was going to have food there but was very busy and the gift shop was very expensive, but other than that great way to spend a morning."
"Written July 6, 2021",Amazing!,"Wonderful experience, so much to see. Stunning building with excellent exhibits. On entry you can buy a map for £1.00 explaining all the zones, which is easy to follow to ensure you capture all that is on offer. The blue zone was a real highlight, great for all the family. Highly recommend a visit."
"Written October 24, 2023","Slow down, and take it all in, especially the story boards about Mary Anning ","I found a day on my own, and spent half of it touring this Victorian wonder.  As a geologist, I was happy to be there all alone to slowly walk through the different halls and exhibits.  I particularly liked how history was corrected, and Mary Anning was given the special recognition of her discoveries and talent, which were buried for more than a 100 years.  I also really enjoyed viewing the large specimen room, and particularly the asbestos minerals.  As an asbestos abatement manager, I will use photos of these perfect specimens in my training presentations."
"Written March 6, 2020",Forever in awe,First time visiting and it won’t be the last. There is so much to see it can’t be done in one day. You get a real sense of scale as to the size of some of these amazing creatures in relation to yourself as well as your place in the natural world. I will forever be in awe of this incredible place.
"Written February 10, 2020",Best place in London,"A true heaven for a Geologist and a science estimator. Minerals and fossils collections are huge. If sciences are your thing, plan a full day to visit it. The shop is really nice to visit as well and there are a few spots for food and beverage."
"Written August 13, 2022",Ditch the animatronics,"It was ok. Very hot, but plenty of places to buy drinks and to take a rest. I wanted to see more exhibits instead of info boards and gimmicks. The animatronics took up space that could have been given over to more exhibits. Felt a bit too like a theme park, not a museum."
"Written July 2, 2023",Iconic London!,"A London classic! I brought my cousin here, as it was her first time in London and she was thoroughly impressed.  The main hall with Hope the Blue Whale is just so stunning and beautiful!  The exhibits were well done and interesting and the large gift shop had a lot of neat souvenirs to bring home.  This is my favorite London museum and I will always go back when in town."
"Written September 4, 2016",Where is Andy's clock?,"Visited with my family (boys 5&9) had planned only 2 which I thought would hold their attention, earth zone and of course dinosaurs, after gauging interest levels at Tower of London this was essential! Full credit there is plenty of toilets and refreshment areas.They loved the dramatic escalator ride I side Earth and the earthquake simulator and rest was hit and miss. The Dinosaurs I thought would be the making of the trip but again apart from some fantastic animatronics with some exhibits it was too much for them to take all in. My youngest was very excited when we entered the big hall with the diplodocus as he and his brother are big Andy's Dinosaur Adventures fans, he demanded his camera and walked around with great purpose taking photos and then stopped, did a 360 and asked ""where us Andy's clock?"" When he realised it was not there he was not amused. They have a whole exhibit space named and rightly so after Sir David Attenborough, I think one small BBC prop clock and a cut out Andy has earned a place as the show has definitely grabbed the interest of the younger generation."
"Written May 10, 2014",Dinosnores sleepover,"Took my boys and some of their friends as a birthday treat to do the Dinosnores sleep over. Its a brilliant idea and appealed to their love of Night in the museum. We were a small group, just hit the minimum numbers of 5 and had 2 adults. We arrived a bit late and due to the size of other groups it takes a while to get in and processed. Spaces next to Dippy in the main hall had long gone! For some reason I stupidly thought sleeping in a museum might be cold. How very wrong I was. It was July but it was BAKING hot. You have to have min of 1 adult, men can only sleep the mens side, but women can sleep either, so I ended up wedged between a scout group and a school group and the only woman. Its very noisy, but with zillions of excited kids it would be.As a small group we found we got lost and left behind alot, so the overall impression was pretty chaotic and we had no clear direction what we were doing. We started with a talk about asteroids, then moved over for a break, then over to do a torch lit dinosaur hunt..which the kids LOVED (and us too) and then into design t shirts. Kids were tired by then.Kiss goodbye to any thoughts of decent sleep when you walk in, you get a yoga style camping mat to sleep on, and endless rounds of ssshhhhh followed by giggles at about midnight, which is pretty amusing. And the odd child throwing up from excitement and too many sweets.In the morning you get breakfast and and its very cool to see the museum waking up before the doors open. They also do a live animal show which was excellent. If you are going to do this then I think you pretty much know what you are letting yourself in for as an adult, but the kids will LOVE IT. Its a really special thing to do and Im so pleased the Natural History Museum tap into that sense of adventure, mystery and excitement that makes history come to life for us all."
"Written November 15, 2019",Impressive!,"This is a real impressive Museum in London. It is a really ""WOW"" place. There is a lot to see and you can easily spend 2 days here without getting bored or maybe have seen everything they have there. Really really nice!!"

"
"Written September 18, 2016",Interesting and educational - and it’s free!,"We visited the Natural History Museum in South Kensington and like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, this museum does not charge an admission fee. The building itself is absolutely magnificent; a stunning piece of architecture with wonderful ornate carvings of animals built into it.Everything relating to living or extinct natural objects is housed inside this museum.  You can see anything from the fossilised bones of a gigantic dinosaur to a diminutive flea. It was enlightening to see how huge the dinosaurs were and the blue whale was gigantic.The museum was very busy when we visited but I suppose it is understandable considering it’s free.  However, despite being busy, we still managed to see everything we had wanted to – it is definitely worth a visit."

"Written January 27, 2014","The restaurant is fabulous, gluten free friendly too!","I just had to comment on the NHM restaurant which we visited on a very busy Saturday in January.  We were greeted by a long queue but were pleased to be given menus to peruse so that by the time we reached the front (only about 5 mins) we were ready to order and keep the efficiency of the system going.  We could see the food being prepared while we waited and it all seemed to be freshly made to order.  The gluten free choice was amazing, pizzas, pastas and lots more.  We were shown to our table and when the food arrived (not too long to wait) it looked lovely and tasted delicious. Good sized portions too, enough for hungry teenage boys! We had used their meal deal, main, dessert and drink for £12.50 and it was incredible value. Would definitely visit again when in the area. As good as(better for coeliacs) some of the well known restaurant chains!"
"Written November 1, 2012",Dullest museum I've ever visited,"We had the choice if visiting either the Science museum or natural history, and as I reckoned my children (11, 5, 4) would like to see the dinosaurs, we opted for Natural History. Within 2 minutes of arrival I knew I'd made the wrong choice! The dinosaur queue was roughly an hour in length despite us not going until 4 pm to hopefully avoid the large amounts of people. We gave it up as a bad job and tried the Blue Zone instead. Having a pram with me as my 4 year old is mobility impaired proved incredibly difficult as in several places the museum design barely allows for 2 people to pass by each other, never mind a pram! There were virtually no interactive activities in the blue Zone so we abandoned it in favour of the orange zone ( specimens in jars- yawn) and the cocoon, which held no draw for the kids either. Who wants to hear about how to catch flies in Scotland with a pooter? All in all, we will never be attending again, it is two hours of our lives we won't get back and wish we'd spent it elsewhere."
"Written April 17, 2012",I first visited the Natural History Museum...,"I first visited the Natural History Museum as a child. I can still remember the impact of going in through the arched entrance and seeing the huge dinosaur skeleton staring down at me in the middle of that vast open hall. That experience was the first of many over the years, and I have always had a great affection for this museum. I liked the slightly Victorian feel of the architecture, the galleries with the stuffed animals, the insects and of course the dinosaurs.Well, that was then. I took my children there at the weekend, hoping that they would have a similar experience to my first visit. What a disappointment. First, we couldn't even go in through the normal entrance - that was reserved for people paying for exhibitions and members and Important People. Ordinary folk were steered around the back of the building, through a security point to have our bags checked (I can confirm that my nine-year-old son was proven not to be an enemy of the state and not to be carrying any tactical nuclear weapons, which was a relief) and finally ushered through a relatively anonymous back door into the museum. And once in - what have they done to the place? Half of the galleries seem to have been replaced by shopping and eating experiences, and a large part of the ground floor was given over to one of these depressingly modern participatory exhibitions. Instead of looking at things and learning, it seems that nowadays you have to be able to manipulate, pull, push and jump up and down on things before you can understand them. And throughout this exhibition the lovely old stone-work of what used to be the most beautiful museum in Britain has been covered up by plasterboard screens that steer you around the ""highlights"". This was my kids' introduction to the Nat Hist, and unsurprisingly they were not that impressed. Never mind, I thought, let's see the dinosaurs. Well, yes, that would be OK if I wanted to wait for 45 minutes. Instead of just letting people visit the damn thing, the staff had set up long snaking rope-lines to stagger the entry. I asked why and got the depressingly predictable ""ElfenSafety sir"". Round ones, I say. I am quite sure that if people had been allowed to circulate naturally around the museum the traffic would find its own level - people don't like being treated like sheep.We came back later in the day and eventually got to see the dinosaurs, but even this had been turned from an intelligent display of fossils with useful explanations into another ""experience"", culminating in an unconvincing animatronic T. Rex shaking its head and roaring without conviction. Talk about dumbing down.There is an outpost of the Nat Hist in Tring in Hertfordshire. Go there and marvel at the stuffed animals in glass and mahogany cases, the racks of glass drawers of butterflies and insects representing whole lifetimes of study, the expectation that visitors might want to browse and learn in quiet rather than the braying of techno-pop, the simple refusal to treat visitors as though they are slack-jawed morons with a 20-second attention span. But I would not advise going to the Nat Hist in London with such expectations. Very disappointing."
"Written December 30, 2011",Poor quality ice rink equipment,"Love the NHM, it is a great place to visit but the temporary ice rink that is currently there is best left alone. Both my wife and I are regular skaters and own our own skates; but as London is nearly 3 hours from us, we left them at home; foolishly. The boots provided are in the worst state I've ever seen; the first pairs we both tried on were so blunt that you couldn't stand on the ice with them! second and third pairs were no better, so we complained to the person serving us (who was very polite and friendly). He informed us that the skate sharpener had been out of action for some time, so none of the skates had been sharpened. We asked for a refund, as we felt the skates were not fit for purpose, and in our opinion, dangerous. the manager was called, and he pretty much told us to mind our own business and that we didn't know what we were talking about. He even contradicted the staff member who had been serving us by claiming that the sharpening machine had been working until that morning; we were on the 10am session. He refused to give us a refund, telling us to contact IMG; the company who run the skating rink, and was even fairly snotty with us about giving us his name so we could complain.We both love the Natural History Museum and ice skating and do not want either of them tainted by such a shoddily run venture as the temporary ice rink that is in the grounds.Probably also worth mentioning that I also posted a comment on the HNM Facebook page giving our views on the quality of the ice rink hire skates; it was taken down shortly afterwards with no comment from whoever maintains the page. I have also passed on our concerns to the museum directly by email; this is not meant as a rant at the museum, but as a real concern over the safety of those who are using the hire skates at this rink."
"Written July 10, 2011","Free entry, bit staid - and no dinosaurs!","Visited the museum for the first time in several years and found it to be a good few hours. The museum is rather traditional - as in here's a case, have a look at it, but it is huge and you could spend several hours here if you wanted to see it all and didn't have young children etc with you. The special sex exhibit was good but a bit pricey. We were also slightly disappointed that the dinosaurs were being cleaned. Overall though worth a visit."
"Written June 3, 2011",Don't waste your money on age of the dinosaur,The museum is ok if you want to look at stuffed animals. Paid £28 for a family of 4 to go into the age of the dinosaur exhibition. What a waste if money. There are only a couple of animated dinosaurs and the tour only takes about 10 minutes. Just take a tour around the normal dinosaur exhibition
"Written January 22, 2007",Interesting,"This Museum is definately worth a visit, especially as it is free and lets face it everything else in London is so expensive it is good to not have to put your hand in your pocket again.The museum is spilt into different zones which is great as it means you can skip anything you don't want to see.  All the exhibits are really interesting and it is a great place to learn.Tips,  The musuem opens at 10am and I would recommed going in the morning.  When we left at 12 noon the queue to get in was huge and went out onto the street but when we arrived (10.15am) there was hardly a queue at all.Even if you go round and see and study everything in detail I would say that you will not need more than 4 hours, this should help if you are trying to cram lots of things into a day or 2"

Yes, there are roving packs of children if you visit during the school holidays, but we've also wandered the halls solo during off-peak hours (ie: during the school week).  Even during the summer you can strategically avoid the little nippers if you arrive early and avoid the dinosaur hall.That being said, we have two little guys who love the museum.  Every time we're in London we pop in and explore a new section...plus hit the aforementioned dinosaur exhibit.  There is tons of interactive stuff for every age, plus more in-depth reading for anyone with a longer attention span than our group.  We spent over an hour just in the 'senses' exhibit, examining visual illusions and seeing how much we could remember in the crime scene video.  If you really love Natural History, you could easily use up two days of your trip just hanging out in this fantastic building.  The Science Museum (equally as impressive) and fabulous Victoria & Albert museum are just next door.  There is a tube station right on the corner, and the best breakfast place in all of London just down the road.  If you want to grab breakfast before hitting the museums, head down Cromwell Road (in front on NH & V&A Museum) towards London.  Just a few blocks away, on the right (south side) of the street is the Patisserie Valerie.  Great prices and YUM--the croissants and big breakfasts will save you from having to mess with mundane museum food!FYI:  Thank your local Londoner once you've visited the museums.  The high income tax they're paying helps to finance all three of the museums above, and the admission to all of them is FREE."
"Written April 8, 2022",Won't be going back unless it's guaranteed to be quiet. Uncomfortable experience.,"We visited yesterday with 2 adults and 4 children (6-9) and honestly, it was a horrendous experience and none of us want to experience it again.We chalked it up to a few things;* The timing - half term can be a tad busier for obvious reasons. * Over booking - it was packed to the point where there were pile ups of people trying to squeeze through the tiny passage ways throughout the Dinosaur exhibit.* People just not caring - walking up to the entrance I had someone's child actively jump off of a wall and nearly knock myself and my youngest over. His parents didn't even care. We had a few kids shove into the younger members of our group throughout the day too.We did the entrance hall with ease as it wasn't packed and then as we walked down towards the mammals and dinosaurs sections we noticed the que was massive to get in. We opted to turn into the mammals rather than go to dinosaurs and walked backwards.The mammals wasn't too packed thankfully and we were able to spend time looking at different bits happily.The moment we got to the dinosaurs section however it was an almost instant regret.The amount of people that pushed and shoved to get through as you are trying to look at the first bit of information when you walk in (about the different periods of time) and the t-rex & triceratops skulls was frustrating. Not to mention the big buggies that are being used and struggle to fit through some of the gaps.We continued to see the tyrannosaurus rex and that was slightly less packed however you walk in one way and to get to the red of the exhibition you essentially double back right next to it - easy enough unless you want to go to see the TRex then leave because people just filter round and push. Terrible management of the lines etc.After this we really wished we'd gone out rather than through the dinosaurs bit. A lot of it was closed off and there were high boards up meaning we were essentially forced through in pairs as people were pushing us into the walls trying to get ahead of us. At one point I had to stop and calm my son as he was starting to have a small over load due to the heat and packed out area.As soon as we spotted an opening we lifted the kids through and got the heck outta there.All 4 of the kids voiced they they wanted to leave there and then. So we did.I won't take them back unless it's a quiet quiet day as that was unsafe on many levels.  Very uncomfortable for everyone there and honestly the lack or care shown by others is shocking."
"Written October 2, 2015",Great place for people of all ages,- A must-visit in London- Great collection of specimen and models- Its really huge and takes at least 2-3 hours to see the entire place- Can get crowded on weekends- Great place for kids
"Written February 19, 2015",BEWARE There is no members room at present,"The museum has some great exhibits but........We live outside London, so a members' room is a real benefit of membership.Currently there is no members' room and no date for a new members' room.Filling in a complaint form about the lack of a members' room resulted in ............ no contact at all from the Museum.  Which just made me that bit crosser."
"Written October 4, 2010","If you are over 15, it is absolute rubbish","I went to this museum yesterday, and I was so disappointed. All I saw was lots of animal models, and dinosaur models. There are very few real animals there, and those are birds mainly. The greatest disappointment was when I entered the other two museums; I spent 4 and half hours in it and saw almost nothing real, just games and videos and pictures for children; and there lies the extraordinary science and V&A museums. So, my advice is spend your time in the others, just give 30 minutes to this museum for the earth's treasury, they have all kinds of rocks in it, and it is worth to see and another 30 minutes to zoology spirit building if you have interest in historical collection of animals in jars, skip the cocoon and whatever you do, do not enter the dinosaur chamber, unless you want to spend at leats 40 minutes in the queue just to see 2 dino fossils a few plastic models and a plastic model t-rex roaring. It is for only children and adults that have lower IQ than an average child."
"Written July 17, 2010",Dino Snores,"Fantastic !!!!Spend the night at the museum.I went in a group of 5 8 yr old kids and 2 adults - what a great night.The kids loved it.We had lots to do and loved all of it.Adults - don't expect to get any sleep, especially if there's a male adult snoring like a walrus all night echoing through the main hall and 500 kids giggling but it was fantastic all the same. Brilliant fun and great team leaders and presenters. I imagined stuffy museum types, they aren't. Very entertaining and worth the 45 quid per child. Will book again."
"Written November 9, 2019",Shockingly awful museum !,"No words can begin to describe how disgusted i am with the service this museum has provided (or not provided!) today. Over £100 spent on tickets down the drain as apparently due to 'technical problems' our tickets were booked for another day. We were then faced with the fact that we weren't allowed in as the space was full which we knew it wasn't, as groups in front of us were being told to buy tickets that day! Then we were rudely told that we could not even have a refund. Along with all this we were accompanied by dear friends who had travelled over 200 miles to see the exhibition for a birthday. JACK EVANS the so called 'manager' was called down to talk to us. He was the rudest, foulest, most inexperienced manager i have ever spoken to. The way he dealt with the situation was appalling and i strongly advise his job to be reviewed as if it was me i wouldn't dare employ such a disgustingly vile man. So, in summary the natural history museum is not somewhere i will be returning to until a whole new team of staff are employed and i will be telling all the family and friends to steer very clear from this disaster of a museum!"
"Written August 1, 2019",Many things to see here,"There are many things to see in this place. After you finish seeing guard change at the palace, you can walk to this museum or take the tube here. It is free entry but you can donate for them. It is really interesting place. I am sure if you like this kind of stuff, you must visit this place. There are restaurant and shops that you can buy souvenir also. "
"Written June 1, 2019",Love it,"When you come to London you have to visit the Natural History Museum. I visited it twice, I love it. Probably, I will visit it again😊The entrance is free, you have to pay  only for special exhibitions. Of course, if you want, you can make a donation, 5 pounds is ok. The opening hour is 10, usualy you have to wait to enter, 10-15 minutes. The museum is very well organised, the building itself is a work of art. "
"Written May 21, 2019",A strange feeling ,"So the natural history museum is a beautiful building. But the inside well I think it’s great for children but a lot of replicas and the things that actually are real are covered in dust and not taking cared of, and very old posters. The best part was a performance one on the rooms. "
"Written November 19, 2016",First time visit,"Neither of us had been to this Museum before and were greatly looking forward to it, sadly we were a little disappointed about some aspects of it.We entered via the exhibition Road entrance, which may have been a mistake. Bags checked we progressed to the admissions desk where it was noted there were two of us and we were told that while admission was free there was a suggested donation of £5. In these circumstances we usually will give a donation (more often than not, larger than any suggested one) on exiting the venue. We explained this and were waved on with a smile. Next, a few feet away, we encountered two donations boxes, the way forward between them blocked by a member of staff, who repeated the donation line quite forcefully. This person only reluctantly got out of the way once we had explained again our wish to delay any donation until the end of our visit. It seems that this suggested donation is seen as compulsory by some. Having entered we encountered the escalator entrance to the volcano display, spectacular, but we made the error of going straight up it. We had not realised we had no way through from these levels to the rest of the museum, we rapidly got very lost. We had not been offered a map of the museum on entrance and found only one member of staff, a cleaner, who was very helpful and guided us back to where we could collect a folded map of the type usually given on admission to National museums, they were £1 here. We picked one up and then could find our way round the fascinating displays in what is a stunning building. Highlights for us were the dinosaur and Blue whale galleries, Dippy is an interesting cast, as are a surprising number of the dinosaur skeletons, something we were quite disappointed with. We could understand a few to add balance to the types displayed of course, but there did seem to be an awful lot of them, do we really have such a paucity of real specimens in the national collection? The human display was fascinating, as was the insect and the darwin centre. The Gems was a very traditional but interesting display, the treasury was fascinating, I never knew gold had been found in more than microscopic quantities in the UK before.Apart from the admissions staff the rest of the staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly. A bonus is the availability of free WiFi, which meant my wife could post a film of the animated Trex on facebook, saying it reminded her of her mother.In the end although disappointed in the almost desperation to extract money out of visitors at times (admission is free but as UK taxpayers we already contribute) we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and yes we did leave a donation."
"Written June 21, 2016",Security guard ruined what could of been a great day,"On walking in to museum there was a table for bags to be searched on entry. There were two members of security team carrying out checks, after waiting by the table for approx 1 minute and being ignored I assumed it was only selected people's bags that were being searched so decided to walk on, at this point I was shouted at ""where do u think you are going"" I said ""I'm sorry didn't realise u wanted to search my bag, I will come back"" to which the security guard in question replied ""yeah u better had"" I then opened by bag for him to look inside feeling really embarrassed and deflated that a trip I had been really looking forward to wasn't off to a great start. He was so rude while checking through my bag and treated me with such contempt that as soon as my bag search was over I walked into the museum and burst out crying. Something that should have been a very small part of my day ended up leaving me feeling really small and foolish for the rest of the day. I really hope no1 else has the same experience I did."
"Written August 10, 2019",Gross Gross Gross Toilets,"In the set of toilets I used there where 3 loos, 2 of the locks on the toilet doors were broken,2 sanitary bins were full and over flowing. It was a really unpleasant experience. For a iconic tourist attraction will years of experience, you would hope that in peak seasons (i.e.summer holidays) that’s these facilities were managed more effectively."
"Written June 15, 2019",rowded venue with no ventilation in the dinosaur exhibit and most other areas,"Busloads of school children pack the museum every weekday and parents/grandparents  bring them on weekends. We tried to get in on a Thursday, then Saturday morning and the venue was overcrowded and unventilated making it hot and very unpleasant to be there. We came back about 2.30pm on Saturday and were able to see the minerals/crystal display. We returned on a very cold Sunday morning and were able to view most exhibits except the cocoon.The best educational exhibit is the Creepy/Crawly insect section with its interactive display. The other sections worth viewing when not too crowded and hot are the mammals and dinosaur displays. In general it is unpleasant to be there in its unventilated rooms with huge crowds."
"Written November 13, 2018",The greatest museum in the world and free,If you combine this with the science museum it is basically the greatest museum on earth particularly for kids and teenagers. The dinosaurs are iconic and the blue whale even more so. A must for visitors in London 
"Written October 10, 2018",What happened it used to be amazing!,"I feel so sad as I write this remembering the 2 times I have been in the past admittedly a long time ago. The building is still spectacular and worth going to see, but what happened to all the fabulous exhibits they used to have. They seem to have been all packed away in favour of interactive exhibits aimed at children. We were so disappointed. It was really packed but this would have been okay if all the schoolchildren in groups hadn’t been so “feral”. The teachers were all letting them run riot. This was just one party but all of them. Everyone was also really rude. I am a northerner and could not believe how people conduct themselves here! Try to avoid mornings and early afternoons if you can."
"Written August 9, 2018",Awful experience,"Ridiculously busy, no visitor control, hot, no air-con of notice, hardly any guides, poor signing, small crowded toilets, outdated exhibitions, more interested in maximising income from tacky souvenirs and food. Not how I remember as a kid - what have they done?!"
"Written August 8, 2018",Too hot,Family was very disappointed with the visit. The high levels of the crowds mixed with the heat in the museum did not make it enjoyable. People were looking flushed and not well. It was a great disappointment since it was filled with great exhibits and displays. 
"Written July 24, 2018",Awful. Awful. Awful. ,"I spent a total of 45 minutes here; 15 minutes queuing for the toilet, 15 minutes walking around the museum and 15 minutes using the free WiFi (the only good thing about the place) googling 'things to do near me' to find an alternative way to spend the 2 or 3 hours I had planned to spend here. The museum looks grand from the outside but once inside it's a huge disappointment. I was greeted by a member of staff trying so hard to get every visitor to donate £5 that it made me not donate (it's free entry). The hard sell put me off! The layout is extremely confusing and the signage needs sorting out, I followed signs to the toilets and ended up walking round and round in circles. Then I came across a group doing the exact same thing. Very confusing coloured signs which offer very little in terms of helping you find your way around. The museum was crammed full of people so I could barely see a single thing. What I did see looked rubbish, fake animals covered in dust, plastic bones, poor signage, confusing cordons in the dinosaur section. I can't believe how bad this place is. Cafe extortionate and hardly any choice of healthy meals or snacks but loads of cakes to choose from. Avoid! Go next door to the Victoria and Albert instead. "
"Written January 2, 2015",SO YOU LIKE QUEUES?,"Visited on Boxing Day, and have never experienced queues like it - even at the Empire State Building, New York. Not sure all is being done by the management to reduce queueing. A free flow may well allow a better flow of people. There were staff positioned at the tube exit in Gloucester Road forcing people to join queues, and barriers and barricades make queueing obligatory. When inside, there are more regulated queues. It was not a pleasant experience, and I would not recommend a visit.Interestingly enough just up the road, the Science Museum had lots of people in it but because there was no queuing structure, people tended to work out there own ebb and flow leading to a much pleasanter experience. Similarly at the V&A, all on the same day."
"Written October 9, 2014",disappointing and depressing,"After a first great impression at the entrance i have noticed that many rooms are now filled with bars and cafe... with the usual lame coffee and plasticky cakes; Most installations are dated and by reading the descriptions it felt like every other animal got extinct or is seriously threatened by humans. Which is true..., but when you read that and look around at the crowds eating rubbish food and producing even more rubbish at an impressive rate... i found that a very depressing experience.Oh, and don't dare going close to the toilets.. the most disgusting thing ever.I have visited Vienna National History museum in Austria a few years back and THAT was worth it! Who likes this has no idea of how amazing this place could be."
"Written October 4, 2014",Restaurant totally spoilt the experience for us!,"My boyfriend and I decided to visit the National History Museum before we caught the train home. I had been in the Museum before and had an AMAZING experience - I loved the collection of animals and felt that I just had to go back to this facinating place! My boyfriend had seen it from the outside before but hadn't been inside.We arrived about 11.30am and booked tickets to see the exibition 'Human History' (can't remember it's exact title). Good news they have a cloakroom or else we would be hauling heavy suitcases round the Museum. Anyway we walked in and went straight to the exibition which was 'Out of this world'. The fact that there was real human remains to see and information about them just made the exibition even better. We absolutely loved this and couldn't wait to see more of the Museum. We next went to the Mammals which, again, was AMAZING. We both loved seeing the reproductions of the whales hanging from the ceiling - how they got up there I do not know. As it was approaching lunchtime we decided to go for something to eat, then have a look at the Dinosaurs and the Volcano/earthquake information before heading back to the station.Now this is where all hell hits loose, and things go rapidly downhill from here -We decided to have quite a decent meal as we were going to just buy some sandwiches to eat on the train. I had eaten in the main restaurant before and was very impressed with the place. All was going very well here. The service was reasonably okay - man who served us though appeared slightly grumpy, but not rude. We both decided to order burger and chips which we both thought was delicious. We had finished our meal and decided we had some time to kill before we went back in the Museum, so we chose to sit in the Restaurant and chat. We were enjoying our conversation and both felt very relaxed. I thought I saw something running under my feet but couldn't imagine it was anything other than a bit of paper wafting in the wind. A couple of minutes past and I saw a MOUSE RUNNING UNDER MY FEET, which I let off this massive scream - I apologise to the people who were sat in the restaurant on the 28th September lunchtime...I do have a phobia of rodents unfortunately. Clearly the restaurant staff heard me and they came running over and said ''Madam, we can move you to another table'' - I am sorry but this is a completely unacceptable response! They clearly think that solves the problem, which it does not. They didn't say sorry or offer to get rid of the mouse, just they would move us to another table. We were absolutely shocked and discusted at what we saw, and left.At this point, we both decided that enough was enough and we were going to leave the Museum completely. We were enjoying ourselves greatly and were forced to leave, and decided to go into the Victoria and Albert Museum instead. We weren't really interested in the stuff in there, so feel very angry that the incident happened. It totally spoilt our afternoon!!Clearly the restaurant have big issues on either pest control, hygiene or cleanless, or they are just down right lazy and cannot be bothered to fix the hole in the wall that's letting the mouse in."
"Written October 7, 2014",not impressed,I should have known that I would not enjoy this museum when I had to submit to my bags being searched before I was allowed to enter! This ridiculous policy caused queues standing in the rain and as I had my luggage at the end of a holiday I was incredibly embarrassed about some person going through my laundry. The cloakroom prices were extortionate and I had to drag my bags around with me. Needless to say my stay was short and I am in no hurry to go back.
"Written September 16, 2014",Appalling food in the restaurant,"We took our grown up kids for a birthday treat yesterday to the Natural History Museum. We thought we would have a treat and have lunch in this magnificent building. We should have realised something was afoot when we saw how completely empty the restaurant was at lunchtime. Maybe 2 other families and a wee mouse running around. I ordered a hotdog with chips for the birthday boy who was starving as he had not had breakfast, 2 veggie burgers and chips and a side salad of coleslaw and a caesar salad, plus 2 soft drinks this totaled over £40. We have never been a family to leave food - EVER - (and we were all very hungry) but this meal was so bland and stale tasting that we couldn't eat it. The caesar salad was a bit of little gem lettuce with tasteless dressing, croutons and a few ultra salty dark anchovies lurking in there. Nothing else .. for £8 .. no art to it remotely. We had had this salad in pubs in London lots before and it was fabulous and had extra nice bits like rocket, roasted pinenuts and shavings of Parmesan. The hotdog was bland and dry and with a few crispy bits of onion on top not butter and a huge amount of low-grade bread. The veggie burgers almost had no taste at all, I think they were made from tinned beans and were dry with a massive pappy bap enclosing it. It said it came with hummus but we opened it up and saw a tiny tiny trace of something beige that was probably suppose to be the hummus. We certainly couldn't taste it. How could food be so utterly tasteless I think you would have to work extra hard to do that. The coleslaw was not fresh and it was acrid and watery, I found it actually repulsive. None of the dressings tasted like mayonnaise. When the waiter asked how our food was nobody wanted me to complain but we were sitting there with most of it uneaten so I said it was the worst meal I had ever had out and it was such a disappointment to come up from Bristol and this was our food treat for the day out! We are not wealthy, we eat out maybe once every few years. I said to the waiter that the chef needs to be sacked as he clearly has no love of food and must have no taste buds ( ... or she?) They offered no apologies - in fact the waiter said that that was the ingredients for a Caesar salad. It might have been the basic, bog standard ingredients but food is also an art form and maybe the Natural History Museum's restaurant would be full if they approached food like they do in the V&A - where we thankfully took ourselves and had a lovely pot of tea and very good cakes!"
"Written August 26, 2014","A Monument to Trivialisation, a Mc-Museum","The natural history museum has amazing potential. It's history, size and location offer fantastic opertunities for wonder and learning. Unfortunately if you want to be be in awe of the natural world there is more to be seen on the way there. It is a watered down/borderline patronising exhibition of the natural world. It is geared towards children which is great but it offers them a Mc-Museum with pradicable nutritional value. For instance the ""creepy crawly"" room has low quality short videos on loop surrounded by large colourful plastic displays of food that ants like (a plastic display of ice-cream, cake and soft drinks), you can go inside a life sized model of a termite mound (with nothing informative inside it). It's a MC Donald s museum for kids. It could be so much better. It's great that they gear things towards kids but it could be full of interaction, nooks and crannies and informative displays. I feel like the museum is more concerned with entertaining children under the guise of education rather than stimulating their potential interest in the world. This reminds me of the kind of museums that make people dress up in period costumes."
"Written February 2, 2014",disappointing,"I loved the NHM as a boy and took my 2 sons this Saturday what a mistake, this museum shouldn't be free as too many people go which makes it a nightmare. After queuing for an hour to get in, you couldn't get to see anything as it was to crammed, you also couldn't see the dinosaur section as this would have taken another hour in a queuing. Please make people pay to reduce the congestion."
"Written May 13, 2012",No T-Rex skeleton,"Was hoping to see an actual T-Rex skeleton and not an animatronics T-Rex, although it was amusing.  The line for the dinosaurs looked long, but moved pretty quickly.  Beautiful building and LOTS of screaming kids."
"Written August 3, 2009",Very Nice Museum,"First of all, it's FREE!!! When we went in, our bags were searched quickly and we got in. We went wandering through with no real destination, and passed the ""Birds"" section. There are so many beautiful and interesting birds. Then we went to the mammals section which was HUGE!!! The museum had friendly staff and lots of info on each item. But here's a tip: Don't go in through the main entrance, go in on Exhibition Road; it'll save you at least an hour."
"Written July 20, 2004",Always keeps me coming back for more!,"I must have visited the NHM a hundred times -  it's just incredible! From the actual building itself ( look at the pillars to see birds and lizards carved into the stone ) to the multitude of fantastic exhibits, you could spend a week there and still not see everything! I recommed the Earth galleries - take the escalator through the centre of the earth! What's more it's free entry so great for those visiting London on a budget and fantastic for kids who will love the dinosaur exhibits! I'm returning to London again next month and have promised myself I am not going back to the museum as once I'm in there I just can't leave!"
"Written August 23, 2022",Overcrowded and uncomfortable,"We visited as a family of 4 and had pre-booked the entry time, I understand that this is the summer holiday and also it is free entry (with donation) however, it was  overcrowded to the point it was dangerous, it was exceptionally humid and uncomfortable, you could not look at any exhibits as you were being pushed or nudged forward to keep moving, to the point little children would have been knocked over."
"Written September 24, 2020",Great Building,"Really enjoyable and interesting day out. All very covid safe, book a morning ticket to enjoy the full experience. Some great collections and displays all housed in great building."
"Written September 13, 2019",Night at the museum,"I went to the NHM with my school and slept there. The food is good but the muffin at breakfast you get if you sleep there is horrible 😂😂. I really enjoyed it and my school did many activities such as:   making T-shirts and looking around in the dark and finding dinosaurs, you can go as a family and a couple."
"Written February 12, 2018",Movie Night at the museum - don't bother!,"My daughter and i thought ET in the Hintze Hall would be fun but it wasn't.Long queues to get in, long queues to get drinks or snacks so we didn't bother, and after we spent some time in the Dinosaur gallery ( the only other gallery available wasn't open when we arrived) we found another (yes you've guessed it) long queue to get into the Hall. It was so cold in here that we kept coats, scarves and gloves on all evening. The sound quality was terrible as the voices just echoed round the hall.I love the NHM but please, lets have a better organised evening, and i think a complimentary drink with a £28 ticket wouldn't be unreasonable. This is a total ripoff."
"Written August 7, 2017","Really terrible, what a disappointment ","I last visited the museum around 20 years ago as a teenager and thought it was fantastic, so I was really looking forward to returning and taking our young son with us. However it was so disappointing. First when we arrived we walked to the main entrance and got virtually all the way there before seeing a sign saying that the main entrance was closed and we needed to walk all the way back we'd came to a side entrance. We then found the queue to get in. It took about 20 minutes to get in so it wasn't too bad. When we got in we were ushered towards an information desk. We wanted to go to the whale exhibit so I asked about this and the girl on the desk sold me the tickets for this. The charge for the three of us (2 adults and 1 child) was £37.50, which seemed steep but I was optimistic it would be a good exhibit.We then walked into the museum and tried to find the whale exhibit. There was no sign posting for it anywhere!  We had no idea where to go. Eventually we headed for the mammal zone,assuming it would be there. We followed the signs, which pointed upstairs. So we took the escalator only to find that the next sign said the mammal zone was downstairs!  So we went back downstairs and ended up back where we started. We ended up just wandering around and only found the exhibit by chance!Then, despite already having tickets we had to queue behind people who didn't have tickets. However while we were queuing we saw the price list for the exhibit and saw that a family ticket was £32 - quite a bit less than we were charged! We asked about this when we got to the front of the queue and were told it was because we'd bought individual tickets and had paid a ""voluntary"" contribution on top. I pointed out that we'd not been told a family ticket would be better value and nothing had been said about a ""voluntary"" contribution. They were apologetic and said they could arrange a refund for the difference but they weren't authorised to do this and they'd have to call a manager.  So I waited for about 15 minutes for a manager to come only for one to then phone and say he couldn't come and I needed to go to him!Anyway we eventually got into the whale exhibit, we worked our way through what we assumed was the first of a number of rooms. It was mainly basic displays of information on the wall, with a few exhibits to look at and a couple of short videos. We then turned the corner and found ourselves in a shop selling whale memoralbelia. Obviously the shop is always at the exit, so both myself and my partner looked at each other and thought ""is that it?"". It had taken less than 10 minutes to see an exhibit that cost nearly £40 to go into. We even went back in case we had missed another room, but we hadn't.  It was so disappointing, it wasn't anything special, no different to the style of the free exhibits. We expected as a paid exhibit it would be much more extensive,  creative, interactive and high tech. We felt completely ripped off.Next, more signposting issues- our son needed the toilet, we followed the signs only to be sent round in circles again. It took nearly 15 minutes to find the toilets and we thought our son might have an accident. We then decided to go to the mammal room because it was something I remembered as a highlight when I last visited.  What I hadn't expected however was for it to have not changed one iota in the last two decades! It was so dated and all the exhibits were covered in a thick layer of dust. The dust was so bad that some people had written their names in it!In addition they simply let too many people in. We expected it to be busy, but it was ridiculous. You either could barely move or you were swept along in a tide of people. It was really unpleasant. So much so that even our six year old asked to leave after only an hour and a half there (most of it lost!).Then came the final challenge - finding the exit. Again we followed the signs and were sent round in circles.  It took 20 minutes to find the way out!I can't believe how bad the museum is now. I don't understand the positive reviews. There were large numbers of overseas tourists visiting and I was embarrassed that this is allegedly one of this country's foremost museums. They really need to seriously sort this place out."
"Written July 6, 2017",A must for budding young naturalists...,"Having loved this place since my first visit on a school trip a few (many) moons ago I thought it about time to take my youngest niece and two nephews (one of whom is naturally dinosaur mad) to go and meet old Dippy.   We queued for about 30 mins but thankfully it wasn’t too hot a day.  The happy memories came flooding back upon entering when I saw old dippy in the main hall (Hintze?) which were then shattered when I discovered she is to be removed (no doubt so they can hold corporate parties)!  Nonetheless the little ones were suitably impressed.  Many of the exhibits have not changed since I visited as a child.  Some of the interactive displays in the marine mammal area, for instance, are in dire need of updating or, in most cases, repair.  The animatronic dinosaur was a highlight of the trip for the children.   However, as an adult corralling the children, who naturally want to explore, is made difficult by the crowds of people.  Though it was only a moderately hot day outside, indoors the heat was stifling and very uncomfortable in some places with the use of portable fans merely helping the hot air to circulate. To this working man’s eyes the coffee shop and restaurant were overpriced (though, perhaps average for London?).   £4.20 for a slice of cake: that is more expensive than a Happy Meal (two in fact, and probably about as nutritious). Luckily I had packed several bottles of water to keep my monsters hydrated and plenty of raisins, fruit snacks and sweets to keep them energised. The main gift shop by the entrance is well stocked and sells a variety of educational and not so educational books, toys, mementos, cuddly toys, &c with prices to suit (almost) all pockets.  The trip was, however, a hit and we left happy, exhausted and burdened with three large carrier bags worth of goodies.  Great for kids who want to know more about the natural world (rather than being cajoled) and the fact that it is free should encourage more to visit (shame about how they put down old Dippy though)."
"Written July 5, 2017",Plan half day at least to spend here :),"One of top 5 interesting and educational museums in London. If you are with kids or not, make sure you don't miss this museum during your visit to London. Take map or use signs to make sure you did not miss any section. This was the first museum I have seen real dinosaur remains and skeletons. Supportive staff, all infrastructure is there to spend the whole day. I am sure you will grab some souvenirs at the end. And yes, it is free :)"
"Written February 27, 2017",Sad to see it get this bad.,"We have been to this museum many times over many years but this weekend was abysmal. I accept that there is a lot of building work going on and the staff did their best. However it was carnage in there. It was so busy that I thought we had joined an exodus or a fire evacuation. We were greeted by a man stood on a box shouting in broken english that we must give money. Then we were carried along with the crowd past one board after another of drivel which I would get half way through and get pushed on by the next hoard. People sat on the stairs, on the floor, it was like the blitz. A lot of the interactive displays were broken. The one good thing was the automated dinosaur. Get rid of all the silly displays that no one reads, less is more. The most interesting thing there was the building.The rest looked like the earth must have looked like after it was hit by the alleged meteorite! I would wait until this building work is finished."
"Written October 1, 2016",Completely Underwhelmed,"Today we decided to visit the NHM as I hadn't been since I was a kid in the eighties. The queue was a bit off-putting but since it seemed to be moving we joined and to be fair it didn't take long before we were in the main hall. That was the only pleasant surprise as what we discovered shattered my fond recollections. The exhibits have been stripped back, slim-lined and crushed against the walls to make way for the masses. Whilst there was a distinct lack of exhibits there was sadly no shortage of pointless display boards offering only a picture or half a dozen words of information. The dinosaur exhibits, although fascinating only offered a dark shadowy silhouette to get your imagination going rather than an artist’s impression and the least said about the taxidermy the better - save to say these poor animals died in vain. We had budgeted a half day to tour the museum but gave up in around 45 minutes as there really was nothing to see or read. I find it hard to be so negative about such an institution, but I honestly have to say we have seen and learnt more during a trip to our local reptile shop."
"Written August 14, 2016",Excellent day out,The natural history museum was amazing. It is huge and it had a lot of facts and info on different types of animals and plants. They also had special exhibits on different insects and butterflies when we were there. The cafe in museum served very decent food (to my surprise). Definitely worth a visit and remember to donate some money at the door!
"Written June 19, 2016",Dippy's Still There,"I hadn't visit the Natural History Museum for many years and media reports suggested that the model of the diplodocus in the entrance hall had already been removed and replaced by the blue whale skeleton. We were delighted to see that Dippy is still there, for the time being, however the blue whale skeleton isn't on display as it's being refurbed ready for its re-positioning.The whole museum is wonderful, loads of interesting exhibits from the most popular dinosaur section through to marine mammals, birds, human biology, insects, the solar system, volcanoes and earthquakes. There is also a fabulous display of precious gems and metals.Don't be put off if the queue to get in seems long, it moves very quickly."
"Written April 6, 2016",One of the top museums in london,"If you are planning to go wandering around museums, then you should visit the natural history museum and the V&A museum which is a 5 min walk. I guess visit both will take up half of your day."
"Written August 16, 2015",Natural History Theme Park,"I visited the museum to look at spiders.   My first clue that the museum has been drastically altered since my last visit,  quite a while ago,  was that when I asked a staff member where the arachnids were,  he looked at me as though I was speaking a foreign language.  ""Spiders"",  I explained.   The reply,  ""I expect they are in the Creepy Crawlie section"",  was not encouraging.   I didn't find a single spider in that section,  and asked another staff member what had happened to the collection.  He explained that the museum directors had visited Disneyland,  and taken their inspiration from that.The museum is now devoted to display boards,  models and video presentations aimed at (probably) six-year old children.  It was suggested that I visit the Cocoon,  and there,  as well as frequently repeated information boards about the museum having a vast, world famous collection of specimens of everything man has found living,  or once living,  on the planet,  I did manage to find,  in total,  I think,  four spiders.   They are without any identifying labels,  not even a name,  and no details of where or how they live.Given the time and cost of travelling to London,  the free admission is way too high,  and what was a wonderful museum full of fascinating things is now a cheap theme park,  as the curators intended. I have given the museum a one on the 1-5 spot rating,  because there is no minus 5 available."
"Written June 17, 2015",Good way to spend an afternoon,"The Natural History Museum is in a beautiful building, and there is a good variety of exhibits. It can get fairly crowded on the lower level, but there are plenty of great things to see upstairs where it is not so busy. Another great thing about this place is that it is FREE!! So you can split your time between this museum and the Science and Tech museum next door, which is also FREE!"
"Written April 11, 2015",Make sure you pre-book the tickets for the dinosaurs gallery online,"We were attracted to visit this museum because of the dinosaurs exhibition; and not surprisingly, there was long queue to get into the dinosaur gallery. Luckily we pre-booked the tickets online via the museum's website and just turned up at the time beating the queue. That was the best decision I made, considering the queue is at least an hour long.we only had time to visit Blue zone (dinosaurs, sea life, other animals etc) and it was well worth the time spent.  It is free to enter - as in most museums in the UK."
"Written January 26, 2015",Queues,"|We visited on Saturday and had to queue, although some visitors just by-passed the bored looking control staff and walked right in. This museum is geared for school groups and children or families with very  young children, definitely not for adults interested in natural history. We had to queue for what seemed everything, including the dinosaur section. Queueing 40 minutes so that we could pass the mechanical T Rex which I had not the slightest interest in - and look at a few artefacts is not worth your time! If we weren't standing in queues we were being knocked around by running children, hit by pushchairs or shunted by impatient people wanting get past! The architecture is amazing but it is let down by a poorly designed infrastructure. It would be far better if there it was opened up, like most museums are and one could walk around in relative peace and enjoy the exhibits, a bit like the British Museum..."
"Written January 24, 2015",Dinosnores for Grown Ups,"A Night at the Museum! If you ever get the opportunity then go; it is a night to never forget. With Naughty Science Talks, Dino-Dinner Quiz, drinks and bug tasting, live stand-up comedy (Helen Arney singing The Elements Song) and this all ends with the coolest sleepover ever taking place beneath the fossilized skeleton of the Diplodocus that graces Hintze Hall of the Museum. Drifting off to sleep with a harpist playing music including the theme tune to Jurassic Park and waking up to the sun coming through the panels of the stained glass windows.A mention has to go to the staff - Sally and her team including security were the best ever, from the moment we first walked in they made it extra special."
"Written December 5, 2014",Love this place,Lot's do and lot's to see and the price is totally free!! Beat that in London! ! A must see is the Dinosaur exhibition it is truly amazing you could easily spend a whole day on just this! 
"Written October 31, 2014",Ok,Visited the museum during October half term...never again it was far to busy I would recommend for you to pre book your dinosaur tickets  online before you attend saves you over 1 hour of queuing time you just go to the front of the queue if you are interested in museum it's a good day and plenty to see..
"Written October 30, 2014",Chaotic ,Half term I know but 30 mins to get in and then over a hour to get in the dinosaur section. People sitting down wherever they could and inability to get round the exhibits caused us to quit within 15 mins. Also £2 for a standard can of coke is offensive. Badly needs some better organisation when busy and financial reality on the food front 
"Written September 30, 2014",Dusty and old,Huge queues which was expected but when we got inside were very disappointed.Free entry unless you wanted to see the new feature of a mammoth was a joke.The mammals were very dusty and old looking.Only enjoyable part was the dinosaurs
"Written September 16, 2014",No Dinosaurs :(,Specifically went to London to show our son the dinosaurs and was horrified to find out that they were closed.Would not have gone to London had we known. Having said that it is free and still an amazing museum to visit. Very clean and lots of exhibits to keep everyone entertained.Just hope the dinosaurs come back soon!
"Written August 20, 2014",Looks tired.  London can do better than this,"I was really underwhelmed by our visit to the Nat His museum. We went on a Saturday in August so hesitate was mega busy.  The crowds just weren't managed well and the whole place was hot and airless.  We'd pre booked tickets for the Dinosaurs but still we're corralled along the walk way to see a stagnant model of a T-Rex. The thing that disappointed me most was that apart from the Red zone (earthquakes and volcanoes) the exhibits were tired and lots of the interactive stuff (especially in the creepy crawlies section) was broken.  It just needs updating and better infrastructure management.  Toilets were also poor and not clean.Having been to the Smithsonian museum of Nat History in Washington DC, London was a very poor relation."
"Written August 23, 2019",Fun for kids of all ages,"We visited this museum with our kids 7 to 14 and were absolutely delighted by the experience.  The museum has so much to see and absorb.  All of the kids enjoyed the dinosaur exhibit, the whales as well as the moon exhibit.  There is really something for everybody.  They have some amazing preserved biological specimens as well.  It is best to go early as it can get fairly busy by the afternoon.  If you are going with kids just let them lead you to what draws their attention.  It is amazing how much they learn and retain.  We got a nice meal at the cafe which was good and not expensive.  It is a great day trip with family"
"Written August 4, 2019",Not an enjoyable experience.,My recommendation is that the natural history museum institute a timed visit schedule during the summer months. The exhibits may be amazing but we never found out. The sheer amount of people in the museum was extremely uncomfortable and possibly unsafe. There were people having picnics in corridors making it almost impossible to walk down them.I'd you really want to sweat more than you have ever sweated before and get really familiar with the back of other people's heads then this is the perfect attraction to visit. If you want to see the dinosaur exhibits or anything else for that matter then you're out of luck.
"Written July 22, 2019",ROAR-SOME!!!,"The museum is amazing for kids 6+, and has everything from dinosaurs to planes, volcanoes and birds!"
"Written June 1, 2019",Faboulos ,"Very interesting and diversified, you need at least one day, kids are impressed! The only cons was the temperature inside, hot"
"Written May 27, 2019",Awesome Museum!,"The Natural History Museum in London it was amazing. This free museum has so many exhibits that reflect the history of the world. When you first walk in you see the skeleton of a gigantic blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The exhibit that I liked the most was the museum of the moon. In that room they have a replica of the moon hanging from the ceiling that looks so real.  It’s so cool! Other exhibits that I enjoyed were the history of dinosaurs and the vault, which is a room full of the world’s most precious crystals, gem stones, metals & meteorites. This museum is also great for kids. They have a ton of interactive activities that the kids of all ages will enjoy."
"Written May 2, 2019",Free and fun for the kids. ,The content of the museum is something you’ll find in most major cities. The grounds and the building are awesome and it’s free to visit. It’s certainly worth seeing and the surrounding neighborhood is awesome. My wife got some awesome pictures of the kids.
"Written April 27, 2019",Where did the dinosaurs go?!?,"Let’s not beat about the bush, this place has gone downhill over the last couple of years. The focus is less on exhibits and more on cramming as many people in as possible. There must be at least 5 different gift shops all selling highly over priced tat and there are now numerous cafes which, funnily enough, all sell over priced food. My first concern is that the museum was absolutely full to bursting and yet you’re free to just wander in without any bags or rucksacks being checked. Security does not seem to be a priority for the museum it would seem. Now, as everyone knows, dinosaurs are the be all and end all for most 5year olds and ours is no exception so we were most disappointed to find that the once brilliant dinosaur exhibition now falls seriously short. Previously we’ve been and enjoyed walking above the dinosaurs on the elevated walkway and seeing the dinosaur skeletons but the walkway has been permanently closed and instead everyone is rammed into a one way system where you can’t see anything and get pushed along to the end. If anyone from NHM is reading this then perhaps consider timed entry and perhaps get back some actual dinosaurs instead of the digital screens. On whole, the museum was far too packed for any children to actually enjoy themselves which is quite sad as surely museums, especially ones like this, are primarily for children and young people. The Darwin Centre was also shut during our visit and so we found ourselves going over the road to the V&A which was a much nicer experience. So save yourselves the train fare and give NHM a Miss unless you’re into queues, in which case, you might want to see someone about that! ;)"
"Written February 13, 2019",3000 misbehaving schoolchildren and an unclean exhibit,"If you want to view models of animals covered in an inch of dust, this place is for you.If you want to be surrounded by 3000 screaming school children, this place is for you.If you want to not be able to hear yourself think, this place is for you.On the plus side, with free entry, you will only be wasting your time, not your money.A very dissapointing experience."
"Written January 24, 2019",Perfect for kids (and for all)!,"Third visit. This time, I took my two kids to London Natural History Museum and they simply loved it! There are some renovations needed (ex. blue whale room), but it’s one of the best nhm museums in the world. I will take them there again in a few years."
"Written January 18, 2019",Pretty Cool!! ,It was extremely crowded the day I went! Excellent museum though and the dinosaurs are really well done!! Places to eat and what a fun day I had taking it all in! I’ll definitely go back next trip!! 
"Written December 4, 2018",Something for everyone 👍🏼,"We decided to visit the Museum on a Saturday. It was busy but easy enough to get round. There is a cafe on nearly every single floor. The food looked good too.We spent nearly  4 hrs looking at some amazing things. There are plenty of seats around. The staff are all friendly.This worth a visit even if you are not a museum person, so interesting. ALSO ITS FREE. We put some money in the donation box."
"Written December 3, 2018",Superb,For people of all ages. The children will stay for ever at the dinosaurs. The ice skate at the entrance is also a nice alternative.
"Written November 7, 2018",A busy but enjoyable museum,"This is a busy museum. If it’s not full of families, it’s full of school children. They are all having a good time and it’s what one expects from one of the top museums in London and the World. As long as you know that before visiting you can prepare. You might have to wait to see displays and certain areas (like Volcanos And Earthquakes or Dinosaurs) may be closed temporarily due to overcrowding, but there is plenty to see. One of the less visited areas is the Orange Zone. Here you have The Cocoon and the Spirit Collection. Both are interesting spaces and are completely different from the rest of the museum. This is a wonderful museum and is somewhere I would definitely one needs to visit. It’s full of interesting displayes and the staff are friendly and helpful. Some displays are old, but as the Visitor Assistants explained (and as some very small signs also mentioned) the displays are rarely changed. This is because any new specimens are more usueful scientifically so are used in research to better understand that particular species and the evolution it and it’s ancestors have undertaken. Be prepared for long lines outside. Be prepared for lots of people. I’d recommend to get there as early to opening as you can’t there may be a bit of a line outside, but it will be a lot quieter inside (as you can see from the photos).BE PREPARED TO HAVE FUN!!!!"
"Written October 5, 2018",Out of this World,What an experience. The Natural History Museum is free entry and well worth a visit if you are in London. I was dragged here by my husband who has a keen interest in science and even I enjoyed my time here. We were there on a busy morning and were still able to move around freely. The dinosaur and rock exhibit is a must see. 
"Written September 27, 2018",Meh.,Millions of exhibits packed off in some warehouse to make room for interactive displays for children and plastic dinosaurs. Dumbed down natural history. The only room worth visiting is the one with minerals and gems. That's it.
"Written September 13, 2018",Disappointed in the museum,"We are from NYC area and maybe we are spoiled but we were extremely disappointed. My 13 yea old just wanted to see the Dinosaurs and he walked thru saying, that's wrong, they didn't live together, etc etc. On a positive note the architecture of the building is gorgeous and it is free. Little kids may like it but it's crowded and not interested as other museums, go to the science museum it was better."
"Written September 12, 2018",Very good source of information for science students.,"My teens they really enjoyed our visit here. A lot to do and learn. If you have time, you can spend a full day here. It is a must to mention, the architecture of this building is impressive, both from the out side and the inside. Wow!"
"Written July 15, 2018",World-class museum,"One of our favorite stops when in London.  Amazing breadth of collections, the mineral collection is amazing."
"Written July 15, 2018",Brilliant place but busy,This is accessible from the tube station by subway which is very handy. The building is stunning inside and outside.  The attraction is free with a suggested donation of £5 but it's worth more and there are donation points in the main hall.The dinosaur exhibition was excellent if a little packed.  The mammal section is good and the views from the upper gallery are good. There is huge section on minerals and ores which didn't interest me but the cabinets in the room were beautiful. I'm sure if you were interested in minerals this would be a fantastic place.We arrived around 12 pm and only had a very short queue.There are a few seats and a coffee shop which was perfect for us as one member of our group was tired.
"Written July 15, 2018","Nice museum, very busy on the weekends!","Beautiful museum, but it does get very busy on the weekend with huge line ups. The line does move relatively quickly. There were a lot of people visiting on the Sunday I was there, would recommend a weekday to avoid the huge crowds."
"Written July 28, 2014",Second best Natural History Museum in the World,As said in the title... One of the best attractions in London and probably the second best in the world after the one in New York. It is probably the best way to spend a rainy day in London. Strongly suggested if you have children even if they don't speak the language. Been there 4-5 times and probably I will go again on my next visit to London. Extremely recommended for families on rainy days.
"Written July 23, 2014",Amazing educational day out,"Our 14 year old daughter was in awe the minute she walked through the doors . The building alone is so imposing and impressive if it was just the empty rooms it would be a sight to see . This was mine and partners second visit together but this time our daughter came too . It really is a magnificent museum to visit . However the "" improvements"" that had been made detract away from the original displays from the early days . We felt as though we were being directed into shops and cafes when all we wanted to see were exhibits . We understand that an income is needed for the upkeep but to us an entrance fee would be better to see more exhibits than people eating and leaving rubbish on tables and floors . All the hands on exhibits to us take up far too much time and therefore you don't get to see everything . We had a very enjoyable day and would definitely visit again ."
"Written June 17, 2014",Outdated and questionable displays,"My last visit to this museum dates 13 years back. I was impressed and told myself that I must return some day... me not being a museum person at all.So today my first impression was that things have changed for the worst. I cut my visit short as I got bored after checking out three of the four zones. Starting with the Blue Zone, I first went to the dinosaurs which is the coolest part of the museum. I counted four animated dinosaurs including the T-Rex which were all a bit lame. The T-Rex seems to be the major attraction here as people pose for pictures, so be prepared to be shoved around. If you are interested in the history of palaeontology, there are plenty of displays to inform you about when the first fossils were discovered, how they are named etc. The Mammals section shows some stuffed animals from the museum's historical collection which by now have faded and worn out. I also checked out the blue whale but couldn't figure what the fuss is about. If you have ever seen a whale in nature, you'll be disappointed how unreal this model looks like.Off to the Green Zone where I only visited the Creepy Crawlies. Nothing worth mentioning, only lots of information on display and a gigantic scorpion model. What a disappointment.You reach the Orange Zone via the lift which takes you to the 7th floor of the cocoon shaped building. Again lots information to read if you're into it, interactive displays and videos running in the background which I found disturbing. I was expecting a huge collection of insects but only few on display of which of them in such bad light that you couldn't make them out properly.In one of these zones I spotted a tank with a crab pierced on a stick (it looked real and dead, of course). Visitors are encouraged to pull it out of the water to see if it weighs more in or out of the water. What a disturbing display, if it was indeed a dead crab.There is an overall children-friendly theme in the museum and I dare to say it's mostly aimed at them. Kids brochures about the museum can be purchased for £5 at the entrance. There are lots of benches in case your feet feel tired and you need to have a little rest. I found the architecture of the building is much more intriguing than the exhibitions. Be prepared to have your bags checked."
"Written June 2, 2014",Great place shame about the over inflated prices of food,"I cannot fault what is on offer to see here, by the end of a full day I was on information overload but enjoyed every minute of it.I was disappointed though by the over inflated prices of food, yes I know entry is free and it is London but to pay £2 for a can of diet coke and £5 for what is two pieces of bread with tuna and cucumber in-between is daylight robbery - for 2 of us it was £14 !!!For me it just spoilt what was a great visit and yes I did leave a donation.Well worth a visit but take some of your own food, snacks etc "
"Written April 14, 2013",too crowded to see the exhibits properly!,30 minute queue to get in - 30 minute queue for dinosaur exhibit - so many people it made the emperor penguin arctic huddle look appealing! you couldnt see the exhibits properly and it was so hot! many of the exhibits were disappointing (eg creepy crawlies) as they seemed to focus purely on children's  hands on activities at the expense of interesting and revealing facts or artefacts! even the shops were disappointing with mundane gifts and toys! very disappointing!
"Written August 28, 2012",Very Boring,"When we last went to The Natural History Museum, I thought that it was absolutely boring, and i mean, a museum should be fun and nice to be around.We will not be back again!!!!!"
"Written August 26, 2012",Sadly showing its age,"Like many UK citizens I have fond memories of visiting this museum as part of a school trip.  I am sad to say that a once great institution has lost its way in the 21st century as both me and my wife were badly dissapointed by our visit this week.The problem can be summed up in one word - overcrowding.The problem is that the museum has always had sections that are more popular than others but this never stopped you enjoyng them at least not until this visit.  Problem 1 - the entry queue, has no other purpose than to slow down entry and restrict the number of people entering the museum at any one time.  A 45 minute queue to get in with no cover is not pleasent.Problem 2 - the queue for the dinosaur fossils.  This begins in the main entry hall and snakes around under the brontosaurus fossil that any previous visitor will know well until you get into the dino area.  After this you are on a forced track around the section akin to a queue for a US theme park ride culminating in a large animatronic T-rex model before you can get out of this horrendous section.Problem 3 - at the end of each of the museum sections, you find yourself thrust into highly commercial shopping or eating areas.  Again think theme park here and you wont go too far wrong.  Now I personally quite like shops and can resist the temptations but I pity the poor parents who get trapped into having to buy their kids the latest dino model.  In short the museum has become horrilbly commercialized.  Of course some people may enjoy hearing the dipplodocus fossil ""roar"" for the pricely sum of £10 but sadly for me it just trivialises what a museum is about.Problem 4 - families with young kids.  Museums for me are about learning, but swarms of sub 5 year olds are going to learn next to nothng from the exibits here, this is definately a museum for older children not the little ones.There are some plus points of course as well - for example the architecture of the buiding itself is fantastic and actually better than most of the exibits but really the museum needs a complete rethink in my view, spreading out the popular sections throughout the museum to reduce overcrowding would be a good idea.  A ticketed approach to reduce overcrowding.  Even an entrance fee to reduce over-commercializing the exibits.In short the place is more like a theme park than a place of learning and sadly I'd rather take my kids to Disney as its far better done!"
"Written November 15, 2010",Most over rated museum in UK - Avoid,"I had high hopes for this place. I thought the English were famous for their museums, and on the whole I saw some amazing things whilst touring the UK. However this has to be the worst Museum I have ever been to. Ok. To be balanced, here are the positives - - Free Entry- Perfect Location- Beautiful architecture- Some nice bones and speciminsThats about it though. I felt like I was back at High School. I have never been anywhere with such a high density of Children - not even Disney land. They should totally control the numbers they allow into this place on a day. it ruined the whole experience for me. Everywhere you turned there were groups of teenagers running around, screaming, shouting, TOUCHING the exhibits without any respect for the age of the things they were looking at. There were no security staff in sight, those that we did eventually spot looked as young as the school children, with their very informal T-Shirts & Fleeces. We only realised they were staff when we saw their 2-way radios sticking out from their faded black denim and exposed underwear.Perhaps due to the high volume of school children, the exhibitis have a sense of being ""dumbed down""  for this age range. Although impressive, the anamatronic dinosaurs seemed rather immature. Again, perhaps of the high volume of school children, many of the exhibits were broken, out of order or looking very tired and worn. The cafe was prices were absolutely shocking - even for London, and it took about 30 minutes of queuing to be served by a grumpy man who hardly spoke any English. If you're travelling with a very young family you may enjoy this. I however have been to far better examples of natural history museums. This was more like a zoo, with the animals being living school children monkeys."
"Written July 11, 2008",The Most Amazing Museum Ever!,"Ok, so where do I start. I believe that the best place to start is with the incredible point of the museum being completely free. Of course, donations are needed to keep the museum running, so just dropping in some spare change will be great for the museum. Considering everything else in London is overly expensive this is impressive before you even step foot into the building!The building itself is most impressive. It is a huge, old building, which is fascinating to take pictures by. The first thing you see as you enter is a huge dinosaur skeleton, which is again impressive to take photographs by. There are different zones which give you a feel on what is in each one, therefore you can decide which zone you would like to venture into if you don't have much time. This is what happened to me and I chose the green  and blue zones which is filled with animals, insects, birds, dinosaurs, human biology etc. The animal collection is AMAZING! They basically have almost every species of animal and bird. I also took many photos by these. They look almost realistic on camera! There is this one huge room filled with the biggest animals on earth, there are elephants, giraffes, hippo,s rhinos and a big blue whale the size of the whole room!!!!There is also a red zone, which is mostly to do with natural forces and the earth itself. The last zone is the orange zone which is the Darwin Centre and the Wildlife Garden. There is also a new buttefly house, but you have to pay extra for this. There are also many cafes and restaurants inside, I went to one of them and they had lovely cakes for a wuick snack after a long time of walking around. I would definitely recommend this for families and a fabulous day out!"
"Written August 14, 2022",Overcrowded and boring,"Do you love hot, sweaty, overcrowded rooms full of screaming children? Then the natural history museum is the place for you! With exhibitions that provide almost no interesting information, you’re guaranteed to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience… because you’ll never want to experience this again."
"Written March 6, 2020",Excellent experience!,Starting with a beautiful building passing by the skeletons and all the exhibitions is undoubtedly exceptional.Excellent to spend a morning or an afternoon with the children and have an enriching cultural experience.Highly recommended.

"Written August 31, 2020",Love this museum and the dinosaurs,"This museum is fantastic, from the awesome dinosaur exhibition, the somewhat old and a bit tatty mammals which are older than my grandparents but still retain their charm and all of the wonderful exhibits."

"Written March 23, 2020",Big and informative collection,"I would recommend to show this place to your kids - informative, interesting, and rich collection about geology, dinosaurs, humans, and much more. Of course, adults will like this place too, I promise."
"Written March 20, 2020",A true gem,Exactly as you’d expect – truly amazing but horrendously busy; to the point where it was difficult to move around without simply being carried along in a constant surge of people.

"Written December 18, 2019",Amazing museum - fascinating,This is the first time I've been back to his museum for more years than I care to remember.  It is amazing.  The building is a wonder in itself - beautiful brick and glass work.  The exhibits are up to date and fascinating.  The place as packed with so many young people and families which was a joy to see.  We all enjoyed our visit and will visit again as didn't get to see all the exhibits.  The ice rink outside looked great fun and so pretty when the natural light started to fade and all the tree lights were twinkling.  I would recommend this museum for all ages.  Plenty of seats too if you need to rest your legs.  The cafes are busy and the two shops tempting.
"Written December 16, 2019",My kids love it!,"We know that while we’re in London, we had to bring the kids to the NH museum. The moment we arrived, they were awed by the magnificent building and entrance. My boys were self-directed and led in exploring the museum; us (the parents) just tagged along. It was amazing to see the sparkle in their eyes. The admission is free but we did have to dodge a few group visits (mainly students) at the entrance."
"Written December 16, 2019",Excellent!!!,I got in the museum at the opening time and I got out 5' before closing time! I spent most of my time at the dinosaurs department! It was fantastic!!! If you visit London you have to go at THIS museum!!!
"Written December 11, 2019",Amazing Museum!,"My wife and I had the chance to visit the Natural History Museum yesterday and we found it absolutely amazing. We only had a couple of hours to spend there so, my recommendation - give yourself some time to see all that there is!"
"Written December 10, 2019",Walk as Darwin did....,"This is a fantastic museum to explore both solo and with family.  Exhibits neatly arranged into easily digestible sections.  I wanted to see the wildlife photo exhibit, but didn't realize that I needed additional access / different admission (my fault) and unfortunately, on the one day I was there, it was fully booked.  Otherwise, friendly, helpful staff, and well worth the visit!"
"Written December 9, 2019",Need several hours to get through it all,We loved our visit at the Natural History Museum. The range of exhibitions was amazing and we could not get through it all with the short time that we had. Kids seemed to enjoy themeslves as well (if the slight queue at the Dinosaurus exhibition of families was anything to go by).
"Written December 8, 2019",Full of fun,"An elderly but noble museum of the old style. Has a huge range of displays of animals, plants and minerals from the natural world. Many of the exhibits have their own individual histories.  the museum is often crowded at weekends with families taking their children on an excursion.Some things are quite expensive but there are lots of things which are worth buying. It's a good place to buy original gifts or things for yourself. You really need to go!"
"Written December 7, 2019",Cavernous Cornucopia of History,"I was completely taken aback by the enormity, extensive variety and rich history offered by the Natural History Museum.From the moment the massive whale skeleton seemed to swoop down from above to the astounding spread of rocks and stones in the Geology Hall to the various exhibits, the NHM deserves a few days of visits to truly appreciate all that it has to offer."
"Written December 6, 2019",An excellent museum,An excellent museum with an overview of British history and contemporary life. Good display and great museum building. I would definitely recommend a visit.
"Written December 5, 2019",A Monument that Bolsters Darwinian Theories,"Through all our many years of regularly visiting London, we never really had a chance nor ‘motive’ to visit this museum, a monumental rather forbidding ‘campus’ in the Kensington area.  But on a recent rainy autumnal day we thought it the best time to do so and we pinched ourselves for having ‘neglected’ to visit it before.For here are displayed the marvels of our planet and how it came to be, and with Darwin’s bust and the suspended skeleton of a blue whale on the ceiling as our introduction to the museum’s collections, we were alternately subjugated by and awed at the impressive specimens in the various galleries:  from the minerals to the planets to the evolution of man, this museum has something for everyone to study and appreciate.  The museum supposedly has a piece of Mars rock (!) which regrettably we did not get to see.  It’ll have to be for another time and for a much longer time than just one rainy afternoon."
"Written December 5, 2019",one of the best museums ever visited,"I am not into museums really,  but this one is just fantastic! It's surprising that it is free of charge and the line is not that crazy really. The museum is exciting no matter how old you are. It's definitely worth a visit if you are in London!"
"Written December 3, 2019",A spectacular building and a stunning collection,"They have a huge assortment of items in their collection, plus temporary exhibitions (we saw the museum of the moon, which was gorgeous). Don’t miss the blue whale, the dinosaurs, or the treasure room. Also, the building itself is remarkable. It makes me think of Hogwarts, and it’s full of details like tiles that depict plants and animals. Great for kids as well as adults."
"Written November 25, 2019",A wonderful way to learn,Wonderful interesting notations amongst exhibits. Different rooms from dinosaurs to mammals to geological exhibits. It is freeWheelchair assessable 
"Written November 23, 2019",Massively overcrowded,I feel very sorry to write a review like this. I have been here many times and was very excited to bring my daughter for the first time. We came down from Scotland especially. It was an horrendous experience. You could barely move for the crowds and she was so overwhelmed by the noise and chaos we had to leave. Whoever is responsible for control of numbers urgently needs to review this situation. I would rather pay and actually be able to see something . The current situation is untenable.
"Written April 12, 2022",Childhood memories destroyed,"I used to visit this lovely building and Victorian displays, as a child, in the 1950's.I went back last weekend and was appalled. Difficult to get in and needed e-ticket.Once inside my childhood memories were destroyed. They have vandalized a lovely piece of architecture and it is now full of shops, cafes and modern displays. No doubt this is ""progress"" but I will never go back there."
"Written April 4, 2022",Great for kids,"Lots of kid's favorites,lots of interactive exhibits. The building it's in is gorgeous, especially that main hall. Fun part of town too."

"Written September 13, 2020",Hm not enough seats,Thanks to covid-19  not enough  seats to sit and stare at the dinosaur also food is not cheap for families 
"Written September 7, 2020",Always a good idea,"Great fun with the Kids, we have a 3 year old and 8 month old.Love seeing the dinosaurs, and you can’t knock the fact it’s free!"
"Written November 23, 2019",Love that it’s Free!,Love strolling through here checking out the history when I have some time to kill on the weekend. Kids will love the dinosaur and animal exhibits. 
"Written November 23, 2019",Great museum - lots to explore,"The dinosaur exhibit itself is worth the trip - great animatronic Dinos to watch, and a very well set up path to learn about all dinosaurs with plenty of fossils and information.  Spent 3 hours there and only got through about half the first floor.  The current Moon exhibit is fascinating - a highly detailed sphere allowing you to see all sorts of details.  "
"Written November 11, 2019",always splendid,the Natural History Museum is always a highlight to visit when in London. It is a great and unique place. So much to discover and my favorite is annually the Wildlife Photographer Exhibition. Just excellent!
"Written November 6, 2019",One of the greatest museums in the world,"In my opinion, the Natural History Museum is in a unique handful of exalted museums around the world. The lines can get very long so plan to be there at least 45 minuets before it opens at 10.00am, sooner is better so you can to try and avoid large tour groups, most of whom however try to complete the tour in about 2 hours, so they are never at one exhibit for too long. Closes underground is South Kensington, about 400 meters away. Once inside the museum you will experience truly amazing exhibits that will stimulate you to learn more about what you have seen; it's an amazing experience for children, plus like all public museums in London, it's free. If you are like me, someone who visits my granddaughters in London several times a year, we tend to spend quality time in only a few sections of the museum each visit.Cheers"
"Written November 6, 2019",Awesome,"One of the best museums I've ever visited! Excellent for kids, but I also learned a lot about our pre-historic days. Just the building inside it's worth a visit"
"Written August 31, 2019",Loads to see,Very much enjoyed our time here.  So much to see one could easily spend and entire day here.  Food is available in several cafes.
"Written February 2, 2020",Nice building with 2 other museum in vicinity,"The gemstone exhibits are really awesome. The skeleton of the blue whale, the dinosaur are well displayed as well. The kids would love it."
"Written January 31, 2020",My favourity museum,"I prefer history museums but this is the more beautiful and interesting museum in my opinion in all London. Only the building is one of the most beautiful construction that I saw in London. In addition, the arrangement of the samples is very interesting."
"Written January 28, 2020",Loved the Dinossaurs,"If you want to know how the planet earth was created, what kinds of nature and animals there were before human... and even the human evolution, this is the right place.All you learn at school, you can see here with your own eyes, Terrific."
"Written January 22, 2020",Wow,I love the fact  the in London almost all museums are free. But this one in particular  will blow your mind. Very interesting and fun to visit it. I loved it. 
"Written January 12, 2020",Awesome,"This museum rocks!Be prepared to be there for the most part of the day.The only downside is the amount of visitors,but everything else is amazing!"
"Written January 6, 2020",Wow!,This museum is really amazing. You have to stay one entire day here to see everything and it worth it 100%. The central room (the hall) it looks like Hogwarts.
"Written January 3, 2020",Great museum to visit and free,"This is a great museum to visit, all that you can see there shows you the diversity that exist/existed in earth.Is a great place to visit alone or with children. "
"Written December 28, 2019",At least my son was happy,"45 minute wait to get in with the most miserable man in a coat telling my son he wasnt in the queue and to go to the back and queue (really?!), more Spanish children than I care to count running around climbing on everything, queues for everything, people urinating on the walls next to the toilets as they couldn't get to the toilets or urinals and dads lifting children over the sink to go to the the loo because they couldn't get into a toilet as there wasnt enough.litter everywhere, more spanish families stopping to take family photos of every single child, group shots, photos with their parents and every other combo you can think of, blocking the already narrow path.Had my son pushed around more than a cats toy ball without apology by numerous other guests, watched a half dozen people take a map without paying (it even says £1 on the map, cant believe some people, just brazen theft/ dont understand english or dont care!).But still had a great day out with my son, 2/10 might return. Bumped up from a 1/10 due to being free."
"Written December 25, 2019",Excellent but not enough time,We put 2 hours aside to explore and we had no idea what was in store for us. What an amazing time with so much information and interaction. You need minimum 4 hours to get a taste of how much there is and not to rush and enjoy hall by hall.
"Written December 23, 2019",Good half day out ,"Lots to see and learn, plenty of places to rest and eat. Was there 15 years ago and compared to then, it's much nicer now. "
"Written August 14, 2019",OVER-RATED,"Huge queues too get in, taking far too long.  Far too busy and noisy, with families and children running around, yelling, blocking routes and photos, barging people out of the way, and generally being disruptive.  Many areas could not really cope with the numbers allowed in.  The museum uses too many information boards to try to tell stories, rather than actual exhibits.  It is over-hyped, and visiting is generally an extremely unpleasant and un-museum-like experience.  It's all too focussed on sensationalism and dinosaurs."
"Written August 14, 2019",Fabulous!,If you have any interest in either natural history or beautiful architecture then this is a must see. Fabulous building and amazing exhibits. Highly recommend!
"Written August 12, 2019",Science and Architecture,"Great to visit, just mind the literal seas of people. Many of exhibits are inclined a good bit more for children than adults so do keep that in mind. I would like to have an optional guided tour  just for the architecture though. The latter is worth going for alone. "
"Written August 12, 2019",It’s crowded in August,"This place is just amazing, and the saying ‘something for everyone’ has never been more true. We also visited in December 2017 and it was much quieter. In August the ques are long, and the noise and crowd inside can be a bit overwhelming. I would recommend getting there 15min before open, then you’ll have a chance to explore in relative piece. The moon room is very cool."
"Written August 11, 2019",Naturally Great Place to Visit in London ,"Another of the spectacular free museums in London. Within minutes of arriving we knew we'd only be able to scratch the surface in the time we'd allowed for the visit. We concentrated on fossils, minerals and gems. We could have spent the whole three hours we had in just the marine fossil exhibits. This is certainly high on the list of things to do again next time we're in London. Easy access via either bus or Underground South Kensington Station. Excellent accommodations for handicapped visitors. "
"Written August 30, 2019",Amazing exhibitions,"This museum exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history. There are many displayed collections on animals, fossils, human biology and other related themes. I enjoyed mostly the dinosaur, the mineral and the earth exhibits with great footages and interactive displays. The building is large and stunning with different architectural styles: Romanesque, Gothic and Victorian. You may need to come back couple times in order to really take in all the information. Highly recommended. The entry fee is free and it was packed with young families (it was school holiday!) when I were there!"
"Written August 28, 2019",Amazing,"As an adult it is still one of my favourite places in the world. The building is gorgeous within itself, the exhibits are frequently updated so the museum is never the same. Great for kids as there is lots of entertainment and great for adults willing to learn"
"Written August 27, 2019",Big Crowds,This is a great museum but it was hot and very crowded when we were there. It was a Saturday and school is out on holiday so surely that is why. Many amazing things to see and experience. Try to go early to avoid the crowds. 
"Written August 26, 2019",Timelessly beautiful,"The Natural History Museum is a must-visit for people who love browsing museums, and also have a keen interest in wildlife and biodiversity. Here, you will find specimens of animals that have gone extinct or are now critically endangered.While the dinosaurs exhibit and the moon exhibit tend to be crowded, you usually get to enjoy quieter aisles in the higher floors.You can also explore how the museum is involved in research work to help protect existing wildlife.Great place for both the young and the old."
"Written August 26, 2019",We Stayed Ages!,"So much to see and do here. We walked and walked and walked, and could have stayed longer! Loved the Dinosaur exhibition, including the animatronic T Rex! . The roof in the stunning Hinze Hall is hand painted with plants from all over the world and is quite spectacular. Definitely a great place to spend time in London and externally the building is so beautiful. "
"Written August 22, 2019",amazing museum for kids,"We visited this museum with three kids 10 and under. They really enjoyed the visit. There was too much to see and do, to see it all in one day. We will definitely return. The museum guides are great souvenirs and well worth the money."
"Written August 18, 2019",Best museum ever,Spectacular is the word for this.  So many interesting sites and exhibitions. We enjoyed it. From fossils to skeletons and earthquakes. From rocks to bones. 
"Written August 17, 2019",recommended,"I recommend visiting this museum, especially if you have children / teenagers, both for the architecture of the building and for the enormous amount of animals of every size, type and age. Everything is well exposed and explained, the rooms are spacious, the collection of diamonds on display is very beautiful, the tour in the sector where the formation of the earth is explained, the platform that simulates earthquakes is very exciting. All this and much more ... and it's also free."
"Written August 16, 2019",One of my favourite places in London! ,"Wonderful museum, so much to see! Massive fan of David Attenborough so after watching one of his docs this was first on my list for London! You do need quite a bit of time here so get up early! "
"Written August 11, 2019",Behind the Scenes Spirit Collection Tour,"This is a review of the Behind the Scenes Tour: Spirit Collection. This was one of the highlights of my three-week trip to Europe. You get to go into the basement vaults and see thousands of specimens in alcohol (that’s the “spirits” part) that the museum has collected for a couple hundred years. I won’t give away too much, but if you’re a fan of Charles Darwin then you won’t want to miss this. Our guide, Tom, works at the museum and was incredibly knowledgeable about both current research and the history of the collection. This really is a behind the scenes tour. You see specimens so big, so old, and so rare that they can’t be shown in the museum. You’re in the storerooms and labs that are usually only accessible by the scientists at the museum. If you love science and history, take this tour! "
"Written August 9, 2019",Wow!,"I kept wishing I had my kids or my grandkids with me but to be honest I enjoyed this like a kid so I didn't need them, but they all would have loved it!  There were fossils and dinosaurs and sea shells and rocks and a huge model of the moon!  There were fish and land animals and bugs and snakes!  There was literally something for everyone.  You could spend hours in here and we did, but still didn't see more than 1/2 of what they have to offer.  So worth a visit, especially if you do have your kids or grandkids with you.  One tip....don't limit yourself to looking around.  Look up too!  There is so much to see."
"Written August 9, 2019",Short visit to natural museum,Visited London Natural History museum with my wife in beginning of August. This is very nice place to visit shortly or longer time. Shortly just to see some selected parts like we did. But can also take long time especially with children. Museum is also very well explaining facts for natural life and is thus a very educating place. Especially for school groups. Free entrance makes this very popular place to visit.
"Written August 8, 2019",Fun!,"Fun for the entire family. Also, great place to learn wee bit about a lot of things that make this world what it is."
"Written August 7, 2019",Awesome museum,First museum we visited in London an it was such a great experience. The queue was long but passed quickly and the exhibits inside were amazing to see 
"Written November 4, 2019",Huge and amazing!,"Even the building is worth a visit! The architectural style is evocative of Hogwarts school. The museum is divided by different sections, from mammals to human being, birds and earth. The most amazing section, in my opinion, is the red one (earth) where you can experience an earthquake simulation "
"Written November 2, 2019",Amazing! A must see!,"Never mind all the amazing things to see inside this museum 💕 The building itself is incredible! Breathtakingly beautiful 🥰 I spent most of the day there, there’s so much to see! Loved it and would go again and again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 💕"
"Written October 29, 2019",Free Museum in Kensington,This is a free museum that is beautiful.  I recommend it for kids and and adults.  It was raining that day and nice to get inside.  They had lots of rooms to view.  
"Written October 28, 2019",Excellent museum,"It’s a huge museum where you can stay the whole day or come at least twice. There was a long queue at the front side so didn’t want to wait and walked away towards the science museum. There was another entrance with a shorter and faster queue so we entered in 5 min. There are many places to eat something but you can also eat your own food there. There is water to fill up your bottles. The museum is free but donations are welcome. The museum plan is 1 pound.The toilets were very busy. When we left the museum around 1 pm, there was still a long queue. At the moment there is an ice skating place in front of the museum. 9 pounds per person. It’s a great museum for all ages including adults. "
"Written October 27, 2019",This place is AMAZING!,"It's free! But make a nice donation.Gorgeous architecture coupled with amazing exhibits. If you live in London, you should be a member and come every week.We bought memberships just for this one trip so we could see the Wildlife Photography exhibit that was sold out. Lots of cool perks including a quiet lounge with views of the city and the outside architecture."
"Written October 27, 2019",Cool place,"We were standing in a kilometer long queue (took more than an hour) before we were let in, it was the week of school holiday. However, it was worth it!"
"Written October 26, 2019",Silent disco ,"Love how the museum puts on events like the silent disco. A great use of the space. Last night was the second one I've been to here and it was again, incredible. Great music and the building looked fab. Who wouldn't want to dance under the whale? Thank you for being brave with the space and doing things most museums would shy away from. "

"Written October 20, 2019",FREE!,"This museum is free to the public. Has a wide variety from Dinosaurs and Mammals, to Birds and creepy crawlers. Rocks, minerals and human evolution. Great way to spend the day. "
"Written October 19, 2019",Always worth a visit,There will almost always be lots of children milling about when you visit this museum. It can get frustrating at times but it's important to remember how lucky we are that a place like this exists with so much knowledge available for us to learn from. Exhibits are engaging and accessible to all
"Written October 17, 2019",Enjoyable visit,We enjoyed visiting the museum. We arrived soon after it opened and by noon when we met again in the main hall it was very busy with school groups (lovely to see those little ones so interested!) and harder to get photos of exhibits.Very well laid out and an enjoyable wander around. Quite a few interactive exhibits.
"Written October 16, 2019",Worth it for the architecture alone,"The best of many natural history museums I've been too. The gem and dinosaur areas went above and beyond the normal taxidermy animal you come to expect. But even if you're not as interested in the exhibits, the structure itself, inside and out, cannot be missed. "
"Written October 15, 2019",Natural history on a grand scale,This wonderful museum is vast in area and from the moment you enter you will be enthralled.  We are so small in comparison with the skeletons and models of animals on display.  What child could not help be engaged by dinosaurs or the blue whale.  I really loved the moon model.  It was hard to see it all yet so many displays drew me in to explore.  Don’t forget the outdoor area as well - wildness in the heart of London.
"Written October 14, 2019",Mouth agape,I was in awe from the moment I walked in and saw the whale skeleton high above. One could easily explore the Museum every day for a week and perhaps not view all the sections. My advice is to go early and visit often.
"Written October 13, 2019",Amazing collection of dinosaur bones and other natural history stuff!,"The museum boasts an amazing collection of natural history. I suggest go straight to the dinosaur collection if you're short on time and then do the other collections (mammals, birds, reptiles, sea etc.). The hummingbird wall was pretty awesome too."
"Written October 13, 2019",Great animal section ,Went with my daughter and thoroughly enjoying walking around and seeing everything especially the dinosaurs and the mammals. The building itself is beautiful as well.
"Written October 13, 2019",Fantastic,Excelent museum. Lots of people. Very educational. Convinient for kids  to learn everthiny about earth from  begining.
"Written October 12, 2019",Iconic London Museum . . . but so busy!,"We visited the Natural History Museum with our kids in April 2019 - having not been there before I was amazed by the sheer size of the facility. AT the time there was a very impressive temporary exhibit on Gemstones as well as the usual attractions like the dinosaurs. I was very impressed with the Cocoon - the new home to the National Insect Collections and the interactive displays explaining how specimens are collected and preserved for research.The only downside of our trip . . . it was packed with people, it was so full it was difficult to move! This may have been because it was school holidays (close to Easter) but it was uncomfortably full. We would have stayed longer if it wasn't for this, so i suggest choosing your timing carefully when you visit."
"Written October 11, 2019",Put Aside a Whole Day,This place is HUGE.  Do not think that you can do it justice in a few hours.  My first visit lasted 4 hours and I still didn't see everything.  It is great for children and adults alike.  A must see on any trip to London.
"Written September 14, 2019",Fabulous collection inside an architectural masterpiece,It is worth the visit just for its fabulous Neolithic architecture alone. But the diNosaur section is a big attraction for persons of all ages. For geologists the gems and stones section is a real treat. It is also free for all
"Written September 8, 2019",Rubbish,So went with a friend for the first time in maybe 10 years. Its barely changed.  Most of the exhibits look dated.  Most of the interactive displays are broken or just make some lights flash.  Got bored and left after a while.  Not impressed at all.  If I'd had to pay I'd have asked for a refund.
"Written September 7, 2019",Great experiences ,Amazing architecture and the good thing is no entry fee. Lots to see and learn I was really amazed and really had a great time here. 
"Written September 7, 2019",Super,"Lovely time spent here went with my family and grandson who is 4. It was wonderful to see his eyes widen whilst taking in all the exhibits. It was busy, but worth taking time to look around, we did stop and relax under the moon. An enjoyable time."
"Written September 7, 2019",Superb,"This is one of the best places to see. Soo great for children to learn basic things, it is full of activities and you can spend all day inside, specially when the weather is not perfect. And... it´s free."
"Written September 6, 2019",The whole family will love it,One can spend hours here and remain fascinated. So many things to see and will take more than a single trip. One of the best in the world.
"Written September 3, 2019","Worth a visit for sure, and it's free!","This place seems to be a great visit for all ages. Whether you're interested in history or not, the exhibits themselves are well laid out to catch your eye at every step inside!The exterior needs it's own post as that it something which WILL drop your jaw.Well worth a visit."
"Written September 2, 2019",Wonderful experience,"We had a fun filled time at the museum. The kids were so excited that they were not in a hurry to leave. We did not have to pay to enter, it was free. Also the meal we had wasn't shabby. They had good kids meal pack at a good rate."
"Written September 2, 2019",Worth a visit!,"I was very excited to see all the displays, especially the blue whale and the dinosaurs. It’s a good museum for children but even adults would have a wonderful time.The building itself is really stunning. The architecture is just really magnificent. They have listed all the highlights in their brochure so even those with limited time can enjoy the displays. I went during the peak season and the crowd was quite manageable. There may be a queue outside but that’s just for security, so don’t get discouraged if you see it. Best of all, entrance is free! Quite interesting souvenirs at the gift shop as well. "
"Written September 2, 2019",Awesome place,"Very interesting place, lots of cultural memories. It is designed both for the adults, as well as for the children. Free entry and nice staff to guide you through it. Also, it is place in one of london's luxurious neighborhoods... With very beautiful architecture and nice vibe. "
"Written October 10, 2019",Vast collections! ,"Stunning museum full of great collections, ranging from various animals, to fossils, to information on natural elements and disasters. I went during the afternoon, and was able to walk through the museum in about 2 hours. As it was a weekday, there were plenty of field trips, but I didn’t find the museum packed. Overall, a lovely experience! "
"Written October 9, 2019",My favourite place i  London,As you see historical itens you feel inside the Harry Potter Movie. The Museum also has a nice restaurante to kids.
"Written October 9, 2019",Stunning to see,"Must do for any ageThe building is almost as spectacular as the exhibits areBeautiful place to spend some time and free, or small donationWe loved it "
"Written October 9, 2019",Great Place,"The museum has wealth of info and is an amazing place. Ideally one would need days to go through every exhibit, but even if you have an hour it is worth a visit to the main exhibits! "
"Written October 8, 2019",A must go for kids in London ,"National history museum -  a must go if you are going to London with your kids , lot of learning and experience and it's free.The first thing I noticed was the building such an architecture it's sufficient in itself to see.the huge dinosaur in the entrance is welcoming as that's a demo wat the museum has in store for us. I had less time so I couldn't see the whole museum but I did see the gems section and planets section found it very informative . There are guided tours which can be taken and I am sure they are worth it. However  one thing I liked was there were groups of small kids with teachers and museum people explaining them everything. That was very impressive.it requires atleast 3-4 hours to see the whole thing at your own pace and reading everything . There were   also lots of free activities throughout the day some practical, some demonstrations, all very interesting. I think everyone should themselves visit and take their kids also.attaching the screenshots of the map to help you plan your visit. "
"Written October 7, 2019",Highly recommend a visit with children,"On a recent trip to London we visited this museum. You could easily spend a few hours here. Be prepared as it does get busy! Very informative and educational for kids and they learnt a lot. Did feel the signage wasn't great - took us a while to figure out how to get to the dinosaurs! Museum is free and worth doing but allow some time. There is a shop selling books, stones etc and also a small coffee shop on site. The science museum is next door but we didnt have time to do it but factor in some time if wanting to do both"
"Written October 3, 2019",Wow,"The billing itself are a great monument of an outstanding architecturere,we entered to see the dinosaur exposition, it is amazing, the moon exposition also remarkable, I recommend to visit this museum , you won't regret"
"Written October 2, 2019",Stunning building,"All attractions in the museum are very interesting but none compare to the building itself. Details of monkeys, birds, leaves in the portic arches reveal how are the people who erected it. Take time not only to see the skeletons but also to appreciate every detail at your sight."
"Written October 1, 2019",Amazing museum in a stunning building,Absolutely fabulous museum with amazing displays and interactive exhibits you could probably spend the day here as it is vast and there a various eating options available.Don't miss the Museum of the Moon exhibition which is currently on Until January 2020.And the whole lot is contained in a beautiful building.Very highly recommended.
"Written September 30, 2019",Great for all the family,"I took my Mom, Husband and 2 Nephews who were 7 and 14 years old. Everyone loved it! It is such a great attraction and you could easily spend all day there. Luckily we got there just before it opened and started to queue (about 20 minutes before opening time) - i would definitely recommend doing this as when we came out at lunch time the queue was snaking twice round the building. It is a free attraction and there are lots of different exhibits to see. The building itself is beautiful and the grounds are also lovely - we took a packed lunch with us and sat outside to eat our lunch before heading off elsewhere in London. "
"Written September 30, 2019",Free attraction you don't want to miss while in London,"The museum is huge, so you better prepare yourself for a good 3 hours to experience everything from the very beginning of humans on earth to our days. You can even experience an earthquake without the danger in real life.   "
"Written September 29, 2019",Great organisation ,Fantastic place. Free and super clean. Good place for everyone. Good organisation with maps and lift 
"Written September 27, 2019",Magnificent museum,"Totally recommend to animal lovers, but even if not, the moon exhibit itself is worth the visit. Their invertebrate section was a bit small but arranged well. The dinosaurs were extremely well placed and the ""live"" T-Rex is a must.I recommend that you free up at least 3-4 hours ind order to get the full experience (unfortunately I only had a couple of hours and missed some of the exhibits)."
"Written September 26, 2019",Wonderful free museum for animal lovers,"This museum is magnificent from both the exterior and the interior. Inside you will find many skeletons and representations of animals, I found everything interesting but expect a lot of walking!"
"Written September 26, 2019",Brilliant,"Spent most of the day here and visited just about everything, it was most enjoyable and not too crowded. The Wild Life Garden provides a lovely break and is amazing to find i central London. The building itself is worth looking at."
"Written September 24, 2019",A shrine to man's desire to destroy everything,"Beautiful building.  We, for the most part, enjoyed the museum, and even learned a few things (like the brain as a flat linear organ, that Kryptonite is real etc etc).But, the Sequoia changed my mood.  An incredible living thing, a seedling in the year 500 we can only imagine what it lived through, every war, every heir to the throne, empires, plagues.Only for us idiots to chop it down for no reason whatsoever after 1300 years of living.  This makes you look at everything with a different view: gross, unnecessary abuse of our planets wonders.Its a matter of opinion but I found my overall view was disappointing.  Not of the museum, but of the museum as a shrine of mans stupidity."
"Written September 22, 2019",Attenborough fans rejoice,Many of us have seen David Attenboroughs series about the Natural History Museum and visiting is even better.
"Written September 22, 2019",Amazing!! ,"I have always wanted to visit the National History Museum. It is overwhelming with how much there is to see and to take in. So many things to do and engage in, lots of interactive games. We only had a few hours so I didn't get chance to explore it all but I plan to return and spend a full day in the near future. It does get busy, it is free but you are asked to give a donation which is feel is fair. The building is stunning and so is the interior. Can't wait to return for a proper adventure. "
"Written September 20, 2019",Love this musuem,Love this place! The displays are amazing and suitable for adult and kids of all ages. Allow plenty of time as there is heaps of different things to see on each floor. Tip...don't go on a rainy day in the middle of school holidays!
"Written September 16, 2019",Still one of the best there is!,"They've given this place one hell of a clean-up since I was last here and they've added a new wing and entry but the exhibits are still as arresting and mind-blowing as I remember them. The great entry hall looks much grander then it did and it's a lot noisier than it was when I was last there (in 1969) but it  is still a wonderful place to visit. It's free and it opens at 10. The dinosaurs, fossils and mammal exhibits are really engrossing and I've always loved the insects. One of my favorite exhibits was the huge Alaskan King Crab but I couldn't find it this time. The museum is a lot more interactive than it used to be and I remember there used to be attendants all around the museum making sure that you were dead quiet and didn't touch anything- how times have changed. The place is much lighter and airier than it used ot be which is a great plus. The museum shop is temptation incarnate - I had to keep reminding myself of the airline's weight limits! This is still one of the best places in London. "
"Written July 22, 2019","Amazing, wish we had more time","We took two kids (8 and 10 years) and our 8 year old was determined he would be bored.  From the moment we got inside both kids were so excited to be there and couldn't wait to see what was in the next section.  The displays are really well displayed and captivating, the information is really clear and the interactive sections well thought out. From the dinosaurs to mammals to corals and birds it was so well done that we could have spent hours in each section.  Ultimately had to almost drag the children out.Will definitely allow more time when we next make it to London."
"Written July 22, 2019",Not only for kids,This  is the place for everyone. Don't get discouraged by the crowds waiting in the queue - it moves pretty fast. I've heard that the best time to visit is just any time but summer holidays ;)
"Written July 16, 2019",Too crowded,"Same as at some other museums in London, it was too crowded and too hot inside, especially at some parts of the museum.I understand it's free so many people visit, but under these circumstances nobody can really enjoy a visit. I think that limiting the number of people that can be inside at the same time could help."
"Written July 6, 2019",Fantastic day out! ,"I loved this museum, so much to look at and walk around observing. I was a little disappointed that the big Dino skeletons are currently on tour however the whale in the main hall is still pretty cool. They have staff located around the museum with different artefacts and skeletons and they offer some extra info which was cool. There were lots of school kids there when we went (10-2) so be mindful of that if you don’t want the crowds. It was super easy to get there from a tube to south Kensington station, you just follow the signs straight through. We took lunch with us and just ate it at a table, I didn’t see the prices of food but it is apparently quite expensive. The Dino cafe did look really cool though and would be a good spot for the kids to have a rest. "
"Written July 3, 2019",Back in London beiefly but standards have dropped.,"Sad to see the devolution of the Natural History Museum. Customer service non existent. Exctinct, like the dinosaurs. A disgrace. Front steps being fixed up so entry is via a side entrance  It was packed as ever. Went through quickly as I only wanted to see the Dinosaurs. Seen other sections on previous tours   Dippie is gone. 'On tour'. Yeah and the new free space below the hanging blue whale skeleton which replaced it is used for functions/events. Ka-ching! ££££££££. :( But then, to get out. I asked an assistant. 'Go back the way you came'. was one reply. I asked another. She found it funny that I was clearly tired and wanted to leave. Told me to go via a dinosaur related section (forgot name) but...where's that then? (A bit like asking where the train station is and being told it's just passed the church next to the bus station. And where are they??) No temporary signs. Anywhere. ""Nothing to do with me."" Was another member of staff's answer when I complained. Pardon??!! I replied ""It is actually. You're wearing the name of the company on your T shirt"".  ""Above my pay grade"" was their next answer.  It's a tacky tourist trap of a place. And the  ""store"" is tacky. Hey I love the USA. But it's the USA. And this is Great Britain. We call it a shop.  S-H-O-P. *eye roll* As 'fake' as the exhibits  🙄"
"Written July 3, 2019",Amazing!!,"Great way to spend a few hours, the building incredible and there are so many wonderfu things to look at, and it’s free!! "
"Written June 28, 2019",School visit,"Nobody can deny the wonder and awe this place creates with people of all ages. Whilst I appreciate it is free to enter the museum, I do wonder how much MORE money they would make if a basic cheese and tomato sandwich didn't cost £4.95 and was say, a more reasonable £2.50? I wonder how many more people would actually buy food from the museum as oppose to bringing their own. I wonder how much more they can generate from lowering food prices for the sake of upkeep and maintenance of the museum? Very few people, even tourists will be prepared To pay rip-off prices and get bumped under the pretence of 'supporting' the museum. Yes it's free to enter. But don't charge £1.60 for spring water and £5 for a basic sandwich that costs 4 times less just across the road. Your missing a trick her History Museum! "
"Written June 27, 2019",Very Disappointing,"Boring, and items in the shops are about 5x their worth. Not much to see except fake-looking dino fossils and pictures."
"Written June 23, 2019",Wow wow wow,Such a fantastic place. We didn’t have nearly enough time to do it justice. Very kid friendly and free (make sure you give a voluntary donation).
"Written June 21, 2019",It is the home of Darwin,"One cannot emphasize the unique collection of things to see and touch. Ot would take a week to look at it all.  But it is not on the top ten list of things to see, without reason.  It is fantastic."
"Written June 18, 2019",Could Spend Hours There,"Wow. That was my impression of the museum. Beautiful displays, nicely arranged. So much to see you could easily spend a day or two browsing the different sections. We had a pleasure of spending 3 hours here and it feels we only touched the surface. "
"Written June 18, 2019",The best experience ,What a place so many exhibits to look at and  it's  so big.. any one who visits London  have to go to this place it's  busy place but so much to see and learn plus it's  free!!!!!!
"Written June 18, 2019",Great afternoon,"A great afternoon at the NHM, the kids loved the Dino exhibit and I love that it is by donation so all can enjoy.  Definitely something for the whole family."
"Written June 15, 2019",Amazing building and exhibits,"Easy to get to on the tube.Wonderful exhibits such as the dinosaurs and mineral collection.Best part was the building, learning about the history of great scientists and the detail in the architecture.I would recommend not going during school holidays, it was very difficult to enjoy the exhibits with so many young people crowding the areas."
"Written June 13, 2019",Unique impressive building with interesting architecture,The museum has a unique curved glass ceiling mounted on curved iron poles.  The museum resembles a church layout and it includes a unique tree root showing the human  population census over thousands of years. An enjoyable free entry museum that is worth visiting
"Written June 11, 2019",really impressive,"i highly recommend the place. its really impressive. we spent 5 hours there but we have not see it all. the building is impressive, very clean and organised, with lot of information. no queue (we visited the place on Saturday) the entrance was free and there is a nice gift shop as well. All the kids are so excited there."
"Written June 6, 2019",I can’t believe this amazing place is FREE to enter!!,"It blows my mind that such an amazing museum is free to enter. I’ve paid over $40 US to enter museums smaller than this and with less displays. Strongly recommend donating to help them keep up the museum. I went 2 hours before closing time and realized I should have allowed myself more time. There was so much to see! I ended up skipping over some things to ensure I got to see the displays that truly fascinated me. As a marine biologist, I’ve always loved any marine life displays. The blue whale skeleton is amazing, but it amazed me when I realized that this wasn’t the only whale skeleton on display! There were 5 - the blue whale in the main entrance, then a bowhead whale, a right whale, a sperm whale, and a gray whale in the mammal display. There was also a life size blue whale model with over a dozen other life size cetacean models including orcas, Risso’s dolphin, narwhals, etc. The displays along the sides were highly educational as well. I do wish that the shark and ray displays were a bit larger. Corals and cnidarians had an entire room while there were 2 small displays that contained various sharks. "
"Written June 5, 2019",Perfect for my kids,We spent 2 days to visit this museum because my kids liked it. They enjoyed to look around all rooms and talked about what they saw. Perfect for the kids!!
"Written June 3, 2019",Brilliant for all the family,"This was one of the highlights of our London trip. The museum is enormous with sections on Dinosaurs, Human Biology, Mammals and many more we didn't have time for. Even the members of the family that weren't keen on going enjoyed the visit!The dinosaur section is awesome."
"Written June 1, 2019",Way too busy,"Went on a very hot Saturday. The museum was very busy and very hot inside! I think the museum needs to invest in more air con. It was so busy it was hard to see anything. Although in my opinion there wasn’t much to see, the dinosaur section was ok but the ‘human’ section just looked run down and old and needs updating. But it’s free so can’t complain."
"Written August 7, 2019",pay a visit!,"very good museum, went with my kids and they were fascinated by so many things to see and learnworth going"
"Written August 3, 2019",Awesome!,"This place will just wow you the moment you step in. The artifacts are just amazing and breathtaking. Even the building itself is such a beauty. The color of the tiles were arranged in a way that's symmetrical and mesmerizing. If only there were less crowd, it would have been more comfortable to take our time and browse. "
"Written August 1, 2019",It's all there,If you are looking for natural history this is a place to go.  It can easily take you a whole day (or two) to get through the many exhibits.  Almost something for everyone to see.
"Written July 29, 2019",What a beautiful building!!,"Came here as soon as we arrived from the airport. Since our hotel room wasn’t ready yet. This place is only a block away from our hotel. Exhibits were great but if you’ve been to Smithsonian,MET, Field Museum, then this is nothing different to my opinion. You can skip this. We were for like an hour just to kill time. We didn’t stay longer because it was hot inside. Not sure of the ventilation of the building but it was really uncomfortable inside. Plus there were too many tour groups. The building is beautiful outside though. Impressive!"
"Written July 29, 2019",Amazing architecture ,"You could visit this museum for the building alone. It’s such a beautiful building. And the museum is free, as are all the museums in London. It has exhibits over many levels and the most popular by far with all the kids was the dinosaur exhibit. At the time of our visit there was an exhibit of the moon but I think this was temporary. There is bag storage available for a fee and you can take photos."
"Written July 29, 2019",Magnificent ,"One of the world’s great museum, in a magnificent building. A remarkable collection but not overwhelming. Invest 3 hours and you’ll see most of it. Don’t miss the earthquake room! Only criticism is it’s a bit too focused on kids and they over do the cartoonish style a bit too much. Grew tiresome. Free admission, so don’t visit London without investing some time here. "
"Written July 29, 2019",Wow wow wow,The building alone is breathtaking! Then allthe exhibits inside makes this for a wonderful time. I would recommend more than one day as we spent 7 hours there and had to miss quite a bit because of not enough time. The moon exhibition was out of this world! 
"Written July 29, 2019",Best in the world,Best Natural History Museum in the world. Huge collection of everything and so something to wonder for everyone (from 5 to 100 years old). Great collection of dinosaurs and minerals. Takes hours to see everything. 
"Written July 28, 2019",Just incredible,The whale bones in the foyer is unbelievable. The whole place is just amazing. Makes me wish I lived in London full time. 
"Written July 27, 2019",Just amazing,"Well, this is an amazing way to spend couple hours (you will need 3-4 hours, even you could spend a day easily); especially if you have some kids.You have lots of coolections to visit: dinosaurs, mammals, fish and marine life, minerals, human evolution. Lots of interactive games for kids, to learn hi the body and mind is functioning, different insects, how animals are walking, and so one.Then the building is just amazing. One of the nicest buildings I ever saw.So, very nice museum, and it is free. "
"Written May 25, 2019",Brilliant place to visit.,Great and beautiful place.Very nice and willing staff.Cannot say more - just brilliant place to visit!
"Written May 25, 2019",Loved this Museum and so easy to get too,"If you like architecture, this is the place for you. Its well organized and not over the top crazy busy. It only took us an hour to do the entire place and its Free. Take advantage of all the museums, well worth it."
"Written May 25, 2019",Always lovely!,"The perfect getaway with the kids when we get bored of shopping and need to learn. This was the first time we’ve experienced any discomfort climate wise. It was extremely warm inside. Something must be going on with the ventilation system. Pizza and burgers at the T-Rex Grill are nice and reasonably priced. Best of all, It’s FREE! (But do donate when you’re leaving)"
"Written May 25, 2019",What a brilliant building and loads to see and learn ,We just couldn't see it all in one day.  The museum is free to enter but donation boxes plentiful to help them fund their work.  I cant fault this.  From just looking at the architecture or learning about dinosaurs or earthquakes everything is there.  Toilets plentiful as break points.  Use the side entrance though as not such a large queue and I'd try and avoid weekends as by lunchtime it was getting very busy so if you don't like hoardes of people like me avoid that time if you can. 
"Written May 24, 2019",An early morning taster for an inquisitive 4 year old,"1000 hrs opening time and a quick drop in to introduce a 4 year old to a classic museum. at this time it isn't too crowded and the child has space to explore and enjoy an educational experience without realising they are been educated  Dinosaurs, Chi Chi The Panda, Guy The gorilla  (sad they are Stuffed) and a building decorated with intricate carvings. Andy's clock from CBeebies. I think the aims of the museum were well met"
"Written May 22, 2019",Wow wow wow,"Loved the natural history museum. The building is one of my favourites in London. Great day out and spent hours there. Food is horrible inside so make you, you go out somewhere in south Kensington but such a great day! Loved it. Some areas could do with some updating."
"Written May 21, 2019",Excellent museum,"This is a great museum for young and old. It's huge, so it is probably a good idea to decide what you want to see before going. Children of all ages will enjoy the dinosaurs, but there is so much more. We'll definitely be back!"
"Written May 19, 2019",Old treasures slowly being stripped away,"Sadly, the 'History' part of this museum is in rapid decline. Expect lots of CGI, plastic replicas, noisy cattle-herding through mid-nineties features, and sadly little of the beautiful spaces for historic specimens in their original presentation cases. What lovely period marble or stone will be ripped out next and replaced with a bare, characterless white wall, or dull temporary exhibit one wonders? What's certain is the original architects would be deeply saddened to see what's been done to this timeless cathedral of Science. You get tourists come to experience the Harry Potter-esque wonder of British history, right? Not  janky video-projection and broken plastic statues? Someone with vision needs to take this place over, stat... It's becoming UGLY."
"Written May 18, 2019",Should gave took a kid,Its been on my bucket list for a while but once i was there i didn't realise how much of it was orientated at kids. I was on a weekend away without him so wen i go back it will be a different t story still very good so much history to see busy on a non school day. No backpack search like we were warned but be prepared if needed. There is a cloakroom £5 for bag over 4k. Drinks expensive 
"Written May 16, 2019",Amazing Experience,"Fascinating place, huge dinosaur fossils, a fragment of a meteor dated over a billion years old!  Great gift shop!"
"Written May 14, 2019","Good Exhibits, Free Entry, Worth It? Yes if Just for Photos","The entry into this museum is absolutely stunning. Once inside past the initial shock the exhibits, although good, still need some of the “wow” factor. The exhibits range from Dinosaurs to basic bacteria and everything in between in the natural universe. In the minerals section there are meteorites and Mars Rocks there is also star dust. Entry into the museum is Free although if you want a guidebook or map it will cost you £1-£5, there are special exhibits that do cost extra as well, prices may vary depending on the exhibit. This museum is child friendly and a great place to spend if the weather isn’t the best. "
"Written May 12, 2019",Think back 230 million years!,Standing next to the actual skeleton of a dinosaur is a breath taking experience.  I plan to return soon with friends and family.
"Written May 10, 2019",Nice For families,"Went into this museum to get out of the rain! This is definitely a place for adults to take their children. It was pretty packed . There is a lot to see, but got to warm for us. They have some great desserts at their cafe."
"Written May 10, 2019",Wow museum!,"this place is free of charge, offers many interactive exhibits, kids were walking around for hours without complaining. the only bad thing is that you can't see it all in one day ;)!"
"Written May 9, 2019",Interesting!,"An incredible, grand building and extremely interesting however it was almost unbearably crowded, so crowded we had to leave. Some areas of the interactive area for children are definitely a little worse for wear which is understandable due to the free admission. Please give a donation upon entry as it's so important to keep these treasures up and running."
"Written May 8, 2019",Amazing museum,"This was such a fun and interesting museum, and like most museums in London, free! Expect a crowd even in the offseason, as many locals visit often. The building itself is massive and a work of art in its own right. I'm sure the dinosaur exhibit is one of the best I have seen. The mineral and precious stone exhibit was fascinating. I did not make it to even half of the exhibits as we only had 2 hours to spend here on an EF tour. That is definitely not enough time! I think you would need a full day to do it justice. They even offer overnight events for children and adults! Talk abut a real night at the museum!"
"Written May 8, 2019",If you are a curious person,"There is so much to see here that I wish they extend the hours late into the night. My wife and I spent a good part of the day wandering amongst its huge halls to find wonders after wonders. Millienia-old trees, extinct animals, pre-historic meterites, etc..... Photos taken at the NHM are simply breath-taking as almost every exhibit make an incredible backdrop. Highly recommended."
"Written May 7, 2019",Wonderful museum,What a marvelous museum. There are actually 2 rocks from Mars here! Along with so many other items. A must see.
"Written April 29, 2019",A Must Visit,"First of all, it is free and there are a lot to see. My daughter is into dinosaurs and she was very happy at the end (I won't give spoilers). And if you're into gems, stones, and minerals, you'll find them there as well! Not to mention all the stuffed taxidermy mounts of birds and mammals you will see"
"Written April 25, 2019","Once amazing, now ruined!","I first went to The Natural History museum in 1982 when I was 7 and it had a lasting impression on me. I've been a further three times since and it has never disappointed. However, my own daughter has just turned 7 and what better place to take her than to London to see the same sights. Alas, things change and not for the better. Gone are the fantastic rooms full of dinosaur bones, natural wonders and animals of the world. Gone the ability to roam and spend hours wondering from room to room. Instead, everything is now cordoned off. The public are 'kettled' into warrens. Shuffling along in steady droves to look at not actual dinosaur bones, but instead, plastic dinosaurs and animatronics. Gone are the rooms and rooms of exhibits. Replaced with cafes and endless shops, or VIP rooms you can't enter. What have you done to this wonderful treasure? It seems the persuit of money and the dumming down of exhibits has killed it. If you want a good day, I recommend the Science Museum around the corner. Where visitors can roam free, away from people, pens and ribboned off queues!"
"Written February 18, 2019",One of the places to visit.,"I have been in the museum in the past and I was as I remembered it: huge, impressive, located in a very nice building.  You need a lot of time to see it all! "
"Written February 11, 2019",An amazing Museum and free,"Found we had a few hours to burn on sunday and this was a great place to visit, Amazing place and you would learn loads, Great place to bring kids and would need a few hours to get around the whole place. You would be tired after walking the whole place so said id come back another day and do the science museum but the national history museum was a great spot and very informative."
"Written February 11, 2019",Not what it used to be.,"My last visit to this museum had been in the late 1990s, when a full day had not been enough to take in all their incredible collections. It was superb and fascinating. One of the best days out I had ever experienced, so I was looking forward to a return visit to see how the museum had evolved. I wish I hadn’t bothered.Overcrowded, tacky, tired, run down and dumbed down are words that sadly sum up this once world-beating museum.Previously, large and spacious galleries had enabled the public to walk at their leisure along row upon row of wonderful skeletons and majestic stuffed animals with glass cabinets in their hundreds, displaying collections of insects and animals in their thousands, there to inform and captivate, to amaze and bring wonder. Now, the heaving crowds are herded along plasterboard-lined narrow corridors, decked out with brightly coloured plastic signs, past endless displays of interactive computer screens with rows of illuminated buttons (many not working), a myriad of diagrams and information boards with cartoon fonts, naturally interspersed with the ubiquitous gift shops and special ‘pay to enter’ or ‘members only’ rooms. What few exhibits remain look like they have come from a 1970’s theme park, their paint peeling, their surfaces covered in thick, grey dust.Sadly, the exhibits we had come all this way to see are no more. No doubt packed away behind the scenes as it is no longer PC to display dead animals. It’s all about conservation and habit loss these days, don’t you know? It’s almost as if the museum is trying to distance itself from the ‘naughty Victorians’ for amassing their world-class collections in the first place.I understand that times and tastes change, but this museum seems to have lost its way. I don’t want to spend my time reading information boards when I visit a museum. A book read in the comfort of my own home will accomplish that. I want to see the animals, the skeletons, the marvellous collections which have now been replaced with child-friendly interactive displays, for at the core of any museum should be the exhibits, surely?We had planned to make a day of our visit, but after a few, disappointing hours we moved on next door to the vastly superior V&A. Unless something drastic changes we shan’t return, and that is a very great shame."
"Written February 10, 2019",Family trip to London,Extremly recommended for all age groups. I have to admit I'm not a museum person but this museum is very interesting and lots of hands on experience. 
"Written February 3, 2019",Con trick,"Wanted to see the Wildlife Photographer of the year exhibition, but was not allowed to enter without paying for membership as well as the admission. Despicable!"
"Written January 31, 2019",Spend a day at the museum! ,"The museum is beautiful! Love their attractions too! If you visit on Nov-Dec, they have a skating rink just outside the museum. Make sure to buy your tickets ahead to reserve a slot. "
"Written January 21, 2019",Mind blowing ,"It would take a month to review this place properly - suffice to say, if you’re in the area, don’t miss it and free up a couple of hours.  Should be mandatory for all kids, a place of wonder."
"Written January 19, 2019",So much to see and learn from,Loved the national history museum and was amazed by the amount of things to see and learn from. You would need a full day to truly see everything and we found navigating even with a map a little confusing. Enjoyed the shop there and all the things it offers. 
"Written January 15, 2019",Great visit with a 4 year old and baby in tow,"We live in London but this was our first visit to the museum with our kids (just turned 4 year old and a 6 month old baby). I was very pleasantly surprised by just how accessible it is with a buggy. The hassle is actually getting to the museum - South Ken tube is not at all accessible, a lot of steps to get up to station entrance level and then again to get to road level. On the way home we decided to just walk on foot to Victoria train station (from where we could get an overland train) and it took about half an hour and was better than lugging the buggy up and down a variety of staircases. We went on a Thursday in term time. It was busy in places - the volcano section in particular was chockablock with school trip kids - but generally we got to see everything without issue. Once there, the cloakroom is helpful and you can check buggies in for free so long as they are folded. You can also wheel them round the museum if you don’t want to check them in, everywhere we went was very buggy accessible. There are plenty of cafes and pit stops for food and drink. We had pit stop one in the cafe on the ground floor in the volcano/earthquake wing, a lunch box for our 4 year old was (I think) £5.50. That was for half a cheese sandwich, fruit, drink and a muffin.  There was mould on the muffin inside and they promptly swapped it for a free one but not the best start. We later had a proper lunch in the dinosaur cafe, which does pizzas, burgers and wraps. The cafe was quite quiet, the waitress said it tends to be less busy if weather outside is good (tourists tend to do the museums if they get a wet day). Food in the cafe was good and our 4 year old loved the animatronic dinosaurs in there. We were probably at the museum 1030-1500 and got to see most of what we wanted. We skipped through volcanos quickly due to volume of school kids, tried the earthquake room, then went through the insect room, then dinosaurs and the mammals section. We also did the big hall. The whale hanging in the big hall is good but frankly, it is never going to be a proper replacement for the old diplodocus that used to hang there! Our 4 year old liked the dinosaurs best (obviously) with the robot T. rex the number one highlight. There are also about one million gift shops in there so never fear that you will go home without a souvenir...There is also an interactive room in the basement (called Investigate I think) which features on “must do” reviews of the museum, we went down to go in as it’s meant to be excellent for kids, only to find it was shut for use by school groups only. I think the sign said it was closed all morning and until mid afternoon.  I’m not sure whether we just got unlucky on our day or if this is a permanent thing. Overall, a really great day and our four year old is already asking to go back again. "
"Written January 12, 2019",Very busy ,"Visited on the 3rd January and was not prepared for how busy it would be. Visited once before when my son was a toddler and it was so calm so think I was just not expecting it. A lovely interesting museum, especially for kids, but sadly it was just too busy for us to see things properly. Kept getting shouted at to ""keep moving as its busy"" in the dinosaur section....how can you keep moving in a museum when you are supposed to read things? This seemed a bit odd and got a bit a annoying as felt they were rushing you out. Would have stayed longer and seenmore if not so crammed. Hope to return (on a quieter day!)"
"Written October 6, 2018",Amazing building and museum ,This was first on my  London ‘to do’ list and I wasn’t disappointed.  The main hall is architecturally stunning. Give yourself a lot of time to visit the  galleries in detail. Loved the Treasures section. 
"Written September 30, 2018",Massive beautiful building housing an overwhelming collection,"Impressive inside and out the Natural History Museum is a great place for adults and families. The building itself is only dwarfed by the number, size and variety of it's collections beautifully displayed. Several cafes, facilities and museum shops add to a memorable experience."
"Written September 30, 2018","A Must for dinosaur fans, natural science enthusiasts and Darwin admirers ","Very interesting both from the outside and inside. We, family with a five year old, started our tour around 10 o’clock (opening hour) on a Saturday, found already cueing people. Didn’t take long for us to get in (maybe 4 minutes). Free of charge, but you can give an optional donation of 20, 10 or 5 pounds ( very convenient by card).Inside, very crowded of course, but very nice display of dinosaur fossils and all kinds of kid-friendly animations too.We visited the Darwin center, but were already tired after 2 hours of walking in the museum. Constant noise level, walking for miles and playing game of “which country are these visitors from” made us very tired. We used one additional half hour for the special exhibition on “life in the dark” (12,50 pounds per adult , which was worth it and less crowded) and half an hour more to leave the museum ( because you find interesting things along the way).Exhausted but happy, we left for something to eat.Would love to stay there during night and alone. -;)"
"Written September 28, 2018",Stunning as always,"I love this museum I went there for the fourth time,  it's always nice spent your time and there are plenty of stuffs to see and learn. "
"Written September 20, 2018",Free and interesting,"Make sure you pop in to this beautiful old museum while you are in London. It's not in the city centre, which makes it a delight for those staying in the Kensington area.Beautifully lit by natural light, the building itself is as much a wonder as its contents. "
"Written September 19, 2018",One of the best of its kind,"I could spend days and days in this museum wandering around its extensive collection of everything that has to do with nature and research. Building itself is stunning with marvellous details in its pillars and on its walls, clearly breathing what it houses inside. Don't miss the Vault at the end of the extensive miral collection where some very precious gems are displayed. I keep coming back here every time I am in London and can highly recommend this musuem. It is great for kids as well as certain exhibits are highly interactive such as the Dinosaur and Creepy Crawler section. Enjoy and say high to Darwin from me!"
"Written September 17, 2018",So much to see,The NHM is huge and you will need at least a day to see everything. There are many different collections that are of interest for both adults and children. Be aware that at peak times it can become exceptionally busy with many school groups and tourists. It is free entry. There are cafes available and of course shops. One shop seems to be dedicated to children whereas another to adults so look out for these as the items they sell are different. The NHM runs specialised tours which you gave to pay for but these are usually very good and the guides are knowledgeable. Check out the website for further info. South Kensington us the nearest underground station and if you want to avoid the main roads there is a tunnel which you can use from the underground. There are other museums in the same are so you could pay a brief visit to a few or spend time in just one.
"Written September 15, 2018",Never disappoints," My son and I visited Life in the Dark exhibition. Which was one to be paid for, but it was worth the money. Very informative, varied, interesting. There were other nice exhibits on the way to this exhibition. Such a nice place to spend time with your little one."
"Written September 13, 2018",Excellent collection,This museum easily deserves a day with its awesome well organised collection and great cafe.It would be a pity if you restricted yourself just to the donosaurs section.
"Written September 9, 2018",amazing,What a beautiful building. we visiting with our young children. it was a saturday and very busy but was a fantaatic experience. My children loved the dinosaurs and mamal section but i found the whole place very interesting.  We will definately visit again
"Written April 25, 2019",Free Museum well worth spending the afternoon.,"Great choice for any London visitor or family trying to stay out of the gloomy or rainy weather. From amazing dinosaur fossils to interactive nature exhibits, this is a must see for all ages. The admission is free, and the museum is better than most."
"Written April 21, 2019",Ok!,"Good layout! Volcanos and earthquakes section very impressive. I had feeling we are walking to long from section to section. Dinosaur section was ok,  bit too dark. But the  museum itself as a building is beautiful. Stunning "
"Written April 21, 2019",Beautiful! ,Gorgeous museum. I loved all of the detail in the building. We weren’t able to spend much time here but it’s worth just popping your head in and seeing the main hall! 
"Written April 16, 2019",Great museum for all age groups,"Lots of different departments and exhibits, should be something for everybody. The earth-section with earthquake simulation was modern and well made. The dinosaur-section will also be exciting for most people. It pays off to arrive at opening hours, it did get quite crowdy on a Sunday."
"Written April 10, 2019",Beautiful Building,Stunning building inside-out. Visit is free so worth stepping in to see the collections if one has time to spare in London or if weather not suited for outdoor sightseeing. Weekends though seems very busy. Weekdays might be less
"Written March 29, 2019","Great place to spend a few hours, for free in London !!!","The NHM is a great place to spend a few hours looking at the history of the world. You have to pay to see some special exhibitions, but we just stuck to the free selection. We had two teens with us & at first they weren’t over excited to say the least. But when they seen the dinosaurs they soon change there moods. There’s not many places in London that are free & well worth a visit. But the NHM is definitely one to fit in if you’ve got the time."
"Written March 20, 2019",History and Architecture,Great day out for all the family. The building is spectacular from outside too. Plenty to see and do for the whole family..
"Written March 18, 2019",Stunning,The Natural History Museum is very educational yet entertaining at the same time. It would make a great weekend away trip for the kids and adults alike. The dinosaur section was particularly impressive
"Written March 1, 2019","Fun, free and entertaining ",A great place to come for a few hours or even a few days. There is so much to see and do plus it’s free! Try to avoid the main entrance and head for exhibition road entrance which rarely has a queue. Then head to whatever takes your fancy. Going to the dinosaurs section is a must and also the whale skeleton in the great hall. Plenty of friendly staff around and also cafes and shops. Great for all ages.
"Written February 19, 2019",Half term mayhem,I now know how it feels like being herded like a sheep. The museum is amazing and you can easily spend 2-3 days but do avoid half term. We didn’t get chance to see some of the exhibits as the rest of the “flock” of people around us didn’t want to stop and just carried us forward. Our little boy loved the animatronic dinosaur. 
"Written November 18, 2018",Loved the Dinosaurs exhibit,No entry fee however the staff reminds you to make a donation for the museumWent on a Sunday good place to take kids alongHad a good time ... but from all other exhibits really enjoyed the Dinosaur exhibit...seeing all the fossils recovered from the past which inform us about the dinosaurs is amazingWorth a visit when in LondonPosting pics for all to see for themselves 
"Written November 15, 2018",Must vusit,"If you have young children, then you cannot afford to miss this place! So much well-preserved and well presented information in one place with so many interactive games to help the young ones engaged. Highly recommend the red and the blue zones. Dinosaur sections are always a big hit. We dined at their Dino themed restaurant and my kid thoroughly enjoyed. Winter carnival right outside, was an added blessing!"
"Written November 13, 2018",Fabulous,"Very well done; typically ""natural history"" museums are overwhelmingly focused on things for children to make noises with and play with; not too bad here. Highly recommend going early on a weekday; we mistakenly did not and struggled with the crowds a little bit. Be sure to notice and appreciate the building itself, which is absolutely amazing."
"Written November 13, 2018",Amazing,"The outside of the building will take your breath away, start breathing again as the exhibits are fantastic. Everything is laid out for the visitor to see. Easy access to each display. Very very helpful staff."
"Written November 3, 2018",Best place for kids in the half term,"The iconic place to visit in London any time of the year, but extra special for those kids who are growing, learning, experiencing and inquisitive and for parents who need to keep those energetic kids occupied in half term holidays. A great day trip or half day if needed, can get busy as such a magnet for tourists so recommend getting there as doors open. Go straight to the dinosaur exhibits and the animatronic T-Rex. Then enjoy the various exhibition rooms on the ground floor and if time go upstairs to see the old gem collection room, which is less kid orientated and more for those of us that can remember what the museum looked like 30-40 years ago. Yes, dippy has gone but is now replaced with a grand Cretacean blue whale which commands the main exhibition entrance. The facilities are good, lines and queues do form in the exhibition areas and the restaurant does get busy to be expected, I recommend taking snacks and drinks in your backpack. That said there is so much on offer, kids love the visual and tactile experiences on offer and the chance to learn so much in one place. Note the walking distance between tube exit and entrance in the tunnels, the stairs and inclines to get in and out of the museum and the large amount of walking in the museum itself if with toddlers. the kids will not forget their trip and we look forward to visiting again soon. As a free entrance it is only right that we give a donation to maintain this fantastic learning experience for all future generations."
"Written October 23, 2018",Do not miss Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition,"The museum is fun and contains a lot of educational and thought provoking materials. Admission is free. Very good to visit with kids. The highlight of my trip, however, was the Wildlife Photographer of the year exhibition. If you go, book it online, don't even hope to 'just get there and get in.' Fascinating, artistic, educational, evoking many thoughts and emotions, this exhibition was easily a highlight of my trip to London. Every photograph is accompanied with a story, and I read them all , ending up spending 2 hours just at the exhibit."
"Written October 22, 2018",Great fun,"A lot of people (slightly soggy Sunday) - perhaps too many. My niece loved the dinosaurs, and I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful building details."
"Written October 17, 2018",Amazing building...and it’s FREE,The architecture of this building was stunning.  The exhibits were plentiful and the collections were expansive.  Best of all it is FREE.  Great activity for all ages.
"Written October 14, 2018",Highly Recommended,visited to the place during our trip to London. Amazing museum which everyone has to visit when in London. highly recommended. The best part is its free to enter.
"Written October 9, 2018",Absolutely Must See!,"Of course it can be a bit crowded – it’s one of the best museums in the world and the entrance is free (please donate as it lives with donations).And if the day is rainy (and that’s not unusual in London) tourists will invade it.But the museum is simply an amazing place with tons of information, replicas and cool interactive gadgets for people of all ages.From the ant to the blue whale, from the formation of the earth to the confines of the universe, any curious kid or adult will be marvelled wit the visit."
"Written September 5, 2018",I enjoyed the experience,Definitely a place for knowledge and learning. This place is comfortable and fun to be in. I want to go back again.A piece of the history of the world in one roof!
"Written September 4, 2018",Amazing,"The exhibits are astounding, as are the crowds. We visited on a rainy Sunday, which probably contributed to the congestion, but definitely a top spot to visit in London"
"Written September 4, 2018",Wonderful ,A wonderful building inside where people meet biology as science. The dinosaurs area and Darwin area are spectacular. After the visit pay some time in the exterior also.
"Written August 30, 2018",Good not great,"First of all, and this won’t affect everyone and this can be extended to include most of London... if it’s hot outside, it’s hot in the museum. Like most public buildings in London, there is no AC. For Europeans this is expected. For others, maybe not so much. So suffice to say that the 90+ degree weather when we visited maybe affected our enjoyment of this and other attractions in London. Seriously, our favorite exhibits were the various fans placed around to cool down the docents and guards. Anyway, heat aside, to be honest, the building is the star here. The main hall is absolutely stunning and worth the visit by itself. The exhibits there are well presented and pretty cool. The slight problems come when you venture to some of the other halls. My 15 year old son has always loved dinosaurs so we were excited to see the world famous dinosaur exhibits. Our issue was the presentation. Most of the fossils were suspended above the floor and it was really dark so it made seeing them somewhat difficult. Maybe this is a temporary thing but it was not really that great. The mammals area was also fairly “meh” with a lot of replica animals mixed in with actual skeletons and such. A really strange thing too was the huge layer of dust on top of the blue whale and the other larger fake animals. Looked like it had not been cleaned in many years. The other parts of the museum seemed more science center than historical museum. Probably fun for smaller kids but my kids were maybe a bit old for it.One of the surprise cool things (literally... it had AC so maybe that also tainted this part of the review) was the Darwin Center. Obviously the newest addition to the museum it had some really cool stuff to see mixed with some newer technology sure to appeal to older kids. Overall, expect to be wowed by the structure itself and some of the exhibits. Just don’t expect to love it all and you will have a great time. "
"Written August 27, 2018",educational fun,Been chiming here with children since they were in pushchairs and still going now they are teenagers. always interesting. check their website for exhibitions
"Written August 25, 2018","Amazing, unforgettable experience","We really were just going to visit ‘Sensational Butterflies’ as it’s a street away from our holiday house and the kids were begging to go. But we ended up going there and also seeing a part of the museum.The butterflies are not caged or anything - they fly around freely and this startled my 5 year old a bit but my 2 year old was unbothered - he loved chasing them around!The butterfly tent is also not very big and you could tour it in a couple minutes but there are chairs to sit and chill on if you just want to stay around a bit longer - but it’s warm in there so you just wanna see the butterflies and leave.But it’s so beautiful and there’s loads and loads of colourful species!!The butterfly store at the exit also has great butterfly themed souvenirs and surprisingly well priced! Also For £6.5 a pop for entry, it’s a great deal! And that’s for the butterfly place - admittance to the museum is free but they ask for a donation at the entrance which you can give or decide not to - totally up to you.What’s not to love? Seeing the butterflies fluttering around was surreal- my kids aged 5 & 2 really enjoyed this and we got ice cream in one of the trucks on the grounds and went to the museum but only spent a few minutes as they were hungry and then we came back out, laid out a scarf on the grass on the grounds, got hotdogs and fries and drinks and we had a picnic!!! It was a load of joy!!!We got to see the butterflies, the dinosaurs, fossils, ants ( I had no idea there were so many species of ants!!!) and T-Rex etc. In the 1.5 hours we spent in but we did not go beyond halfway on the first floor at the museum so we will definitely go back.It was such a great experience though and the kids had the best time that I can’t possibly think of why anyone wouldn’t like this! There were babies and toddlers and teenagers and mums and dads and aunts and grandpas and grandmas - it’s is such an inclusive place - can’t believe I had never been!!! Looking forward to going again!"

Highlights were the beautiful entrance hall and giant whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling, the animatronic dinosaurs, and the many hands-on exhibits for children. Our 10 yr old daughter loved it! We spent 3.5 hours there, and would have stayed longer but we had a reservation elsewhere and had to leave. It's best to get there early. We got there shortly after it opened, and by the time we left (around lunch time) it was so crowded, especially at  the dinosaurs exhibit."
"Written January 8, 2019","🏛Rich, educating and fascinating🦕"," Absolutely worths a visit.The quality and quantity of the preserved artifacts are surprising.The structure is suggestive and immense; it hosts several areas, each one dedicated to a specific theme: animal and human species and the various evolutions to date, passing through an interesting interactive path dedicated to human body, brain, emotions and their respective functions and abilities.The animal exhibiting area is breathtaking: it is literally surrounded by majestic prehistoric skeletons, exhibited with care and originality. Also the numerous animals reproduced and stuffed, from the oldest to the recent ones, is very suggestive to watch.The itinerary includes some salient details on the extinct and endangered species, exposing their causes and consequences.The wide ""Geology"" area reserved for minerals is stunning, you can admire many rarities on display. It' s also possible to try the simulation of a strong earthquake occurred in Japan in 1995.The structure is very well taken care of, the entrance is free, you can make a donation to the exit, and it will be certainly deserved for this museum so rich, educational (for children and not only) and original.It worths spending a whole day there."
"Written January 6, 2019",Theme park for young children - tacky and noisy,"For children i’m sure it’s very good. Endless shops selling tacky souvenird, like plastic dinosaurs. Endless cafes, and between them play areas for kids.oh yes, the occasional exhibit, surrounded by screens, pictures and explanations aimed at - kids. All inside a beautiful historic building. If you want a theme park, no doubt it’s fine. If you want, what is it they call it? A natural history museum, look elsewhere. Vienna has a brilliant natural history museum if you can make it. If you want a kids playground, it’s perfect."

"Written December 8, 2018",Huge Collection of Minerals,"I am a lover of crystals and minerals, and this was the main reason for my visit, and I wasn't disappointed.  I have been to the Swedish Natural History Museum, but this one seemed much bigger in terms of size and its collection.  Mineral lovers would love this place, and I would have been able to spend a day or more in its mineral section alone.  The souvenir shop also sells minerals at very reasonable prices, and I picked up a few here as well."

"Written November 27, 2018",Unbelievable,The museum which impressed me the most in London only because of that building. You have to see that in real.
"Written August 6, 2018",Crowded ,Nice place to visit but for sure not in the hot summer as most places in London during summer are hot and not aircooled. 
"Written August 3, 2018",Beware of the dinosaurs,"We visited this during a very hot day which may have slightly affected my review. The museum is very warm in that weather. The ""red"" area was the one I spent most of the time in. It was a nice temperature and really well laid out. It covers volcanoes, earthquakes, evolution of man and related areas. Although I didn't go my husband took one of our sons to see the dinosaurs. They stayed for a few minutes escaping at the first possible way out. He said the display is very badly set out, the whole point of going is to look at the dinosaurs and have photos, it was too crowded for this and had a member of staff telling everyone to keep moving. The T-Rex, a very important part of the display, is in a dead end meaning returning the same way. He felt it was an area with the possibility of serious problems."
"Written July 29, 2018",A must,Wonderful time in this museum. I would say this museum is good from 8 years old and up. Toddlers won’t find many things interesting. My toddler saw the skeletons and said monster. It’s a museum that’s filled with so much but age is a consideration to get the most out of it.

There is something for everyone, but for once we didn't go through the dinosaur exhibits, just the mammals, ""bugs"" and the Ichthyosaurs.The usual tat-shop, but there is a hidden gem - the British Geological Society shop which has some amazing items, is quiet and peaceful, and well worth a visit.    Getting there required directions from 3 staff, two of whom sent us to the main museum shop!No admission fee, although there is a voluntary donation - no pressure, just lots of places you can drop something off (no, small children are not an acceptable donation!)To close as I started, BRING BACK DIPPY!"

The natural one has new exhibition for dinosaurs 🦕 for example and old permanent exhibition for animals, Darwin’s work, minerals and many others. Sunday was rally crowded in this fantastic architectural place with great accessibility for public transport. Many choices for food inside and you need it😋"
"Written July 14, 2018",Lots to see from volcanoes to dinosaurs,"Don't make the same mistake that I did. There is a lot to see. My first visit, I left after the volcanoes and earthquakes not realizing that there is another big section of the museum to explore. I'm not sure if you can get to it inside the building. We walked out and saw another entrance. That is where there is quite an extensive dinosaur exhibit. Also another one of mammals and several more. It's all very interesting. I think this would be a great activity for families with children of all ages (maybe not babies.) Plus, the building itself is fascinating. Plus, it is free to enter and there is free wifi inside. Please make the requested donation of five pounds per person so the museum remains accessible."
"Written July 14, 2018",Great ,Brilliant and free to get in (donation optional) building is beautiful. Lots of interesting things to see 
"Written July 11, 2018",Extensive collection would take more than one day to completely view,"We did a quick stop for an hour or two, just quickly perusing the entrance, the dinosaur exhibit, and the aquatic mammals section. All were very impressive, particularly the number of actual fossils (not just casts) on display within the dinosaur exhibit. The comparison between the blue whale skeleton in the entry and the life-size model in the aquatic mammals section was also fantastically striking. Well worth a visit."
"Written July 8, 2018",A fun day out for all ages,"I have been going to the Natural History Museum for 41 years. First with my son, then my grandson and now my foster grandson. All children love this place, all the bones, models and now the moving dinosaurs. I thought my teenage grandchildren would have grown out of this place, but they still love to go. It is a very fun educational place to go. Adults as well as children would enjoy going here. Easy to get to as well on public transport."
"Written July 7, 2018",Ms,I visited last week for the exhibition which was fantastic. What I was disappointed  with was the state of the toilets I don’t know what all the overseas visitors think. The bins inside the toilets were overflowing  . Some toilets were in a filthy state. Surely with the amount of visitors you could afford to have a attendant to keep them inspected. 
"Written July 19, 2017",The dinasour section is awesome for a toddler,"My daughter who is 3 years old loved the big dinosaur and did not want to leave. Thats the only section that we properly checked as we spent most of the day in the science museum. We also took her to their butterfly exhibition which was nice, but a bit small. I remember the butterfly farm in Stratford which was way more entertaining. It was still really good for my toddler. Would definitely go again. "
"Written July 12, 2017",Children can't get enough of the dinosaurs ,"Our children love the dinosaurs, but the other sections including outdoors nature play in summer are fantastic "
"Written June 23, 2017",Butterfly House ,"If you're in London take the time to go to the Natural History Museum Butterfly House. We lost nearly two hours watching them emerge from their chrysalis and others feeding and flying. It's hot in there, as many of the species are from the tropical rainforest. Cold water is sold in the shop as you leave. Can't rate this highly enough. "
"Written June 21, 2017",mammoth of knowledge! ,"An amazing museum to see, observe and develop an amazing understanding of variety of genres. The entry to the museum is free. The museum is broadly divided into several sections and one can visit the section depending upon convenience. Efforts have  been made to emphasise on activity based learning to inculcate a better understanding! Totally loved this place. If given a chance, shall surely come back :) "
"Written June 21, 2017",Must see!,I couldn't see it but my wife & 4yr old daughter visited it and loved it! It's huge with lots of interesting stuff for children too..
"Written June 9, 2017",Love this museum,"Everybody can explore the science behind the Aurora Pyramid of Hope, an unrivalled collection of 296 coloured diamonds. It was interesting to see the secrets of life and death in London over 5,000 years. 3 hours it's not enought to see all the exhibitions and attractions."
"Written June 1, 2017",Family-friendly top attraction ,A family-friendly museum and a-must visit. Free admission.  It has collections and exhibits including dinosaur skeletons and millions of specimens from around the world. They organised small group talk on specific topic. We attended the interesting session on butterflies.  There are charges for special exhibitions. Access via South Kensington station. 
"Written May 31, 2017",Love love love this museum,Had a good time walking the halls of this museum. Fascinating exhibits of dinosaurs and other extinct animals. Particularly love the volcanic displays and suppositions about how the world was created.
"Written May 26, 2017",Good Museum and entertaining!,"The Natural History Museum is a good museum but I would say it is more designed for kids than anything else. Make sure you consider this if you're planning on visiting a lot of museums in London and the time is short.They have great exhibitions but most of them are for kids to play and learn. And Don't get my wrong... adults can have a great time as well but considering my previous experience with other museums I know it will cause a great impact on children.They have awesome fossils and the Mammals section is great. Make sure you check the Darwin Center and the Whales exhibitions...The Gardens are simply great... beautiful place and the architecture, like many other London public buildings, is amazing!Admission is free but you can donate some pounds to this cool place if you like! You can move around the place and visit V&A museum and the Science Museum as well... they are located next to each other!You can get here by bus and by Underground (stop at South Kensington station) but you'll have to walk a little bit... not too much!"
"Written May 15, 2017",Dinosaurs a must see,Nice museum. Great dinosaur exhibits. Museum is free and houses educational exhibits. Several study areas. Mammals is another very nice display. 
"Written March 4, 2018",great,"I took my brother there and we really enjoyed the dinosaurs, as well as the earthquake simulations. Maybe not very exciting for adults, but very exciting for children up to 14. If you want to look at everything, it will take the whole day, there is so so so much to see. free entrance just like most other museums in London"
"Written March 2, 2018",Exploring London ,"This museum is amazing, you could spend hours in there. It would be an amazing place for  children and teenagers. It really is the most fascinating place"
"Written February 28, 2018",Great architecture and exhibits,You will want to come back here. Try late nights which happen every month. You can then walk with a glass of wine and listen to relaxing music in the background. Wonderful architecture. You can just sit there and admire. 
"Written February 25, 2018",Great afternoon at the Museum ,"A classic on a rainy day, but I have to salute the staff at the Museum for making the very long queue outside the museum under the rain so entertaining!  Our 7 years old son loved the museum. Thanks to the museum app which is available in both IOS and Android, we were able to select the trails and hence not miss out on what we absolutely wanted to see in a short period of time. The museum was very crowded but we still managed to enjoy it. The facilities were well managed, we had lunch at the T-Rex Grill inside the museum. "
"Written February 23, 2018",Absolutely Amazing! ,"Incredible! The national history museum was very interesting and it had so many different natural artefacts to learn about. From mammals and reptiles, to human evolution and human biology to minerals, plus so much more. The line was a bit long, but I guessed that was because it was the weekend. So if you have the chance, I would recommend going during the week."
"Written February 21, 2018","We are the Dinosaurs, Marching Marching","I can't attest to too many exhibits at the museum, but the Dinosaur exhibit and the other mammal exhibits near it were fantastic. There is a giant, roaring, T-Rex, and also a full sized Iguanodon. I took my four year old for a day trip and he was interested and engaged for about 2.5 hours.  We also had a snack at one of the many cafe's.  It is really nice that the museum has several cafe's; some large, some small.  Reasonable prices.  Good pastries. Very good coffees.  We really had a good time.  When we arrived the queue seemed very long, but the staff is very efficient and nice. We were inside in ""no time."" This is a highly recommended attraction; with or without children! Just go!"
"Written February 19, 2018",Not how I remembered it.,"Visited today and was totally dissapointed. This was the first time that have taken my 9 year old Daughter to the Meuseum and wish that I had mot bothered. Bearing in mind that the tourist seasons has not started yet the place was packed. We had to queue for 30 mins in the rain before the Grumpy old man outside let us in. We were greated on entry with machines and a Man standing by the £5 Donation Machines. Pleased to say that I did not Donate on the way in!! Straight away we could see the place was overcrowded. We walked to the Dinosaur exhibition and it was awful!! Just full of tall boards with pictures on. 1000's of people pushing you and it was ridiculously hot inside.We decided that perhaps we should try another section so headed over to the creepy Crawley hall. This was no better, infact it was very tired looking. The exhibition consists of worn out screens that don't work, a few specimens that are falling to pieces in thier displays. After a further 10 minuets of being trampled on by rude members of the public who have a inability to control thier children we gave up and made for the exit not bothering to see the rest of the Meuseum. Very dissapointed and ruined what had been a much looked forward to day out.They need to make the whole place more open. They passageways are far too narrow for the amount of people inside. "
"Written February 16, 2018",Nightmare!,"Should have expected it in February half term especially on a rainy day! Absolutely packed and people were still pouring in so after a couple of hours we decided to leave, there’s some great stuff to see but plan your visit wisely. We’ll return but try to pick a better time."
"Written February 13, 2018",Earthquake simulator was great,"There earthquake room was an eye opener.. obviously no where near as devastating if it were to happen for real but does give a better insight as to what happens.Amazing models of animals, full scale whales, wolves, deers.. worth a visit if you have a spare afternoon or even to spend a quick hour in here if you know where you're going "
"Written February 12, 2018","Noisy, unsupervised children made this place an absolute nightmare","The place was full of noisy, unsupervised children. By 'unsupervised' I mean that often their parents were there, but they indulged their offspring, allowed them to holler at the top of their voices, push in front of people and obscure their views of the exhibits. Entitlement on their part to the absolute uncaring regard of others. Surely this is not a good way to rear children?"
"Written February 12, 2018",Not impressed,"Apart from the dinosaurs which is free all the other exhibits were charged ! Far too many school trips , and not as good as I thought it would be ."
"Written February 1, 2018",A very crowded visit,Perhaps a bad day to visit as the children were on half term and it took over an hour to get in - choose your time to visit!! 
"Written June 2, 2018",A parents dream,We brought our 4 and three year olds to visit the dinosaurs and boy didn't they love it! We ended up visiting twice! Despite the size of the museum the children were excited and wanted to see everything. They loved the dinosaurs and to eat ast the T-Rex grill was a highlight our Dino loving boy.  We loved our day and wound recommend to anyone to visit. 
"Written May 27, 2018",Late nights are a hit,Decided to attend a late night opening at the Natural History Museum as a friend wanted to go. I had low expectations of a boring dull evening but how wrong could I be.The whole museum was open to visit but without the huge crowds normally seen. In addition we attended two free lectures which were very professionally arranged and highly informative. I will certainly go again and would recommend everyone to get onto the mailing list to see if any of the lectures are of interest to them. If so go and be ready to be amazed.
"Written May 26, 2018",Excellent,"It was crowded when we were here. Full with students from everywhere. Hence, the experience was not really fun. But, i must say, the displays were mesmerising. For those museum lovers, this is a must visit place!"
"Written May 5, 2018",Queues and unhelpful staff,Arrived today and queues were really long. I asked staff how long the excepted queue times would be and told 40-50 minutes. After an hour and still no where near the entrance gave up.Staff need to give members of the public the honest time wait so that we have an informed choice.
"Written April 12, 2018",Must see,This is a must see if visiting London. I could stay there all day.  Very suitable for kids. The museum is amazing!
"Written April 1, 2018",A must see when in London with kids,"After an early morning of traveling we decided to spend the afternoon wandering through the Natural History Museum. This probably wasn't the best idea since it is a very large space and the kids (especially our youngest) were pretty pooped. BUT, what a great natural history museum! We didn't explore the entire collection but rather focused on the earth displays, taxidermy and dinosaurs. Our son loves science and animals so he was in 'nerd-heaven'! Since the museum is free, we didn't feel like we absolutely had to see everything and could rather check out what our kids liked the best. Be sure to note that not all of the exhibits are free but the pay-to-see exhibits are still reasonable. Another tip - use the size entrance to avoid waiting in long queues at the front entrance!"
"Written March 31, 2018",the faster way to turn back time to your happiest childhood,"Anything I may write as a review won't describe the beauty of this museum neither the magic you can breath here. It is a magical place, where you can feel close to the most ancient history, to the stars and far away planets, to the many fascinating cultures of our richest humanity. I say, and I hope you can simply trust my word, if you go to London you just go visit this amazing museum. You won't regret it. If you're a lover of history just go. If you're a lover of antropology just go. If your soul can still feel wonder for the many incredible things we have in our universe, just go. If you're a child in heart just go.If you have children oh....they need to go there! It's a magical, wonderful, beautiful adventure in space and time. You won't regret it. I promise."
"Written March 19, 2018",Just wow,"I have been twice to London and every time I start my journey with this museum. It is free of charge and there is so much to see. Just go inside and you will be awed by the huge skeleton. And then just go on, get inside and you won't regret this museum visit. Oh, and as a bonus- it really looks like Hogwarts :)"
"Written March 19, 2018",What a treat for the young and old!,This place is a huge treasure trove of amazing things to see and experience! And it's free! Wow! We thoroughly enjoyed it! They also have a delicious cafe with reasonably priced food and tons of options for vegetarians. Must see in London! 
"Written March 6, 2018",That was marvellous,"With two 9 and 7 years old kids and mamy we amused for couple of hours. We have seen all things that the kids are taking in their school work. The museum is great and well structured and involve lots of information and aiding tools. It’s free, while coffee and food staff is a bit expensive. We amused ourselves to a great extent. ENJOY."
"Written January 30, 2018",My favourite childhood place has become a theme park.,"I am so sad to write this. I decided to book a hotel in London last weekend and revisit much loved haunts. It was raining and the queues along the road were daunting. Once in the museum, I was prepared for the beautiful elevated whale instead of Dippy... not prepared for the tacky information/reception desks plonked below it. The dinosaur section funnelled everyone into a dingy theme park style one way system, with more emphasis given to Ice Age films than the bones and original dinosaur reconstructions SHOCKINGLY covered in dust. The numbers in that confined area finally got to me and I had to leave. The Natural History Museum is an exquisite building. The exhibits are magnificent. Why are they displayed the way they are?"
"Written January 28, 2018",Dinosaurs and Blue Whale: a must for any child (and grown up children),"Excellent free museum.Security means a long process getting in, so come during the week if you can. The Dinosaur exhibition and Blue Whale jukebox were highlights."
"Written January 21, 2018",Dinosnores (Sleep at the museum) - not what I expected!,"I purchased the Dinosnores as a special Holiday present for our family knowing that my kids were on the older side for this (9 & 12).  I don’t know why, but I imagined a small group of families having a magical camping/explorer adventure in the museum.  Maybe I got that idea because Dinosnores had been sold out for months when I first tried to book it?  We arrived and were faced with typical London queues and masses of people (500) at registration for the event, including large school groups!  Not the cozy event I had wrongly expected.  Arriving in Hintze Hall, we were greeted rather coldly and condescendingly by one of the staff and assigned a sleeping spot.  I was so glad we had brought our own inflatable camping mats as they only provided yoga mats.  We then were ordered to go to our first activity.  I understand that an event of this size is a Health & Safety nightmare and needs clearly communicated rules, but the military style of our leader was really off-putting.  The first activity was a rules briefing and science presentation about dinosaurs which led into a torch-lit exploration of the fossil section.  This was cool and enjoyable, although my kids had figured out at this point that they were not the target audience and started having a bad attitude...We were then bossed around by our strict leader to the eating area to eat our home-brought snack.  She wouldn’t allow us to sit where we wanted to keep her assigned group together.  We just wanted a booth, but had to sit right next to it, at a table.Next we saw a very entertaining and well-presented science talk at one of the theatres in the museum.  The two female staff scientists were engaging and really good and we learned a lot.We really wanted to go to sleep at this point (23h) and should have, but felt that we wanted to get our money’s worth, so moved on to the third activity of the night: T-shirt drawing.  My kids sleepily drew a dinosaur on a shirt.I assume they do three activities to tire everyone out, so no one gets any silly ideas and just falls into bed at midnight.It was cold and extremely drafty in Hintze Hall and they woke us at 7am, when we had to immediately pack up camp and go to breakfast.  Definitely bring your own as the one they provide is disgusting.My family was so over-tired that they wanted to go home before the animal show, but I convinced them to stay if we left right after and if they didn’t “have to” explore the museum before it opens its doors to the general public.The animal show was good, but we were all sleep-deprived and wanted to go home.  I’ve learned that a good-night’s sleep is really important to my family and that my kids are too old for this kind of thing!All of us felt that it was not really worth it for our family.   I do think a more warm welcome would have made for a better experience."
"Written January 20, 2018",Great place to take the children,A wealth of displays that will interest/entertain any child (or adult).  With very helpful staff who will help you find your way around too.  Watch out for the queues at busy times.
"Written January 18, 2018",Bring back Dippy,I would enjoy it even more if they were to give back the stolen Parthenon Marbles. Moving Dippy the diplodocus was a mistake.
"Written January 7, 2018",A must see!,"The British Museum of Natural History is an absolute gem. To do this great museum justice, plan to spend the day. It's well worth the time."
"Written January 2, 2018",Educational museum with free entry,A very educational museum. Great for young and teenager children. Its a big museum that you can spend at least half a day there if you cover everything there. There's a donation box if you choose to donate.
"Written December 31, 2017",Very interesting ,I personally think that this place is wonderful for both adults and kids! You can easily spend a good 3 hours in here.
"Written September 27, 2017",Stunning and amazing.,"Looking at my watch as I reached the end of the exhibits I could not believe that over four and a half hours had flown by. Visiting the Natural History Museum was amazing, educational, fascinating and full of intriguing exhibits. I especially enjoyed the volcano, earthquakes, human ancestors, whales, dinosaurs, and giant sequoia exhibits. There are plenty of cafes so you can pit stop for a tasty scone with jam and clotted cream, like I did."
"Written September 21, 2017",What a let down.  A theme park pretending to be a museum,"This museum has so much going for it, with some world class exhibits, some not able to be seen elsewhere, and then ruins it by trying to be a theme park for attention seeking dumbed down kids.  How patronising.  The museum assumes we want to be entertained rather than educated.  Huge disappointment.  Cannot properly see important fossils, and important and culturally sensitive finds are treated like circus extras.  Will not go back while they treat me like a dumbed down TV addict."
"Written September 13, 2017","Amazing museum, not to be missed","I love a good museum and this is one of the greats! The building itself is so beautiful and you could probably spend a day just looking at the intricacies of the architecture and decoration of the stone work. You do need to have your bag searched on the way in but this is just a sign of the times and once you're in, it's not something you need to worry about again. (Personally I think it's a small price to pay to protect the safety of visitors and the priceless and historical exhibits)We spent 5 hours here and still didn't get to see everything but I would be so happy to go again. There are some ""copied"" exhibits but this didn't bother me so much as everything is so carefully cared for and laid out. There is a fountain of knowledge on so many subjects, I would have got lost for days reading every snippet of information. The stuffed animals can make you feel a little uncomfortable but I'm guessing that's why some of them are models. I have visited this museum previously as a child and remember it as a boring place with rooms full of bugs and stones on display but the improvements since then are amazing. Many of the displays are now interactive and some of the models move. They have clearly tried to make the museum more relevant and I believe they have achieved this while still remaining true to its roots. We didn't eat here but that was only because we had planned to eat elsewhere in London, not because it was to expensive or the food was unappealing. The toilets were clean and had attendants. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable.A great day, not to be missed!"
"Written September 3, 2017",Wonderful Place! ,"A beautiful and educational experience that provided something for everyone in the family. The exhibits were very thoughtfully and intelligently presented. The dinosaur exhibit will always be our ""forever favourite"" - don't miss it! "
"Written August 28, 2017",An iconic place for science and culture,There is a reason why the Natural History Museum has appeared in so many movies and pictorials. It is because it is a really really cool place. What a great place to visit. If you happen to have had a tinge of science in your background it is even better. This is an extraordinary repository of centuries of scientific effort. Many things are worth visiting. I suggest you make a bit of a plan as to the exhibits to visit because if you don't you will later have regrets about the cool stuff you missed! Get going there....it is a must.
"Written August 25, 2017",A Bit Stuffy,"An interesting museum, though I felt compelled to move quickly through the rooms just to avoid the crowds and mobs of young children. Having some geology schooling, I found the mineralogy section incredibly expansive and most educational. Exceptional curation."
"Written August 24, 2017",A fresh look at an old favourite ,"Having visited the museum many times, we expected the usual excellent visit. Surprisingly they have changed the entrance from the main hall to a side entrance which initially seemed odd until we entered. Wow. An escalator takes you I to a huge metal ball representing the ancient earth. This leads you into the section of the museum that deals with the natural Earth and the stars. Many of the exhibits have been refreshed to create what feels like a whole new museum. All previous visits with kids have started with dinosaurs and mammals,  leaving little time or energy for this excellent half to the exhibition. The change of entrance meant that even my 4 yr old son said the volcanoes were his favourite section. We spent more time in the museum on this visit than ever before and loved it."
"Written August 22, 2017",Free Day out ,"It's free, but gets crowded.  Lots to see. Children liked it, especially the sea animals.Expensive cafe & shop"
"Written August 19, 2017",Educational ,Love this place...its free but ..please support after by a donation...every little helps to keep it running 
"Written August 12, 2017",Avoid busy times if you can ,There can be no true criticism of this iconic museum. The collections date back to an historic period of adventure and exploration stored and presented in a piece of history itself of victorian architecture. Some of the very old displays are in fact more interesting than the more modern ones as they represent a time of study and disvovery in a world where exploration and information was in its infancy. This is a place where it would take multiple visits just to skim the surface of what's available. If you catch it early and during the week you'll be rewarded with a lack of queues and more time to take it all in. 
"Written December 29, 2017",Very interesting ,"Amazing and interesting. Saw the dinosaurs and venom exhibit. The whale was amazing. Too much to see for one visit. Big queue, but it moves fast, half hour wait. Worth it "
"Written December 22, 2017",Family day out,"It is free but they encourage you to make a minimum of £5 per person donation at the entrance. The range of exhibits are huge and to fully appreciate all, I suggest at least 3 hours. Some of the exhibits require paid tickets to enter. There are enough free exhibits around to spend your time there."
"Written July 5, 2018",great day out,"It's close to public transport, It's free, its big and interesting. Whats not to like about the NHM?We went for the wildlife photographer of the year exhibition which we had to pay to get in."

"Written June 30, 2018",Free and enjoyable,Thoroughly enjoyed this free museum. Not the most stimulating for adults but great for children. Some displays did however feel a little dated and in need of maintenance 
"Written June 30, 2018",Worth a visit!,Great dinosaur exhibit and overall a very nice natural history museum. Good value as it is free with a suggested donation of only 5 GBP
"Written June 25, 2018",Natural History Museum,This museum was a lot of fun! They have some great exhibits including a room which looks like a small grocery store. You can experience what it would be like during an earthquake while you are in the store. They have some awesome dinosaur exhibits also! 
"Written June 16, 2018",Fascinating “free” attraction in London,"Truly wonderful experience.  Just make sure you allocate enough time for it!  We allowed 3.5 hours and were a little rushed.  Lots of people but still easy enough to get around.Some fantastic exhibits, although some are getting dated now.  The “earth” area was great and human evolution good too.Free to enter but a little pressure applied to make a donation at the entrance. Personally paying £2 for a still water is donation enough!"

"Written June 2, 2018",Any science lover must visit,If you enjoy science you have to stop here. First of all the architecture is magnificent and out of this world. Most importantly though this great Natural History museum has a wide range of different exhibitions. It's fun and not overwhelming despite it's wide variety of exhibitions. 
"Written December 20, 2017",Very nice especially for children,Very nice museum.  I think more a child than an adults pleasure. A lot to do for the children and shops mainly have toys for them. Still worth the visit.
"Written December 19, 2017",Amazing building ,"The Architect that’s gone into this building is truly magnificent !  I found myself looking up at the building more than the history inside.   I have been a thew times now and always something new.  I can not believe it’s free to get in either,  so contribution towards the upkeep is always something I help towards.    You could spend your whole day in here if needed, it’s so big. The Dinosaur area really is amazing to see. At Christmas time the ice-rink is one of the best I have seen and very pretty with all the trees and centre piece lit up round the rink. No trip to London is complete without visiting this museum, and made even more special at xmas time. "
"Written November 10, 2017",One of the best Museum !!!,My visit to this museum was so pleasant! One of the best museum of neutral history I have been. I will recommend it. If you have children do not miss this museum. Your kids will love it!!!
"Written November 7, 2017",Longon gem!,It's the second time I go to the museum and I still enjoy it very much. Great for kids and adults of all ages. It is incredible how there can be a museum like this with free entrance! It is undoubtedly one of London's greatest attractions.
"Written November 5, 2017",Loved it!,"A must -visit. I'd say that if I had to visit only 1 museum, I'd pick the Natural History Museum. Also because I simply love the architecture of the building.  I was completely in awe. "
"Written October 10, 2017",Must go place! ,"It was the first place we visited in London and we spent almost a full day there. So much to see and really interesting exhibits. My son loved the experience. We went near Christmas season, there was an ice-skating rink on the ground of the museum. Highly recommended! "
"Written October 4, 2017",If you're looking for a new pram,This museum is insanely busy and there seems to be nothing in the way of ensuring too many people aren't crammed in. Once you see past that you see the below par exhibits. The dinosaur section was really poor in terms of the others I've seen across the UK and in Europe. In fact by far the most interesting experience was walking around the shop and flicking through books. The place just comes across as massively underfunded. I just don't see why they don't just charge a fee for non UK national tourists. Everywhere else in europe you spend 50 percent of your money on getting into museums. Plus it might make the museum able to create better facilities and exhibitions. So to sum it up. Go here if you want to spend an hour or two dodging prams whilst trying to have a look at below par exhibitions.
"Written October 3, 2017",Whale expedition ,First time in Natural history museum and I was amazed! Building architecture taken my breath away and when we entry it I lost my words too. Welcoming staff and amazing giraffe with its scallop - Wau! And it was just a beginning. We spend a lot of time in body expedition where we found too many interesting fact about our bodies. Whale expedition was unbelievable!! Everything so nicely organised and you can also play around with the bottoms ! Just perfect experience for us. Definitely will come back! 
"Written February 13, 2017",Disappointingly static,"Have to admit this was a huge disappointment. Growing up in Sydney this place had a huge reputation do we were really looking forward to taking the kids,but they hated it . It was hugely crowded with adults even on a sunny day with next to no kids which should have been a giveaway. Although it gets a tick for being free the displays were static and dull . Don't bother with primary school age kids"
"Written February 9, 2017",It might be alright if there weren't any children,"The museum is undergoing a large refurbishment. You are unable to orientate yourself because the main entrance is closed. The numbers of children make it impossible to enjoy, as you are almost shoved out of the way. I went there last as a child and really enjoyed the memories, but now it is not really adult friendly and to say we were disappointed is an understatement. It was hot and noisy, with children making progress almost impossible. The V&A next door is a 5* attraction, as is British Museum. The whole experience has left my wife and me totally disillusioned and we will probably never return. The problem seems to be that our museums are being transformed into an ""experience"" for one particular group, to the detriment of others. I will therefore content myself with gaining knowledge from books - you know those papery things with a binder down one edge!"
"Written February 5, 2017",Great space,With a number of other museums and definitely worth the visit as the space alone is beautiful and grand.
"Written January 24, 2017",Wonderful experience,Had a wonderful time in the museum especially the interactive portions of the museum. There is a lot to learn and see keep atleast 4 to 5 hours for your visit. I was not able to visit the photography exhibition that was going on but despite that there is enough to keep you busy. There are cafes and a restaurant inside to take rest in between the museum tour. All in all a very good experience and what makes it even better is that it is free to enter. :-)
"Written January 11, 2017",Fantastic Museum,Absolutely loved our visit to this museum. Artifacts are so well displayed and easy to view. Highly recommended.
"Written January 1, 2017",Must see for people that likes biology and natural sciences,"For people that likes biology this museum will be preferred from the British Museum. I think that both should be visited in your trip to London. Prepare to walk at least half day (10 am to 4 pm), no audio guides available but plenty of interactive attractions."
"Written December 15, 2016",Very good,"It was very interesting and I learned a lot!! I loved the part of the dinosaurs, there was a huge T. rex that moves!"
"Written November 27, 2016",Interesting!,Although it was very crowded and lots of kids I still enjoyed the exhibits at this museum.  Beautiful architecture too!
"Written November 27, 2016",A must visit,This museum is everything other reviewers have recommended or for. My only reservation is that because it's so popular it's sometimes tricky to actually see some of the exhibits because it's so busy. I'd recommend trying to find out it's quieter times especially in the paid for exhibitions. The photography awards exhibition was very crowded but also wonderful and the highlight of our visit.  
"Written November 27, 2016",Choose the visit time carefully,"Despite the review title, we didn't and it took about 30 minutes to get to the door (11 ish on a Sunday).The escalator through the earth's crust is smart. Quite warm and busy in the upper galleries though. Highlight has to be the diplodocus and the architecture in the room it's in. Truly stunning. The dinosaur exhibition area is brilliant and well worth a visit.Wear good shoes (for walking) and don't rush. You could easily spend a few days exploring the whole place.The cafes get busy but you can take your own food in. If you have the family it's a good way to eat."
"Written November 19, 2016",So big and exhaustive you would get lost,The Natural History Museum is really impressive. Everything you want to know about the diversity of wildlife through the ages is there. We couldn't see everything within 2 hours and had to go. And we want to come back see the rest. And you know what? It's free! But donate please.
"Written November 2, 2016","It's everything, literally. ",A truly amazing collection of our discovery of things over the ages.Check for school holidays as it can get very busy.
"Written November 1, 2016",Amazing just go there !,"Simply beautiful, amazing, if you like history this is the place for you. Also worth going there with your kids because of the T-Rex!And moreover, it's absolutely free !"
"Written October 27, 2016",Brilliant place for kids and adults.,"This is a fabulous free attraction near the Embassies. Plenty to see and explore inside and lots of local restaurants when you are tired. My 8 year old became upset at some of the stuffed animals, which I had not consider, so perhaps worth exploring with yours if you have sensitive children."
"Written October 16, 2016",Brilliant,"The best museum of its kind I've been to! An excellent collection of fossils, animals, rocks... I was only slightly disappointed with the 'Human' exhibition, which had nothing on display other than screens and interactive games for children."
"Written October 10, 2016","Fun for everyone, if you are lucky","A must see attraction in London, especially for families. You must allow for a minimum 30 minutes queuing during school holidays. The near CGI dinosaur in the Dinosaurs' area is well worth the visit in its own right."
"Written August 24, 2016",Nice museum but packed,We went to this very nice museum with our two little kids. We liked the impressive animated dinosaur. And the rest of the museum was very interesting. The earthquake simulator was great.
"Written August 23, 2016",Great! ,"There are loads of great exhibits in a beautiful building. There was quite a queue on Saturday afternoon (during school holidays) but it went down fairly quickly. I was also glad to see this was free as everything else in London seems very expensive. Very friendly, helpful staff. Good toilet facilities. "
"Written August 12, 2016",Huge... With a crowd to match,"There was a crush of people, especially at the popular exhibits, i.e. dinosaurs. Beyond the exhibits, I really like the architecture and layout of the halls. Would love to spend an entire day here... if only my legs could take it (& if I didn't plan to visit the neighbouring museums)."
"Written August 10, 2016",Amazing place and great for kids too,What an amazing place this is. Alone or with children this is an amazing place to visit with plenty of things to see and do. I would definatly recommend going to look around and spend a happy few hours 
"Written August 9, 2016",Great for the Family!,"My children love the dinosaur exhibit!  It's changed in the past year.  It's more accessible to and easier to walk through, but not as fun as the original! Go early or late.  If you have a stroller (buggy) use the entrance on the exhibition row as there is a lift (elevator). The best cafeteria is in the middle of the museum (Benugo).  It has a good selection of food beyond just sandwiches! visit multiple times.  So much to see.  Don't attempt to see the whole museum in one day. "
"Written August 4, 2016",nice building,"The building itself is the real star here.  The exhibitions and displays are good, but there are so many people there, it is hard to really enjoy them.  Nice free (donation requested) activity."
"Written July 27, 2016",Celebration Party,One of the best nights of our life in the graduation ceremony of our MBA at LBS. It is very recommended to attend a night event in the museum and not just the regular daily visit.
"Written July 26, 2016","If you could only see one museum in London, let it be this one!","I have many fond memories of visiting this museum as a child, and now that I take my own children there I still think it is possibly the best museum in London! The dinosaur bone collection alone is worth the trip! The building is stunning! The exhibits are amazing! The entire museum is just fantastic! ...and it's free! We are so lucky to have this beautiful museum, and impressive collection, here in London! If you are planning a trip to London, make sure you visit this museum, not to mention that you have the brilliant Science Museum, and the wonderful Victoria & Albert (V&A) museum right next door! Be advised though, the queues outside can be very long during peak periods!"
"Written July 21, 2016",I couldn't beleive that it is free!,"Just next to the A&V museum (interesting medieval artefacts) and Science museum (fantastic), this is a great place to visit for free in London. Reserve some 2-3 hours for visiting, there are a lot of great things to be seen."
"Written June 14, 2016",Kids loved it!,"The dinosaurs are of course the main attraction here but having just been back from Iceland, my kids totally enjoyed the section on volcanoes and earthquakes. My boy also loved the section on how the earth has evolved. Great exhibits, educational and entertaining at the same time. Try the entrance at exhibition road instead of the main entrance. It usually has a much shorter queue."
"Written May 24, 2016",Membership has great benefits!,"I wanted to extol the virtues of membership of the NHM. I am a single father with 2 pre teen children, so the usual family (2+2) deal for the paid exhibits does not work for me. However, membership definitely does. The biggest advantage is that for the subscription fee of £61, not only do I get into the paid exhibitions free, but I get 10 free guest passes. So membership paid for itself in 3 trips! We have been to the amazing wildlife photographer of the year and Otherworlds exhibitions twice, and are going next to the butterfly experience. You also get to jump the queues; don't have to book time slots, and get the NHM magazine, that the children love. A great way to save money and support the museum!"
"Written May 23, 2016",A beautiful and interesting place for people of all ages!,"Arrived on a weekday about 11am. Many, many people queuing to go in. There were many others already inside. But everyone was considerate and orderly.In the great hall just as you enter the museum is the fossil of a T-rex! Obviously everyone was trying to take a picture of it or with it.The great steps behind with a huge white statue of Charles Darwin was also a photo pit stop.Even small kids were fascinated with the collection. The seniors were equally spellbound with all the exhibits.Dinosaurs! Mammals! The workings of he human anatomy! Some many rooms to explore! Many hours to spend here!Free-of-charge! No entrance fees! Donations are most welcome!"
"Written May 9, 2016",Something for everyone,"I was thoroughly impressed with this Museum. There are numerous exhibits, it is informative and interesting, some thing for all ages. There is fee to enter just a donation."
"Written May 6, 2016",Excellent ,Visited the wildlife photography exhibition. Not a museum person but was pleasantly surprised at the place and exhibition. Loads of other things to see as well and some nice cafes in the museum.
"Written May 1, 2017",Every time with new eyes,Considering the huge lots of culture you get for free in a neat and tidy place I can only recommend that everyone visits the Museum. Couple of hours will do if in a hurry.
"Written April 30, 2017",Very good free museum,"Like many other London museums, this one is free. Special exhibits have a fee. Highlights include the dinosaur exhibit, which includes some of the most complete skeletons and a T-Rex and other dinosaur animatronics; a simulation of the 1995 Kobe Japan earthquake, and many hands-on displays throughout. Multiple gift shops and eateries on premise. Can get very crowded. It was a good rainy day stop for us. As others have said, the line/ queue to enter can be VERY long, but do not be deterred. It does move very quickly and is relatively painless. World class museum."
"Written April 27, 2017",Great for kids,"Dinosaurs section is a must, but other sections are also very good. If you go with kids, I recommend to go as soon as it opens at 10, since the queue got a bit longer when we were leaving and you need a couple of hours to visit everything."
"Written March 20, 2017",Beautiful place but deserve more maintenance!,Building is just amazing! It is very complete museum but pity how some parts are full of dusty. Need it more maintenance! 
"Written March 18, 2017",Great free museum!,I loved the Dodos and all the fossils.  Definitely worth a visit.Free entry- near south kensington station.   Great museum store too.  Moon rock in a small display in the entryway.
"Written March 16, 2017",Phenomenal and Immense Museum,"This old museum of ancient delights has the cathedral-like 1880 Victorian building which is an unforgettable landmark. This architectural wander’s columns crawl with carved monkeys imaginatively clinging to the terra-cotta and floras sidling across ceiling panels. If you visit London this a must visit place, charming and incredibly huge museum.Few tips that could be helpful for a great visit :1.	The quickest way to get to the museum is to go to South Kensington station by London Underground and it is about five minutes' walk away.2.	Skip the main Cromwell Road door and use the small entrance on Exhibition Road, as it’s the quietest and step-free. 3.	The best way to skip the crowds is to arrive early in morning.4.	The Cromwell Road entrance leads to Dinosaurs, Creepy Crawlies, the Blue Whale, the Darwin Centre and the Wildlife Garden.5.	The Exhibition Road entrance is closer to Volcanoes and Earthquakes and the giant Earth model.6.	The new Darwin Centre has 22 million insect and plant specimens are takes nearly 17 miles of shelving.7.	Visitors under 7 years can take advantage of a FREE Explorer Backpack near the entrance of the Central Hall (must have valid I.D.). Included are kid-size binoculars and explorer’s hat, an activity booklet, magnifying glass, drawing kit, recording sheets and clipboard, plus clues to help complete a challenge.8.	School-age children ages 5 to 11 years can purchase self-led discovery guides with challenges and discussion topics for £1 each, also at the visitor’s information desk in the Central Hall.9.	You can take a free behind-the-scenes tour which last about 45 minutes. Numbers are limited, need to book at the information desk in the Central Hall.10.	Check the afterhours events, including evening gallery tours, night safari, late Fridays (extended hours, with snacks and drinks available - every last Friday of the month, excluding December) and even sleep-overs in the Natural History Museum.11.	Entry is free, but you need to buy a ticket for the IMAX Theatre, flight simulators and some special exhibitions."
"Written March 9, 2017",Absolutely great!,"Went there with my granddaughter, 3 years old, she was enchanted with the dinosaurs, the big whale and, even with the spiders. The big stair going through the center of the Earth was also very good, we had to go up many times.It is an amazing place to make children get  interest in science.Recommend for sure!"
"Written February 20, 2017",A Sunday outing,"From the queuing at the side entrance onwards it turned into a location from hell! People don't have any level of courtesy left in them, we were pushed, shoved and bearded through the exhibition areas like 'Penguins in s huddle'. If you wanted to stop you were shoved, if you tried to get close to an exhibit you were moaned at and if you tried to pause then all hell broke loose around you for being so inconsiderate. People with pushchairs use them like pathfinder rams to make headway and most of the time they are empty. The museum is clearly trying to fit as many people through the doors as possible but to the detriment of visitor experience. DO NOT VISIT ON THE WEEKEND... "
"Written February 20, 2017",Free day out,"We visited the last day of half term and got there for opening time and queued for around five minutes to get in. ( FYI on the way out the queue was HUGE and they were staggering entry).Overall we had a lovely day, the museum itself while grand and iconic.. we felt a little disappointing.Lots of displays were models or casts and generally it lost its authenticity. We did enjoy parts especially as some were relevant to DD school studies.Don't think we will be visiting again, although this time the Dippy was out on tour so maybe...Also the display cases and cabinets were quite dirty some with THICK layers of dust.. toilets also quite grim. We always take a picnic but passing through the cafe a small child's lunch box £5, cans of drink £2, grapes £2.75! Very dearNHM.. overall you could do better. Average rating "
"Written February 15, 2017",Educational and entertaining!,A must visit for people of all ages (& kids too!). Extremely interesting and well laid out with a great cafeteria too!
"Written February 16, 2015",Top Tips To Beat The Queues In School Holidays,"I visited with my two teens during Febuary half term, the first tip I have is to beat the initial queue to get in, go round to the side entrance next to the science museum, this has significantly shorter queues, if you want to be able to walk through the front entrance then do so as you exit to save time ! Once we were in the museum there was a queue of over an hour for the dinosaur exhibit, not many people know this but you can actually pre book a dinosaur gallery visit for free online during school holidays, online booking usually opens about a week before the holidays, you get a booking code and can walk to the front of the queue to the annoyance of everyone in the queue ! The dinosaur gallery is the most popular exhibit in the museum and really is a must for families, following the tips will keep you sane and avoid those ""how long"" questions."
"Written February 14, 2015",fantastic museum,"fantastic museum and worth visiting, especially if you have kids.  Time saving tip…if there is a long line at the Cromwell Street entrance as there was when I went there (massive line winding all the way back to the street from the front door) simply walk around the corner to the Exhibition Street entrance and chances are there is no line at all and you can walk straight in.  Definitely try and avoid school holidays if you can as it is really busy."
"Written January 24, 2015",For all dinosaur and nature enthusiasts!,"I have been going to the NHM for years - as a child, then to take various nieces and nephews and finally with my own children. It was and remains a brilliant day out.  First of all, the outside of the building is beautiful, just look for all the statue creatures around the tops.  Once inside, the dinosaur section is as good as you would want it to be.  After that, we like the natural world section which is opposite. A couple of tips...It gets very busy and it is well worth going at opening time.  If there is a big queue at the front then there is also a side entrance next to the Science Museum. Once inside, make sure that you do the dinosaur part first as that gets busy very quickly and there is often a separate queuing system for that.  The shop is a little expensive but there is a good selection.  The best shop is opposite the insect/bug section."
"Written December 13, 2014",National History Museum Ice Skating rink,Came here after Winter wonderland cancelled (and refunded) our tickets (due to unusually warm weather they said!)...This place is just Awesome! If ur not on time u can miss out on 10 mins of skate time due to the queue...5*
"Written December 3, 2014",My favourite place ever.,"Please bare in mind I am a fossil and natural history enthusiast. I think I have included most of the facts towards the end. Whenever I have a bit of free time in London I go to the NHM mostly alone because I like a good hard long look at everything, and then some. Even before you go inside you notice the architecture is fabulous and the stone work has been greatly considered and designed. Talking of stone work, my favourite bit is the geology section located on the 2nd floor (I think). The diamond display is awesome, some of them light up fluorescent under uv light. Also in this section I learned that chalk is comprised of planktonic skeletons, when you write on a chalk board just remember you are writing with thousands of compressed bones from sea fairing organisms from back in the day. I digress.The only problems with NHM is that there are only 24 hours in the day, the 2nd problem is sometimes the toilet facilities get quite busy.You can see newly extinct species like the dodo from their fabulous taxidermy range. Not on sale in Primark. The fact that they're at the museum is truly wonderful. But, looking at its' body you realise you are looking at one of the last preserved dodos in existence, that's the bit that makes me sad.Natural science is absolutely invaluable to the progression of human kind and this museum has taught me so much through the years. Their exhibitions are incredible if you manage to catch a good one. If you can go to the after hours that's the one you want.10/10 I love it! It's not for everyone but everyone will find something they like about the NHM."
"Written October 13, 2014",Worth the visit. Very crowded,Visited the museum while in London with our 8month son. We waited for around 20minutes in the rain to enter the museum. We didn't want to miss it and didn't have time to return if we had left. The exhibits are really interesting. We walked around the museum with our baby in the stroller with no major issues.The only problem we noticed was that the various themed halls had only one door to be used as an entrance or exit. This creates some issues since the museum is usually quite crowded. Having the stroller with us somehow got us more space to move around and people helped us. The dinosaurs are of course amazing. The huge whale is amazing. I can't think of something not interesting. You can spend hours in the museum but the whole ambience and the crowd don't really allow you to enjoy the whole experience. I guess when our son is older and if we return to London we will revisit the museum for him to enjoy the exhibits.
"Written August 26, 2014",Geology Museum,"Back in the day the Geology Museum used to be a separate entity around the corner from the Natural History Museum.  At some point it was subsumed by it's larger neighbour.  However, it still maintains a separate entrance which does not suffer from the huge queues of the Natural History Museum.  The Geology Museum still maintains its separate exhibits and areas.  It's incredibly interesting, particularly the exhibit of the evolution of the earth.  The interactive earthquake is fun whilst the precious jewels section is stunning.  It is much more manageable than the Natural History Museum and a lot less crowded, even during school holidays.  As a treat, I suggest the self-service restaurant across the road at the Victoria and Albert Museum."
"Written August 24, 2014",Very disappointing,"I had wonderful memories of visiting as a child but taking my own son was a very disappointing experience. We queued to get into the museum itself and fought our way through the crowds to the dinosaur exhibit, where we were very disappointed to find we had to queue again. What was worse was that this queue was basically the exhibit -- you just stand in a big line shuffling slowly past the bones. It felt like a very unimaginative, old-school approach to a supposedly world-class museum exhibit.We gave up and went next door to the Science Museum instead, where we walked straight in and had a fantastic time with all the hands-on, interactive exhibits. Maybe someone from the Natural History Museum should pop round to their neighbour and learn a few things?"
"Written August 17, 2014",A Totally Enjoyable day,The city should be so proud of this beautiful building! Its an absolute treasure Staff are pleasant and very helpful! Its contents are visually stunning and there I so much to take in it also demands a second visit!
"Written August 15, 2014",Appalling,"If I could give it no marks I would. We were prepared for a queue and to deal with rainy weather but to be treated with the total lack of care was a shock. At a very early point in the queuing process we were approached by people selling membership to allow fast tracking (£83 for a family for a facility that is meant to be free to enter). We had queued for almost an hour and were waiting in the square with a lawn when we realised that at the rate of progress we were making it would be another hour before we would get inside.  As we left the queue we passed the main entrance and noticed that there appeared to be no queue nearby. We were told that there had been a fire alarm and when I complained to a member of staff that we had been held in a queue in the lawned square for nearly an hour with no information about the fire alarm, the additional waiting time and in general both staff members were obviously completely unaware that there were any people queuing there at all. Complaint was met with the stock answer that ""we are sorry but we are extremely busy"". Our experience throughout was similar at other ""attractions"" in London. Long queues and a fast track process to rip off the public that when I inquired further meant only a 10 minute saving of time at the London Eye. How did London stage a successful Olympic Games? If those jokers can do it so could anybody. "
"Written May 6, 2016",Amazing ,"If you mention London, a lot of people will suggest going to the NHM. It's honestly amazing. Very informative, entertaining and interesting. Check the website for any special exhibitions. The museum is free but some of the limited exhibitions cost. The best bits were the mammal fossils, the blue whale made to scale (it's the size of the room!) and of course the dinosaurs. We went on a Friday afternoon, and the place was busy. I've been on a bank holiday and its insane how busy it gets. So if you're visiting during the holidays try to get there early! "
"Written April 2, 2016",Brilliant day with staff on the ball for kids with Autism,Took my 2 teenage girls and 10 yr old boy (ASD) one of the best places I have ever been for staff having awareness.  Allowed us to stand in quiet spaces when queues were too much. Suggested quieter routes. Asked what they could do to help. Told us who to approach for additional support if we needed it. Even personally escorted us from one gift shop to another as the bag we wanted to buy wasn't in main shop.. you may see this as not losing a sale.BUT... the man that escorted us was BRILLIANT with my son...to the point that he walked through the main hall full of people laughing and talking about gaming. Every person from security to canteen has at least a basic knowledge of autism.. WELL DONE NHM xx
"Written March 29, 2016",Amazing.,"First of all i would like to mention the staff. Our son has Autism & queing for a long time can be very difficult. I sent an email before hand asking about this & we where taken to the front of the very long que straight away on showing our letter.What a fantastic place to visit. So informative & especially if you are interested in the most amazing creatures that walked on our planet, the Dinosaurs. Amazing fossils, especially the Triceratops. Incredible. Bring your kids asap."
"Written March 17, 2016",A Banquet for the Senses,"The first wonder was the lovely façade of this highly decorative museum. The vaulted entrance hall is fabulous, and not only because of the dramatic recreation of the gigantic dinosaur skeleton.The galleries are vast and their content is superb. We enjoyed spending time in all. The Red Zone containing a journey through the Earth is most impressive. The coverage of the natural forces shaing the earth is very well done. We savoured what seemed to be a very realistic rendition of the effects of an earthquake on a Japanese supermarket.The Darwin Centre and cocoon are remarkable. It was great descending and taking in the details on butterflies and insects, with the descriptions from the scientists an added bonus.The Human Biology section exhibits were impressively presented and informative. The mammals displays were interesting, including the unfortunate dodo."

"Written November 19, 2015",Wonderful experience,"Visited here thinking I could have a quick look around and head off again, but to my amazement the place is so big and there are so many areas to cover. I got so engrossed in all on display as it was all fascinating that I ended up spending many hours here. Both young and old would enjoy a day out here. There is no charge at the door but it is recommended you leave a donation of £5.00 which is very little considering the amount of time one could spend in here."
"Written November 12, 2015","Exciting visit to this museum, built for this purpose in the 19th century.","This is a dream come tru museum for a child, very accurate in the positioning and description of items exposed. Spend at least 2,50 in there. Please consider it is always crowded."
"Written October 28, 2015",Bones and more,I visit the Natural History Museum every time I come to London. Each time I take a look at a different area of the museum. I am always amazed at the vast collection of specimens and artifacts. I like the way they present things in a way which makes sense in telling the story of species. I appreciate the care and professionalism of the staff. Always helpful in answering questions. I will return the next time I am in London. 
"Written October 12, 2015",Lovely way to spend the day and learn,"I spent a lovely Sunday at the Natural History Museum with my six year old niece. The star attraction amongst the kids seems to be the dinosaur collection. There are plenty of interesting exhibits that both kids and adults will enjoy. You can spend at least five hours here.. Would definitely recommend this place on a cold, rainy day."
"Written October 3, 2015",Ideal for kids,Need to allocate at least one full day to enjoy the museum. We started at the Jurassic/dinosaur section as it gets crowded and warm. We enjoyed it immensely and learned a lot from the exhibits. Wish we had more time to cover the entire museum. 
"Written September 22, 2015",First traffic jam museum experience,"The collection in this museum is probably fantastic, there was only no way of getting near any of the displays. On a rainy day in the holiday season: do not even think about going here. The place was packed, the children (all 6000 of them) seemed to be screaming. The energy in one phrase: nobody who was here, really wanted to be here."
"Written September 20, 2015",Spent 4 hours and didn't see 100% of it,"It's enormous, very diverse, quite exciting for adults and kids alike. The best part - it's free (together with Science Museum and V&A). A must have, definitely! Plan at least a day for this and science museum. Plan 2 days if you plan to do V&A as well."
"Written September 2, 2015",Awful,"We arrived mid afternoon and saw a queue for the dinosaur room which we joined, thinking it wasn't too long and we would be in and out in no time.  After an hour in the queue, (the museum is very hot with no ventilation or fans to keep you cool and no signs to tell you how long the average time it would be), we got into the room, its was a great exhibition but there are no staff on hand atall once on the raised platform to assist or move people on who are taking photographs of the displays.  Also once you are on there, there is no exit off so you have no choice but to follow it round.  Part way round I started feel ill with the heat, but I had to keep following the slow queue of people round, unfortunately people were very reluctant to move.The displays were very good and I was impressed with them, however there was a lack of staff and ventilation which ruins the whole experience.  If you have children I would make sure they have sufficient drinks and things to keep them occupied in the queue otherwise by the time you get to the exhibition they will be agitated, from what I experience from other families.That was the only exhibition we saw as we had to get out as soon as possible to get some fresh air.  Sorely disappointed as other museums we visited were better organised."
"Written August 26, 2015",Really beautiful museum,"Just  walking  up  to  this  building  will  put  you  in  awe. The  architecture is stunning. When  you  walk  in you're greeted  by  Dippy, the  dinosaur skeleton. I would  suggest  going  to  the  earth  oriented  part-as  in  the  planetary section and  earth's natural disasters  as well as  the  geological  mineral and  rock  exhibit.  In  this  area,  they  have  an earthquake  simulator platform mimicking the same  quakes felt by the Kobe earthquake. Just riding the  escalator up  to  these  exhibits through  the  giant  earth is  awesome "
"Written August 21, 2015",It was hot and crowded beyond measure.,"It was beyond hot. After an hour my clothes were sticking to me. People were sitting by the bathroom red faced, looking like they were about to pass out fanning themselves. We only made it to the first floor. We could hardly see anything because there were so many people in the way. You couldn't move without bumping into someone or stepping on a kid. We stayed an hour then left. My kids and I did an online tour of a museum in the United States and didn't see anything in the museum that we didn't see in the online tour. Highly disappointed! I enjoyed walking around the parks down the road more than this museum."
"Written August 13, 2015",Wow!,"Never been to a museum like this one.  Unfortunately only allowed 2 hours to look around but will come back again.  A free museum that has loads of exhibits and information.  The dinosaurs of course, were a hit with the kids (10 & 12).  Staff were really friendly and helpful (when we got lost).  Came out of school holiday time and arrived as the gate opened, we were inside within 10 minutes.  Quite a few school groups  roaming around but not so busy."
"Written August 10, 2015",Plan ahead to make the most of your visit with young children,"We are based 2 and a half hours away from this museum by train but have made several trips with our young children - now 4 and 6.  We find it a very visitor friendly space: crowded yes, overwhelmingly so? No.  For us the trick is not trying to do it all in one visit.  There are 4 zones and we concentrate on 2 each visit - about 2 hours worth - and then pop next door to the Science Museum for another couple of hours. We always do it this way round because for some reason the queue to get into the NHM is way longer and build during the day.  No queue at the SM at 1pm on Saturday 8 August!  Personally I find the food & drink here expensive as I don't live in the South and still think £2.55 for a cup of tea is extortionate.  We take picnic lunch and eat in the designated picnic areas in each museum (not in the actual galleries). I recommend the one in the basement of the NHM. Well laid out, spacious, clean, cafe next to for tea and coffee etc.  The kids activity book is £5 and can be bought instead of a donation as the whole profit goes to the Museum (win/win).  It has a map, stickers, facts etc and helps carry on the adventure at home.  Hope this helps you enjoy the day as much as we did :)"
"Written May 27, 2014",Excellent educative visit!,Take your children to a journey back in time in the dinosaurs' room or amaze them with a visit in the mamals' room! A perfect way to spend a great Sunday.
"Written May 10, 2014",Average ,"Exhibits are good, although the mammals and animals section seemed very dated and not well kept, like it was forgotten about. The dinosaur section isn't worth a 30 minute queue to see a trex. It's ok.... "
"Written April 12, 2014",Do visit dinosaurs and the Vault!,"On entering into the museum, a huge dinosaur fossil greets us. The architecture of this place looks like a scene from harry potter so we were busy snapping photos.Likely many major museums, this place is huge and 1 day is definitely not sufficient to see every gallery. So minimally, go for the dinosaurs and the Vault!It is especially crowded during weekends.Highly recommended for a visit!"
"Written March 20, 2014",So disappointed,"Visited several times over the past 40 odd years and we were so disappointed this time that we won't be back.My husband and I  visited with my parents and it was always a pity to leave, we visited with our son and we always wished we could stay longer, this time we allowed ourselves a minimum of four hours and left after an hour and a half. The building is a beautiful structure - and from the outside is as glorious as it ever was, but the inside is awful, mainly because it needs a darned good clean, the stonework and floors are a disgrace. The dinosaur hall is overpowered by the walkway that now dwarfs the exhibits - probably great for children because there is a maze of printed information on huge boards which would hide the dinosaurs if you happen to be  on the ground  and only three feet tall. The moving dinosaur is a trifle 'theme park' and the shrieks of the children does nothing for the atmosphere.We really didn't seem to find as much to look at as we used to - some of the mammals look more like cuddly toys than the ones we are accustomed to seeing in zoos - I'm sure I remember cases of butterflies and other insects, too, and if there were birds I didn't find them. There is a new 'state of the art' building  - the actual purpose of which  I haven't exactly been able to discover, but it appears to have been taken over by sponsors primarily from the pharmaceutical industry. It's all very self congratulatory but not my idea of informative to any degree.The young man who searched my bag was most polite and charming - what a pity the same could not be said for two other employees I spoke to - total indifference to the point of rudeness aptly describes one of them. The geology section was the only area which appeared the same - but then stones, precious or otherwise are not renowned for change once they have been put in a cabinet. We felt that the museum has lost its way - that some 'bright young thing' has been tasked with bringing it into the 21st century, All well and good but in trying so hard to fit in with the future the museum has lost its wonderful past."
"Written January 26, 2014","Terrible, dated information - busy","Ok so London is busy fair enough and we had to queue in the rain for awhile but overall I was excited to visit the museum. How disappointing though. The whole place was over run with parents that had no idea where there child were, or holding a crying baby next to your ear when trying to read about an exhibit , or a pushchair in your legs..... But then the exhibits themselves ate aimed at children or thickos! It explains things like a child's text book with no real valuable information , the exhibits themselves look tired and anyone that listened at school won't learn a thing. I was totally shocked at the style of some of the exhibits they were hilarious an Old tv screen showing a 1980 clip of a monkey . Or a photo to fool your mind ! And even a plastic crab ? Quite sad really. Now I enjoy an old style museum with an item and an explanation write up not just a few words , and then an interactive question- aimed at children. Maybe it shouldn't be free anymore and they should update the info.   "
"Written November 13, 2013",Dreadful dino experience,"I love the Natural History Museum. I spent 12 years in a school literally across the road from it, and have spent countless happy hours in this fantastic place. But, I beg of you, don't waste your time on the dinos. Had foreign visitors who wanted to see the dinosaurs. Key tip: Book a timed entry ticket online - if you do, you will skip the awful sweaty crowds outside. Good news: These timed tickets are FREE. Bad news: You won't have skipped the sweaty crowds INSIDE the dino pen. And 'pen' is the right word. I saw more human armpits than dinosaurs during our miserable tour. My foreign guests then apologized for making us go through with it!"
"Written June 4, 2013",Go if you're in London!,Love it here! Great central location! I love the T-Rex at the front an the Earthquake simulation! Building is beautiful too!
"Written January 20, 2013","Dinosaurs, Minerals, Darwin - Oh my!","I loved visiting this museum. Lots of kids here, for school projects and such. Made it feel very lively. Great place to come visit if you're in London with your family. It's free! They have a small cafe, kinda expensive so if you can wait, pop in here and then leave and have lunch elsewhere. Otherwise maybe just a quick snack here.They do have a coat and bag charge so depending on how much time you have, you might not want to check your coat in. No charge for the loo - woo!"
"Written January 17, 2013",Fun & fact all under one roof,"This was my first visit to the natural history museum.  I had a day in London whilst my husband was on business.  Usually I would have some retail therapy.  However on this trip I decided to have a cultural trip. When  I arrived from the tube, I walked in with a group of school children.  I did have some trepidation that I wouldn't get to see the exhibits due to the volume of visitors.  However there was plenty to see.  This is an amazing place for children as there are plenty of activities and interesting things to see.  I would highly recommend this museum."
"Written November 10, 2012",Poor,I was expecting more from the museum but it was terribly dull. My 4 year old son had nothing interactive to do which meant that he was very bored. I should have known there was a reason the museum was free. I won't be returning!!
"Written April 25, 2015",More Time,"London is awesome.  Need more time.  Some locations have long, long corridors.  The day I bus hopped to the museums I walkes.  Over 10 miles in one day.Need to pace self for the trip and be aware of delays due to lines."
"Written April 20, 2015",WOW,Been to the smoke many times before yet never visited.....what a error!Will be going back again and again!Great place to visit please don't make the same error as I had and visit soon.
"Written April 18, 2015",Dino Snores for Adults,"We've just spent the night at the NHM for this event. From the moment we walked through the doors to the moment we left this morning, we couldn't have asked for a more fantastic experience. To sum up: the staff were great and so passionate about their jobs and the museum itself, the building was a magical backdrop for the exhibits, the entertainment was so enjoyable and relaxed, we could take part in as much or as little as we liked, everything was so geared to giving us a wonderful experience and we couldn't have asked for more. The exhibits themselves were very well displayed and looked after.  As a side note, we had seen Chi Chi and Guy at London Zoo when we were children, and to see them exhibited again, although sad in some ways, was a happy trip back for us.The food was very tasty and plentiful, as was the tea and coffee. Being able to wander through the galleries at night with very few people was a dream come true, and then watch Jurassic Park at 3am was almost surreal. There was a harpist playing the most beautiful music for a couple of hours and so we all were able to relax and soak up the atmosphere whilst laying in our beds looking at Dippy! You must put this experience on your top ten of things to do ever!"
"Written April 10, 2015",A Great Time.,"Took my son here and we loved it.  Got there a bit before 10 and joined the long line.  However, once the place opened, the line moved quickly and we were soon inside. We immediately went to the Dinosaur exhibit and later were so glad we did this first, as the line for that grew immensely over the morning.All of the exhibits were great and my son immersed himself into the different halls.  I know in the end we did not see everything, but I'm sure we will return again to explore more."
"Written April 1, 2015",Headache inducing,"Pros: Beautiful building Fab displays and facts Free Cons: The queues were simply horrendous. Particularly annoying are people generating more queues by taking selfies with the dinosaurs. Soooo irritating The dinosaur queue is not worth it. Felt like a feat of endurance to make it to the robotic trex. Then, once there, you can't stop, cos it makes a bottle neck. Kids screaming / crying /charging around. Can't read the placards if you wanted to. I agree with another reviewer: make an adults only day!!! Nothing wrong with the museum / displays / curators. It's just all about the volume of people spoiling the experience"
"Written March 29, 2015",Must see Museum,Go to see the beautiful building and the dinasours. But once you are inside there are lots of things to see and explore.Remember the treasures and the enormous tree at the top of the stairs.Can be crowded. Free entrance.
"Written March 13, 2015",Very interesting,"Went here to fill some time, and it was free. We looked through the Blue Zone (the dinosaurs and then human biology). Both were very interesting. There were many dinosaur fossils which were very interesting, and a lot of information about them and the lives they would have lived. Human biology was quite interesting, and the part about vision/perception was fun. I think it would be a great place for families, and I would also recommend at least half a day, if not more (we only had about 4 hours, but we do like to take our time and read everything)."
"Written March 10, 2015","Really crowded, but interesting. Check out stone creatures on the outside of the building!","I like that the Natural History Museum (and many museums in London) are free. Then I feel like I don't have to see every last thing in the museum to get my money's worth.  The Natural History Museum was super-crowded the day we were there. It was really crowded on the walkway that is above the dinosaur exhibits.  And I have to vent: I don't mind that people take photos in museums, but it drives me crazy when they take the photo and stand there to post it. And stop it with the selfies in museums. It is rude to the rest of the people there. But, back to the museum itself...The building is amazing.  Especially take a good look at the outside, where there are sculptures of all kinds of creatures.  I loved the inside with the huge atrium, and of course the wonderful sculpture of Charles Darwin at the top of the steps. Check out his eyes, they are so lifelike.  There is tons of wonderful things to see in the museum, so enjoy. When you need a pick-me-up, they have a nice cafe for scones, coffee, tea etc."
"Written February 25, 2015","Crowded, Confusing and Dissapointing","I had visited the Natural History Museum quite a few years ago when my first child was 10+ and now decided to revisit for the benefit of my second child. Our first experience all those years ago was excellent and we expected the same and perhaps better.Right off the bat, there was a massive queue to even get in. It was drizzling and freezing and we had to wait for over an hour.As we entered, we were shocked with the amount of people we saw (see attached photo). In fact, we could only see people and nothing else. Even the large iconic Diplodocus skeleton in the middle of the grand hall looked tiny and swamped! There seemed to be a massive queue.The exhibits themselves were disappointing with a lot of stuff missing. Entire sections were being refurbished and were off limits.There was general chaos and the lack of proper signs or maps was frustrating. The few staff that we could seek out were not particularly friendly but who can blame them with the sea of people they are having to deal with. There were people sitting on the floor and some seem to be sleeping while others were checking their phones - looking dejected and bored! It looks like a railway station in India or China!I would suggest avoiding this attraction till all the sections are open and the Museum comes up with a better way of organizing the flow of people and the signs etc. I woud suggest they start charging an entry fee so that it would slow the entry of people just wanting to get away from the cold or rain!"
"Written February 17, 2015","Always a great place to visit, young and old alike.","50 years after my dad first took me it never fails to impress. The building itself is a wonder to behold. It was opened in 1881 being an iron structure clad in terra cotta tiles - honey and blue in colour. Sculpted in the tiles are hundreds of animals, both modern and extinct. See how many monkeys you can find climbing the round arches in the main central hall, recently renamed the Hintze Hall after a generous donor.The latest addition to the museum is a stegasaurus called Sophie. It is the only one outside of the USA and the best preserved example of this curious dinosaur. Enter the museum by the Exhibition Road entrance (the old Geological Museum) not only to see Sophie, but also to avoid the long queues at the Cromwell Road front entrance. This is the Red Zone of the museum which is about Roscks and earth processes. Don't miss the earthquake experience at the top floor, reached by a long escalator.The dinosaurs are what children young and old love to see - including the animatronic ones. There are queues to see this, so you can book a time-slot ahead of your visit to save standing around. In the basement is a room where children can get some hands on experience with magnifying glasses and microscopes. Also there is a large picnic area where school parties can eat their sandwiches as well as anyone else wanting to sit and have food brought or bought.The Darwin Centre is a modern building and worth a visit. It is in the shape of a vast cocoon and is the largest building made from spun concrete.Don't miss the Treasures exhibit. This is up the stairs from the main hall and, in a darkened room, are some of the most precious items out of the many millions in this place - including a skeleton of a dodo. Unfortunately the feathered dodo was not to be found in the birds section - it is being refurbished - as is the Lucy ape-creature (not too disappointed as I'm not an evolutionist). And don't wait too long to visit if you want to see Dippy, the diplodocus dinosaur. This has been here since 1905 and will be removed in 2017 to go on tour around the UK."
"Written August 14, 2014",Insane queues!,"I loved the Natural History Museum as a child, but apparently visiting in school holidays is now a no-no. Arrived at 12 o'clock to join the end of a queue just to get in. It looked at first like a fairly short queue but after we'd stood in it for 15 minutes we realised that it went past the entrance, snaked round several times on itself before coming back. We stood in it for 40 minutes, then suddenly there was a mass exodus from the museum, with people trying to get out through the queue we were in, and the queue stopped moving. Added to that, the heavens opened and it poured with rain. So we're all standing out in the rain, half the people are trying to leave, half the people are trying to get in, it's total chaos and there's nobody around to tell us what on earth is going on. I guess maybe the fire alarms went off or something?  If that was the case, fair enough it can't be helped, but it would have been sensible to let the people standing outside in the rain know what was going on and that they weren't going to get into the museum anytime soon so they could go away and do something more productive with their lives. As it was, we spent an hour standing around for no reason, and we all got soaked!"
"Written August 11, 2014",Big let down,"Huge queues, got access through rear entrance to avoid queues. Dated exhibits, most interactive displays not working, a lot of the displays looked knocked together in a garage with plywood and glue. Yes there are some jaw dropping exhibits, but the general feeling is of a giant public school biology lab from the Fifties."
"Written August 9, 2014","hot, busy, kids loved it","Having read reviews I felt somewhat intrepid about visiting NHM on a hot Saturday during school hols. Yes it was busy, and yes it was hot in places but overall we enjoyed the visit.  With children aged 2 and 5 we didn't aim to 'do it all' - but wanted to see the dinosaurs, the blue whale and then whatever we came across. Kids loved the dinosaur exhibition - I was a little underwhelmed by the moving T rex but my 2 year old found it suitably scary, so probably pitched about right! We went up to the volcano and earthquake area first - they liked the escalator (there are very few where we live so this (and going on the tube escalators) was very exciting for them!). It was very hot and crowded there but the imitation earthquake was good and they were fascinated by the videos of earthquakes and tsunamis. Blue whale was impressive and lots of other animals that they recognised there too. Also spent a while admiring the actual building itself / main hall and staircase which is amazing (and familiar to them from 'Andy's Dinosaur Adventures on cbeebies). A few tips which helped us:Entered via Exhibition Road as less queue - it was outside the building but fast moving so only around 10-15mins.Left pushchair in the (free) cloakroom - easier without it in the crowded areasBooked (free) advance tickets for timed dinosaur slot so walked straight in past the long queue.Took our own picnic and used the basement picnic area - this was great, lots of space and cool - saves queuing and spending out on food.Take plenty of drinks - we did find a water fountain (at the back of main hall opposite toilets) so were able to refill our drink bottles too.Bought a guide map for £1, as others have commented it is useful for getting around and doubles as a fan!Take time to look at the building - beautiful details, stone carvings everywhere, lots of animals etc to spot.Don't attempt too much - we were all flagging a bit after 4+ hours and although there was lots we didn't see, felt it best to leave while the kids were still happy though tired, rather than exhausted and miserable. Hopefully can come back another time to see more.It was only around 15min walk up to Hyde Park / Kensington Gardens - a lovely end to the visit with an ice cream surrounded by greenery"
"Written August 2, 2014",Great museum but take water & get the free fast track tickets for dinosaurs !!,"We traveled with 3 small boys who were excited to see the dinosaurs. We were expecting it to be busy as it is school holidays and it really was.  It is complete chaos in the main hall and ridiculously hot as hoards of people queue for the dinosaurs. The only way we coped with it is we reserved fast track tickets which are free and on the website before we went, which saved us queuing as you turn up at a set time & go straight in. The boys would have been a nightmare queuing in the heat and having been to the Science Musuem first we were out of water ( BIG mistake!!). This Musuem is a wonderful trip and a must do. Personally I wouldn't take a buggy in there again as it is far too busy, which means in my opinion the Science Museum next door is much better equipped for smaller children & for babies if that is your main priority. Kids loved it though!!"
"Written July 31, 2014",World's #1 Natural History Museum,"Leave it to the Brits to develop and display the best.  The extremely large collection of the best specimens from the globe are here.  The set of dinosaur skeletons is remarkable in terms of completeness and display.  They are mounted high so you can get a better view of the overall structures.  The gem collections are wonderful.  The rocks and minerals collection is huge and the largest I've seen [#2 collection is in Moscow, #3 is in Chicago].  Plants, birds, etc.  collections are all done well.  You can easily spend several days here, and all in wonder. There are special exhibits requiring a tickets.  We enjoyed the ""Britain - One Million Years of the Human Story"" which explains the long history of human settlement of Britain with evidence collected from all over the countryside.  It includes life-size models of our early ancestors.  It is a world class exhibit.  There is a restaurant on the first floor with good food at a modest price.  There is good family dining area too with a great kids menu.I've visited the Chicago Field Museum of Natural History and the New York Natural History Museum, and the various key Natural Sciences Museums in Moscow.  The Brits are the Leaders."
"Written July 25, 2014",Enjoyable,"Visited today and was easy to get to from wembley park. Lots of things to see, there were additional exhibits for a small charge. With the outside temperature in the mid 20's its advisable to have water available inside for a small fee. Would recommend."
"Written July 24, 2014",fantastic great brilliant amazing excellent trip!!!!!!!!!!!,"the mammals section was great especially seeing how big the blue whale was in comparison to other mammals. the red zone was probably my favourite, it was about the restless earth. my journey in the red zone began when I went on the escalator and was taken through the earth (see website for picture!). the volcanoes and earth section was great and I had just learnt this topic in geography. at the end of this section there is a Kobe supermarket earthquake simulator and it gave an insight into what an earthquake was like. a brilliant trip overall but the only minor disappointment was that the Charles Darwin evolution exhibition was closed on the day I went. the staff were all very friendly and welcoming."
"Written July 23, 2014",Kids will love it!,"My grandson had so much fun there! Lots of stuff for kids (and he´s only 6 years old) but was able to recognize many birds, flies and many others animals - specially dinosaurs - of course - plenty of them. Easy to get there by Tube / bus. Food is very good but there will be a queue , be prepared. It worth visiting, I recommend."
"Written June 19, 2014",Best attraction in London,"I'd never visited this museum before and it had been on my ""to-do list"" for years - I tried to visit last summer but was put off by the huuuuge queues to get in (though I understand you can book timed entries to certain exhibitions), so tried again a little earlier this year in April and found it was the perfect time to visit. No queues but still quite a few people/school groups in there, as expected. Fortunately there's so much to see that there's no real build-up of people in any one space and you can't complain when admission is free anyway!I really consider this museum a must-see for anybody in the area, especially if you have children as it's a wonderful free day out. It's packed full of information on so many different kinds of flora and fauna and there's a lot of interactive stuff too! Lots of incredible taxidermy, fossils and skeletons, and a small wet specimen area too. Unfortunately the Attenborough Studios were closed when I was there so I must visit again to try and catch that.An amazing day out for any osteology, entomology or paleontology enthusiasts. Very easy to get to as it's only a stone's throw from South Kensington tube station which can be reached on the District, Circle and Piccadilly lines. I myself will be sure to visit again someday. Be sure to dedicate a big chunk of your day to visiting as there is a LOT to see."
"Written June 7, 2014",Twice every year... A must,"One of the most well managed museums in the world. The magnificence of the building's architecture itself takes one's breath away and once inside it is truly well put.You aren't bombarded but casually entranced by what's on offer. The butterflies are a must for all.It was rainy day (surprise surprise) on my last visit which added great views through the skylight.People from every corner of the world come here and I'm just lucky to live a few miles away from it. Blessed, surely. "
"Written August 3, 2015",A gem in the heart of London,"Fantastic attraction, imense place very well preserved, pre-historic animals, volcanos, earthquakes (there is a small room where you can experience the true sensation of an earthquake).

"Written July 20, 2015",Natural History Museum Dino Snores for kids,"We have just spent the night at the Natural History Museum having a Dinosaur themed sleepover.  I booked for myself, my husband and of course the kids!  There were around 500 children and adults we started of the evening getting our sleeping area sorted out.  We were put into teams we were stegosaurus reds and we were allocated sleeping in the main hall.  Top tip don't be too eager to sleep under the dinosaur as it never gets really dark.  We went into one of the alcoves and near the back corner where it was quiet and dark.  Another tip take a sleeping mat as they provide one but its so thin and you are sleeping on a stone floor so very uncomfortable.  We started off the evening with a fantastic science show ""creatures from the deep""  which was fantastic lots of jars of very unusual deep sea fish.  Was fun informative and interactive really enjoyed it.  Then snack time followed by a dinosaur hunt in the dark with torches.  Finally the evening concluded with  a T shirt making activity for the kids where they design a dinosaur T shirt to take home.  Lights out at midnight I must admit none of us slept very well and we were a bit shattered in the morning.  After a light breakfast we had the animal man and he was fantastic lots of audience participation and the animals were unusual and varied also they were not manhandled the children could stroke them but handling was limited and the animals welfare was obviously the first priority which was lovely to see.   We don't live locally so had booked a hotel nearby for the Sunday  but couldn't check in till 1pm so if you have to hang around for a while like we did it can be a bit hard as we all wanted to go back to bed. The experience was amazing and I would highly recommend,   its a one off wonderful thing to do and the kids and you will never forget it."
"Written July 7, 2015",Fascinating place. Beautiful building. ,I spent an interesting and enjoyable few hours inside this magnificent building. It really is a beautiful building both inside and out. The main entrance hall is stunning. I arrived at around 10am on a Monday morning to find really long queues at the main entrance but I walked round to the side entrance on exhibition road where there were no queues at all. There was an escalator that took you right from the ground floor to the top that was made to resemble you going up into a planet. I can't describe it but it's breathtaking. The exhibits in this museum are really enjoyable and so worth seeing. There is no entrance fee payable but like the other museums in the area they just ask for a voluntary contribution towards the upkeep of the museum. Definitely a must visit place. N.B. Visit the Japanese supermarket replica area for a few minutes for a little surprise! 
"Written July 7, 2015",Impressive museum!,"Amazing museum, with an awesome collection of dinosaurs, plus great exhibitions of modern animals. Several temporary exhibitions are presented across the year, usually worth-visiting. Look for the Wildlife Garden, accessible from the Darwin Centre (cocoon) exit. The garden is a little paradise, where you'll be able to experience British biodiversity  "
"Written June 29, 2015",One of the best museum in the UK,"Although I like the Museum of Natural History (in New York) much more than the Natural History Museum, but this is still one of the best museum we have in this country.The museum is basically divided into 4 zones and split into 3 floors. There is a lot to see here and you can easily spend a whole day at the museum without getting bored. My favourites are the blue, red and green zones as I really like the Earth, dinosaurs, reptiles, mammals, insects sections. I also like the solar system on the 1st floor (Earth section) but I feel this department seriously need some updated as it hasn't changed for at least 10 years. Comparing to the museum in New York, ours is too simple and too brief as it could explore a little more, i.e. looking into our galaxy and universe. However, I really like the constellations on wall (at the Earth entrance). The dinosaurs section is also another highlight at the museum and I think those dinosaurs display is brilliant! The earthquake section also need some updating as well as it hasn't changed for a very long time as well.Their biggest let down is their food hall. The food is expensive and do not provide enough choices. Overall, its free of charge (although there is a donation box at the entrance) so this is definitely a ""must see"" in London.Tips: i) try to avoid visit the museum during school holiday & half term as this place can be nightmare when it is overcrowded.ii) use the entrance on the Exhibition road can save you time for queuing."
"Written June 6, 2015",Coral Reef Exhibition,As a keeper of marine aquatics i was so looking forward to coming here to look at all the corals and displays as shown on the website and YouTube!Save your money and go down your local fish shops people they will be better stocked and lots more to see!!They only had one live tank roughly 1000ltr and everything else was dead coral on display!Very dissapointing and not worth the £50 to get there and the £20 to get in!!
"Written May 20, 2015",Amazing! great for family.,"Lots of display on Dinosaurs Animals and Nature! Too many might take slightly longer time to understand some, but is for all ages to enjoy! Was there during long weekend, long queue but it did not take too long to get in.Is a Must See."
"Written May 7, 2015",Temple of the History of Natural History!,"This museum is amazing, not only for its rich collection and stunning building, but also for  being a great part of the history of Biology and Natural History studies. A must have experience in London.Love it!"
"Written June 29, 2009","Breathtaking, beautiful, extremely informative and FREE!","This was one of the highlights of my trip to London with my father. We walked here from our hotel near Lancaster Gate on a wonderful sunny day. It is really something to see the massive collection of animals, birds, insects and dinosaurs the museum has on display. To see the full size of the blue whale is unbelievable. It really shows you how great mother nature is. The museum also stands as a reminder of how destructive human beings can be. Many of the animals on display are endangered or extinct. It is a shame that many of these creatures can only be witnessed stuffed and behind glass, rather than in the wild. All in all, I was extremely impressed and blown away by the displays. The only thing I was not satisfied with was the lack of information on sharks.  It takes a full day of walking to make it around the museum, and be sure to check out the display on Darwin and evolution. The natural history/geology section was also very interesting, and there is a room with a simulated earthquake. I don't know about the previous negative reviews about the museum. Perhaps they didn't understand that museums are going to be full of video games and rollercoasters to keep those with short attention spans entertained."
"Written May 30, 2023",Worth the trip but pack snacks and drinks,"Most of it is free of charge however hefty price on special exhibitions and the cost of food/drinks is outrageous so are prices in gift shops. Loses a point for this as the museum is still far from average.However, we like the free part of the museum (donations encouraged). Excellent display of exhibits, very informative, building is gorgeous, well signaged. Make sure you book your free ticket for an allocated time slot or you can be waiting for two hours until you get in as non-ticket holder. You can get in within 30 minutes prior to your allocated time as a ticket holder."
"Written May 5, 2023",Great Natural exhibits,Very enjoyable but certain areas very crowded . Lots of school groups in some sections. Plan for time enough to what you want or go for a couple of hours different days.
"Written April 7, 2023",It's been ages and ages.........So glad to return.,"The last time I was here 'Dippy' was on the meet and greet which was some years ago. 'Dippy' has been replaced by 'Hope' the Blue Whale in the the great 'Hintze Hall'. It's a magnificent room with a seated statue of Charles Darwin keeping watch up the first set of stairs. If you get to choose which way you enter the museum choose the front, I took a side entrance in but had to make my way to the Hall before I felt I was really here. It's the heart of the museum and for me one of the most amazing rooms there is, anywhere.'Hope' takes centre stage in the main hall but is suspended from the ceiling so whilst she is amazing in her own right and maybe bigger than 'Dippy' she lacks the eye level, massive dinosaur, impact that 'Dippy' used to have.  'Hope' however is the real deal.If dinosaurs are your thing the there is a separate room for them and a few other dinosaur skeletons doted around the museum. The main dinosaur room is dimly lit and is hugely popular so can get cramped.An animatronics' T-rex is one of the first big dinosaurs you see, but there are other better and real ones to see. T-Rex looks like he shares the same dentist with Jurgen Klopp, the Hollywood teeth on a dinosaur just looks wrong, at least he wasn't wearing sunglasses !Various other rooms featuring a plethora of extinct animals, cats, whales, human evolution, insects and far too much to see in one visit. The most recent exhibit is 'Titanosaur' possibly the Biggestest dinosaur in the world ! It's just gone on display and requires a separate timed ticket so pre-book before you get there. There is a fee to see this exhibition but it has just gone on display so was extremely popular. I failed to get a ticket the night before so will have to visit again soon but no matter there really is so much to see on multiple levels, just make sure you get a map and as a tip start in the main hall, it has a Wow factor all of it's own.The only downside is, as with any free to enter museum, there's just too many people and they have a captive market for food and drink."
"Written August 23, 2022",Too hot to enjoy.,Great museum with an amazing array of things to see and do but it was UNBEARABLY hot and the feeble warnings here and there were not representative of how hot it actually is. We couldn’t wait to leave.
"Written July 10, 2022",FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE,"I spent almost 4 hours in the museum and loved the many displays from Dinosaurs, Mammels, Birds, Darwin and more. I believe this museum to be the best in the world, certainly the displays are done at a top notch level for both adults and children"
"Written May 19, 2022",Great historical visit,You can spend hrs here - there is so much to see and read and it's brilliant for kids of all ages. The building is stunning too.
"Written March 28, 2022",take the kids,"went primarily for the wildlife photography exhibition, but struggled with the museum, its very disjointed, and very crowded, an may be its more geared to a younger audience, though i found the marine and mammal section interesting, but both under served."
"Written February 6, 2022",Natural History is Awesome,"Lots to see and an interesting mix of displays. From saving the planet, dinosaurs and lots, lots more, you could ask for a better setting. The building is stunning."
"Written January 26, 2022",Great architecture - but too many kids!!!!!!,"***disabled reviewer***I have to say, I didn't enjoy this museum as much as I thought I might.  Mainly because I'm a childless adult.  there are a LOT of kids here, and fair enough.  it's just very noisy and very difficult to get near anything as the kids sort of, dare I say it, get in the way! eek! The exhibits were wonderful, but I'd steer clear of the dinosaurs bit, it was so crowded and not that great tbh because they were mainly 'replicas' or animatronics.  Not the real deal.The great hallway is magnificent, even without Dippy.  I particularly loved the architecture.  Look around at the walls when you go - you'll see some wonderful things.We ate at the T-Rex diner - it was busy (1pm ish!) but we were seated at a table with a number on, you go up and order, and they bought the food within about 5-10 mins! The drinks took longer - but hey, it's busy.  We had a New-Yorker sandwich, made fresh to order, with large chunky, fresh bread, and plenty of fries.  The table had a bottle of water and two thimble glasses.  Our drinks order was also tiny, but for the price (around £15) it was good value. The pizzas looked great too - freshly made, with charred bits and plenty big enough for dinner, not alone lunch for one!  I was also able to charge my scooter here.The staff here are friendly and helpful. I wish they'd offer a kid-free time to visit.  By the time I left, I had tinnitus from all the noise that kids make. We were here for 5 hours or so.  (I'm not totally anti-children, it's just hard navigating around them in a wheelchair)"
"Written September 19, 2012",beautiful building,The most beautiful museum we have ever visited. The building is stunning and in a great condition. We loved every minute of our 3 hour visit. 
"Written August 29, 2012",Unrivaled,This is one must visit for a family day out. When we visited one day was not enough so we spent an extra day and cannot wait to visit again. I did some background research on their website and I got to plan the day to the full. Wholly recommend you do that before you visit.
"Written August 27, 2012",Complete let down!,"I spent the afternoon at the museum on a weekend away with my husband, with the idea of checking it out before bringing the children next time, I was so angry at the end of our visit that unless this museum has a complete overhaul (of both exhibits and staff), I have no intention to return- EVER!!  The queues are disgusting, especially the one which gives you access to the dinosaurs. Luckily we had bought a ticket to a special exhibition previously so were able to avoid the I initial entrance queue, and had also booked a slot to the dino gallery which allowed us to fast-track the queue and go straight in. However, I felt the pain of the poor penned in families, sweltering in the unbearable heat of the museum gallery, with fed-up screaming, sweating children being observed by diss-interested staff. It is packed to the rafters!!! You cannot move for other, equally irrate bodies, all desperately looking for something, anything that will be of some interest to their children. Families, if you are looking for a fun, educational, stress free day out with your children then this IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. Infact, I'm struggling to understand who it is for. If your kids are dinosaur mad then DO NOT take them here. The dinosaur gallery is a pathetic, I genuinely think I could have curated a better one myself and I know very little about them. I wasted a whole afternoon here trying to find some redeeming features and came away with nothing! Oh. If you're a fan of rocks and precious minerals then you'll be sufficiently catered for- there are galleries and galleries on the stuff!!"
"Written August 27, 2012","Dissapointing, boring, Crowded, hot & smelly.","So dissapointed with this visit. Queue to get in was slow and a the end of it before entering was a hard sell of a guide book.  Walked straight by bag search even though husband and I had a rucksack each. As you walk in you see another heart sinking winding queue to enter the dinosaour area.  While queing you can fork out £10.00 to hear the Dinosaur roar !The guide leaflet is a £1 donation and is poorly laid out - and needs to be redone.  I would try and get something off the internet and print for free.  I used mine as a fan mostly.  This was because it was a hot, humid day, people were soaked thru from the rain  (being caught in the queue) and the air in the museum was a humid stew and not nice at all.The dinosaur section is a winding single file walk around and also up steps ( lift provided for buggies etc) to walk gantrys looking down on skeletons etc.  At the end is a moving T Rex then it winds out past lots of educational screens.  I couldnt wait to get through the whole section and get out.  The stones / minerals section seems unchanged since I visited with school.  Best thing about this section is its not busy and its nice and airy and has benchs to sit down on, which are few and far between in other sections.  The Vault area at the end is worth a visit to see the selection of Diamonds. Also if you sit here its one area the building is in its origonal state and the stone carvings and origonal building details can be seen which are more intresting than some of the exhibits.  Sadly in other areas the buildings origonal features, walls, windows, doors, ceilings details have been covered up with boards for new displays which is a total crime in my book as they are the best feature of the place.It all seemed a lot bigger as a child.  But then so much space is taken up by gift shops you have to exit through after the main exhibits and cafes.  All after your money.I didnt see anywhere to sit and have my own sandwich /drink.  I couldnt wait to get out of the place and left dissapointed as i had come to London especially to visit.  A lot of train fare and hotel costs and time allready invested into my visit.I would hope the national lottery put money into this place to bring some much needed soul and educational value back into this gorgous building and its contents.In return i would gladly pay an entrance fee."
"Written August 3, 2011","Excellent Museum, First Rate Experience","We visited the museum a couple of times during a short stay in London.We were all very impressed with the range and scale of the exhibits.There is so much too see and learn about that a few visits are needed.Top Tip: Visit after 3pm, ther are less crowds and in parts of the museum it feels like you are the only people there!!"
"Written June 21, 2011",One of our dinosaurs is missing :-(,"Well, actually all of them! We visited at the weekend and there are numerous signs saying the 'Dinosaurs are on holiday' Oh how funny. I bet the kids rolled up at that one! The Dinosaurs were the main reason we wanted to go to the museum in the first place. Why they would shut the Dinosaur exhibition for cleaning in June/July I have no idea. Couldn't they do it in October November when there may not be as many disappointed kids (and adults). Other than that the museum is full of interesting exhibits and a great way to spend a few hours one afternoon if its raining.  Only rated average due to lack of Dinosaurs, othwerwise it could have been 5/5"
"Written June 1, 2011",Do NOT pay to see age of the dinosaur,The museum is ok if you want to see stuffed animals. The cost to see age of the dinosaur is £28 for a family of 4. What a rip off. All it is is a few moving dinosaurs and you complete the exhibition in under 10 minutes
"Written February 28, 2011",A great family day out!,"My husband and I visited with our 3 children aged 3, 6 and 8 on the Saturday of half term. We arrived early (9.10am) before the museum opened (10am). Because of the number of people in the queue the museum opened half an hour early which was great.Inside each area is clearly signposted and divided into colour coded sections so finding your way around is easy. We bought a guide book for £5 which had a map in the back but individual maps can be bought for just £1. I would advise visiting the dinosaurs first becuase by midday there were long queues and it could take up to 1 hour to see them. There were no queues in the other areas of the museum.If you have small children there are toilets everywhere but also quite a few gift shops which makes them hard to avoid! We did purchase a few gifts and I think they were reasonably priced compared to other UK attractions. There is a lot of walking and we could have done with the buggy for the 3 year old. Everywhere is big enough for buggies and lifts are available.We didn't use the restaurant because in the basement there is a large picnic area, great if you've packed a picnic. Hot and cold drinks are available (£3.90 for 2 teas) and there are a selection of vending machines selling snacks.One of the best displays is 'investigate' which is a hands on area where you can view and handle lots of things from animal skins to fossils. There were also sharks jaws, crocodile claws and a pond dipping area too! It is great for kids giving them a chance to use microscopes, measure, weigh and draw items, or just feel things which is something they can't always do in the main museum.Overall it was a great day out enjoyed by all. It is easy to get to by train and being FREE to get in is a bonus. There is so much to see and do we are going back again to see all the things we didn't have time to view this time."
"Written November 5, 2009",Fantastic,"This museum was wonderful.  I went during the week and it was not overcrowded.  There are exhibits for all ages from kids to adults with advanced knowledge of natural history topics.  You can spend a whole day there; good concession, clean, EXCELLENT EXHIBITS.  Well organized and layed-out.  Make sure you take the Cacoon Tour.  All this for FREE, no admision."
"Written August 30, 2009",Get there early!,"Its no suprise that you have to queue a while to get in! We arrived just before 10am and the only had to queue for about 10mins. (When we left at about midday we overheard that the queue time was 45mins!)We bought a museum programme guide for £4.50 at the door which was a great souvenier. We took some lovely pictures of the outside of the building which is pretty amazing in itself.We visited the blue zone first where we saw the life size model of a whale - this area was very quiet with hardly anyone there! Later we went to the dinosaur area which was a bit of an anti climax i have to say. You walk round the area with a snail trail of people and cant stop to look at anything and lots of screaming children. Later on there were HUGE queues to see this area- i think alot of people would be just as disappointed as we were with this exhibit.I visited with just my husband as we dont have children. I found the place to be very overcrowded and the constant screaming and shouting from bored children became too much in the end! My husband was actually shoved out the way on several occasions by young children!!!There is loads to see but the displays seem a bit crammed in.On the up side, it is very educational and loads of interactive stuff for the kids (and adults too as i discovered with my husband!) Its great that you can see so much and not have to pay an entrance fee. I took lots of photos of the entrance hall as it really is a very beautiful building."
"Written January 18, 2020",Fun for all ages ,Definitely an amazing museum for adults and children (although I admit the focus is children) so you can spend quite a time inside learning new things. 
"Written January 16, 2020",Christmas treat to London,My husband suprised me with a trip to London and our first stop on arrival was the natural history museum. A truly awesome place cannot believe it's free but well deserving of your donations!! You'll spend a good few hours in ther wondering round is a maze of things to see.

"Written January 12, 2020",Great Museum,"We visited the museum on school holidays but still was not expecting such a crowd, and had to wait outside for 30 mins.A must visit in the city of London"
"Written January 11, 2020",Great Museum for Kids!,"The Natural History Museum was one of our go-to places as our kid's favourite Cbeebies programme, ""Andy's Prehistoric Adventures"", was partially filmed here. We had our little starstruck moment when we saw the dinosaur in the main entrance (it's in one of the shot as Andy runs through the museum in the show opening sequence). We took our time to walk through the galleries and while our kid was thoroughly exhausted by the time we got to the dinosaurs, he was awed by what he saw. (Parent-tip: Do not check in your stroller at the Cloakroom like we did because you'll end up regretting not having it and having to deal with a tired whiny child. The museum is huge so a stroller is very helpful if you have one.)The museum is very well put and the exhibits are incredible. The exhibition text is easy to read and understand. There are plenty of gift shops, we noticed that there's almost one in every hall, so pace yourself in buying the souvenirs as each shop sells items unique to the exhibition that they are near.Go to all the galleries if time permits, if not, then go see the dinosaurs! To all the staff, thank you for a lovely experience! <3"

"Written September 21, 2020",Good but little underwhelming ,"Booked tickets online.  Staff were polite and knowledgeable .Spent around 2h looking around. Quite a lot of the exhibits were closed to the public i assume to do with Covid precautions. Other  exhibits were ""models of"" rather than the real thing....It was fine ...just a not what I expected from it..."
"Written September 4, 2020",Natural History Museum is a Natural London Wonder,Maybe it's the Covid period but there were a lot of things closed.  This place is magnificent!  It's gorgeous.  The exhibits I did see where well laid out and informational.  This should be something to see if you're in London on a holiday.
"Written August 20, 2020",Ultimate helpers,"On our arrival at the museum with my grand daughter, I was totally unable to bring up my emails, and thus my tickets. The assistants ""passed me down the line"" to a younger man. He patiently helped try to obtain access, and when we failed, rang bookings to search for my tickets, which they promptly found, thus saving the day. He then messaged ahead so that we would not be asked for the tickets again. I am ashamed to say I forget his name, but it began with an E. Throughout our visit, nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who answered my 9 year old's questions and queries without demure, and helpfully 'piloted' us on our way. Absolutely top notch!"
"Written August 7, 2020",Top Notch Trip,"We (myself, my partner and our five year old son) came to the museum for the re-opening after COVID-19, we pre-booked a time slot ticket in advance online with the children's visitors pack (including a tote bag, a map and a dinosaur themed mask to encourage our son to wear a mask around the museum which he loved!) It was a shame to see people being turned away at the gate as they had not realised you needed a pre-booked ticket, I would think it is obvious because of everything going on, however, maybe more obvious signage on the new ""whalecome back"" posters would have been helpful. The museum was immaculately clean and myself and my partner praised the museum for having staff circulating constantly cleaning the displays and exhibits, also the amount of hand sanitisers around the building made us feel completely at ease. It was wonderful how empty the majority of the building was, most of the displays felt like private exhibits! A lot of the ""hands-on"" activities are closed, which is completely understandable and we were fine with that. One thing I would say, is that later on in the day as the museum got busier, the staff that are circulating should be challenging masks (I completely understand that there are some people that cannot wear a mask, however, whole groups of people were coming into the museum without wearing one, and I would suggest that not every member of these parties are exempt). But also challenge social distancing, it was very frustrating having groups of people barge into us through the museum. Especially children not being watched by their parents! My son has been essentially trained to remember ""special distance"" and he was getting quite upset when other children were coming too close to him when he was trying to look at something and thus, he felt he had to move. I feel staff could be doing more to stop this and to challenge people who were not adhering to the one way system. This was especially bad in the dinosaur exhibit which I would assume is the most popular area of the museum especially for children. Overall, the day was fantastic, it was the first time we had all been around the entire museum (except what was not open, but this was minimal) and we spent nearly five hours exploring. A real day out - I find with museums, you get out of it what you put in!"

"Written January 1, 2022",Terrifying,"We visited the ice rink on New Year’s Eve and really wish we hadn’t! Would suggest because of the mild weather the ice was melting and there was two inches of standing water on the rink, it was too dangerous. I was knocked over backwards by a tall bloke who’d been weaving in and out precariously of other skaters throughout the session. I hit my head and momentarily blacked out. My 12 year old daughter had to call over staff, one of whom said it wasn’t his job to help. When I was finally helped off the ice was seen by a grumpy first aider who seemed more intent on telling off my traumatised daughter for wanting to be with me than in carrying out a proper check over. She checked me for concussion, made me sign a piece of paper and gave me some paracetamol and sent me on my way, totally missing the bleeding gash on the back of my head despite me telling her my head hurt. Poor organisation, poorly trained staff, who all seemed too young to deal with a crisis and poor management to keep the rink open when others had closed because of the weather. Thankfully I was just a walking wounded but dread to think how they would have reacted to a serious injury!"
"Written August 27, 2021",Great dinosaur area,"The building in itself is worth the visit and great dinosaur display; the other displays are average, bur nice. The free tickets are impossible to get at short notice, but you can buy a membership that entitles to entry without booking for one year."
"Written July 23, 2021",Nice if you want a sauna.,Ridiculously hot. We left after 20 minutes because it was like a sauna. You would think an attraction like this would be air conditioned when it was 29degrees outside.
"Written June 5, 2021",No social distancing,"Poor effort. Usual great artefacts but given covid19 times, with timed entrances there were was no social distancing whatsoever inside, some guests also chose not to wear masks, which was not enforced. So fingers crossed."
"Written December 18, 2020","Amazing, go! Now!","If you haven't been before, thers nothing else to say but amazing whether you're 8 or 80! Stop looking at reviews and just go..."
"Written October 30, 2020",Fantastic day out,An amazing place - we squeezed in much as we could but don’t think we saw it all. Particular compliments to be paid to the chap in The Kitchen who spotted my lipreading badge and removed his mask temporarily- he was very helpful. 
"Written October 28, 2020",Visit with 5 year old grandson,He loved it.  Only thing that was a bit lacking is the selection of places to eat as only one place open. What they had on offer was very limited.
"Written October 5, 2020",Fun for all ages,A very nice museum with a ton to see and do. Appropriate and enjoyable for all ages. A little crowded but COVID measures were still adhered too.
"Written October 2, 2020",Covid friendly!,"Although some of the exhibitions are closed currently, the staff are dealing with covid/social distancing really well. We enjoyed ourselves and it was much nicer only having so many people allowed in at a time as we could walk around with ease and see everything we wanted to!"
"Written September 23, 2020",Super day out,"Some of the best collections of dinosaurs, and of natural history examples in the world.    Highly recommended it as a top ten London stop."
"Written February 16, 2020",Kids (and adults) will love it,"From dinosaurs to animals, precious stones to volcanoes and earthquakes this place has it all. The line to get in can get long, but it FREE!!!"
"Written February 15, 2020",Rookie Error - Avoid during school holidays,"Great place, good location and close to public transport with buses stopping nearby & the tube stopping at south Kensington station allowing you to avoid potential foul weather by taking the underground tunnels to the museums. It’s also within minutes walk of cafes & it’s really easy to navigate between exhibits and nearby V&A museum & the science museum."
"Written February 13, 2020",This is a must see but it's LARGE.,"If you are a fan of the NHM in NYC, then make this museum a stop on your trip. The specimens are amazing and the displays are top notch. Definitely go but wear very comfortable shoes as it is a marathon."
"Written February 12, 2020",Exhibition Best Wildlife Photographer of the Year,An exhibition of photos of wildlife that is amazing not only for people who love photography but also for people who love animals and vice-versa. Unforgettable moments caught on camera. The only negative side is the photojournalism room where you have the photos of the horrible things that human beings do to animals. 
"Written February 11, 2020",Great Family Museum ,Great Family Museum with unique and one-of-a-kind collection. Great for toddlers and young children!
"Written February 11, 2020",One of my favorite museums of all time,"You can get lost in the beauty and the size of this museum, but it is definitely a stop in London I recommend to anyone"
"Written February 8, 2020",Outstanding ,We spend a whole day here.And there was still a lot more to see.You need more than 3hours if you run through the whole area. Highly recommended
"Written February 8, 2020",An excellent experience,"A walk for the whole family, you can discover impressive things and the best of all is that most of the exhibits are interactive. The dinosaur sector did not have much to do compared to the other sectors and was very crowded. But overall a memorable experience."
"Written February 8, 2020",Dinosaurs and minerals,"The dinosaurs had a great exibition, as expected. The mineral part was at least as impressive and we spent even more time there. The building itself is worth the visit if you are in to beautiful buildings. "
"Written February 3, 2020",Short visit but worth it,"I only had an hour to visit the museum so I didn't have the time to see all the exhibits, but the ones that I did (minerals, the vault, Heinze Hall) were amazing. I can't wait to return with my children to show them this excellent place."
"Written January 5, 2020",Dinosaurs!,"I went solely to see the dinosaurs, and they did not disappoint. The crowds were insane though. I would recommend going at opening or near closing because it was wall to wall people in there."
"Written January 4, 2020",Great Museum,This is a free museum with something for everyone. You can spend a little time or days looking around. Great educational museum. 
"Written January 4, 2020",Excellent! Queuing are fast,"A bit crowded, I came there at around noon. But the queues were very fast, so don't be discarded by a big line in front of the entrance."
"Written January 3, 2020",Fantastic museum!,"This museum is huge! Even before you enter, this is an impressive place. The building is really impressive and beautiful. If you like museums of this type, this is a must. Recommended."
"Written January 2, 2020",Very busy during holidays,"Crowds are well controlled and displays very interesting.No tickets, but donations requested. Cafe has acceptable food."
"Written January 2, 2020",Amazign and worth the visit!,"For any natural science enthusiast this is a dream come true! Every single exhibition was stunning and they even had a wild life photographer as a guest speaker on the day we were there. Loads of reading and hands on, but can get quite draining due to information overload and the walking. "
"Written January 2, 2020","National History Museum, Better than ever, more exibits, 6 Stars.","We went to the Museum on 1st January 2020, you have to get there early almost as they open to beat the rush, the exhibits now are mind blowing, they have a Dinosaur section with a range of Dinosaurs of different types, they have a Large Tyrannosaurus that moves roars and looks really authentic, then opposite they a huge moon in a darkened room, we spent some time looking at it, it was amazing, they have a large area with machines that help you understand different human evolution, Language, eyesight, just about everything, you can spend all day in this Museum and you will come back again. Restaurants Cafes, plenty of seating, if you are in London this a must, we will be going again."
"Written December 31, 2019",Awesome in every way!,"Amy young grandson loves his dinosaurs! So I’m our trip to London from California, I knew we had to make a stop at this gorgeous museum.  We are visiting during the busy week after Christmas and the decorations are everywhere including the museum grounds. We knew we couldn’t commit to more than a couple of hours with a toddler and infant in tow so decided to get there around 3 (it closes at 550). The line to get in seemed daunting but actually moved very quickly.  The building itself is an architectural beauty and even those who are usually turned in by interesting buildings have to be awestruck by its grandeur outside and in - don’t forget to look up at the amazing ceilings as you walk around.  The exhibits for the dinosaurs have something for everyone and is truly a remarkable collection. But probably let the most memorable moment was my 3 year old grandson coming up close and personal with a full size audio animatronic TRex! That was something and almost enough to jolt him out of his jet lag. We stopped in the cafe for coffee and scones and weren’t disappointed Outside for the holidays there was an ice skating rink and carousel.  A really great afternoon and only wish we had more time there....without the little ones and a double wide stroller in tow!"
"Written December 30, 2019",Favourite exhibits,"Overall this is a fantastic museum containing every kind of natural exhibit you could think of, thoughtfully laid out and we'll documented. Oh and did I mention? It's free.Standout feature for me was the ""moon room"" with an enormous suspended globe covered in photo montages of the moon. You can just sit or lie on the floor and stare at it for ages. Mesmerizing.Also take the ride up the escalator into the big glowing planet in the geological section."
"Written December 30, 2019",Choose your times wisely...,"We went on a Saturday morning, there was about 20 mins que time so not so bad. We came out mid afternoon to find people queuing all the way to the main road with staff announcing that both entries had a que time of 1hr plus to get entry to the museum. I'm glad we went early!!!It's a fab museum and other reviews can explain what there is to do ( a highlight for us was the Kobe supermarket earthquake room ) but the main thing we noticed was that this place gets absolutely PACKED. Maybe if there was some sort of crowd control system it'd be easier to spend more time at the exhibits? It's quite easy to find yourself being carried along with the crowds. The downstairs picnic area though is incredible, loads of space and was very quite especially compared to the restaurant area which was near full capacity by 12pm.That said, once you're in you can easily spend an enjoyable full day here!"
"Written December 29, 2019",A very brief visit,I popped into the Natural History Museum with a friend and immediately regretted our lack of time! The exhibits we were able to visit briefly were very impressive and informative. I would love to return. There can be huge queues so I'd advise arriving quite early or leaving it a little later to avoid queuing. 
"Written December 29, 2019",Great museum - too crowded,"There are so many great exhibits at this museum, but you constantly must fight the crowd.  They should charge for admission to reduce the crowds or even create an appointment system.  If I were to just rate the exhibits, it would easily be five stars "
"Written December 29, 2019",Best of London,"Went here with the family, my 4 year old was all about the dinosaurs, and that was the main reason we went. Fantastic excebition, specially the dinosaurs and the  whales was our favourites. Lunchtime at T-Grill, laim hamburger and crappy service- please choose one of the other kafeterias. VERY nice shops, both Dino-shop and the ordinary shop. Lots of people- even on a weekday in November. "
"Written December 29, 2019",Wonderful!,We took our 21 month old son to see the dinosaurs for the first time and he was in awe! It was busy (Saturday between Christmas and New Year) but we expected that. If you can go on a weekday during term time you're laughing! Also - go the 'Moon' while it's there...great as a chill out!Paying a £5 donation is nothing compared to the amount you can see in this awesome museum! 
"Written December 26, 2019",Wonderful architecture and exhibits,We see something different every time we visit. The building itself is a spectacle and the exhibits fascinating. Educational and thrilling. Fabulous place
"Written December 26, 2019",Unmissable. ,"This, along with the Science Museum, is the jewel in the crown of London museums. My wife and I have spent many a happy day here with my young son, who has soaked up its many educational facets."
"Written December 26, 2019",Blast from the past,Kids loved the Natural History Museum as always! Very educational and entertaining. Loved the Minerals & the Vault! 
"Written December 24, 2019",Beautiful place.,This place is really beautiful. If you love seeing history before your eyes. This is the perfect place. 
"Written December 23, 2019",To crowded to enjoy. Terrible experience. Much better things to do in London.,Have to say I doubt anyone could enjoy this museum with  the number of people packed in. I certainly did not. We lasted 15 mins and left it was terrible.  It was so crowded that you could not move or read anything. Too many people which honestly should be controlled with timed tickets or maybe charging people. I know that is a terrible thing to say in this country but look at Europe most of the museums cost something to go into.
"Written December 23, 2019",London Museums are Amazing- Free entry to this place,"You need lot of time to explore London attractions, but if get few days then don't miss out museums specifically those where you get free entry. If you love historical things and want to explore natural things, do visit this place. Wheel chair access and lifts are available. "

The cafe(s) ensure you can have a quick lunch inside the museum, thus maximising your time there.Highly recommended."
"Written December 21, 2019",Excellent ,"We were looking for a place to take our 4 year old to, and found the museum mentioned. Entry is free and there was a massive queue at the entrance. However, we were taken right through as we had a child and wife was pregnant. Everyone was very friendly and the museum was amazing, considering it's free. Brilliant visit and kid loved it."
"Written December 20, 2019",Day in the Capital,"Definitely worth a visit, loads to see, do and learn. Our 5 year old was difficult to remove from the place she liked it so much. Give a donation to keep this place at the top. "

"Written December 18, 2019",Well laid out and quite instructional,"This is a place to look at the history of our planet. It is a great place to take children to follow the evolution of man, the natural phenomena that affect us and try to understand how we fit into the natural world. "
"Written December 17, 2019",Highly recommended!!!,"Breathtaking museum!Very well organized.You can see things that you have never seen before.We really loved the Darwin Centre.Its a must visit place, especially for those travelling with kids.Highly recommended."

"Written December 9, 2019",Museum,"We visited here and had a lovely time, very bright and airy and the displays were very good. The museum was clean and tidy and had an enjoyable experience."
"Written December 8, 2019",Amazing.,"Amazing museum.  So rich in species diversity, from mammals to cnidaria, it has incredible fossils and is extremely important for knowledge and our history.  The human body part is also wonderful and interactive.  The museum also has several cafes and options for breaks and rest."
"Written December 3, 2019","Way too crowded, many things not on display","This museum is free, which is fantastic, but you have to pay extra to see things like their  giant squid specimen (which I had been looking forward to). The dino and mammal skeletons are spectacular, but hard to appreciate because the museum was completely packed on a Friday morning. Loads and loads of school trips and tiny babies who should not have been out."
"Written December 2, 2019",Excellent,"I still cannot believe this museum is free of charge.  Our four children ages 4 to 16 loved this museum.  We were impressed with everything it had to offer.  It was perfect day for it as well since it was raining that day, and we were nice and dry inside the museum."
"Written December 1, 2019",Visit to Natural History Museum,Beautiful architecture both inside and out Colour of stonework very complimentary to the surroundingsInteresting exhibits - we visited for the Wildlife Photographer of the year Some parts of the museum were a little overcrowded - our visit was on a Thursday and as expected some schools were also visiting
"Written November 26, 2019",Thumbs up for this!,Really enjoyed myself at this museum. Free entry (as usual for museums in London). So many things to see. Especially the whale skeleton(most instagrammable photo op) i guess. Very interesting gift shop. Its near Science Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum too. Walking distance of Harrods too.
"Written November 26, 2019",Such friendly staff!,We were here again for the Wildlife Photographer exhibition and loved it as much as in previous years. We were late for our slot but staff was very wellcoming.

"Written December 15, 2019",Slightly disappointed,"We are a family with two young adults (18 and 21) and we were looking forward to visiting this museum. Whilst there are some amazing exhibits my personal feeling was that a lot of exhibits were looking old and tired, especially in the Mammals area. By far the best feature of the museum is the museum building itself - fabulous architecture and carvings throughout."
"Written December 14, 2019",Amazing as usual ,"It's one of my favourite place in London. Inside and outside there is a magic atmosphere, especially now in Christmas time with lights everywhere and the place for Ice-skating . I suggest to go there for spend a good time, every section is very interesting and the style of the building it's fantastic. "
"Written December 14, 2019",Natural History Museum with a 1 year old,"My son was 1 year old on that time and my son had his buggy.So I was limited to look around. However he enjoyed it even it was not too much. It is easy access with stroller, you can bring your own food and eat it in the restaurant and there are baby changing facilities.I really enjoyed that day."
"Written December 13, 2019",Faboulous,"This museum is a ""just see"" when in London. Dinosaurs, historic events, creatures and figures well orchestrated and loads og stormer are hold.Highly recommended and the best - less people og Desember, then skoletimer du ring summer!"
"Written December 13, 2019",Love the dinasaurs ,This is another great muse and also next door to the V&A so great to visit both. I particularly like the great Hall and the skeleton hanging from the ceiling. Some amazing exhibits and a great place to bring children.

"Written October 20, 2019","Great museum in general, just lacking new content ","I still love this museum considering that I already visited it before back in 2016..however, there isn't much new in terms of new exhibits (compared to Tate Modern for example or Science Museum), so i ended up walking through it relatively quickly this time. Overall I think it's magic is most definitely present for anyone seeing this museum for the first time, however I'd recommend you go elsewhere if you've already been to this museum in the last few years. "
"Written October 20, 2019",Well worth it!,"So much to see, you could be here a day and still not take it all in. Found it easy to browse through and experience lots of 'hands-on' exhibits. This place is so big, yet it handles crowds well. "
"Written October 19, 2019",Amazing,In a few words: It’s simply amazing.You can spend hours in this museum and it will still surprise you in every new room.
"Written October 18, 2019",Α must see in London,"An absolute must see for families. Very well organized, family friendly and in a impressive building. Tip: try to visit it during the week and if possible be there around 9:40 to avoid the big quews. It opens daily at 10:00."
"Written October 17, 2019",Family outing,"This museum is interesting, really entertaining, but it would be way more interesting with little children (I think?): The stories and the interactiveness would attract them more than adults :) "
"Written October 17, 2019",What a building - go just for that!,Try to go at least once a year usually to a specific exhibition. This year was wildlife photography.  Just love the building.  Probably one of my favourite museums ahead of Musee D'Orsee in Paris. 
"Written October 16, 2019",Family time,"The place is perfect to visit with children, plenty objects on display. We recommend the place to families"
"Written October 16, 2019",The best museum in london!,I never get bored of the natural history museum. It s the best and nicest museum in London. You must visit it! Lorenzo
"Written October 27, 2019",Fun place to visit,This is one of the top natural history museums in the world.  It provides a great educational experience for young and old.
"Written October 27, 2019",Great Venue,"Visited this museum on a Saturday in school holiday time, although it was busy you can still get to see all the exhibits. Exhibits are brilliant well set out and world class. Gift shops were very busy and very expensive but as the site is free it’s expected. Plenty of spots to eat and drink although aim expensive."
"Written October 27, 2019",Worth to visit ,"Get there early in the morning to avoid queues and waiting. Visited 2 special shows of dinosaurs and human life; Great work and truly informative shows. Perhaps directed a bit more to kids and teens, however new stuff and interesting experience for adults as well. "
"Written October 26, 2019",Wow!,"This place is amazing and has been on my bucket list for a while now. As I was in London I couldn’t give this a miss, nor could thousands of others. The museum is split into four main sections and you would probably need a day in each section to do it justice. I had just four hours so was basically walking through the areas taking note of major exhibits. At the end of my brief visit I left thinking that I need to return at some time in the future. Highly recommended. "
"Written October 24, 2019",Brilliant half term day out,"Went to London for the day 23rd Oct 2019, with my 6yr old grandson,  the exhibits  are amazing  the blue whale  t rex,  the earthquake  simulator was good, we spent almost 5 hrs there, it was quite busy, but that's because  it's half term, I would recommend  it to anybody,  adults and children,  lots to see and do,  , highly recommended"
"Written October 24, 2019",Everyone wants To be here in August. I think I’d prefer to come in winter,Every child loves to come here. Lots of us big kids too! The queues are long waiting to come in. It’s located next to the Victoria and Albert so you may be able to combine them and make it a big day. 
"Written October 23, 2019",Outstanding- for the Darwinian collection alone!,There is so much to see and do here and so much to learn. The natural History Museum was close to the Holiday Inn Hotel  where I was staying so I had a leisurely walk and then proceeded to spend the bulk of the day at the Museum soaking up knowledge.
"Written October 22, 2019",Impressive insight into the natural world,"Our main goal was to look at the Wildlife Photographer of the Year. The exhibition was great and educational. In addition, we enjoyed the impressive building. Exposure to dinosaurs is in high demand, not to be silent there. I recommend that you enjoy the atmosphere of the 2nd floor."
"Written October 22, 2019","Brilliant displays, lots to see and touch",My 6 year old and I loved the NHM. The displays are awesome and there is lots to enjoy. You can spend quite a few hours here. The only downside was the cafe which I thought was overpriced for the offering they had and also virtually impossible to get a seat. It still didn't detract from our overall enjoyment.We went in early November and enjoyed the Ice rink which is part of the NHM grounds. It was beautifully set up with a magical xmas tree and lovely cafe with a great cup of hot chocolate to warm you up after the ice skating. Top marks.
"Written October 21, 2019","Disappointing overall, but dinosaur exhibit must be seen","As a biologist, I was very disappointed in this museum.  There are others that are much better.  For example, the natural history museum at Oxford is comparatively small but much more effectively presented.That said, the dinosaur exhibit is excellent and a must-see.  The tour of the exhibit begins by asking if communities of dinosaurs had organisms (species) filling different niches, just as do natural communities of mammals, at least before humans changed the natural order of things by, for example, removing top predators.  The display does an excellent job answering the question, and you will have to go there to get the answer.  This is an excellent thematic presentation of natural history.Don't look at the specimens in jars along the hall leading to the Darwin center.  They are poorly curated, and this is not a good example about how biological specimens in museums, which are very valuable, are curated.The remainder of the museum is variable in its presentation of natural history of different groups.  Nonetheless, it deserves to be seen; and hopefully everyone will gain a greater understanding and appreciation of the natural world.  "
"Written November 10, 2019",Excellent content. Very overcrowded ,"The museum is has its good and bad pointsThe good.- The quality and diversity of content is outstanding. There is a huge variety of exhibits. Others have commented on this. - A fantastic dinosaur section. Great for younger kids esp. the moving T-Rex. However the route through this section has been changed and, I guess due to the crowds, the elevated walkway has been closed. Most are are hung from the ceiling and so are best viewed from above on the elevated walkway rather than from below as now.- very good physical earth section. Very good descriptions about the exhibit (volcanoes, earthquakes etc)- A wonderful buildingThe not so good- The museum is tired and run down. Some displays are dated, many are dirty and the accompanying visuals and explanations are poor and low level in most places. The NY museum is far far better in this respect and shows how it should be done. The bad- The museum is very overcrowded. One can’t enjoy at weekends. This is because it is free. So it is overrun, noisy, chaotic in many parts, run down and obviously lacks investment and so is deteriorating.- Why does the UK permit this? Why not allow those of its citizens on social security to go in for free and charge everyone else, like every other museum of its class in other countries. That way the UK would stop subsidising tourists like me and the museum would have more money to spend on its upkeep and invest in its future. Overall it’s a lovely museum but avoid at the weekend. "
"Written November 7, 2019",Afternoon trip the the National History Museum,"I visited here with my 13 year old daughter. We were taken with the blue whale bones, Andy's clock and the the natural world area. We had coffee and hot chocolate which were nice in the central cafe. The surroundings and the building are beautiful. There is so much to see. We'd definitely love to go back some day."
"Written November 6, 2019",Wonderful museum!!, We happened to be staying a few blocks from the museum & everyone recommended it so we had to visit. It did not disappoint! My daughter loved the fossil exhibits & dinosaur exhibits. The moon simply was beautiful & fascinating to me. My husband loved the animals & watching our daughter take pix of her fav things. There were loads of school groups there but we never felt over - crowded. What a treasure of a museum to have in London!
"Written November 6, 2019",History,I really enjoyed the Natural History Museum. But I enjoyed most of all the gems and rocks. Hundreds of different types.
"Written November 6, 2019",Crowds of people,We stood in line for about 45mins and the queue was about 150 metres long. So many people were packed inside it was almost impossible to see any of the exhibits. As soon as you stopped to look you got jostled or someone went in front of you. We gave up and left
"Written November 6, 2019","Amazing place to visit, you can easily spend a full day here!","It is a great place to visit, especially if you have young children. It is great that it is a free museum ( there are some exhibitions which you will need to pay to enter). Section for dinosaurs is brilliant, especially if you have young children!. There is so much to see which you can easily spend the whole day. Also the building itself is very old and historical, don't miss it."
"Written November 5, 2019",Worth the visit,"Excellent exhibits, educational and interesting enough for one to get all caught up in reading and wanting to learn more about what they are seeing in front of them. It gets crowded but there will be moments when you can enjoy your viewing without a whole bunch of people crowding in front of you."
"Written November 5, 2019",Love it,Great place for small as adults you can be there half day and enjoy trip no fees and is much more better than scien museum i think was very boring we both love IT  tirex is great
"Written November 5, 2019",Mighty dinsaurs,Amazing place. Really reveals the wonder of nature especially of times past. Allow plenty of time to just look and absorb what is on display form the absolute tiny to the unbelievably enormous. Well worth a visit at any time. A fantastic way to spend a day. 
"Written November 5, 2019",Wildlife Photo Contest,"The Natural History Museum has a wonderful collection of all the things you would expect. It also has the Wildlfe Photography contest for 2019. This is the exhibit is 100of the top and class winning pictures that garnered awards. These photos are just stunning and each picture has a brief history of how, what, why and where it was taken. The exhibit runs to May of 2020 and advance purchase tickets are recommended by the staff."
"Written October 16, 2019",Great place to explore,"Visited on a Monday afternoon, very crowded in some places but a wonderful place to explore.Finding all of the small exhibits and fascinating information is part of the fun!I can imagine this place is great for children who love to learn!"
"Written October 15, 2019",Great if you love even a bit of science,"I love this place, every single time someone comes to visit me i take them there and not even a single person disliked this place."
"Written October 15, 2019",Very tired...,"They have some fantastic things in the collections, but the displays are really tired and unimaginative - straight from the 70's - and in desperate need of updating. A must visit I guess, but don't expect any inspired presentation...oh, it will be busy too of course..."
"Written October 14, 2019",Historic day out,Absolutely great day out. You can't fault it. Loads to see. It's absolutely free and entertaining. I would suggest anyone to visit.
"Written October 14, 2019",Amazing building,"Huge collection, very cool to check out.  The building interior itself is worth going in for.  Not overly geared towards kids."
"Written October 14, 2019",Must see," A must visit on your visit to London.  No fee to enter,only donations are welcomed.  Museum had replicas of dinosaurs, whales, and other mammals, human history,  earth beginning....The Moon sculpture is breathtaking and remembering. "
"Written October 14, 2019",Dinosaurs and a Bluewhale!,"The title says it all, but there is more to it.During weekends and Holidays there are hour long cues outside (in the rain).I don't think it is worth the wait.But when you can go there during the week before noon, you won't have to wait and can enjoy the exhibition.It's free of admission, but of course a donation is a nice thing.There are several Restaurants and Shops in there."
"Written October 14, 2019",Moon exhibit totally cool.  Easy to navigate,"Definitely a must on your next visit to London.  No fee to enter but donations are definitely welcomed.  Museum replicas of dinosaurs, whales, and other mammals - totally cool.  The Moon sculpture exhibit was breathtaking.  "
"Written October 14, 2019",amazing building full of wonders,"We visited late on a Friday afternoon when it wasn't too busy. This allowed for a more pleasant experience exploring the exhibits and taking in the historical information. The new wonders section is amazing, full of great items with a very good interactive learning  experience. The cafe was also pretty good, serving good coffee and a decent selection of food. Don't forget the science museum next door, it's equally as impressive"
"Written October 14, 2019",A great day to spend with the family,Great place to take young children to explore and wonder. Selfishly it is a place for adults to learn and get lost in learning. Highly recommend it!!
"Written November 3, 2019",The Best Natural History Museum in the UK!,"All schoolchildren in London go to this museum at least once - but it is better if they can go more than that. There is so much to see. It is worth knowing that the old Geological Museum entrance on Exhibition Road is easier to access (smaller queues) than the main entrance on Cromwell Road. When you go in, check out the minerals in the wall before going up the escalator to the earthquake machine. The old geological displays are worth viewing before getting into the biological exhibits.We took a junior school boy and girl from India and I was surprised that both enjoyed it much more than the Science Museum next door. There is so much to see in both - they are not to be missed!"
"Written November 3, 2019",Hungary,"Intresting exhibition we enjoyed it. Long quey at the entrance as it is free,but you can get in within short time. If you have time do not skip it."
"Written November 2, 2019",Best museum in the UK by far ,"Been coming her since w child and this place never fails to entertain kids and adults alike, beautiful architecture too!"
"Written October 31, 2019",A unique day!!!,Very impressive museum with fascinating exhibits. It was worth it visiting. Excellent for children and adults too.
"Written October 31, 2019",Amazing ,"Won't say too much apart from loads to do, beautiful building, could spend hours there, kids and adults! Loved it.  Easy to get to and so much to see.Highly recommended "
"Written October 30, 2019","An enormous, well organized, set of 5 collections!","This world famous ""Natural History"" Museum, highlights ""scientific excellence"", and was established 138 years ago.  It has a collection of about 80 million items, that are divided into 5 different themes/collections-- which will appeal to visitors of all ages.  The Museum (located near 2 other remarkable museums) can be readily reached by public transport (& admission is free).  The Museum has been awarded TripAdvisor's ""Certificate of Excellence"" [based on feedback from travellers like us].  The extensive collection, covering a huge area, is organized into 29 ""galleries"", which are then grouped into 4 main areas (each is ""colour coded"")... so, it would be advisable to think about one's priorities and then, at the information desk, ask where they are located.  In addition to a great gift shop, there are 5 restaurants/cafes--- one of which, T.Rex, is ""Dinosaur themed"".  A visit will be most memorable.I hope that this Review has been helpful."
"Written October 30, 2019",Full of fascinating things,Interesting exhibits in a beautiful building. Definitely worth a visit - you can spend several hours in here. I was particularly pleasantly surprised by the geology exhibits.
"Written October 30, 2019",Vienna Nat Hist Museum is FAR better!,"Anyone who has been to Vienna Natural History Museum would NOT be amazed by this museum. The entry hall seems rather poor and climbing up and down on the stairs did not make us happy. The vault with gems is amazing though, as well as 4,5 billion y old meteorite!Since my last visit the museum has been upgraded, I liked the apps, teaching kids, bringing them closer to nature!"
"Written October 29, 2019",Really interesting,Love the sculptures and the great historical artifacts.Really a good place to go to have an educational tour.
"Written October 28, 2019",Much to see,There was a lot of interest here and well displayed. Some of the labels etc needed refreshing as they were looking a bit tired. 
"Written November 18, 2019",Really impressed,"Took the kids here on a Saturday and they loved it, there is so much to see, you really need 3-4 hours to get around it all.Gets quite busy but wasn't horrendously so.Making a donation is made easy by card or cash when you go in."
"Written November 18, 2019",Lots and lots to see,"This museum offers way more than one can see in a day, maybe even a week. The building is beautiful and the collection enormous and very old. Definitely go here if you're visiting London. One downside, it's usually extremely packed with children. "
"Written November 17, 2019",Wild life exhibit ,I have been here for this exhibit the last couple of years. It is truly amazing to walk through so much history and then go for the wild life exhibit. I can recommend this place.
"Written November 17, 2019",Marvellous day out.,Sooooo much to see and do all under one roof. We spent the whole day in there and didn’t see everything. Leave plenty of time  to visit. 
"Written November 25, 2019",Very impressive museum ,This was my third visit to the museum and it was as thrilling as the first time. It covers many topics ranging from earthquakes to dinosaurs. It is suitable for all ages and there's a big emphasis on visualization of the exhibits. Highly recommend! 
"Written November 17, 2019","Wonderful place to explore and learn, but expect crowds","Loved the museum, but as with such a large facility, some areas were closed off that I would have loved to explore a bit. A wonderful docent was stationed to help teach more about items that would have been found in one of the areas closed for renovation, which was wonderful. It was both enjoyable and a bit overwhelming how many students where there for fieldtrips, but we anticipated this, given it was mid-week - so if you go, make sure to anticipate that! The credit card system went down about five minutes before we checked out with our items at the gift shop which, clearly wasn't their issue, but just wanted to forewarn others that it may be an intermittent issue as I had read about it happening previously in another review somewhere. All in all, staff were stellar, welcoming and friendly and we enjoyed our self-paced visit. "
"Written November 17, 2019",Enter into the center of the earth,"The escalator takes you into the belly of the earth , thats your entry inrto Natural History which is a wonderful museum well worth the visit. Some galleries have been updated and a few look dated but watching the kids go through was very cool as they were totally taken but low tech and high tech displays . A must visit"
"Written November 15, 2019",Wow,This was my first visit to the London History Museum and I wasn't disappointed.Lots to see and do and educational for children too.The added bonus was admission was free.A must see if visiting London.
"Written November 13, 2019",Speechless,"The building itself, is utterly beautiful, magnificently so. We were moved to tears ( quite literally ) by the sheer beauty of the place.Then on top of that you get the exhibitions! All together a fantastic visit, and it's free, although we gave £10 each. Unparalleled value!"
"Written November 12, 2019",A great flying whale over you,Or at least the skeleton... it’s an impressive collection of natural wonders that varies from the dinosaurs to the moon.Maybe you need a couple of days to really visit all what is there. 
"Written November 11, 2019",Solo adult visit,"Remember going as a youngster, and when my children were younger want to see what it was like now.Wirth notting  if you want a map you need to pay. There are however maps on the wall and posts through out the museum.Dinosaurs, mamamal, whales and dolphins were good. There is pleanty of interaction opportunity even as an adult in the whales and dolphins.  Seeing the Blue Whale(in the enterance hall) and The Museum of the Moon when it gad gone dark was amazing and well worth that photo."
"Written November 25, 2019",Best Day Ever,"I had the best Day ever at Natural History Museum. The building was in itself amazing. They had activity books for children, so it's well suited to bring kids (maybe not the youngest ones <4 y/o).I was crying inside of joy the whole time because it was all so great. Dinasours, mammals, gems, minerals, sea shells, creepy creatures, and so on. I had hoped the Human Evolution area had more models of extinct homos/humans tho. We didn't get to see everything on one day, so we will definetely go back!"
"Written November 25, 2019",Excellent,"These museums are always overwhelming. The dinosaur exhibit is really nice. The animatronic t-rex is really cool. It was very busy, so hard to get around. A free museum, though--you can't complain. The moon exhibition was also really cool and the evolution area always interests me too."
"Written November 25, 2019",An interesting place to visit for every one.,"We visited this place on a Saturday afternoon.  There was a bit of  queue but we didn't have long to wait.  We went first to the Dinosaur section and the first thing you see on the entrance hall is a dinosaur hanging from the ceiling.  They have a couple of working models.  The only thing I wasn't too happy about was having to follow a line via a cordoned off sectipn, but I suppose it stops any  chaos.  There were a lot of families there and most of the children found it exciting.  We also had a look at the room of the moon, which was quite interesting and the bird section and saw Guy.the Gorilla who had died in the late 1970's.  Well worth a visit.on a rainy afernoon. "
"Written November 24, 2019",Best gift shop for kids!,It is a wonderful Museum that could take days to cover completely. It has several gift shops that have great gifts for kids. Gorgeous building too!
"Written November 23, 2019",AMAZING........,"You don't get much for free in this world, but OMG !!!! If only to look at the building you must go. What a place. There is something to look at from every angle. As for the content.... there is more than enough for you to while away a good 3-4 hours. The exhibitions are amazing and it's good to see that there is always something else in nature that will blow you away. A souvenir brochure was only a fiver and full of glossy pictures. Entry is free and there is opportunity to donate , £5 is recommended and is well worth it. "
"Written November 23, 2019",One of my favorite musea ever!,"This museum is cool, not just for kids but everyone. The collection is HUGE and very impressive. The animals, dinosaurs, mammals, stones, minerals and so much more! It's a very nice way to learn about planet earth and it's animals, what roamed our planet millions of years ago. The only thing that could be better was the mammal part, it felt a bit outdated compared to the rest of the museum. The building itself is absolutely stunishing, beautiful architecture and the ceiling is just WOW! You can easily spend an entire day here if you would like, but also pick different sections of your choice. Like the title said: One of my favorite musea in the world. You must go see this!PS. The Museum of the Moon is REALLY nice!"
"Written November 21, 2019",Fantastic in every way,Take all the family. There isn't enough time in the day to see it all and so kid friendly. Not to be missed.
"Written November 20, 2019",Simply amazing,"It would take to long to write a review on this wonderful place. We spent over four hours looking through history and enjoyed every minute, I would however recommend wearing good comfy shoes."
"Written November 18, 2019",Take the time to read about the history of this place.,"My daughter and I wandered in and spent hours here. The architecture and the history behind it is enough to enchant you and then there are all the displays, the uncovered bones and history behind them, the dinosaurs and exhibits of all sorts of animals. I liked that there was a note on one exhibit that was admittedly looking a little frayed by the many years but that these animals would not be replaced because they no longer believe in killing and mounting the body for display. I really appreciated that so much and found that to be an honorable note to this beautiful museum. Look for the carvings every where of monkeys and birds and other animals in the staircases and beams. There is a Moon display lit up and people were laying on the floor beneath it. It truly was so gorgeous. My daughter and I absolutely loved wandering thru here. "
"Written October 14, 2019",Moon exhibit totally cool.  Easy to navigate,"Definitely a must on your next visit to London.  No fee to enter but donations are definitely welcomed.  Museum replicas of dinosaurs, whales, and other mammals - totally cool.  The Moon sculpture exhibit was breathtaking.  "

"Written October 10, 2019",A great day out!,"Excellent FREE museum to see! Easy access with a pram/buggy. The displays were excellent, the architecture is wonderful, staff were fabulous especially downstairs in the Exploration room where the children could take fossils and look under the microscopes and draw and explore. Even for a toddler! Loved the Andy clock and the T-Rex display! Lunch was great also in the T-Rex Grill! Very Family Friendly!"

"Written October 9, 2019",Great visit but very busy,"Went with family in July 2019. Mainly spent time in dinosaur and space areas of the museum. It was VERY busy and this did make it difficult to see everything, however would be fabulous if went during a quieter time."
"Written October 9, 2019",A wonderful experience,Many non-English speakers think this is going to be the NATIONAL not Natural history museum. There is so much to see here and even if fossils or minerals are not your tging it's a great place. The shop is also very good.

"Written October 8, 2019",This place is huge and very informative,This place is  HUGE. one full day is not enough to visit all the different halls. I was particularly amazed by the science exhibition and the dinosaurs skeletons. There is also a huge airplane museum
"Written October 7, 2019",Fabulous Architecture and contents,"The first thing you see is the beautiful architecture of the building.  That in itself is worth seeing.  The contents, from the dinosaurs in the breathtaking main hall to the gem collection upstairs is extraordinary.  You would have to go back several times to see it all.  We especially liked the “moon room”.  That was special.The only downside was how crowded it was.  Maybe next time we will wait until school is back in session.  Also, the food in the cafe was high priced and not very good."

"Written October 7, 2019",A must visit for science and history lovers.,"Apart from the magnificent blue whale skeleton hanging from the roof, the museum is filled with enormous treasure of all times.

"Written October 6, 2019",Amazing ,What a day out the dinosaur section is truly amazing. So life like I even got a fright lol the ques are pretty long but if you have an autistic child where you can show evidence.  You can skip the ques
"Written October 6, 2019",Spectacular,"An amazing museum, so much to see and do, plan what you will see/ do if possible as it can get very busy and noisy.  It can be a little overwhelming for younger visitors so try to go at less busy times, e.g not school holidays when queues can be crazy long.There is a cloakroom to leave things in but call ahead to find out about bulky items e.g large bags.  There is also a large colour coded eating area in the basement of the museum that is accessible by lift and stairs.  You can take a little picnic or buy there, food can be a little pricy especially if you are in a large group.  There are also lots of free activities throughout the day some practical, some demonstrations, all very interesting.  Whenever I go with my children we always discover something new. It’s definitely a gem."
"Written October 3, 2019",Very interesting ,Always a different show on and the general halls are full of treasures from the past.Certainly a good way to learn something and spend a day out. Excellent for kids
"Written October 2, 2019",Back after many years,"It's been over 50 years since visiting this place and as you can gather it's changed quite a lot, plenty to see and inactive with. Plenty of cafe shops in various places around the site.Had just over half a day here and would think you need at least a full day if not longer.And it's free to get , so worth a visit if in the area"
"Written October 2, 2019","Crowded, not much to see, does anyone clean ANYTHING?","We went during the week in the morning and apparently that was a ""low crowd"" time to visit. I don't know how that can be, but whatever. It was nothing but dozens and dozens of school trips and kids running amok with no supervision whatsoever. You can't actually see or read anything because there are so many people standing in front of whatever you want to look at. I was excited about the dino exhibit--heard it's really good--and i was disappointed to say the least. What's so great about it? There were hardly any fossils in there. It was dark which made it feel even more claustrophobic than it already naturally was. Most of it was reading posters of things that aren't that interesting instead of looking at specimens. The whole one-way road they push you through was irritating. Even if you got to the front of the people crowded around to read something, it wasn't long before you were pushed down the corridor. Whose idea was that?And for the love God, does anyone DUST anything in that museum?? There is literally an inch of dust covering EVERYTHING. The dinosaurs and everything else looked positively FURRY. It was seriously distracting and a disgusting turn-off. This place has been open for over 130 years and nobody has thought to dust your displays even ONCE?? I wouldn't go back to this place if someone paid me. Visit the Cast Court at Victoria & Albert's if you want to see something cool."
"Written October 1, 2019",Awesome,Amazing place with lots of interesting things for learning. Only downside it that the isn't enough information for people with disabilities  
"Written September 30, 2019",Wonderful!,"Visited the Natural History Museum with my wife and two kids, 7 and 10 years of age. We all loved the experience. It is free to enter but you are asked to make a donation. The museum is VAST so much so that a full day could be spent here exploring. There is so much to do and see. Couldn't recommend a visit highly enough."

"Written September 28, 2019",We all loved it!,"Wow, visually everything you see is amazing! My sons 9 and 5 thoroughly enjoyed it especially the younger one. We got there as soon as it opened and some levels we had to ourselves for a short while. You can take your own picnic and go to a designated place to eat it. I wanted to buy a cake but the price £2.90-£3.90, thank goodness I don’t live in London! "
"Written October 6, 2019",So many interesting things to see! ,"Went to the museum as it was close to our Airbnb and I’m so glad we did! First thing you should know is it is free, which is helpful when you’re traveling and already spending a lot of money. The inside was incredible! Stepping into the main hall where the blue whale skeletons hangs from the ceiling.. I felt like I was at Hogwarts! There are so many incredible and informative exhibits. The collection of animals is fantastic to see their sheer size alone! We also got to see the temporary moon exhibit which was fascinating. I would highly encourage going to this museum for a few hours and getting lost in history!"

"Written October 6, 2019",A tour to the Natural History Museum,The exhibited articles were plentiful and marvellous! The range of display from ancient relics up to the recent discovery enlightened me to know more about the lives on earth so much. A place very worthy to visit.
"Written October 6, 2019",My fav museum in London!!,"Even someone are not interesting in museums, I am sure that he/she will love it. You need to spend a lot of time but it deserve it!!! Enjoy it."
"Written October 5, 2019",Great for kids!,The architecture is very interesting as is the great hall (with blue whale and other large skeletons). We also enjoyed the section on human evolution.
"Written October 5, 2019",A 'Not Miss',"There are things in the museum that were not especially interesting (I am not big on geology) and, to be honest, having been very disappointed with the Museum of Natural History in New York, I was not enthusiastic about visiting this one. Glad I changed my mind. The dinosaur exhibit, in particular, was worth the visit on its own. The building itself is similarly something which is worth seeing just for itself."
"Written October 5, 2019",Excellent,"Second time I have been now have taken both grandsons, if we did not live so far away would go on a regular basis, you need many visits to get round, what was disappointing that a number of people in front of us just did not put any donation in at all which I think is wrong for such a wonderful experience."
"Written October 5, 2019",wow the architecture!,I popped in fairly briefly and took a few photos of the stunning building and somehow found myself in the cafe which was quiet.  Helpful staff and great layout.  Loads to see and do.
"Written October 3, 2019",Amazing ,"We loved it here, it’s just amazing. You could easily spend an entire day and you would not be bored. There are various zones throughout the museum exploring different things and there is something for everyone, from dinosaurs to how the human body works, the Darwin collection which contains some truly extraordinary specimens, to precious gems. There was a huge range of interactive displays providing a wealth of information for both adults and children, and staff on hand to provide more information for those who were interested. Some of their specimens were nothing short of spectacular and it was one of the highlights of our trip. If we are ever back in London we will definitely come back here! "
"Written October 3, 2019",Spectacular building and exhibits,"We were only there for a short time as we had already been to the V & A museum next door for a large part of the day.  What a contrast both externally and internally!  Entrance is free but they request donations to help maintain the incredible museum.  We gave our donation and then paid £1 for map of the building/exhibits which was extremely useful! We really only viewed the ground floor exhibits; dinosaurs, mammals, marine invertebrates, fishes, amphibians and reptiles and the moon. All the children around were mesmerised by the huge animatronic dinosaur! What a spectacular building, inside and out.  I found the brickwork as fascinating as the exhibits, inset with fishes, lobsters and crabs and also the birds and creepers climbing up pillars!We also went into the ground floor cafe for a much needed drink.  The cakes looked delicious but we resisted!I certainly want to return to ‘do’ the incredible museum thoroughly.  It just whetted my appetite for more."
"Written September 22, 2019",Too Packed to Stay. ,"Today the museum was populated by uncontrolled kids with uncaring parents who stood in conversation whilst their offspring ran around like they were in a public park. Couldn’t view exhibits for ignorant people not looking, not walking, just blocking the way. I haven’t been for years, and I don’t recommend it to anyone who doesn’t suffer fools gladly. "
"Written September 22, 2019",The Highlight London.,This place is simply mind blowing. Staggering exhibits in a truly spectacular building. We only had a few hours here but enjoyed every minute. You could spend a week in this place quite easily.
"Written September 22, 2019",Exceptional,"What a building, what a place! So much to see and do. Our 6yr old daughter absolutely loved seeing all the various exhibits, particularly the birds, creepy crawlies and of course, the awesome dinosaurs, as did we. A must see place. You could spend hours here. Plenty of places to eat as well. Thoroughly recommended!"
"Written September 22, 2019",Just amazing,"Unbelievable. Kids loved it, so much to see, need to go again as didn't have time to absorb everything. Kids were thoroughly engrossed in everything and loved the dinosaur! Can't wait to return (may go without the kids next time ha ha!)."
"Written September 21, 2019",Exciting and eerie at the same time.,"When you first enter you will be in ore of the size of some of the subjects, but at the same time you are completely captured with the tour information, it’s gripping."
"Written September 20, 2019",Mad in the school holidays ,Absolutely rammed on a sunny August day so I cannot imagine what it would be like on a rainy day! Lots to see but slightly ruined by the crowds. Can recommend the picnic area in the basement as it was much quieter than anywhere else and had a little coffee shop too!
"Written September 19, 2019",Wowowowowowow,A great way to spend a few hours as we did on the last day in London before we went to the airport.  Stunning building and excellent interactive and well presented displays. Easy to get to as the South Kensington Tube Station is very close by
"Written September 19, 2019",I was expecting way more than what i saw,Its was ok ! Not more than that. There are some exhibition and the entrance is free. I think this museum is more for kids.
"Written September 18, 2019",Disappointing, Very difficult to navigate around and the so missed areas. Lady in the cafe was so sullen made us feel we were disturbing her just to get served. 
"Written September 17, 2019",Enough for a whole day!,"If you’re planning to visit, I have two tips;1. Make sure you have a whole day free for it! There’s a lot there!2. Don’t go during the school holidays! Me and my girlfriend made that mistake in August! Absolutely heaving! Couldn’t even get round a tiny section without clipping the heals of toddlers and being run over by careless chavvy mums with pushchairs. Probably best if you don’t take much stuff with you because it you want to put it in the cloakroom I’d suggest you take out a mortgage for doing so. Same if you want to use the café. There’s so much to see, and so much to read that you simply can’t take it all in. From rare crystals to dinosaurs (and no I’m not still talking about the clientele!). So much interactivity to enjoy, not just for kids - I learnt so much in the optical illusion section about how your brain sees things for example. So much to see and do and incredible architecture!"
"Written September 28, 2019",Full day of activities ,"If you are looking for something to do check it out as they always have something going on, that caters for different audiences. "
"Written September 27, 2019",Exciting visit for all of us ,"My child loved the dinosaurs section and also the earthquake simulation part.  For us, it was a reinforcement of how many things we can still learn!!!! We can’t wait to go back! People were friendly. The entry was free of charge but you can make a donation if you want. "
"Written September 26, 2019",Great variety of exhibits to explore,"This museum is massive and is gorgeous on both the outside and the inside. We really enjoyed the massive variety of things to see. The dinosaur skeletons were the main draw for us, but the taxidermy of the animal kingdom was very good too. The robot dinosaurs were a fun addition. This museum is very kid friendly, some of the information might be not as extensive as an adult would want to read."
"Written September 26, 2019",Plan on more than one dày!,We only had 1 day here and were exhausted before getting half way round.  I advise spending several days and going to 1 gallery per day.
"Written September 26, 2019","Amazing, my favourite museum","I love everything about it. Amazing exhibitions like the Venom exhibition, Whale exhibition 🐋. Amazing fossils, Birds 🦅 and a lot more"
"Written September 24, 2019",Come to prehistoric times,"As most London musea, this is free of charge and fun to go. Big beautiful Victorian building adjecent to the V&A museum. Magnificient collection!"
"Written September 23, 2019",Amazing for free museum,Loved the building and the atmosphere. Amazing architecture. And it is for free.Coffee served by two italian girls.
"Written September 23, 2019",Natural History Museum ,One of my favorite museum in London. The architecture of the building is absolutely stunning the grand hall itself is worth the visit with Victorian architecture; and the treasures inside date back thousands of years. Best part is that It’s free (you can make donations)Such an amazing place. The dinosaurs fossils are great for all ages and there's good depth to the science and culture for adults. Highly recommended!
"Written September 23, 2019",As always fabulous,Just go.  It will wear you out with knowledge.  It’s free fun educational and well organized.  The building itself is also fascinating
"Written September 23, 2019",I managed to visit the Giant Ground Sloth again after 40 years.,"I had visited the Natural History Museum with my sister about 40 years ago, and still remembered being awestruck by the Giant Ground Sloth reconstruction. I found it again, and was so glad he/she had not been 'mothballed' somewhere. Still is awesome !! And so is the rest of the museum. We spent a wonderful several hours touring the exhibits, and could have spent much longer, but had other things on our agenda, and so moved on. Not to be missed when in London.  "
"Written August 31, 2019",So much to see ! Great for all ages ! ,"Second time visiting this amazing museum  and haven’t been disappointed. Polite and helpful staff, clean and tidy. So much to see and do ! Second time visiting and still not seen it all !! 2 must see areas are Blue Zone ; Dinosaurs and Mammals defiantly a highlight! And Red Zone ; volcanoes/ earthquakes and Human Evolution my highlights of the area! Must see T-Rex, Blue Whale and experience the earthquake room !  Central cafe nice for snakes or cold food but if wanting a meal recommend T-Rex Grill, with great decor! Great accessibility for people who struggle to walk , my mam came with me this time who struggles with osteoarthritis and made her way around fine ☺️Looking forward to my next visit !! "
"Written August 30, 2019",Excellent museum,Very interesting museum for adults & kids. Get there very early to avoid long queues & wait times to get in.  
"Written August 30, 2019",Fascinating place!,Great for kids and adults... Awesome dinosaur fossil collection.  You can easily spend a couple of days exploring this museum!
"Written August 30, 2019",Amazing,An amazing day at the London History Museum.  We could have spent weeks there.  The dinosaur exhibition was incredible.  The building is also incredibly beautiful.  My girls loved reading about all the animals and was to see the extinct ones.  Definitely worth it.
"Written August 30, 2019",A favorite,"This museum is my favorite museum in London, it´s great for children and adults has it has so many different species and things to see and do. I really enjoyed the dinosaur exhibition, very well done but I liked the entrance better when they had Dippy"
"Written August 29, 2019",Busy but fabulous ,Extremely busy bank holiday Monday. We didn't have long so raced around to try and see everything. Would love to go back and spend longer. Brilliant exhibits and lovely cafe!
"Written August 29, 2019",A bit disappointing,"Extremely crowded! To the point when u can’t enjoy what u came for! We were probably expecting more, but the exhibitions were not amusing at all and we would have preferred to go to a different museum instead. I can only advise to come with kids who can be easily amused there."
"Written August 28, 2019",Amazing and free ,"Coming from Australia where you have to pay an entry fee for every museum, it was a pleasant surprise to only be requested to make a small donation. This place has exhibits for people of all ages but the building itself is nothing short of spectacular. "
"Written August 27, 2019",Piece of Art,"This museum has transformed science, specifically the theory of evolution, as an art form. I cannot describe this museum better than a top notch piece of art."
"Written August 27, 2019",Knockout dinosaur collecrion,This rivals the natural history museum in New York!  Beautiful collection... so thoughtfully and tastefully put together!  The facilities are a bit tricky to navigate with a pram but still a must see! 
"Written September 10, 2019",Amazing,"Visited with a 10 yo old boy, unfortunately we had only 2 hours to run thru the museum. Interactive, informative, one of the top attractions of London."
"Written September 9, 2019",A natural history lovers paradise!!!!! Incredible architecture A wealth of information and learning resources....!!!!!,There is nothing quite like this place.. Situated in Kensington...You feel like you're in another world... So much to discover...It takes your breath away..What an insight to this amazing planet we live in.. Impossible to describe here.. You need to visit to take in the scope of this awe inspiring day out! And for free entry too.... Let's here it for London!!!!
"Written September 8, 2019",Flatters to Deceive - relies on its reputation,"I have looked forward to going here since I was a child.Whilst I enjoyed many of the exhibits, I was disappointed by the following:1. The dinosaur exhibition is a shambles - dark, dingy and cramped - akin to walking through Ikea. There was no room to step back and savour the models at all.2 The restaurant is ridiculously expensive and the food poor. Cleanliness of the food area was also poor.3 The exhibits in the main hall are poorly chosen. The whale is disappointing in scale, far less imposing than the full size model in the animal hall4 The moon exhibition was a waste of a room. A giant paper mache moon. Really?5 The wildlife garden is the biggest waste of space in London. Overall, there are some amazing exhibits but the staging is very poor."
"Written September 8, 2019",Nice Exhibition of Nature,"Comprehensive look into nature complete with lots of dinosaur exhibits. The extremely large whale was most impressive. During our visit, a special exhibit with a model of the moon lit up a giant darkened room. The museum was very busy on a Sunday with many family visits - travelers would probably get a better experience on weekdays..."
"Written September 8, 2019","Interesting overall, excellent for families","Excellent family oriented natural history museum, with many hands on and explanatory exhibits about our natural world. And beneath those, you can see the bones of an older approach to museum curation. This is obviously true architecturally, with Victorian design and brickwork popping out here and there, but also in some exhibits. Some galleries display birds and animals with classic approaches to taxidermy (and a few comparative anatomy displays even have century old labels). Wish we'd had more time, and maybe a few grandchildren to share the visit with!"
"Written September 8, 2019",Don't go on the weekend,"Its not one of my highest rated museums. The architecture of the building itself is stunning! I think we made the mistake of going on a weekend. After the intial 30 minute line up to get in the front door it was full of familys with todlers and small children running around, personally just not my scene for a museum. The moon installation was very cool. The red zone was probably the best. It was a little upsetting that the dinosaur section was geared towards 4 year olds but glad that the next generation can enjoy it."
"Written September 8, 2019",Awe inspiring.,Beautiful building in the heart of Kensington. The variety of the natural world is represented here in all its glory. The children will love it.
"Written September 7, 2019",Fabulous!!,We were staying within a mile of Museum so decided to walk!! Great area for shopping and restaurants. grocery called Waitrose is similar to Aldi and very reasonable!The Museum is absolutely massive and FREE!! What a nice surprise as London is pricey!!We did make a donation and started our day! Spent over an hour in the mineral room & vault!! There is a room with the moon and it makes you feel like you are there!! Loved it!!We spent 4 hours and enjoyed it so much!! Purchased their bundle special with two books and a tote!!Hope to go back again before we leave !!Lots of walking but plenty of benches and lifts for all ages!!!Nice Cafe with variety of foods!!Lovely Pots of yes too!!❤️A definite “MUST SEE”
"Written September 7, 2019",Excellent ,London has some of the best museums in the world. The lines weren't too long and the staff did process everyone through quite quickly. The preservation of all the exhibitions were great.To see so much natural history is definitely a privilege. Bathrooms were accessible and the food was a little more expensive but that is expected. It was crowded but that is because it is school holidays at the moment
"Written September 6, 2019",Lovely but dated,As a biologist science museums are always on the top of my list of things to do when I travel. My teenage son and I enjoyed our visit to the museum but in compared to other science museums this one is rather old fashioned which is in charming but limiting. Most areas have limited opportunities to interact with the displays and instead the focus is on reading the posted signs. 
"Written August 18, 2019",So fun! Amazing exhibits!,Great place for the whole family to visit!! Lots to see and do. Enormous skeletons and fossils. 15 billion year journey from the Big Bang/Flaring Forth till now. Volcano and earthquake exhibit. 😁
"Written August 18, 2019",Fantastic,"Could quite easily spend weeks in this place. Very informative, very well designed and, best of all, free"
"Written August 18, 2019",One word - Amazing,"In my opinion this is one of the best places to visit in London. It’s great for young and old and everyone can take away so egy from here. From architecture of the building to the amazing displays.And what is most amazing, entry is free.You simply must visit."
"Written August 17, 2019",Interesting place to visit.,"An amazing place to visit, full of interesting and unusual things to look at. Very clean and staff very friendly and welcoming. Allow a good 3 hours to explore, gets very busy especially when it's raining...allow extra time."
"Written August 17, 2019",Amazing place but just SO busy,"Came here on a wet Friday afternoon with my wife and 2 kids (10 and 13) so it was SO very busy. Point one - use the side entrance. When the main entrance has massive queues, go to the side entrance because the queues are so much smaller!!It's great that the museum is free but it makes for a packed museum. We got about 90 minutes to walk around. Went to see the dinosaurs and the moon exhibit as well as wander around a few of the other exhibits. Would have liked more time but it was just not to be.Had a drink in a cafe (be warned - the baguettes were nearly £8 each!!) then headed off again. This really is a wonderful museum bit it suffers for its' popularity and free entry which means you are constantly fighting with the sheer number of people there."
"Written August 16, 2019",Dull,"I had high expectations for this as it’s such a popular attraction but as a young couple 24/25 we found it rather dull. There was a lot of information to be read, I think it would’ve been a lot more interesting if there had been interactive activities throughout."
"Written August 16, 2019",Fantastic free museum,"We have visited this museum many times over the years,but there is always something new to discover. Lots to see and do for all ages. the queing to get in can be tedious depending on the time of day you visit. Close to underground stations and other museums."
"Written September 16, 2019","A feast for the soul, both young and old","I haven't been here since I was about the age of my son I was taking (9). I could, in all honesty, remember very little about the place.First impression was the magnificence of the building on approach which is simply stunning. Then, that magical first moment of walking in and seeing the suspended giant skeleton and seeing my son's face. From then on, it was just a magical tour of all things fascinating, with fabulous variation of activities, interactive bits, films and so much more.The Moon exhibit, despite its simplicity, is utterly enchanting.We spent a few hours here in the midst of a busy day's action and could easily have spent much longer.The fact that this spectacular museum, which is better than just about any museum you can name, is free just makes me love the place even more.An essential visit for families."
"Written September 14, 2019",Well it was a bit dull really and the man on the door was abusive asking for money!,We took some Filipino friends to the natural hisrory meseum but the displays were mostly out of the 1950's and certainly not attuned to an international audience. I felt the man on the door was abusive askign for money in the way he did to what should be a free experience which was frankly shameful. I will not take people there again from abroad.
"Written September 13, 2019",Soo much to see😁,Visited here on a Wednesday so it was relatively quiet. So much to see here that you need a few hours to take it all in. Some well put together exhibits and displays and a variety of themed areas made it all well worth the trip. 
"Written September 13, 2019",A good day out but always crowded and hot,"We've visited the museum a few times and always find it interesting to visit.  I'm still not sure if we've seen all of the rooms there as it's bit like a warren. Whatever time of day we go, it always seems to be rammed with people, and probably because it's an old building with lovely architecture, it's not been fitted out with any modern features such as air con so I usually end up sweating buckets walking around the museum.Not impressed with the cafe food as there is nothing plain and simple like a cheese sandwich or a burger on offer, it's more a chickpea salad type of place."
"Written September 12, 2019",Disappointing,"We came to the NHM and were looking forward to it. My husband had been a few years ago and really enjoyed it. Upon arrival, it was really busy, given that it was summer that wasn't surprising. Overall, we found the museum to be quite dull and the setup poor. For example, in the dinosaur area, it is almost set up like a really narrow corridor. When it is busy, it is impossible to even stop and look at stuff. You are just constantly being pushed through. Many of the setups also felt very childish and certainly aimed at a young audience.We both said that we were glad we didn't have to pay to visit here."
"Written August 16, 2019",Overwhelming!,"  I'm not sure where to begin.  This was the largest museum I've ever gone to.  There was art work from every one of the greatest artists that I've only heard of.  You could easily spend a few days here, if you have time!  Most of the museums in London are free, so cost is not a factor.  I would definitely be back in the future to see what I missed"
"Written August 15, 2019",Just wow,"I spent the evening at the NHM celebrating a wedding and without a doubt, the venue made the event what it is. The grand hall which we were situated in was absolutely beautiful where the scenic view such as the remnants of the dinosaur was something I just couldn’t take my eyes off. A great event and an exceedingly fantastic venue. "
"Written August 15, 2019",One Amazing Museum!!,We visited here recently and were amazed at the sheer size of the building and the number of things that were inside this fantastic museum. I loved every moment of it. This is perfect also as a rainy day activity for families. We look forward to coming again soon. 
"Written September 12, 2019",national treasure,dinosaurs and history what's not to like oh yeah and its free! great day out for kids and adults alike. very busy in the school holidays but beautiful. ive attended events here too that are great. ice skating in the winter too.
"Written September 12, 2019",Museum of theMoon,This so called Museum of the Moon was somewhat a disappointment as there was not much to see apart from artist’s module of the moon which we lit in. Darkened vistibule.This was only a small section of the Natural History Museum itself which is world of its own.
"Written September 11, 2019",It's a must visit for history buffs,"Make sure to give yourself a full day here so that you can take everything in. The place is huge and well curated, lots of interesting things to see "
"Written September 11, 2019",Fantastic ,"This without doubt is the best attraction in London and I would go as far to say one of the best attractions in the world.Every person will take something different from the museum. Young, old, Male or female. There is something for everyone.A true credit to the UK. You could spend days there and still discover something new and learn loads.Amazing "
"Written September 10, 2019",Very dated and dull,I was disappointed to find that very little had changed at the museum. The Cocoon is a new installation and quite interesting but still full of models and stuffed animals.
"Written August 27, 2019",Fantastic,Quite simply the best natural History museum in the World. Nothing I have been to can compare. Thankyou 
"Written August 27, 2019",Take the Private Tour!,"The museum is incredible, but I can’t recommend the private tour enough. We saw specimens not on public display that we’re still talking about two months later."
"Written August 26, 2019",Fantastic Museum,This amazing museum is free and has many exhibits on several levels.  Must sees include 25-meter blue whale hanging from the ceiling and the dinosaur collection.  A great place for the family. Plan to spend at least 2 hours here.
"Written August 26, 2019",Amazing museum ,I visit this museum every time I come here is absolutely amazing has so much to keep the kids entertained and is free in (apart from the donation box) Museum cafe is great too which caters for kids as well as adults 
"Written August 25, 2019",Day out with my Grandson ,Fantastic day out for all ages then popped next door to the science museum another great museum to visit but need more than a day to fully appreciate it 
"Written August 25, 2019",Great but come prepares,NHM is a must if visiting London but be warned. Take drinks with you. I purchased 4 bottles of water and it cost £9!!! London is expensive enough without being ripped off for water too
"Written August 25, 2019",A must see for any London visit,This place blew me away with what it offers across the whole history of the world. You could spend days here exploring and investigating natural history.  There is so much to see and take in it blows you away.  The use of the displays in the way the progress takes you on an adventure.  Just put this on your must do list.
"Written August 24, 2019",A must see in London,"Our and our five year old child's favourite museum in London.Free,easy to reach,with a good and not expensive restaurant but most of all with a great permanent exhibition of dinosaurs you will surely fall in love with!"
"Written August 24, 2019",Excellent visit,"Took the boy to visit the Dino bones! He was so excited we had to tour the exhibit twice. This is a FREE museum. It is crowded but worth it. They have stegosaurus, allosaurus, iguanadon, and a sauropod- all full skeletons. They have an anamatonic T Rex too. "
"Written August 23, 2019",Amazing!,This museum is absolutely fantastic and with free entry! I have always wanted to visit this museum and on a recent trip we managed to fit it in. I was blown away by the artifacts and other sights in there. Definitely one to visit again and the gift shop was filled with everything you could think of!
"Written September 5, 2019",Avoid queues,"The Natural History Museum was #1 on my to-see-list of London. The queues in the morning are a no-go though. Luckily, if you only go in the afternoon, you can avoid the queue and still get lots of time to explore. The whale in the main hall is a sight to behold. Although there are many people, the museum is quite large and the masses scatter. Always worth a visit."
"Written September 5, 2019",a winner with all,so much to see and do here for every one but take your time dont do a tour save your money and look around in your own time have been coming for here for over 40 years and there is still so much to see in this wonderful building
"Written September 4, 2019",Mesmerize visit,"One word, Amazing, although I was on a weekend, the amount of people didn't interrupt at all the wonderful visit. Very interesting exhibitions organized in a very clear and easy way to find your way "
"Written September 4, 2019",Great time ,I visited with my wife and two kids (five and nine) they had a  great time and so did we. It was busy but not too busy. My son really loved the Lego build an alien part which was a free add on 
"Written September 4, 2019",Very informative ,Great place beautiful building jam packed with information old and new. Something of interest for everyone. Staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. Can't believe there's no admission fee although there are donation boxes which i did contribute too.Great day out its a must place to visit.
"Written September 3, 2019",Enormous and full of amazing stuff ,"Incredible building,  amazing architecture and so full of incredible specimens.  It was very crowded the day we were there with many schools doing end of year trips, so that was a bit challenging at times but couldn't be helped.   Our only issue was the lack of air circulation,   everything was very stuffy so we found ourselves needing to head outside regularly for some fresh air. Would definitely recommend if museums and animals are your thing."
"Written September 2, 2019",Absolutely brilliant,"I can't recommend the natural history museum enough. I took the children during the school summer holidays. It was busy but not overcrowded, we didn't have to queue to get in. There is just so much to see here, we could easily have spent an entire day walking around. The museum itself is immaculate and everything is in great working order, far better than the nearby science museum. I don't think I've ever been to a museum with so many artifacts and so much information about each subject. I would urge people to consider donating to the museum, if they are able to, there are plenty of contactless machines and donation spots. This sort of museum must cost a fortune to run and we're so lucky to be able to visit for free."
"Written September 1, 2019",Wonderful educational museum,"This is a fabulous museum, with incredible displays and interactive opportunities.   Great for all ages.  Only problem is the crowds, at least on the day we visited. (Saturday in August)  One should try for a quieter time.  Old great museum that has been updated.  Well worth the visit."
"Written August 31, 2019",Best attraction in London,Very interesting and worth it! Great for kids and adults...it is also right next to science museum. That is day out in London right there. 
"Written August 31, 2019",Surely one of the world's greatest museums,"Even if you have no interest in natural history you should at least go and see the building, it's absolutely stunning with, seemingly, every column and block individually designed. My 10 year old daughter adores the place and insists we go every time we come to London to, as a minimum, see Hope the blue whale. Yes, it is very crowded and some of the exhibits are a bit tired and dated but we all still love it."
"Written August 22, 2019",Amazing,"We loved the space centre on the 3rd floor, very informative and lots to do. we loved it. The air space also is very interesting with lots of rockets, planes and historic memorabilia. "
"Written August 22, 2019",Cathy,"We went there after we had visited the Science Museum. Planning the visit is great advice as it is definitely busy and you can easily get carried away and not see anything in detail. The whale is impressive, the dinosaurs and also the volcanos and earthquakes were our favourites. We did them first thing and enjoyed them thoroughly. "
"Written August 22, 2019",Great day out with lots too see...,Great place to visit especially the large displays - our little man loved it taking pictures of everything in sight from the huge blue whale to the colossal squid and everything in between. It can be a bit busy but all in all it was ok for us. We visited early enough in the morning when crowds were a bit less but they steadily grew as the day went on. Some kids might get bored after a while especially after all of the bigger displays have been completed- but all in all would highly recommend.
"Written August 21, 2019",The main hall...just stunning,"Lots of hands on stuff for little ones, so many different rooms to explore & displays to enjoy. Showing my kids the whale that i first saw as a kid was a highlight of this trip. Museum staff directed us to a second entrance from the subway to avoid queuing in the rain, nice touch."
"Written August 20, 2019",Puzzled,"We visited with our Granddaughter, the building looked fantastic, admission was free, although a box was available to make a donation. Some of the exhibits were not easy to find, so definitely get a map/book. Which we did see was very good, good detail to help you understand the origin and reasons why they work/exist.Suggest go bit earlier in morning when not as busy.Great visit with a 6 year old. "
"Written August 20, 2019","Terrible. If you are an adult, do not go.","We were at NHM on a Saturday in August. After a wait in line for nearly an hour, we entered the museum. Within 15 minutes we were desperate to leave and so we did.The Museum was very, very crowded. Kids running around everywhere, strollers blocking each and every passage. We wanted to see the dinosaur exhibit, but this was so disappointing we left when we the one way traffic lane passed the entrance once again. Who thought it was a good idea to place the dinosaur skeletons above the crowd? How are we supposed so see them?After a very short tour, we decided to leave and never return."
"Written August 20, 2019",Dinosnore - what a fun evening,Booked the dino snore for my sister and my nephew who turned seven in August. He was so excited. I thought the whole evening was extremely well organised and went so quickly. My nephew loved it. If you are wanting to book this then please do not forget you are sleeping on a hard floor with a roll mat - you are not meant to get much sleep. My nephew did though and passed out when the lights went off at midnight. The science show was awesome and scientist Zoe and Rose were fab. Zoe you are very cool and  you both made things so interesting. we were loving our facts. Well worth the money and everyone was fantastic. Thank you to all the dino snore team. Nick the animal man - you were awesome too and thank you
"Written August 20, 2019",Too Big,There are lots of really interesting exhibitions here but there are also far more pointless parts that have no real links to anything. It is also far too big in my opinion! You would need at least a full day from start to finish to get round it all properly. We just skipped past some of the less interesting bits thankfully!
"Written August 19, 2019",One of the must see Museums in London,"If you are a Science enthusiast , Definitely please make sometime to visit the best of the  best Natural History Museum , absolutely free to visitors. Kids will really enjoy the place where they actually can get to know in real about a lot of stuffs they learn."
"Written August 19, 2019",Amazing experience ,This is an amazing museum. We learned so and enjoyed so much! Highly recommended for all ages. One of the highlights of our trip to London. 
"Written August 14, 2019",Loads to see and it’s free!!!,We all love this museum!  We went there for the Moon exhibition mainly but we also visited the other halls.  My children (4 & 9) love the animals and dinosaurs especially fascinated by their skeletons.  My elder one also likes the information and detail on earthquakes and volcanoes as she learnt them from school in the past academic year!The cafe we visited had yummy food which is reasonably priced given it’s in the museum.
"Written August 14, 2019",One of the Best,"Free museum it's best to make sure you get there early, as it does get crowed. Make sure to see the museum of the moom. The whale skeleton had the little one' really talking. Young kids really love the museum."
"Written August 14, 2019",Amazing ,I could look around all day in the museum. There is so much to see. I was slightly disappointed by the signs for some of the displays. Some had little to no information on what you were looking at.
"Written August 14, 2019",Step into Hogwarts,"Being interested in natural history helps, but I'm sure you'd be amazed by this place none the less. All the exhibits are simply stunning and fills the mind with wonder, whether you're a kid or an adult. I can highly recommend a day here, but perhaps try to avoid the worst of the tourist seasons. Walking around here in a bit more tranquil atmosphere simply adds to the experience! "
"Written August 14, 2019",Quite an experience,"Really enjoyed our few hours here, we saw only a small fraction of the place. If we had more time we’d have gone on several days.The building alone is worth it for the visit, then the exhibits are fantastic.All of this for no entry fee other than suggested donations? I don’t think you’ll see that anywhere else.Go!"
"Written August 13, 2019",Amazing resource but way too crowded,"We arrived within minutes of the museum opening and had about 30 minutes of pleasant viewing before the onslaught. It’s great to see so many people interested in Natural History and I’d hate to see such a wonderful place go down the ticket route but next time we visit it’ll be off-peak, if such a thing exists in London. Cafés and toilet facilities are excellent and proximity to the underground makes it really easy to visit. The garden which is new since our last visit was a haven of tranquility. "
"Written August 13, 2019",No dippy,"Went specifically to view the dinosaur display only to discover that ""Dippy"" is on tour and won't return for a few years. My niece was pushed out of the way of the other dinosaur without being able to have her photo taken. Staff are good but overall I personally wasn't too impressed, too many tourists who are willing to push a 6 year old out of their way just because they have no patience."
"Written August 12, 2019",Busy weekend,Think we timed our visit with the busy season which was a little jarring to us however: how can you give a museum with many brilliant exhibits that is also free anything less than 5 stars!
"Written August 12, 2019","Great museum, but can be quite busy","This museum has some really amazing exhibits, one of the most popular is the dinosaur exhibit. The dinos, however, can get quite crowded so get there early. My family particular enjoyed the geological exhibits with the various rocks and gemstones. Who knew rocks could be so beautiful and fascinating? All in all, this is one of the most popular museums in London so don't be surprised if there is a queue outside. It is free of charge, but they highly appreciate donations and maps are £1."
"Written August 11, 2019",Very nice museum,"First of all, I loved free entrance. It was packed with people but there is a lot to see. We have spent about 1-1.5 hours in there as our schedule was tight. But we stopped only at exhibitions that were for free and we were interested in. Certainly it would take a whole day to see it all or at least 6 hour. I like the options of exhibitions, diversity, and interactive parts. I was informed that some exhibitions change so it is nice to visit more than once and I am sure I will return!"
"Written August 5, 2019",Definitely worth visiting ,The outside of the museum looks amazing. Inside there is a large collection of dinosaur skeletons and stuffed animals. There are also exhibitions on human evolution and the effects of earthquakes and preventing them. 
"Written August 4, 2019",So crowded...and hot!,"OK, I guess a natural history museum is geared towards children, but holy cow, the place was insane! We visited on a rainy day, so people were looking for indoor activities and there is no entry fee. So many people, so many children, so loud, so crowded, so hot and stuffy! Some good exhibits, but the crowds made it difficult to see things well and most exhibits had lots of reading panels; the crowds made it impossible to go through things slowly enough to read them. And forget it if you get separated from your party...you'd never find them again. I'm sure we missed some great things, but it was hard to navigate such an expansive place with so many people. Had to get out."
"Written August 4, 2019",Just ok,"Visited the museum with high hopes. I found it to be much more geared toward children than I would have expected. The moon exhibit offered almost nothing to see and the biology section felt too much like a 5th grade exhibition. When we left here, we went to the science museum, which is close by. I’d recommend that museum over this one. Though I’m sure that small kids would love this one. "
"Written August 4, 2019",The Best Museum I’ve Ever Visited in London!,You can easily get to the museum by underground and it looks gorgeous inside and out)) It was a great experience. I spent almost the whole day in this fascinating place and it was excellent! The exhibitions are breathtaking and very educative. I learned a lot and if possible I would visit this place again))
"Written August 4, 2019",Simply the best,Quite simply the best museum in the world. Yes a lot of the artefacts were stolen by the Empire and brought back to England but that’s the same in most great museums...From Dinosaurs to Egyptian Mummies and everything in between...   too much to ever see in a day (especially with young kids) but well worth taking time to explore.
"Written August 3, 2019",Extremely busy but fascinating ,"We went in the school holidays so it was a bit of a nightmare. The displays were good, when you could get to them and it covered so many subjects that there would definitely be something for everyone. I would go again but only during a quiet period. The building itself is beautiful inside and out and worth visiting in itself. "
"Written August 3, 2019",One Should Always Take In This Museum,"The displays are rather dated and not too pertinent. It would have been nice to have more information on climate change to better educate the public. We also went there to learn about the reintroduction of wolves and did not find one word on the subject. They had stuffed pangolins, but not one word on their endamgerment or the threats to most large mammals and birds the world over. They are missing a large opportunity. There was an interesting section on earthquakes and volcanoes."
"Written August 3, 2019","Brilliant for all ages, and FREE","We visited on a very wet day, so it seemed as though all London had decided to do the same.  However, my husband, myself and our 10 year old granddaughter thoroughly enjoyed the day. The beautiful big hall is always awe-inspiring. And what tops it all, there is no entrance fee.  Its up to individuals to make a donation."
"Written August 3, 2019",Fantastic and Free,"Amazing place to visit particularly with children. So much to see and do, you could spend the whole day there. Entry is free but they welcome donations. Definitely visit the dinosaur exhibition - my young children loved it."
"Written August 2, 2019",Beautiful building and fascinating exhibits,"We only had a couple of hours available, so it was a bit of a whirlwind visit unfortunately. Dinosaur fossils are always interesting and this was no exception. Walking through the history of the earth was great. Some of the more closed in areas were uncomfortably stuffy on a warm day as it was when we visited."
"Written July 10, 2019",Awesome place,Great place so much to see and do easy to get around stairs lifts very interesting displays something for everyone especially kids loved the gems display and all the interactive displays about earthquake s
"Written July 10, 2019",It’s free and its great,"Worth the visit if your interested in History, or if you have kidsEven thought it’s free they do take donations and we will most certainly want to donate something to help them offer this amazing service You can easily spend a good half a day here if you wish "
"Written July 10, 2019",Very good but very crowded and quite dusty,"It was our first visit to Natural History Museum. We chosen Saturday to visit this museum, I know it was a bad idea. Whole place was crowded, especially the Dinosaurs exhibition (I know it's probably the most popular one). One day is not enough to see all exhibitions and learn everything about all zones but it's enough to quickly explore all (free) exhibitions (or at least most of it). I was very excited to visit Dinosaurs exhibition but I have to say that I loved Blue Zone, especially minerals and the vault more. Every zone of the museum was very interesting with a lot of different display types. Great, fun day for kids and adults. I have to say something about amount/layers of dust on some of the displayed items, especially in the Blue zone (mammals section) it was horrendous (I know I'm picky and I know those are hard to reach places). It's a must see/visit attraction and I would definitely come back, but not on Saturday :)"
"Written July 10, 2019",Good Fun,Good fun for kids and adult as you learn some amazing facts. Definitely worth a visit for all ages ..
"Written July 9, 2019",Great,"Soo much to see do and Learn,will definitely  be back  only point is it does get quite hot and stuffy inside. "
"Written July 9, 2019",Natural History - love this place,"As I used to live in London before I've been here a couple of times but I make a point to go even on a short stay there. This is one of my favorite two museums in London and I recomend everyone to go there! It's so much to see and they have a lot of different exhibitions. I like the ones about earth and it's history the best and I love the part of the escalator going up and through earth, even as an adult I enjoy that. I would recomend that part of the museum for sure but it do has something for everyone and for all ages.Things from different kinds of animals of today to dinosaurs and to creatures in the ocean. Earth and it's history, fossils and rocks, planets ec ec ec.The museum itself is also a very cool and fabolous building, even for the building itself you should go. However depending on when you go, some parts are full of kids and other people. Especially the dinosaurs are a big popular one and is often crowded. If you have the time you should go early in the day.I've not yet tried the cafe though since it's a bit of an open space and it's usefully full of kids which I'm not a fan of, the giftshop is great to! :')Dont' have much to say more then that you should go!"
"Written July 8, 2019",Perfect day out,Underestimated how long you needed.  Easily all day could be spent here.  Wide range of exhibits to see. Clean and lots of staff available to help.  Would recommend a picnic as food wasn't broad and very overpriced.
"Written July 8, 2019",Excellent school trip with my 5 year old ,"I have been to the Natural History Museum before as a child with my secondary school as well as an adult with my then 2 year old child (3 years ago). This time we visited as part of my child's school trip. It was a totally different experience because there is a designated area in the museum for school children where there is a very big cloak room/lunch area/prep talk benches as well as the usual toilets. The museum itself never fails to amaze me. My daughter didn't remember much of it when we previously visited because she was too young but this time she really loved seeing the dinosaurs and learn about different animals and their habitat, humans and our environment in general. I think it is a great day out for all ages and although it was very busy with different types of visitors it was still very fun and exciting. I cannot recommend the Natural History Museum enough and we will be back to see more because we did not have enough time to explore during the school trip. "
"Written July 8, 2019",Great museum for young and old,We were really impressed by the Natural History Museum. We had 3 days in London and this was the main reason we decided to visit initially. We spent 4 hours here in total. And that was on a very hot day with kids who were quite tired. There was something to keep them interested around each corner. Dinosaur section is incredible. We loved the Cocoon as you get to understand the experiments that take place. The Moon installation that was in place is really well done. The escalator going through the globe and the earthquake sections are brilliant too.Having paid a lot of money for other attractions I felt that this was the best thing to do in London for us.
"Written July 7, 2019",Cool place ,"Absolutely love this place, the building architecture is fantastic and possibly the best looking building In London. Everything inside is cool to see and it’s free which an added bonus! Worth a visit."
"Written July 25, 2019",Dinoheaven,The Dinosaur-section was amazing. The kids were amazed (i admit i was too).Well worth your time and a must for dinosaurfans!
"Written July 24, 2019",A Great Day for the Family,"My son loved the dinosaur exhibit and I loved the architecture. We came during the summer, and though it was lovely outside, it was stiflingly hot inside the building with no a/c. Make sure you get a map as you enter, as we got lost and had to backtrack to grab one. There is a small cafe under the huge staircase that you see as you enter. Outside the building are small kiosks from which to get drinks or ice cream.  The museum is surrounded by jasmine bushes, so the whole neighbourhood smells incredible in July!"
"Written July 24, 2019",A must see for history buffs,As a history buff I always try to visit places like this.  Runs the gamut from pre-history to the moon.  Coincidentally my visit occurred during the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.
"Written July 24, 2019",Looking through time,"FREE ADMISSION. Fantastic, but they do recommend a fiver donation which is well worth the price. So much to see and do. Well worth the visit."
"Written July 23, 2019",nothing to say but excellent,"Amazing place to visit with the family or on your own. The museum building is very impressive, the exhibitions were wonderful and everything was perfect"
"Written July 21, 2019",Beautiful amazing,Great visit and its free too but you can donate which is a must for such a beautiful building with such  amazing interesting features .Well worth a visit
"Written July 21, 2019",Great museum for adolescent kids to visit,"My boys (11 and 14 years) really enjoyed this museum. There was plenty to look, do and touch while there. We spent a few hours looking through the many exhibits."
"Written July 21, 2019",Nothing Special,"When hearing how close the museum was to our hotel, my daughter was excited. She was under the impression that it was one of the best museums in the world. It is massive and has alot to discover but my daughter was disappointed.  It was so crowded you could barely walk through, and it was mostly all animals.  Our biggest complaint was how unorganized and hard to get around it was. It was like a maze and everything was far apart and not easy to navigate. Perhaps our perspective was tainted by how many people were there or that we have an incredible museum back in the US at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History."
"Written July 21, 2019",Awesome,"Even if you do not have children, it is a awesome museum to visit in London. It is free and you should go there even if you have only a couple of hours."
"Written July 20, 2019",Incredible,"The architecture of the building alone is worth the visit, both inside and out! Inside you'll find very impressive exhibits on multiple levels. So many aspects of the natural world are displayed and explained here. I move pretty quickly through museums, but one could spend hours and hours here. There's also a nice cafe inside for a cup of coffee or tea and a bite to eat."
"Written August 1, 2019",Learned a lots!,"I did the visit in a rainy day.No entrance fee. The museum suggests 5 pounds of donation.Variables contents to do, by self.Interesting for all age.There are not only dinosaures.Lots of things to learn.Highly recommended."
"Written July 31, 2019",The Building Alone is Worth a Visit,"Totally gorgeous Alfred Waterhouse-designed building from the 19th c houses an above average collection of the usual exhibits on dinos, mammals, birds, creepy crawlers, the earth, minerals, etc. With a few exceptions, exhibits are “old-school” museum style: think lots of stuffed things mounted in glass cases. Cadogan Treasure Room at the top of the stairs is a must-see. I mean, they have a first edition Darwin & a dodo. Very cool temp exhibit on the moon. Super crowded with lots of kiddos & varying parenting styles all smushed together sometimes creates issues. But hey, it’s free. Well worth a visit just to enjoy the walk up to the entrance & to admire the design details throughout while your kids get excited about the animatronic T-Rex."
"Written July 31, 2019",Don't go on a weekend,"Exhibits were great and well detailed, however we visited on a Saturday morning and could barely move around some of the exhibits as it was ridiculously over crowded, we felt we couldn't stay long or look around properly due to this. When we left around midday there was a queue through the grounds and round the corner to get in."
"Written July 31, 2019",Much better ways to spend your time in London,"Spent 1 1/2 hrs here first thing in the morning. No toilet paper in some cubicles, no hand soap in most dispensers.  Most of the exhibits greasy from 1000's of hands. Housekeeping needs a shake up. Had possibly the worse muffin I have ever eaten at the cafe in the top floor. Exhibits-nothing captivating. Because the museum is free, it seems every school group visiting London goes there, so be prepared for a lot of groups."
"Written July 30, 2019",Family Holiday 2019,It is an excellent way to spend time in London. It is great for children and adults alike and is reasonably accessible by public transport
"Written July 30, 2019",Great time to spend in an afternoon,"If you have half a day free time in London, and are interested in museums, free admission, high quality museums that is, do visit National History, Victoria & Albert, Science Museums in the area. They are next to each other make it easy access to all.Of course, won't be able to see it all if you want to spend 2-3 hours at each. We selected the items we wanted to see so were able to visit all 3.Very educational. The museum was huge, yet, no air-conditioning - not that we felt any cool air. Can be crowded in July - groups of school students were there.If you can, walk through Kensington/Chelsea neighbourhood to there as you will see many beautiful residential buildings. Very quiet clean area. We even spotted the home that Beatrix Potter used to live."
"Written July 29, 2019",Overseas friends,"We took a trip down to London to meet a friend & her kids who were transiting through the UK. We chose to go to the Museum in part as rain was threatened.  We arrived at 10am as the museum opened. The que moved quickly into the museum.  The dinosaur section was fascinating, informative & well laid out.The cocoon is more interactive ( I never knew there were so many different bees & wasps).Kids also love mammals section, whales, dolphins etc all fascinating. Getting refreshments is easy & not overpriced. A walk around the outdoor area of Darwin is good & refreshing as it does get warm indoors. The suspended moon is fascinating,  it's dark in there & cool, just don't trip over all the kids laying on the floor directly under the suspended moon.There is much more to see, you can spend as much or as little time here & there is so much information to absorb. The kids in our group were 9 & 6 years old & loved it."
"Written July 29, 2019",Slightly dissapointed.,"I admit the last time I visited the Natural History Museum was about 15 years ago, but I expected it to have greatly improved in those years.   However I thought it was more about the shops and cafes than the exhibits.   There was plenty to look at but I felt that it was far better before, when the exhibits were arranged differently and there seemed to be many more of them."
"Written July 28, 2019",2nd Favorite Museum,This was my second favorite of the museums we visited on our trip to London. The building is incredibly impressive; everytime we drove by it I was never not in awe and the same goes for the inside.The exhibits are cool and geared more towards pleasing the family which can be a nice change. The dinosaur area was my favorite and is clearly a fan favorite of most patrons. This place or the amount on show didn’t feel as big as the V&A we saw the day before. It also suffered from the same issue as the other museums in that it was unbearably hot inside. They had fans out but that does very little with the amount of bodies inside against the heat from the outside. This museum is definitely worth a visit but don’t miss the V&A first!
"Written July 26, 2019",Family holiday ,"Went to the museum with family and young kids( 9, 7, 7mths) all thoroughly enjoyed the visit. Admission is free, donations accepted. Well laid out and interesting for the whole family. "
"Written August 11, 2019",A free day out for all the family.,"This is an amazing place, it has everything for all ages with lots of interesting and interactive sections for children to play and learn from.  The new moon section was excellent and took our breath away at the scale of the project. Would we go again - definitely Would we recommend- yes definitely "
"Written August 11, 2019",Far too hot and crowded,"We were really disappointed with how busy and hot our trip was. The areas you are first taken into off the escalator are far too small and narrow to accommodate the number of visitors and we found in almost all of the rooms there was a one way system with one entry and exit point which led to no space to move freely. We couldn't wait to get out which was sad as this is the London atraction my 10 year old wanted to visit the most. The hall was beautiful but again, we spent 5 minutes in there due to the crowds. Beautiful building but sadly spoiled by the number of people there."
"Written August 10, 2019",Too Busy! ,Although it's incredible and I think that it is important it is free and accessible! We were being pushed round by enormous crowds there was no chance to read anything! I wonder if putting tickets online or having a certain number of entries per hour would be better! It was disappointing not to be able to look around more in detail! The building is beautiful and has some amazing exhibits! Although some of the dinosaurs need a clean as they have layers of dust on their bones! I have always loved this museum and just think it needs organising a bit better to allow it's wonder to be enjoyed by all! 
"Written August 9, 2019",Shuffling around in a crowd,"My childhood memories of this place revolve around acres of display cases containing every possible variety of bird, insect, mammal, fish or rock that the Victorians had stuffed and/or mounted. Today it is only the minerals section that reflects that experience. The rest seems to be a dumbed down Natural History lite. Have to say that the minerals section made the visit worth it for me."
"Written August 8, 2019",Great Museum in a Great City,"My husband, 5yo daughter and I had the opportunity to visit the Natural History Museum on a rainy Sunday morning.  The crowds were quite vast when we arrived, but people entered the facility with little delay.  I couldn't help but think of ""Night at the Museum"" when I walked into the huge entry hall.  It's massive and exactly what I would envision a NHM to look like.  Bones of a whale above head.  Glass enclosures containing various exhibits all around.The hallways were very easy to follow, especially given the map.  Plenty of hands on activity for the little ones in areas relating to the human body, reproduction, sight, memory and more.  My daughter wanted to touch, push, crank and jump on anything and everything.The trek through the dinosaur exhibit was tough.  Very crowded.  But plenty to see all around.  It was pretty fascinating, though not my favorite location in the museum.If you head to London, I vote for the NHM as a must see.  Educational fun for the whole family!"
"Written August 7, 2019",Just excellent ,"If you are thoroughly interested in palaeontology, just a great museum. The nature is jaw dropping, amazing."
"Written August 7, 2019",Breathtaking experience,"The interior is amazing and you feel like you have entered another world. The staircase is majestic and the whale skeleton is awesome.  Very interesting artefacts to view, especially if it's raining outside. Be careful as it might get a little bit crowded."
"Written August 6, 2019",Amazing museum !!,"Excite experience! The Moon room was amazing!incredible minerals collection,  You must take a picture from de giant Sequoia!After the visit, you must keep walking across the Exhibition road until reaching the garden entrance..."
"Written August 6, 2019",Love this place,"Made many visits here and still love the place ever since I was a child. Fantastic building and worth a visit for that alone,  Awesome!!"
"Written August 5, 2019",Great visit for families.,"This is a world class museum. The dinosaur exhibit never fails to impress  but there are also great exhibits on earthquakes, the moon, human development and other well done topics. Free admission, lots of interactive bits for kids. Avoid lunch at the T-Rex Cafe if yoou can. Service is slow and food mediocre."
"Written July 20, 2019",Great exhibits,"A beautiful building showcasing some lovely exhibits that bring learning to life for kids and adults.  There’s  something for everyone here displays of mammals, minerals, human biology, dinosaurs and more.  Great if you need to escape the rain."
"Written July 20, 2019",Adventure ,Great place for the kids and adults alike. Many exhibits to peak anyone’s interest.  Dinosaur delights. Lift the moon. See giant ancient bugs. It’s there and it’s free. Go and enjoy
"Written July 19, 2019",Dinosaur,"This is a public museum in South Kensington. It’s completely for free !It’s my favorite museum on rainy days in London. You can see there a lot of skeletons from dinosaurs with great explanations.Unfortunately the biggest and well known dinosaur skeleton at the entrance is missing until 2020, now there is a big fish skeleton in the entrance hall. Nice, too, but not as spectacular as the other one.Children like this museum, too.You can see so many different animals from former days, you will come more than once.The picture shows the entrance hall with the actual whale skeleton."
"Written July 17, 2019",Good but in need of an update,"The museum certainly has the volume and quality of exhibits to entertain everyone but is in clear need of an update. For example, most of the video exhibits were filmed in the 80s, many of the interactive exhibits were either non-functional or only partially functional and I suspect given their age some of the exhibits’ science and theory needs to be updated with the latest knowledge. There’s other similar museums in the world that have probably gone past this one in terms of quality, so if you’ve seen any of those previously this museum can be put on the ‘possible’ list rather than the ‘must-do’ list."
"Written July 17, 2019",Impressive ! Incredible ! Informative and educational ....,"... and Free ! this is a must if you love the natural history of life. The work and skilled staff have dedicated hours of their lives to give an incredible insight to the history of nature. I particularly enjoyed Chi Chi the Panda, I would never have the chance to see him, the main section featuring aqua land and flight is memorable, Thanks London."
"Written July 16, 2019",An interesting visit,I came here with my grown up son.  I found the exhibits interesting although perhaps the idea of stuffed animal displays is a little old fashioned?  However there are several newer exhibits which look at the earth and climate change for example.  These were excellent and we learned a lot.  We also ate in the cafe and the food was great.
"Written July 16, 2019",Not enough interactivity ,Stuffed with stuff and lots of info but lacking in interaction for kids education. In midst of dinosaur display under 10 said they were bored. Needs more dynamic things.
"Written July 16, 2019",Best in the world,Best collection of natural history stuff from gem stones to animals to Darwin's findings. It's amazing and it's free entry!
"Written July 14, 2019",Is that my mother in Law?,"Of course Not,   the dinos just aren't as scaryIf you need to feel engaged with nature ] start here ,  ging back hundreds of milliosnof years with the minute creastures which roamed earth to the biggest,  all in one buildingMind boggling stunning"
"Written July 12, 2019",Incredible experience ,Can’t recommend highly enough! Great interest for the entire family. Very creative and engaging displays. Great facilities - loos and a cafe. 
"Written July 6, 2019",Love to visit the Museum,"The Natural History Museum is fantastic BUT it is confusing and not very clearly signed inside. The new Blue Whale centrepiece has freed up space in the main hall so that has helped the over-crowding and it is a fantastic exhibit. I look forward to the bronze Dippy in the grounds. It was very hot and stuffy this week (in July).I would like to see some reorganisation to make the museum ""flow"" better."
"Written July 6, 2019",Very large and clean facilities,So many things to see and do. We were pressed for time and wished we could spend more time but theres so much to do in London. Everything is kept in great condition. Id say its better for families with children. 
"Written July 6, 2019",Slightly disappointing,"I feel like I'm being a wee bit harsh in only giving the museum stars but I was slightly disappointed in it. There's certainly plenty there that is educational and there are some fine displays in this beautiful and large building, but I thought reasonable amount of it was a bit old hat. Museums all over the world have changed quite a lot over the past 25 years and become quite innovative in the manner in which they present information and displays, and I felt that this museum has a little bit of work to do to catch up."
"Written July 5, 2019",Great,"Visited the museum primary for the photography competition which was a bit expensive, but the general museum was very good spent several hours here and still more to go back and see"
"Written July 4, 2019",Excellent exhibits suitable for all ages,"Fascinating, informative, interactive exhibits suitable for all ages. The prehistoric whale skeleton was jaw dropping as was the rest of the dinosaur exhibit. The museum is well laid out and color coded making wayfinding easy. Worth the trip!"
"Written July 3, 2019",Don’t let the crowds dissuade you,"Setting aside the extraordinary architecture, it reminds me of the Smithsonian in DC. If you are a science nerd and want to see what a dodo bird looked like before it became extinct, or to get a sense of how really massive a blue whale is, this is the place to visit. And it won’t cost you a farthing."
"Written July 3, 2019",Must see if visiting London,"Outstanding museum located in western London, just a stones throw away from Hyde Park. Lots of information and exhibits to look at, great for all ages! I particularly enjoyed the blue whale skeleton, the replica of the moon and the cross section of a giant sequoia - in the museum since 1893 and was over 1,300 years old when cut down! The wildlife garden is also a great place to visit for a peaceful stroll, or to sit in the sun and relax a little.  It is a must see attraction when visiting London, especially on a rainy day. Best of all, its free!"
"Written July 3, 2019",FABULOUS AND INTERESTING VISIT!,"We both have not visited this museum for many years and now we wonder why?A really exceptional day out - free entrance - reasonable price tostore bags and luggage so you can wander unhindered - excellent coffee, cakes and scones that were reasonably pricedand toilets that worked!! What more could you want together with the World leading collections and exhibitions, OUTSTANDING"
"Written July 3, 2019",Family visit,"We visited with our son and his  partner and grandchildren of 11 and 13. It was the children's  first visit and they thoroughly enjoyed it, although it was rather hot and crowded. There is an awful lot to see and bit is very informative for the children,"
"Written July 2, 2019",Dinosaur lovers delight!,We went on Fathers day and it was packed but the Dinosaurs made it well worth it. There were quite a few interactive dinosaur exhibits which were fun to watch. I also enjoyed the minerals and the images of nature. We ate at the nice family restaurant called the Kitchen where you could get a hot meal which was very good. 
"Written August 2, 2019",Beautiful place!,"Huge and wonderful place with many details of items and animals. Good to go with family, place of much learning!"
"Written August 2, 2019",Quality Exhibits ... and it’s Free!,"The Natural History Museum has an excellent dinosaur fossils exhibit in addition to plants, mammals and mineralogy.It’s very family friendly, easy to get to and also had outdoor exhibits which are a great way to escape the crowds inside!There are also multiple cafes on-sight which are useful because you could easily spend a day here.There are also multiple cafes, restaurants and  coffee shops across Cromwell."
"Written August 2, 2019",Great day out if you have kids!,"What a wonderful museum for children and toddlers even! Lots of buttons to press and information is laid out in a simple coherent manner. It's an entertaining stroll, definitely worth a visit. Avoid weekend crowds if possible."
"Written August 2, 2019",Interesting ,"Really cool museum, super huge, we really enjoy free entrance.You needs at least 2 hours to see it."
"Written August 1, 2019",A salubrious location of learning and wonderment.,"The cathedral like magnificence of the architecture, the ambience of a time gone by, the academic inspiration...I am always left in awe of this great British icon."
"Written August 1, 2019",Wonderful displays,I loved all the displays especially the darwinian center and the collections. The architecture is more the key attraction for me than the rest of the display as you can also see the displays at other natural history museum around the world but still worthwhile
"Written August 1, 2019",Amazingly beautiful!,"Every inch of the museum was fascinating! So much to see and learn, something interesting at every turn."
"Written August 1, 2019",Learned a lots!,"I did the visit in a rainy day.No entrance fee. The museum suggests 5 pounds of donation.Variables contents to do, by self.Interesting for all age.There are not only dinosaures.Lots of things to learn.Highly recommended."
"Written July 31, 2019",The Building Alone is Worth a Visit,"Totally gorgeous Alfred Waterhouse-designed building from the 19th c houses an above average collection of the usual exhibits on dinos, mammals, birds, creepy crawlers, the earth, minerals, etc. With a few exceptions, exhibits are “old-school” museum style: think lots of stuffed things mounted in glass cases. Cadogan Treasure Room at the top of the stairs is a must-see. I mean, they have a first edition Darwin & a dodo. Very cool temp exhibit on the moon. Super crowded with lots of kiddos & varying parenting styles all smushed together sometimes creates issues. But hey, it’s free. Well worth a visit just to enjoy the walk up to the entrance & to admire the design details throughout while your kids get excited about the animatronic T-Rex."
"Written July 31, 2019",Don't go on a weekend,"Exhibits were great and well detailed, however we visited on a Saturday morning and could barely move around some of the exhibits as it was ridiculously over crowded, we felt we couldn't stay long or look around properly due to this. When we left around midday there was a queue through the grounds and round the corner to get in."
"Written June 20, 2019","Darwin, Dinosaurs and More","This museum is housed in a beautiful building. The exhibit on Darwin is fascinating. There were no maps available when we arrived and it would have been useful to have. Download the app for the map. The human body exhibit was well done with lots of interesting facts along with interactive displays. This museum takes a while to get through. One full day would be sufficient, however its easier to digest everything in 3-4 hours. Either pick a couple of areas to do in detail or skim the entire museum. I chose to view certain areas, and came away with a wonderful experience. "
"Written June 19, 2019",Always worth visiting,"I have been here quite a few times, most recently a few days ago whilst on a day trip with my sister. I can't recommend visiting here enough. There so many things to see, definitely something for everyone and for all ages."
"Written June 18, 2019",Impressive Interior,I visited the Impressive Natural History Museum at South Ken. It was packed with tourists and students. I recommend to visit at 10 am to avoid the crowds. The interior was stunning. Surely this is one of the most magnificent attractions in London. SEE photos.
"Written June 18, 2019",One of the biggest Natural History museums!,So much to see and do. Great for both kids and adults. Go early since it got quite crowded later in the afternoon. We spent a whole day there. Get the map and dont miss any part. 
"Written June 18, 2019",Very Large but worth it,"We only spent a few hours here, comprehensive exhibits but we went mainly to see the Rosetta Stone. Due to the British Empire there are more Egyptian artifacts here than in Egypt. "
"Written June 17, 2019",Relaxing afternoon,"Son loved the dinosaurs and exhibits, the architecture and voluminous ceilings are incredible to stand under.  Must for kids, son who is 10 loved it."
"Written June 17, 2019",Fantastic experience,"This is accessible with people on a budget, no fees for the museums in London, there are some sections that you pay within the building but it is affordable.  Huge skeleton of a blue whale is suspended from the ceiling."
"Written June 17, 2019",Excellent value for just a donation ,Visited here on Sunday it’s so big and there’s so much to see for just a donation well worth a visit 
"Written June 17, 2019",great dinosaur fossiles and a complete blue whale skeleton,It is an absolute great Museum. We where there with our children now for the second time and we are all still impressed!They have a big dinosaur Department and many other Thing which also children find very interesting! Great if it is raining outside! Its for free!!!
"Written June 16, 2019",What happened to this museum??,"Today 5000 plus of my closest non-friends (felt like 10,000 plus but I’ll be kind), visited the Natural History Museum. I am sure that many of the fathers I saw today would rather have been quietly watching the World Cup Cricket with a pint in their hand, than be subjected to the mandatory fun day with their spouse and offspring. Anyway, I digress. The museum is not as I remembered it from 40 plus years ago, far from it in fact. The dinosaur skeletons were perched upon high, no doubt to protect them from the hands of so many screaming minions. A lot of the displays throughout the museum were hands on and interactive, so essentially not my cup of tea as I was wanting to quietly admire fossils. The quietest place was actually the “Fossils of Britain” display just before the main store and exit. Did I enjoy it? For the most part, yes. Would I do it again? Only in the middle of a winter blizzard during a school day. Museums are supposed to be quiet places of learning and not amusement parks."
"Written July 2, 2019","Great Museum, fascinating exhibits","Great museum, wonderful exhibits and displays. We were there mid-week about three in the afternoon at the end of June, before english school holidays however, the crowds forced us leave after an hour. Our grandchildren loved whatever we managed to seeAdvice, go early morning before the crowds."
"Written July 2, 2019",Great museum,My Grandchildren love it here. There is a lot see and do. Some interactive activities too. There is a restaurant which serves really nice food. Some of the animals on show are showing their age a bit as they have been there for quite a long time. There are usually quite long queues to get in...but it usually moves quickly. The dinosaur section is always a favourite. A good place to visit to keep the children occupied and interested.
"Written July 2, 2019",Dinosaurs!!!,This is an incredible place for both young and old and I would highly recommend it. Movatronic dinosaurs that will thrill the kids or the kid in you. Expect to spend a few hours at the very least and if its a winter visit....go skating kn their outdoor rink. Bring lunch and use their famiky space or est in the cafes.
"Written July 2, 2019",So much to see!,"Such a fascinating Museum. It was really busy as I would imagine it is most days. We enjoyed everything about it. So many different exhibitions, the care that has gone into each different one is phenomenal,  so many facts to absorb. I can’t wait till my grandchildren are old enough to accompany me here and we can share the wonder together!"
"Written July 2, 2019",my favourite museum,"absolutely incredible! amazing building and beautiful exhibits. what's not to love about dinosaurs?! very educational and interesting! Busy throughout the day so just be aware that it will be busy. however, not too busy that you can't see the exhibits. "
"Written July 2, 2019",Absolutely love it! Must do in London.,"Firstly, the building itself is marvellous, its Gothic and Romanesque style makes it magical. It’s a plus if you are fan of Harry Potter because it reminds of Hogwarts a little. The entrance is free, but because of the high volume of tourists, especially during summer time, there is a bit of queue. It’s better to go early on the day to avoid it. BUT even if you see the queue outside, don’t be frustrated, usually it’s quite fast. Sometimes there are security checks that slow it down.The exposition of animals and information boards is really huge. Prioritise what you really want to see and go for it first. I think it is an unforgettable experience especially for children and families. An opportunity to learn, have fun and bond together. If you want even more fun and get your hands dirty with experiments and interactive material, pop next door into the Science Museum! "
"Written July 2, 2019",Stayed all day,Great place to spend a rainy day in London.  So much to explore and discover in such a beautiful old building.  We enjoyed the dinosaur/fossil displays and the crystal/mineral/rock collections.  
"Written June 30, 2019",Bits are brilliant and bits are not,"The minerals exhibit is amazing. The birds exhibit is not.  The birds look tatty and dirty and (unless we missed some) large chunks of the world are ignored.  The best part was the reno done on the building itself.  It's been many years since we last visited, and what a difference!  The colours of the stone shine, and the building is revealed for the beauty that it is.  And whatever you do, don't miss the nature Photographer of the Year (2019) exhibition.  It was stunning and made the whole visit worth while."
"Written June 28, 2019","Interesting, but not extraordinary","If you have plenty of time, this is a very interesting and well-presented collection. However, it wouldn't be on the top 10 list. It's not as impressive as the Smithsonian Natural History Museum and there are other museums in London that are more intriguing."
"Written June 27, 2019",Education,Young and old alike will enjoy this museum - from looking at the animals to precious minerals - worth every moment spent and it is free!!
"Written June 9, 2019",Educational,"Wonderful museum to rouse kids curiousity. From dinosaurs, to mammals to minerals, lots for both adults and kids to learn from "
"Written June 9, 2019",Always Free and a sight to see. Take your time and come several times.,"Loved bumping into this on our walk from Kensigton Palace to the Harrod's area. It's a great museum filled with treasures you'll never see anywhere else. A beautifully designed and awe inspiring whale of a lobby greets you. Kids would have loved to come, will bring them next time and I'll actually enjoy it, too! "
"Written June 9, 2019",Dinosaurs!,The Natural History Museum is a short walk from the Science Museum and the V&A. It's huge and you can easily spend an entire day here. Highlights included the mechatronic T-Rex and the taxidermy hummingbirds. It's free to get in but eat before you go because the cafe is expensive.
"Written June 8, 2019","Great building, some excellent exhibits, please bring back more stuff","This was a long awaited return after many years, but it was quite disappointing in places but with some good stuff mixed in. Highlights are the spectacular building, whale and excellent moon exhibition/installation. The geology section and hominids were also pretty good. The downside for me was the relatively superficial exhibits in places which while probably excellent for small children, did leave me a little cold. The dinosaur hall in particular was so contrived, felt too theme Parkish in style, and I felt too much space was sacrificed at the expense of actual exhibits. I hope the museum will look at the balance and perhaps have a bit more of the “real thing” and a bit less of a walk through a science class. I am very sympathetic to the need to provide an opportunity for children in particular to learn about the natural world, but I sometimes think as adults we are too over protective and almost patronising to our kids. By having more objects on display we can add extra mystery and excitement by adding the dimension of the unknown and allow everyone to ask questions or try to figure some things out for themselves - that in itself is a joy. I would however in the positive column say this is a personal view and the overall quality and information of the exhibits and galleries were really good, with clear explanations throughout. I must also compliment the restaurant and cafe as being of good quality and environment. Very pleasant way to spend an afternoon, free admission, but very happy to have made a donation."
"Written June 8, 2019",Cool and beautiful ,We usually have a short museum stay with our kids because everyone gets bored after a while. Two awesome things about this museum 1. You don’t have to stand in a ticket line and can just donate money2. It is set up really well with amazing things that everyone thought was so interesting. We went one hour one day and an hour another day and it was a perfect museum balance for our family. 
"Written June 8, 2019",Fab Fun Trip,"Visit the history museum today (8th June) & wasn’t disappointed, so much to see, so much to do, very clean & tidy. Food and drink tad expensive but with donation entry I was happy to pay for it! Second time we’ve been, highly recommended!!"
"Written June 8, 2019",Spectacular Building,The building is spectacular. I think we enjoyed the building so much that we were distracted from viewing the collection. The museum has lots and lots to see. 
"Written June 7, 2019",Busy,Would have got 5 stars had there not been so many school trips there. Should do adults only days. Whale good and so was the moon.
"Written June 6, 2019",An amazing museum ,"It was a sunny day yesterday，you can see the appearance of the museum very clearly. It is also said to be the setting for the museum's wonderful night movie, so it looks particularly familiar. The building is magnificent. Upon entering the door, I was attracted by the skeleton fossils of the large mammontosaurus. In addition, here almost covers the complete biological evolution history of the earth and the specimens of most of the creatures on the earth. The exhibits are so comprehensive and rich that they are mind-boggling. They are really wonderful and informative. Another interesting exhibit is the moon museum.This moon was photographed by NASA on a scale of 1:500,000. In addition, the moon is not regularly shown on a global scale and is about two months away from its next destination. You can take the subway to the south kensington station and walk about five minutes to see the museum."
"Written June 6, 2019",Great museum for kids in London,"Great for kids and not only! A lot of interesting facts, interactive exhibitions and things to learn both for kids and adults! Probably not the best place for kids under 2 y.o. as they seemed to be bored but my 8 y.o. was very excited and will remember this visit for years!"
"Written June 26, 2019",Okay for a quick look,"If you've got a spare hour or two and an interest in natural history, then the museum is worth a visit. In saying that, I definitely wouldn't pay to go in. The exhibits are basic and could do with a revamp. Probably more fun for children, but adults can still get something out of it. We went in the late afternoon to escape the rain and it wasn't too busy. However, don't go out of your way to visit. There are better museums in London."
"Written June 26, 2019",Tired but still interesting,The displays here are in need of updating in both content and style. it's extremely dated using old technology. They started escorting people out half an hour before closing time. There are great collections here but not exactly displayed the best. There are better places to visit in terms of museums.
"Written June 25, 2019",great day out for all,"great day out, there are three museums located close to each other (NHM, Science, V&A) which helps. Entrance is free, but donations are encouraged.There are three shops within the museum, two belonging to NHM itself, and another that sells geology based items including gemstones and crystals. prices slightly vary between these shops, NHM offers good prices, tumbles are £1, and £2 for other types of rough stones. you are able to purchase bigger pieces as well as other items of interest to the museum, such as dinosaurs and science themed products. My personal interest is in the gemstones. there is a beautiful room which houses beautiful samples of gemstones, Crystal's and rocks all within their old cabinets; this room as a slight old feel to it, and ends with the vault room. my little one loved walking amounts the cabinets exploring new things. Always something to see. people have been friendly here every time we have visited. the cafe area offers tea/coffee, sandwiches and cakes. If you wish to eat something more filling or meal like, there are a few options around South Ken.There are also lifts around the building to help with wheelchair and buggy. most people are considerate and will prioritise the prams and wheelchair which does help.we love going here and it makes a lovely day out. I sometimes wish there was someone I could ask certain questions too such as which part of the dinosaurs are real, and which is an artist's impression, that sort of thing.. also to note the building is very beautiful inside and outside."
"Written June 24, 2019",Interesting ,"Glad we visited here. It’s free to get in and you can give a donation if you wish as you enter. No queue when we got there but it was first thing in the morning. Got a lot busier as the day went on. Maps are £1 to purchase. It’s really interesting. So much to see, very interesting. Make sure you make time to see everything you want to. I loved the dinosaur section but it was very busy. "
"Written June 24, 2019",Adventure,"One of the most impressive musuems, very interactive and informative covering a wide array of topics. Free entrance with a suggested donation on arrival. Very busy on arrival but once out of the main halls plenty of space. Must visit with children."
"Written June 23, 2019",Very impressive Building,"Make sure you see the moon display. I loved it. The dinosaurs are great fun, too. Once again, it's free but donations are asked for and deserved."
"Written June 22, 2019",Must see for families,"We skipped the V and A in favor of the natural history museum. We had a wonderful time and spent about three hours there near closing time which was noticeably quieter. We still didn’t see everything but did spend a lot of time viewing the birds, mammals and Dino exhibits. They have an amazing gems collection and we sped through the volcanoes and earth science exhibits. "
"Written June 22, 2019",Natural History Museum ,"Fabulous, amazing, so interesting and educational. I recommend this place for everyone including young families. "
"Written June 21, 2019",Excellent,"Free entrance, I visited it in the morning at 10 am. After 12 there are a lot of people (visited on August, April and June). Awesome place to visit with children, too. I highly recommend it"
"Written June 20, 2019",Amazing architecture and good displays,We visited not knowing much about the museum but the building blew us away on arrival. Got some great photos inside and checked out some of the displays around too which were good albeit a bit dated and needing refreshment. 
"Written June 15, 2019",a must for family with children,very organised and well thought through museum. enjoyed every corner and section of it. enough cafes to cater for tired legs and hungry tummy. enough explanation to explore and enjoy the museum without a guide
"Written June 15, 2019",Very interesting museum,"Conveniently located at South Kensington Underground station, it was easy to find and admission is free. Google said that this is the 2nd best Natural History museum in the world and indeed it was very impressive and interesting for all ages - adults, children and teens."
"Written June 14, 2019",Just wow!,"We went on a Friday morning / Afternoon hoping it would be quieter than some of the reviews on here seem to mention. It was very busy but manageable and we managed to find a 1/2 hour peace in the cocoon also. I would imagine it is quite crazy on weekends being free but it has to be seen. we spent a good 4 or 5 hours in here and still didn't see everything, Just WOW!"
"Written June 13, 2019",Pretty amazing building with lots to see and do for all ages,"We happened to have an open 1/2 day during our London trip and walked by to find out we could jump right in and enjoy the dinosaur exhibit, natural history and more!"
"Written June 13, 2019",Every child...,Every child should be able to visit for as long sessions she/he likes.Families CANNOT miss the visit...
"Written June 11, 2019",Cool and easy!,"Even if you don’t have so much time to spend here, trust me go there and have take a minute to Explore."
"Written June 11, 2019",Crime Scene Live Event,"If they are still running this and you have a chance to go (and are interested in CSI type activities), this is a MUST DO.  They organized and managed this beautifully - from the facts of the case to the interactive learning sessions with museum experts in various forensic sciences.  It was a fantastic evening out."
"Written June 10, 2019",Another gem,"Huge collection of fossils, minerals, taxidermy and all manners of objects from the natural world. One could easily spend a whole day at the museum. The Dodo bird and Archaeopteryx is definitely a highlight.One note of caution - the museum gets **incredibly** busy on a bank holiday."
"Written June 10, 2019",True museum experience,"We have never been to such a detailed history museum. The facts and features were amazing and gave such an up close feel. A few hands on activities but a little antique to today’s technology. All exhibits are visually stimulating and a lot to take in. The dinosaurs and mammals exhibit were our kids, 6 and 7 years, favorite. "
"Written June 9, 2019",Interesting!!!!,"This is a good place to go if you have lots of time, there are some great exhibitions and lots of interactive things to do!!&"
"Written June 3, 2019",Learn and experience,"Modern museum - you can touch, ask, experience. Amazing moon and really good idea of showing how earthquake feels. Well prepared for kids but it is also a lot of fun for adults."
"Written June 3, 2019",Superior artifacts,"Another great museum to visit. A lot of history and interesting artifacts. When you’re among the hundreds of thousands of years of history, it’s hard to pass through quickly. There is just so much to look at and take in."
"Written June 2, 2019",A must for history and science fans,"I was very interested in history and science, so I had to visit the museum. I really enjoyed exploring all the sections of the museum and learnt new and interesting facts. It was very crowded when I went there, but overall, I had a great time! They even had an ice-rink outside the museum during the holiday season but I didn't book a ticket. "
"Written June 2, 2019",majestic and beautiful,"This is certainly a wonderful visit while in London, it requires minimum of half a day to do it justice  take a tour through the past histiry of Art and sculpture  , the building also has losts to offer"
"Written June 2, 2019",Great building and child friendly ,Great few hours with friends and 3 children. Moon and dinosaurs will never cease to keep you entertained. 
"Written June 2, 2019",Something for the entire family,"This is a free museum which means it is quite busy with school group tours.  It is well worth visiting, though, and a short walk from the South Kensington Tube station.I love seeing the taxidermy because it reminds me of visiting similar museums as a child.  I thought one of the most fascinating displays was a glass case of various hummingbirds.Depending on what entrance you use, you may miss the large entrance hall (Hintze Hall) - you'll know it by the high curved ceiling inset with paintings and made of wood, glass and metal.  It is a masterpiece in itself."
"Written June 2, 2019","fun, long queues, eat before",Its a fun and exciting place for kids. The food hall is on the pricey side but that is to expected. You can aim to spend a good 2-3 hours there with kids but expect a waiting time in the queue if you wait until midday 
"Written June 2, 2019",Great to see,"Didn't have to queue to get in, lots to see the moon exhibition was my favorite. Didn't pay to get into the extra exhibitions. Great for all the family"
"Written June 2, 2019",So much to take in,"Outstanding architecture that has been taken well care of, and lovely exhibits that offer organized glimpses into the past. If you're from Los Angeles, a small portion of it reminds me of the LA Brea Tarpits."
"Written June 1, 2019",Always good for a visit,Always something to see here on your trip to London. Best avoided in the school holidays if you don’t like the crowds - we abandoned our first attempt due to the long line up. 
"Written May 29, 2019",Top level activity,"Top level activity for any type of visitor. Children are really enjoy it. Good facilities and services inside Museum. Museum has a plenty points where we can take a break and have a snack, it is especially important when you came for a few hours visit and/or with children. Came a couple times before this visit and will come back again with kids in future."
"Written May 28, 2019",A great Natural History Museum ,I love the displays of the assorted animals around the world. They have a lot of educational displays. The earthquake and natural disaster displays were great. The inside is impressive. It is also free. It’s a must see museum. Next door check out the science museum then Victoria Albert Museum is near by.  
"Written May 28, 2019",Disappointing visit,"The Natural History Museum felt tired & dated, & didn’t feel like somewhere we wanted to continue to explore. Lighting in the galleries was dark, cases were old fashioned & labels were difficult to read - definitely in need of refurbishment."
"Written May 28, 2019",Cannot believe this place is free. Of you visit please donate!,Wow. What an absolutely amazing place. The exhibits are some of the best in the world. National treasures. A definite must visit. But be warned it gets so busy! Get there early! 
"Written May 28, 2019",Don't miss it,"A fab trip into our past. It took a while to get in, so buy tickets in advance. We visit it previously, but we had to show it to our kids and fiancée. It can't be missed if you are coming to London !"
"Written May 28, 2019",Wonderful exhibits,"A well done museum.  Not to be missed on any London trip.  Perfect setting, perfect displays.  Crowded with school children during the week...can be a bit noisy. "
"Written May 28, 2019",Fantastic,"No matter how many times I come here, it is still an amazing experience! It is easy to find; fully signposted from South Kensington tube station. Despite visiting on a saturday, there were no queues to get in. It still amazes me that a visit here is completely free (although there are chances to contribute if you wish). It was my first visit with my niece aged 8 and it was lovely to see her enjoying the experience. The dinosaur exhibit will always be my favourite part (I do miss dippy in the main entrance area). The interactive elements here are great and the anamatronics definately add to the experience. There is so much to learn and it is done in a really interesting way. The mammals section is also really good. Not as interactive as the dinosaur section but still interesting, even if some of the specimens do look a bit gruesome! My other favourite section was the human biology section. Again, fascinating and fun. My niece loved the drawing activity we found. We visited one gift shop which had a good range of items. We did not buy food or drink there; only because we were pushed for time.There is much more to see than you might think. We were there for about 2 hours and it was not long enough. We did not get to see everything and we could have spent much longer there. This is a unique experience that I look forward to repeating."
"Written May 27, 2019",Dinosaurs,Possibly one of the few museums that has dinosaurs fossils. Some displays are old but still a fun visit especially if you have kids. 
"Written May 27, 2019",Great Place - Just Far Too Busy!,"Lots to see, but just far too many people. We did visit at a peak time so certainly won't complain about it as it was our fault, however it did dampen the experience.If you're in to natural history, then you will like this place! If you don't you won't - Can't really say much more than that!"
"Written May 27, 2019",Awesome museum!,The Natural History Museum is one of the best museums in london if you like to see animals and natural history. The building is also really beautiful! I would recommend going to this museum when in London!
"Written June 5, 2019",Our fav London museum,Dinosaurs!! That was our youngest daughter when we told her about this place. We spent a half day here during our stay in London and it flew by. My only criticism is that there should be a way to pay to enjoy fast track entry. The museum is free but the lines can be long. It’s great that it’s free but some pay would prefer to pay for the privilege of not having to wait so long. Other than that it was superb. Our favourite London museum!
"Written June 5, 2019",This is my son's favorite museum in London.,"This is my son's favorite museum in London. Loves towatching animals and birds, and most of all, the missing millions of years ago, skeletons of dinosaurs, examples of various forms of life and many other interesting exhibits of the world flora and fauna."
"Written June 5, 2019",A huge museum with tons of animal specimens and information about the Earth,"So many animals! From a whale skeleton to dinosaur bones to tons of birds from all over the world, this place has an amazing animal collection. In addition, it has an impressive collection of other artifacts and information about the Earth (minerals, gems, etc.). I spent a few hours there and feel like I barely scratched the surface of what there was to see."

"Written May 31, 2019",Amazing,"The most awesome collection of crystals, gems and: stones, if you interested in such. Also a great show of the Moon. Free entrance, it is up to you to donate if and how much you want. Please donate, I promise it is worth every penny."

"Written May 31, 2019","Very nice museum, worth visiting","It's a big museum, yet you can spend around two hours there and see most of it.The building itself is very nice, take a look on it outside and inside too.The museum is free.Suitable for children and all people too. There are dinosaurs and other interesting exhibits like animals, rocks and moon findings too.You can spend there few hours, depends on what you like to see and if you bring children who may find lots of interesting things for them."
"Written May 30, 2019",Masterpiece,Natural History Museum is a masterpiece to learn many things for people of all ages. The entrance is also magnificent.
"Written May 30, 2019",Very impressed ,The architecture of the building itself was much to admire and there was plenty of interesting thing inside including a blue whale skeleton and it is free 
"Written May 29, 2019",Absolutely Wonderful!,"The outside of the building is beautiful enough to grab your attention, it's gorgeous! The inside of the building is just as beautiful as the outside! This was not at the top of our list of must sees while in London but I am so happy that we went. You can donate any amount to enter the museum and it is very large so you can spend as much or as little time in there as you want. I wish we would have had more time to spend in there because there was a lot I know we didn't get to see. Will definitely visit again on our next trip!"
"Written May 29, 2019",I love it a lot,"This is an outstanding place for everybody who loves life and nature and science. A lot of info especially for kids. Yes, too many people, but this museum is for everybody!"

"Written June 4, 2019",Fantastic Museum,Even the building itself is spectacular.  Wonderful collection.  Give yourself plenty of time to get around.
"Written June 4, 2019",A definite must,I was amazed and very much entertained coming. It was really good that the entrance is free and only requires donation but even then if there's entrance payment involved i still think its a must. I could spend the whole day on this museum if i can.

"Written June 4, 2019",Great adventure,You can spend the whole day and have the greatest time of your life with your kids.  Every zone is very interesting and very easy to go around.
"Written June 4, 2019",great family day,we squeezed in a 3 hour visit here which was not enough.  it was mainly to see the dinosaurs but so much to see there.  it is great and in a fab building.  we arrived at 9.45 on a monday morning and the queue looked long but as soon as doors opened we were in within 5 minutes
"Written June 3, 2019",great museum.  take time to see it.,"We planned to spend half a day here and were sure glad we did.  Even the outside of the museum building is dramatic.  It looks more like a cathedral than a museum. I am a whale nut and the first thing we saw was a giant model of a blue whale. of course we had to see the whole whale display.  A very educational section well worth spending time there.  We then explored the dinosaur section.  great display of fossils.  maybe the only complaint was that some of the displays were covered with dust.  I know they are fragile, but it would be nice to clean them somehow.  There was an unsual Moon sculpture made of hundreds of photographs.  There are a number of galleries we didn't have time to see.  I would strongly recommend taking a few hours to see this great museum."
"Written June 3, 2019",Beautiful Building,The building is one of the most amazing buildings I have ever seen. It’s amazing to think it was designed in the 1800’s. The exhibits pale when compared to the building itself. It’s free entrySo do yourself a favour and visit when you can.
"Written May 27, 2019",Best museum in London ,This is actually the most entertaining museum in London. Who doesn’t enjoy seeing the dinosaurs?! Highly recommend it
"Written May 27, 2019",Bank holiday visit ,"We arrived at opening time and were in a massive queue but this moved quickly and we were in within 10 minutes. Thought it might be really busy but it’s so spacious inside. It was much bigger than we thought and we were there a good 3-4 hours including lunch. Interactive centre for kids was good where children can explore fossils and loved the interactive things in the human bit. Can’t comment on the dinosaur bit as my daughter was too scared to go in there! Lovely food in Trex grill and reasonably priced! Would recommend getting a kids souvenir book when you go in, my daughter loved finding the parts in the book that she could see in the museum and comes with a map!! One of the best attractions to visit in London!"
"Written May 26, 2019",Interactive experience ,There’s a real variety of things to do here from art to interactive science. Really engaging for adults and children. 
"Written May 26, 2019",Captivsting,"The building alone is worth experiencing in its sheer magnitude and beauty and the intricate details woven into its construction. They exhibitions were interesting and diverse, favourite was the dinosaurs and I learn a lot. Great for kids and adults and easy to navigate."
"Written May 26, 2019",Always Worth A Visit,"You can never get bored visiting the museum I guess because it's free and the other, there is so much to see."
"Written May 25, 2019",Disappointed.,"Remembered coming here as a kid and being blown away by it. The dinosaur section felt meh, I guess in the last 35 years with CGI, other museums improving it just felt a little sad, but why were the dinosaur skeletons on the ceiling, bizarre.  The main interest was the small room with the truly historical pieces and the building, amazing the see the history. I wouldn’t return there a better regional museums for this type of thing."
"Written May 24, 2019",So cool! ,"Walking through the doors to the upstairs exhibition of animals of the world feels like traveling through time! This is in some ways a museum of a museum, but I mean it in the most positive way! My three boys and I were so fascinated and spent a couple of hours here, walking back and fourth along the aisles to really see it all. It’s a shame you can’t visit the balconies due to security reasons. I’m really hoping the planned renovation of the museum will take care of this amazing room and won’t modernize it too much. Although more information on the animals would be nice! But it was still one of the coolest museums we’ve visited! Really recommend it! "
"Written May 24, 2019",Stunning building housing fascinating creatures!,Get here early and beat the crowds as this place is popular and can get super busy.  We arrived at 10 am on a Saturday and walked straight in.  Our child loved the dinosaur exhibit and the big blue whale best.  The architecture of the building is even more sublime on the inside than on the outside and its worth visiting just to see this.  
"Written May 24, 2019",Great Museum- shame about the 35 minute queue outside in the rain,"We really enjoyed our visit to the museum, the exhibits were great, some pretty awesome, but our visit was marred and cut short because we had to queue outside for 35 minutes, 25 of which were in a rain storm that came out of nowhere and we were trudging around in wet clothes. There is no shelter outside! Apparently in the summer months the queues are a lot longer unless you start queuing well before the museum opens. So don’t forget, take rainproof clothing or large umbrellas and comfortable shoes"
"Written May 23, 2019",Great afternoon out,"The museum is great and free to enter.The dinosaurs section is great with lots of exciting stuff to see. The animals and the moon exhibit are both quite impressive too but the only disappointment was the human biology section - I felt it was really quite dated and sad, with a lot less people in looking at it although the rest of the museum was packed full of tourists and kids.Still very enjoyable and with a donation rather than an entry fee its still a very impressive place and a beautiful building inside and out. "
"Written May 18, 2019",So much to see,"This museum was very interesting.  The amount of taxidermy was good, some of them looked very old.  The dinosaur exhibit was very informative. "
"Written May 17, 2019",A Great Museum in London,This is a great museum to visit in London even if it is filled with children on school trips. Compared to the one in New York I love the second better but I did love the geology exhibit in this museum. 
"Written May 17, 2019",Interesting and Crowded,"A beautiful structure filled with interesting exhibits.  You are greeted by the skeleton of a blue whale upon entry.  The dinosaur exhibit is short, but well done.  My favorite was the Marine portion with the models of the various creatures.  My negatives mainly involved the crowds of school children that ran amuck.  Loud and choatic, it lessened my enjoyment.  Also, the staff was few and always involved, which made it difficult to ask any questions.  Overall good experience."
"Written May 17, 2019",Beautiful Building,This building always looks amazing and inviting from the outside but once you get inside there is so much to see.  Amazing pieces of history preserved for us all to enjoy.
"Written May 16, 2019",Amazing museum,My cousin went to London and I took him went to the museum and it was amazing. I had a photo in a ginormous dinosaur skeleton but I couldn’t find it in my gallery to post it here but it was like 8 years ago though but an absolutely great experience during my stay in London.
"Written May 15, 2019",So much to see,The building is beautiful. The architecture is amazing. Inside there is so much to see. The dinosaur exhibit was our favorite. The gem exhibit is insane. We actually quit looking halfway through my eyes were crossed. The museum is free but they do ask for a £5 donation. For a family of 4 that is a great price. It's a must see. 
"Written May 15, 2019",A must,"Just come enjoy some  houres. See dinasours, bluewhale  ( realy big) . How the world Was made . Set off 3 houres at least."
"Written May 15, 2019",Not to be missed with chidren,a beautiful and varied museum with some interactive displays. Interesting for adults and for children. A must in london! 
"Written May 13, 2019",Great for the whole family,"The building itself is beautiful and inside is just as amazing. So many exhibits to see and keeps the whole family entertained.We also were lucky enough to be there when the ice skating rink opened, great fun."
"Written May 12, 2019",Cant Be Beaten,"Took a 4 yr old , it was quite busy and we limited our time there but it was excellent , if you are in town with time to spare its way worth it , dinosaur exhibit alone is good enough !!"
"Written May 23, 2019",Lovely trip to the moon and dinosaurs ,Well worth popping in if your in the area. It’s worth going back even if you have been before. There is so much to take in and is a great free attraction for all ages!
"Written May 22, 2019",Great!,Visited in order to go to the wildlife photography exhibition (£15 entrance to the exhibition) and ended up wondering around looking at the many exhibits.  Great for kids too!
"Written May 21, 2019",Unparalleled!,"The best of its kind. A stunning building with countless exhibits right in the centre of London. Make sure that you plan your visit beforehand due to its sheer size. You will need two, maybe three visits in order to properly explore it. "
"Written May 20, 2019",Great place to see,It's a fantastic place to visit. So much to see. Plenty of things to see. Just bring your food because it is really expensive! It's easy to get to and with free entrance it's a must see in London. Plan for a crowd if you go on the weekend.
"Written May 20, 2019",Dino Snores Night Stay,"Well sleeping in the Natural History Museum wasn’t in our bucket list but it should have been! We went for a friends 50th (never too old - we are all big kids). What a fantastically organised event. Fabulous evening meal and breakfast, amazing science talk, comedian and lots of other events. Wandering around the museum until 3am was amazing especially the dinosaur gallery on our own in the dark! We all ‘slept’ under the blue whale and viewed the beautiful ceiling whilst in our sleeping bags. AMAZING - just do it!!"
"Written May 20, 2019",amazing,"the building itself is amazingvery good for family, provide a lot of knowledge of every side of life you can imagine"
"Written May 19, 2019",Fun With Dinosaurs,We were lucky to be able to visit outside of the school holidays/weekend before our four-year-old starts school and thus avoided anything resembling a queue or a crowd. She absolutely loved the dinosaurs - what child doesn’t! - both being scared and loving the animatronic T-Rex and having the chance to see the skeletons of the other dinosaurs as well. The Triceratops was a definite favourite. We were able to spend a very happy hour with just the dinosaurs and I’m sure all the other rooms would have been just as successful. A great way to spend some time with young children. 
"Written May 19, 2019","Amazing museum, difficult access on a rainy day!",The museum is fantastic - and incredibly it is free. There is only one entrance they keep open though and you have a long walk around the block and past the ice ring so very difficult for elderly folk or those carrying kids!
"Written May 19, 2019",Busy - But Must See,This museum is free to all - Maybe that’s why it is so busy.  A must visit and glad that I did have the opportunity to visit. Plan for a crowd if you go on the weekend. 
"Written May 19, 2019","Busy Place!  Amazing entrance, front and side.","It is a very popular place. Weekdays probably are calmer.  Whether you enter from the front or the side, you will be impressed.  So much to see. Take in as much as you can. Then step outside in the garden area for some fresh air and back in to see what you missed.  This is free by donation. The Victoria and Albert Museum is almost next door and Harrod's is a short walk."
"Written April 24, 2019",Its free and its awesome,"This is a must visit attraction in london guys. It has something for everyone. My children and spouse loved it. + Direct access from a metro+ Clean place, disciplined staff, nice exhibits+ restrooms were adequate and were OKShould've reached earlier in the day and see it completely. Hit LIKE if my review helped you in planning your trip any better."
"Written April 23, 2019",Dinosaurs! ,A beautiful building to view before entering!We took the children to see the dinosaurs and they didn't disappoint. The building is stunning.Plenty there to do that is suitable for all ages. 
"Written April 23, 2019",Good day out in a wonderful museum,This is a free museum in a beautiful building. Donation is highly suggested to help them maintain the museum. Kids and parents can enjoy themselves and spend 3-4 hours here. There is a lot of tourist but the place is big enough to accommodate. 
"Written April 23, 2019",Much better than expected,"After the V&A museum, it's difficult to be impressed when you visit a museum on the same day. After a very disappointing visit at the Science Museum, we didn't have high hopes on this one....but we were wrong!!!It's beautifully laid-out with lot's of (pre historical) animals.The building itself is very beautiful."
"Written April 23, 2019",Magnificent!,You would seeReal Stagosaurus skeletonsReal T-Rex skeletonsReal stuffed Dodo birdsReal stuffed HumingbirdThe biggest bird egg shield that bigger than the ostrich’sReal giant whale skeletons!!!
"Written April 22, 2019",A little crowded but great museum ,"This is a very large museum of natural history. We really enjoyed not only the exhibits but the exterior architecture and interior design. If you like natural history, definitely check it out! The only downside is we went at a very busy time of day so it was quite crowded. Other than that, it was a great experience. Try to aim for off peak times and weekdays instead of weekends. "
"Written April 22, 2019",They need to cap visitor numbers,"We visited over Easter weekend (next time I'll check the dates before booking a trip) and the entire visit was horrible. It was that busy we could barely move. The lines.for the bathrooms were out the doors (literally). I dread the thought of a fire or incident requiring evacuation because it would have been impossible. Regardless, we went to see the dinosaurs as it is reported that this is one of the top five dinosaur museums in the world.... I have zero idea how it got the rating. It didn't help that it was beyond crowded, there were barely any dinosaurs to see. There was mostly dividers to keep the flow of the crowd going but it was filled with facts for three year olds, opposed to dinosaur enthusiasts. There was nearly nothing to look at as the casts were quite high up you were unable view them / the dividers were blocking the view. We left immediately after viewing the dinosaur section and therefore cannot comment on the remainder of the museum. If you are however a dinosaur enthusiast and want to attend this museum for that sole purpose, I wouldn't bother. "
"Written April 21, 2019","The other ""not to miss"" museum","Thank you London for these free museums! I loved all of them! This is one of those you can't miss, but beware the crowds: get there ASAP!"
"Written April 21, 2019",Amazing Collection,"A great place to get the geek on and learn about life before human habitation.Amazing collection of fossils and gems  , stand out being the fossil reptile collection and also the hominid displays , showing human evolution .Excellent place to spend at least 3 to 4 hours."
"Written April 21, 2019","Fantastic, spend the whole day there",We arrived at 10am and left at 5:30pm.  Our two boys aged 11 and 12 really enjoyed the whole museum.  There favourite was the dinosaur exhibition and the history of earth.We also paid to see the Photographer of the year which was very good and well presented.Left NHM with our heads full of new knowledge and with sore feet!
"Written May 8, 2019",BIG and AWESOME,"There are lot to see in this Museum . Right from the Crawling creatures to Dinosaur . One can see rich history about all the living beings, fossils and Space. There are rides which one can experience.You need entire day and best part its free to visit which makes entire day event to have fun and to gain knowledge. "
"Written May 8, 2019",No 1 place to see in London,"This place is just the best. Don;t forget to leave a generous donation to help keep this place going. My one recommmendation if you are going with kids is not to try and see everything. It's just too big and they'll get overloaded. Pick a few spots and have a good look at them and leave the rest. My highlights include the giant tree sample upstairs in the main room, the dinosaur exhibition and the geology samples"
"Written May 8, 2019",Spectacular ,Great free entertainment whilst in London. Suitable for all ages but caters in particular to children with interactive displays. Very interesting collections in a spectacular building. 
"Written May 7, 2019","A great place, so much information","We enjoyed our day, so much to see we didn't manage it all. Enjoyed the animal displays and information on the earth. The Dinosaur area was too busy so we skipped it.  Lots of places to eat and an indoor picnic area. Will have to go back and see the areas we missed, wear sensible shoes and be prepared to walk your feet off. Also a wonderful building."
"Written May 7, 2019","An absolute must visit place, full stop!!","I have been to the Natural History Museum on all of my four personal trips to London do far. I couldn't come to London `nd not visit as it is so amazing a place. Each time I go I try to get to a different part that I either scanned through too briefly or didn't get near to at all. Tip - DO NOT THINK OF GOING DURING SCHOOL BREAKS. Just don't, we were there at easter and it made it an ordeal to get around. It wore us out and the kids, especially when people could only slow march through the dinosaur section not able to stop to look, let alone read any of the displays."
"Written May 7, 2019",Need to go," We spent two hours in here, the only problem was we couldn’t get round. there was too many people there we chose the wrong day but what we did say we will be going back. "
"Written May 7, 2019",Mind blowing level of detail,"This place is awesome! The dinosaurs were a total hit with all family members, and there was so much else to see that we need to go back again! Only reason I'm not making this review an excellent is due to the fact that it was soooo overheated in there we had to leave earlier than planned as we were all struggling with the heat."
"Written May 7, 2019",Magic place ,"I went with my children and they had a lots of fun. Perhaps Some rooms are too much complicated for children of a certain age, but it remains a top class place to teach something new to my son and daughter "
"Written May 7, 2019",For children ,"This building is extremely impressive, but that's about as far as it goes. We made our way though this museum very quickly. Everything on display here was taught to us in primary and high school. There is a lot of taxidermy birds here, but a lot of them didn't even show their country of origin making them pointless to look at. The dinosaur exhibits were way too packed and impossible to read and veiw the information on them. Your pushed through a walkway with hundreds of people and told by staff not to stop and keep moving with the crowd. Only recommend if you are taking children."
"Written May 7, 2019",The “wow effect” is guaranteed,"We’ve been there for the first time in years but we regret not having visited it before! The building is amazing and since the very first step in, the wow effect is guaranteed!! Highly recommended!!"
"Written April 14, 2019",Ten out of ten,An amazing building that could take days to enjoy if you have the time.The architecture itself is amazing.Easy access get there early and also visit the science museum next door another fascinating offer.
"Written April 14, 2019",Huge!!!,Very important museum where it is hard not to enjoy it.Can be very crowdy at certain spots but sure worth a visit. Or 2. Or 3...
"Written April 11, 2019",Outstanding museum ruined by crowds,"We adored the museum it is beautifully done and the interactive areas were worth the visit alone. Sadly we couldn’t enjoy the exhibits as much as we liked as the place was over run with students from language schools. There came a point when we were stepping over them in the dinaoaur exhibit because they were all sitting and laying on the floor. There was multiple staff around to witness them sit on the ground inside the exhibit areas blocking people from seeing everything but they didn’t make any move to stop them. The groups were also shoving and pushing both adults and young children to get in front to see things which was also allowed by staff on site. I would definitely go back but on a quiter period, the crowd control needs to be worked on desperately there were some areas where we were being herded like cattle through the rooms there were so many. If there had been a fire in the building it would have been a disaster it’s a health and safety risk having that many people in the one building."
"Written April 9, 2019",Something for everyone!,"We visited the NHM with our 4 children(6,9,13&17) during the busy Easter holidays. We didn’t have to queue to go in as we went about 1pm, we only spent about 2.5 hours as we just wanted to see the dinosaurs for our youngest and the human biology section for our oldest. But there really is something for everyone. Obviously the beauty of it being free is you dont feel obliged to spend hours there! The dinosaur section was absolutely packed so you feel a bit like you are on a conveyer belt but this isn’t unexpected when you go in school holidays! We had tea and cake in the cafe and it was nice, good coffee £27 for 3 coffees, 3 juice, 2 cookies and 2 muffins, so about average. We didn’t try the extra exhibitions but noticed you had to pay a supplementary cost for them."
"Written April 7, 2019",Go early!,"Hadn't visited since I was a kid so a good 30years+!! great to go and see all the exhibits, well what we could fit in to 2hrs. We got there around 9.45am on a Saturday, gates opened at 10am prompt so we just queued for a short while. As it's free though people do fill the place up quickly! main hall very impressive with the whale skeleton, we did the Dinosaur area, mammals, human evolution, creepy crawlies. We had a 6year old with us and she loved it! 2hrs enough for us though. We didn't eat here but plenty of cafes and restaurants in the place. Great to re-visit after all these years."
"Written April 5, 2019",The most interesting things are on the second floor,"The museum is excellent. But if you are a traditional museum goer skip the first floor which is more geared to younger viewers and focus on the second floor galleries. There you will find the Treasures exhibit and the Vault where very unique items are found. Once you are done there, then wander around the first floor. For example in the vault there is a meteor that had space diamonds, and in the Treasures exhibit is Charles Darwin's Origin of Species."
"Written April 4, 2019",Brilliant,Fascinating museum especially in a rain day..your mind fly from room to room with interest I love it  I'll come back as soon as possible
"Written April 4, 2019",Just a quick stop,First off-basic admission is free! We hurried through main entrance and ended eating at the restaurant called I think T Rex or something like that. Pizza was good. Service was also good. Then we spent most of our time in the Mineral/Gemstone wing.  It’s amazing.  Make sure to get back to the vault.  The collection of colored diamonds is a must see. 
"Written April 3, 2019",Amazing museum..... Definitely bring the kids to see it.,"It's an amazing museum. Staff during the visit were so friendly, polite, helpful and very attentive to visitors. The dinosaur section in the museum was my favourite.... Definitely put on your to do list in London. Kids would really enjoy it. Shame we hadn't enough time to get around the whole museum."
"Written April 2, 2019",Like nowhere else!,Even the building is amazing! The family just stood in awe when we entered the main doors. Impressive in the extreme.  
"Written May 11, 2019",Quick visit ,Whether you have time to visit the museum floor by floor and room by room or just have a quick look on the first floor you’re bound to be astonished.
"Written May 10, 2019",Truely amazing place.,Truely amazing place to visit if you like crowds. It was the weekend though so it should be busy. A must see buT allow plenty of time to look around.
"Written May 10, 2019",Natural History Museum,"The Natural History Museum was a place I had wanted to visit for quite a while. The building itself is beautiful with intricate stone carvings everywhere you look both inside and out. The collection inside is vast and, I believe, impossible to see in just one visit. Since there is no admission fee there are no line-ups to get in. The ₤1 cost for the map is well worth the price and the colour photo book is also a lovely souvenir of the place. While there were many people there it was easy to get around and to see the exhibits. The animatronic dinosaurs are a big hit with both the children and adults. The displayed are well laid out and clearly labelled. I was only able to see the dinosaurs and mammals exhibits but I do hope to go back sometime and see more. A very enjoyable visit."
"Written May 10, 2019",Natural history museum ,What an amazing place so much to see and learn about from dinosaurs to gem stones  meteorites and the huge whale skeleton suspend from the roof as you walk in best of all its free entry.

"Written May 10, 2019",Treat ,"Visited on a busy Thursday.  Very crowded as expected.  Free entry but has voluntary donation boxes. So much to see will be returning for another visit in the future.  Gift shops rather expensive.  Particularly enjoyed the dinosaurs but no ""Dippy"" on show. Animations were excellent especially the TRex. The museum is divided into Zones and there's clear information about what's in each one. Staff appeared friendly and knowledgeable keen to help. Enjoyed the Red zone learning about the earth and volcanoes and geological processes.  Lots of hand on things to entertain and educate people of all ages. Need more than one visit as so much to see and read. Didn't manage to visit some zones at all. "
"Written May 9, 2019",Amazing... very special place,The building alone is mind blowing.So much to see you cant absorb it all.The main hall is just amazing.
"Written May 8, 2019",Interesting!,Nice museum to take refuge from the rainy days of London ! :) Very new facilities and good location. 
"Written May 8, 2019",Superb exhibits and free to enter,"The only downside is that it was absolutely, critically PACKED full of people and you can't get near much.  This isn't their fault however and the quality of the exhibits deserve it a 5 star review.  The building is magnificent as well."
"Written May 8, 2019",A must see in London,"Not just dinosaurs, but the story of our galaxy and planet and a warning about what is going to happen if we don't take care of it.The building is itself an art piece."
"Written April 1, 2019",Favourite place in London,"My favourite place in London hands down. There's so much to see and learn, every time there's something new going on, too. The Vault is fabulous - worth visiting just to see the spectre of the coloured diamonds that (who knew!) glow in the dark.  "
"Written March 31, 2019",Simply outstanding,"A must see in South Ken! The great dinosaur at the entrance is breathtaking. Personally I adore wandering in the museum and dedicating time to the different sections.As an added bonus, what a beautiful building!"
"Written March 30, 2019",Never disappoints,"We have been here every London visit and it never disappoints!The galleries are well kept and well managed, the collection is massive and the changing exhibitions are really interesting.The cafe is decent too.A perfect day out, especially since you can go have lunch in Wagamama in high St Kensington, few minutes away, do a little shopping and then to back in for another round in the afternoon!

"Written May 4, 2019",Must see for kids,"It was amazing, the huge displays, detailing, coverage... very encouraging for kids and adults. It is pretty exhaustive too, so plan for two days or be ready for a 4-5 hour visit if only one day."
"Written May 3, 2019",nostalga and amazment,"We went to the natural history museum whilst in london, its really close to kensington tube station, so really easy to get to, the place is stll amazing as it was when i went as a small boy, the dinosaw fossils are awe inspiring, ant the animatronic T-REX leaves children and adults a gasp, the whale exibition is beath taking, okay some of the exibits are a bit old but then it is a history museum, Well worth a visit and great for children, Darwin would approve."
"Written May 2, 2019",Great museum,"A definite must see if you are in London and have a few hours to see and experience all things science. Make sure you go early as the queues to get in can take up to an hour, if not longer. The dinosaur exhibit and the human biology exhibits were very good, there were some repair works going on when we went which was a shame as some parts of the museum were closed.The layout was a little confusing so some more signage would be good"
"Written March 28, 2019",Excellent place to take and educate kids.,"I went with my 2 kids, they enjoyed and learned a lot of things about dinosaurs, other animals and natural topics during the visit to the museum."
"Written March 26, 2019",Jurassic Park with Dippy,"It was a night at the Museum watching Jurassic Park! One of my favourite films when I was a child. I love visiting the Natural History Museum anyway but when I saw this opportunity I couldn’t wait. The whole experience was magical, we were able to explore the Wildlife Photographer of the Year before the film started - which was incredible. The film was presented in the main hall and we were seat directly underneath the blue whale skeleton. As I love the film already I got engrossed and forgot there was a massive skeleton above my head, making me jump a few times. The environment definitely made the film more tense and spectacular. The event was organised with plenty of staff from the entrance, being seated and leaving. There was refreshments and complimentary popcorn, highly recommend and we can’t wait to book our next event with Luna Cinema - Jaws in water dinghy?"
"Written March 25, 2019",Excellent!,truly enjoyable so much to see. at every turn we were amazed.  it's immense.  great for picture taking if you don't use flash.  so much historical information and fascinating items of antiquity.  you'll love it.
"Written March 24, 2019",Nice Enough ,We decided to give this place a try and we really enjoyed it especially because it is free. There are a large number of impressive exhibitions from birds to dinosaurs so it is a good few hours worth of entertainment. I would recommend this place to visit if you are coming to London as it's certainly an experience you won't forget however there are a few things to consider before you go:1. If you want to feel like school sports day this is the place for you because there are children charging around all over the place to the point where I'm sure I shoulder barged some where they ran into me and bounced off because they weren't looking where they were going. So something needs to be done about the number of people they allow in. 2. The cafe/restaurant is quite poor with limited numbers of tables. The table we sat at was very wonky and I had a lovely shower of breakfast tea on my leg when my girlfriend picked up her coffee. So they need to sort this out. Other than these points it's well worth a visit.

"Written March 22, 2019",Amazing,This was my first time here & will need to go back as its so massive there isnt time to see everything properly
"Written April 30, 2019",Prepare to have your mind blown.,i know..seams a cliché..but prepare to have your mind blown...it s one of the best museum that i ve ever seen..
"Written April 30, 2019",Amazing visit,This experience reminds of me of a harry potter movie. The building outside what an awesome sight and when you go in you definitely need a half a day for this exploring.Its free
"Written April 29, 2019",Absolutely amazing!,"This museum is massive, and it would be impossible to cover it all in a day.  There is a great flow to the exhibits, and there is something for everyone.  Take your kids here to learn - very fun and interactive, but not over complicated.  We first walked by mid day on a Saturday and there was a huge line all the way back to the main gate.  We tried again on Sunday around 9:30 am (opens at 10 am) and it was perfect.  Do be warned this place gets very busy as it is free to enter."
"Written April 28, 2019",INTERESTING AND FUN,We visited the museum and to be honest we had a great time. It did not let us down. Plenty to see and do. Highly recommended. 
"Written April 25, 2019",interesting visit ,"We arrived just before opening and the queue was already huge! We got in pretty quickly when it opened though. Such a great free venue to see lots of interesting exhibits. Our sons loves the dinosaur section. Amazing building, clean toilets and great cafe too. "
"Written May 7, 2019",Amazing wealth of history,Very nice to visit but would recommend more interactive virtual reality tech to help with all the senses.
"Written May 7, 2019",Amazing trip in Natural History of Earth!,"I spent an amazing afternoon here, kids loved it, also myself! Take time to visit as many as possible exposition. Some are only for limited time! Kids can find information from the origin till our days, or even about ourselves! Last but not least, through some very expensive attractions in London, this one is free!"
"Written May 7, 2019",Lots  & lots to see and admire,"There is lots to see, and something that will always interest you. It is very big and you can depending on your time spend more than half a day here."
"Written May 6, 2019",Great activity for all ages,"We went there at an Sunday morning. I guess on sunylny days it's not so crowded like usually. We came directly on the morning and had not to queue.The building is impressive, special the big hall with the wale inside. It's decided into several parts and that makes it easier to plan it. It's also step free access.But some exhibitions, e.g. The dinosaur department was so crowded that it's not fun with a toddler going through. "
"Written May 6, 2019",Birthday Weekend,"The Natural History museum is a great place to visit, our children love it here.  The only think stopping me putting 5* were the crowds.  I had to leave my husband and children in the dinosaur area because it was just to much.  It’s one of those places where you wish you were David Attenborough and could go when everyone else has gone home."
"Written May 6, 2019","A cathedral to nature, constantly evolving ","The building is a museum in itself. It stunning majesty  of the blue whale as you enter, the open atrium and the bridge all make this a humbling day, learning of the complexity of nature, our impact the the power of the natural world.Enjoy the dinosaurs, the hailstorm of how they were collected and the minibeasts, birds and sea creatures,  but take time to look through the locked doors at the research libraries, the plans for the future and the knowledge of this imposing building.This is a full day out. We left as it closed and it had more to tel us. The geological section about rocks, earthquakes and volcanoes was well presented and engaging. There are a lot of interactive displays for children and information for older children and parents, well presented and informative. The blue whale in the atrium sums up the purpose of the museum well and the history of its purpose, designs and design are well worth a read. This is a beautiful creation, the detail in the design can be missed if you rush around. Take time to sit and look for the detail on the roof design and the archways.The earthquake simulation give a real sense of the enormity and fear with an earthquake that was in our lifetime. An absolute must visit, but give it a good amount of time - not to be rushed. "
"Written May 6, 2019",Red Zone,Wonderful exhibition on Human Evolution in the Red Zone. This museum has a lot of children visitors and there seemed to be a little less in this exhibit. Would definitely recommend (not just because there were less children). Volcanoes and Earthquakes was a great exhibit as well which includes an earthquake simulator and give you the chance to feel what it was like in Japan during the 2011 earthquake. Lots of interesting statistics plus an explanation of the different scales (like Richter).
"Written May 5, 2019",Excellent,"I was there with friends for few hours, but you can be there few days and it will be interesting. Amazing place with amazing history things. "
"Written May 5, 2019",Fantastic and vibrant ,"What a lovely museum to bring children to! This is a place you can stay for hours. They have Interactive meetings with dinosaurs and the understanding of Mother Earth. I found it a bit hard to navigate in the beginning, but after understanding the consept it was easier. Would love to go back!"
"Written May 4, 2019",To do with kids,"If your kids like culture and learn new things, this is a must. Earthquake, volcanos, dinosaurs... there is for all the tastes. Shame they only open at 10 "
"Written April 20, 2019",Half day visit ,"This is an amazing museum with so much to see and do. One of London’s favourite!We visited over school holidays, it took us about 10 minutes on a queue to get in. Sadly, the dinosaur exhibit was very crowed and people were a bit pushy and there were also lots of people with pushchairs, which made it even harder to get around. It would be nice to have some kind of crowd control so it does not spoil anyone’s visit. Entrance is free of charge but they ask people for donations.There are donation boxes and card machines  where you can donate as much as you like. It also looks like the some objects could do with some dusting and some interactive machines were not working. Overall, it is a great place to visit and we will definitely come back again some day. "
"Written April 19, 2019",Whale of A Time,"The blue whale that hangs from the ceiling is awesome.  Great family friendly place.  Lots, and lots to see and do.  Nice gift shop if you are looking for gifts or something for yourself.  Loved the marble statute of Darwin.  Be sure to visit the mineral section on the 2nd floor.  Some amazing specimens. Couple of minutes walking distance from the V&A Museum.  Nice way to spend the day between the two museums."
"Written April 18, 2019",Amazing place for the whole family,"With a 7yr old in tow, this was a cheap day out in London. Incredible exhibits & the dinosaurs & Earthquake zones were a maassive hit. The little one spent time reading the exhibit labels & there was plenty of interactive or touchable exhibits that she loved to explore & explained this to her visually.We bought a childs activity guide on the wah in for £4, which initially we thought pricey as we expected something similar to the Sea Life pack which lasted 2 minutes. Thankfully this is a proper book full of facts and activities, that she enjoyed & read to us as we went around, including about 'Hope' the whale. Well worth the money!We all agreed we'd need another visit to see everything properly. There's just not enough time to see & appreciate it all (we spent a lot of time in the beginning of time section). A packed lunch is a must as food can quickly add up for a family & get there early for the queues; although staff were amazing at getting everyone in quickly and co-ordinating us. A must for a family visit, as both kids & adults can enjoy it."
"Written April 18, 2019",Extremely crowded,"Nice museum with interesting g exhibits, but so many people that it was hard to the things.Museum is free but special exhibits cost entrance."
"Written April 18, 2019",Amazing!,"This was our first trip to the NHM and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The queue was massive but in fact it moved quickly and it only took us 10 mins to get inside.  I can't believe it's free to get it!!! So much to do and see we could have spent another day here.  My 11 year old loved it too, lots to keep him entertained.  The cafe is very expensive although that could just be London prices...."
"Written April 16, 2019",Overcrowded,Way Way Way to overcrowded! Survived 10 minutes and then ran for the exit! Not possible to enjoy the museum with so many visitors. Maybe the museum should take admission ... 
"Written April 16, 2019",Would have been a 5* if it wasn't for poor crowd-control,"My partner and I took his 7 and 10 year old in the Easter holidays. Fair enough, we thought it would be busy, and even the queue to get in didn't put us off.  However, the crowd control for the dinosaur bit was non-existent.  We were all rammed by push chairs on numerous occasions, people were pushy and very rude, and I literally came out feeling as though I'd run a marathon. If it wasn't for this, it would have been 5*.  It is a great attraction, it's free - you can't really complain too much!  But at what point does it become a genuine health and safety risk?"
"Written April 15, 2019",Favourite Museum,"We love to visit here. Staff are always friendly. The entrance to the museum is free but a donation is recommended. The dinosaur part has always been our boys favourite. They also love the blue section.The Coffee shop is typical attraction London prices. We’ve only had coffee there no food and it was ok. Toilets weren’t the best but it was very busy and could have been a lot worse.Lots to do. Staff are so helpful.We always take lunch and eat in the picnic area downstairs. This was spotless. Very clean. Highly recommended to all. Such a fun, informative place."
"Written April 15, 2019",Half a day visit in the museum,We had a short but good half day in the natural museum. The museums entry fee is free and the building itself is already an eye catcher. Our kids like the dinosaur part the most.
"Written April 14, 2019",Great family outing,"I love museums and visiting this was a must do in London. Entry is free, there is an in-house cafe and you can easily get around if you’re on wheelchair or pushing a pram."
"Written March 19, 2019","An enormous museum, rooms of exhibits.","It was a Saturday afternoon, it was school holidays, most of London was crowded into this museum, had to fight my way around to see anything. Did not enjoy!!"
"Written March 19, 2019",Well worth a Visit ,"A very well organised set up, can be very busy with visiting school parties,however a very pleasant half day"
"Written March 17, 2019",My Fiance's Birthday,"So, me and my fiance were in London for her birthday, i thought it would be sweet to take her to the museums as I knew there was a butterfly exhibit on.That was absolutely amazing! However...the rest of the Museum...wasnt to my expectations. I genuinely feel the Manchester Museum had more to offer. There was hardly any exhibits, it was difficult to navigate and the food prices were...yikes.However the butterfly exhibit was beautiful and well worth the money."
"Written March 16, 2019",Wildlife Photography extravanganza,"Such an amazing exhibition. A family of teenagers, parents and grandparents. We had prebooked the tickets so had direct access and did not have to join the entry queue outside as being half term was busy. Exhibition on for a while yet - quite fantastic. "
"Written March 15, 2019",Busy at half term but we keep returning,My son and I regulary return to the history museum purely because he has a keen interest in Space and there is an entire area focused on this. Will return again no doubt. 
"Written March 14, 2019",Must-visit for families,"My 6 yr-old loved the exhibits, especially the dinosaurs, mammals and sea life. Lots to learn and discover for young ones and keep them entertained."

"Written March 7, 2019",Cool museum in an incredible space,"The building itself was absolutely incredible, inside & out. The museum was packed when I went around 4:45p, but the exhibits that I saw were interesting "
"Written March 6, 2019",Amazing ,I was so excited to visit and the place didn’t disappoint. Just amazing setup very engaging grabs your interest. The dinosaur exhibit was a little crushed to many people for anyone to have a real good look. The only downside was the toilets in the basement area/ picnic room where horrible. Through over use I would say. They were either blocked up with loo roll or just in need of tlc. 
"Written March 6, 2019",Great museum ,"I have to say had been looking forward to visiting the museum for a long time and was excited to go. Now we didn't get round a lot of the museum but have to say the areas we did see were fascinating, so left more to see on our next visit. "
"Written March 5, 2019",Amazing and a Definite Place to Visit if in London,Went here while on business in London. Stopped first to enjoy the museum which was absolutely wonderful. The building itself is like being in Hogwarts from Harry Potter movies. The displays are large and quite impressionable. We also had an evening function here after the Museum closed. Quite a location for special events. No need to do much decorating as the museum itself if amazing. The staff were also wonderful and quite accommodating for the evening celebration.
"Written March 5, 2019",Impressive,Wonderful museum. Very big.Interesting for adults and children.Absolutely free and served by a close underground
"Written March 4, 2019",Just ok for us,"We visited this museum and were fortunate to compare with similar museums from other parts of the world. While the info is properly displayed, I found the overall to lack that attraction factor. The collections were not as rich as we expected and a few areas were really dark. Just ok for us."
"Written March 4, 2019",History for free!,This is the place of my childhood I remember vividly my first visit and its still one of my favourite museums in the world. The collections in her will blow your mind and if you take your kids theirs too. I saw so many gasps and wide eyed surprises round every corner. Plus the building itself is just so glorious.
"Written March 3, 2019",Natural History Museum,"I am very fortunate that I get to visit London every summer with classes from University.  I never miss the Natural History Museum--the displays have been revamped recently, so if you haven't been in a few years, by all means go!"
"Written March 3, 2019",Natural wonders of our world!,A wonderful museum to visit time and again! Can be busy and noisy... But so many animals to be seen! T Rex and the palaeontology section is obviously to be seen but do not ignore the rest ! Come back if you do not have enough time !!
"Written March 3, 2019",Busy but good,Visited on a Saturday in half term so it was extremely busy. That said the staff are great and you can spend as long as you like inside. A great day out. 
"Written March 3, 2019",Wildlife photography of the year 2019,Definitely worth of going to watch the best wildlife photographers of the world works. Best time for family with children is weekend or adults during the week.
"Written March 1, 2019",A cathedral to nature,"Wonderful place and so interesting.  The building exterior looks fantastic with its interesting blue and pastel faded bricks, the interior is more so.  I didn't realise but this was the first museum or 'collection' that was open to the general public.  Prior to that all exhibits were only for the eyes of selected guests and wealthy sponsors.  In his own words, Richard Owen, the creator of the Natural History Museum has truly built a 'Cathedral to nature'.  Sadly his statue which used to occupy the central position in the main hall has been replaced by the better known Sir Charles Darwin.  It was lovely to see so many well-behaved school parties drinking in the information and experience."
"Written February 25, 2019",Extremely busy,South Kensington underground exit brings you right to the door of the museum. It is free to enter but it has to be an one of the most crowded museums I have ever been to.Even though it was a mid week visit it wasn’t easy to see many of 5he wonderful exhibits. I would though take five minutes and consider if you really want to pay the extra for the display of nocturnal animals. Personally we didn’t think it was worth it having seen very similar displays for free in other museums.
"Written February 23, 2019",Half term visit with 5yo,"We had a very nice time here. There was lots to see and do,  but children may be bored after a few hours. There was plenty of information on hand for adults, and lots of interactive things for kids to enjoy. Some of these were out of order, which was a bit disappointing but there were plenty of alternatives. There were plenty of cafes and toilets, though the cafes were a little expensive. The gift shop was reasonably priced though. We got there relatively early so did not have to queue for long, but by lunchtime the queues were very long. We struggled a bit finding our way around the museum, as the ‘zone’ maps were a bit confusing, and you often had to walk through exhibits to get to others, which we weren’t expecting. The displays were very well thought out and I could have spent much longer in a few of them, my son enjoyed the earthquake experience especially.A very nice way to keep children and adults interested and occupied during the holidays."
"Written February 21, 2019",Packed but Worth it,"Went on a Saturday, had a nice long queue to get in a bit of rain but once in I was memorized. You are greeted by the giant blue whale skelleton hanging in the main hall. it's flanked with a few displays and the gargoyles of the animals that run up the pillars are cute to find and look at.went in the T-rex grill meal was alright. but you don't go to a museum for food.\loved going up the long escalator through the metal globe was neat.the gem galley was beautiful.the dinosaur gallery was way too crowded and having to follow the path was squishy.love the T-rex.and the exterior so nice.will retun if I ever get back to London"
"Written February 21, 2019",Half term craziness ,"We are members so the queue to get in isn’t a problem (buy a membership if you want the same perk), however there is always a queue to get in, but it appears in half term it’s much much longer.  Once we walked past the long queue and entered we were met with huge crowds of people inside.  Something I learnt on my latest trip - small children go home for a nap around 2ish.  This means if you go after that time it’s much much quieter and you can see the exhibits much easier.  You can also walk around a little quicker and the queues for food are shorter.   If you can, visit after this time and stay until it closes (5.50 yesterday).  As well as bypassing the queue, if you buy a membership to the museum you can get into all the fee paying exhibits for free, you also get 20% off of food and items you buy in the gift shop.  There is also a private members only section that has amazing views out of the front of the museum and gives you somewhere quiet to relax and have lunch.   I took off a star as the waiting staff in the members only area don’t know what customer service is, and have no sense of urgency.  "
"Written February 21, 2019",If able to visit when it’s not school holidays take the opportunity,Well worth visiting but extremely busy at school holidays. Magnificent building with a fabulous selection of exhibits. Go early if in holidays before the queues we got there just after opening. It is free to enter but for the length of time you can spend viewing everything a donation is appreciated by staff. Plenty of places to eat or drink although expensive but that’s London prices so you expect it.  My tip for visiting London if using the tube. Adult paying passengers with a bank card that has a touch payment can be used like a Oyster Card. Your bank card on exiting picks up which zone you are in so therefor no need to keep queuing for tube tickets .
"Written February 19, 2019",Simply the best family day in London!,My family was extremely impressed with the collection of curated art installation from prehistoric dinosaur fossils to the fine priceless Jewelry at The Vault.This is definitely among one of our favourite museums in the World and we strongly recommend this “must do” if you’re in London with the kids.Do dedicate at least 1/2 day to explore and another 1 hour to visit the souvenir shops. We managed to get some nice gifts for our family and friends.
"Written February 15, 2019",Inspirational museum !!,"Went with 2 children aged 8&10. Though some of the museum seems intellectually challenging, the skeletons of giraffe, dinosaurs etc was a huge Succes for the children, and generated much dialogue around the history of nature. Highly recommended for a dialogue creating experience on nature.  "
"Written February 15, 2019",Hoped for more dinosaurs but... ,"I over expected this place. It was my fault. I was too excited to see dinosaur bones at this museum but was a little disappointed to see only a small section of dinosaur bones. However everything else was very interesting. Those who favour sciences would love to spend more than a day here. The building is so huge, I wished I had more time with it. Still a lovely place to be at too "
"Written February 14, 2019",Never get tired of this place...,"I have been visiting this pace since a boy. It never fails to inspire and excite me. I had a few spare hours and had not visited for many, many years so popped in - so glad I did!"
"Written February 14, 2019",Birthday trip,It has been some time since we last visited the museum but it is still as fascinating as ever and even more enjoyable.
"Written January 3, 2019",Great free attraction,A short queue but this free attraction has great exhibits for kids. Mine enjoyed the human body section where they learnt about cells and how the body works. Dinosaur section is a must see! Also they have Andy’s clock from Andy’s dinosaur adventures the tv show.

"Written December 31, 2018",Short time,Just a quick visit as the young member in our group wanted to see where Paddington Bear came during the first film! Late on in the day as it was our last day in London but had time to look around downstairs & first floor. Should have come here earlier on in the day. Must try harder next time!
"Written December 31, 2018",Busy but great,There is so much interesting stuff to see here. Really you need to visit more than once to see everything properly. It was majorly busy at New Years but we managed to see what we wanted too. 
"Written December 30, 2018",Victim of its own success,"The museum is great. But we couldn’t see any of it due to the massive crowds and queues everywhere. There is a long queue to get in, long queue for the cloakroom, long queue for the toilets, long queues for the exhibits. Then when you are in an exhibit, there are so many people around that you can’t see any of it, and feel like you are in a massive washing machine of people. We managed an hour before giving up, then had to wait for ages to get the pushchair out of the cloakroom again."
"Written December 20, 2018",AMAZING,"It is sad to see someone who complains about even dropping a donation, the place deserves it and then some.So inspiring, for everyone."
"Written December 19, 2018",Exceptional museum!,The (free) museum itself is spectacular to view. It’s an exceptional building with lots of interesting exhibitions. Ranging from mammals to the human body. Great for adults and kids. There was an ice skating rink outside the museum with a couple of food stalls. 
"Written December 17, 2018","So much to see, it's endless","Amazing building housing some fantastic exhibits. Our young ones got themselves a kids guide and wanted to make a bee line for the Dinosaurs. We entered via Exhibition Street and missed all the lines. The first stop was the cloak room which was good to have and at £2 a coat we were not disappointed.We took the opportunity to head through the volcanic globe to the earthquake simulation and volcano exhibit.We then started to make our way to the blue zone stopping where we could whilst our 5 year old pushed through to the dinosaurs. The birds are fantastic and a rare site many being extinct as were the mammals that we saw along the way.The Main Hall was great with the Blue Whale skeleton suspended above and other skeletons dotted around including a Mastodon.Andy's clock from Andy's prehistoric adventures was fantastic for the kids and they were so excited to have a picture with it. We finally made it to the Dinosaur exhibit and the robotic Trex is amazing and great showing, however it did scare the kids which made the rest of the Dinosaur exhibit a bit of a miss.Managed to get around the Blue Whale, Mammal and other sea creatures exhibit before the kids were over it and wanted out.Fair warning to all with young kids, bring snacks and be prepared to miss many exhibits wanting to come back on your own.Great opportunity and I recommend going on a school day and entering via Exhibition street"
"Written December 16, 2018",Fascinating place,"When in London this is a must whether you have small children teens or just adults.convinently located in South Kensington near the underground station and easily accessible. Free entry induce gift shops restaurant coffeyshops . Can easily spend all day looking at dinasour bones , human anatomy and much more. Can be quite busy during holidays."
"Written December 13, 2018",So cool! ,"Love the fact the museum in London are free to visit. Makes for a crowded trip but everyone should be able to experience these incredible places. The exhibits were as impressive as the architecture of the building. The dinosaur exhibit was a bit hectic and busy. If you can spare the cash, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit is definitely worth the visit. "
"Written January 21, 2019",Must see attraction,Worth visiting for the entrance hall alone - an incredible piece of architectural design. There are so many sections to visit - the dinosaur section is atmospheric and brilliant fun for young and old.  I also love the birds and fossils with everything they tell you about Victorian England.  The annual wildlife photography exhibition is beautiful. I go every year. Lovely downstairs picnic area so you can take your own food and get yourself a coffee.Very well organised and a shop full of very tempting gifts.
"Written January 20, 2019",Crowded but amazing,"The museum itself is amazing! I loved every part of it!The only recommendation would be to avoid going there on weekends. The amount of screaming children is gigantic and it is a bit of a bummer since it is a museum. If you happen to see a lot of children and families around, stay clear of the dinosaurs, because although it is extremely fascinating, you almost can’t move in the aisles because of the amount of people (and strollers) there."
"Written January 19, 2019",Finest historical collection,A great place to visit and enjoy the rich historical artifacts and many other collection.

I myself also loved the exhibits about the mammals, preferably the see mammals. The entrance is free, so that is really nice. Really worth the visit.

"Written January 8, 2019",Extraordinary,"We visited here on the second day of our three day trip to London in November.It is truly a marvellous structure, not unlike Hogwarts, giving what feels like a travel in time.The exhibits too are fantastic if a little dated in various areas.Make sure you get here early as when we was leaving the queue was exceptionally large, and be prepared for the Dinosaur exhibit to be heaving as this is the most popular attraction within the museum."
"Written January 6, 2019",Everything I Expected,"The museum is wonderful! Reminds me of the movie ""Night at the museum"". Lots to look at and learn. I enjoyed the mixture of old and new things to view. I enjoyed the flow of the museum making it easy to navigate. If you like history, animals and beautiful architecture this is the Museum for you. Great for families or a fun day trip activities. Also a close walk to other major London Attractions."
"Written January 6, 2019","Amazing collection, beautiful architecture, terrible crowds","The museum's architecture is as amazing as its collection and alone is worth the visit. However, the crowds are terrible. Thankfully, we arrived early - about 15 minutes before the museum opened - to line up and enjoy some parts of the museum before it was entirely overrun. The dinosaur exhibit was extremely popular, as expected, and is designed in a way that forces visitors to follow a path. Unfortunately, it was very congested and it was very challenging to appreciate and enjoy the exhibit. With that in mind, we were still able to visit most of the museum in about 2-2.5 hours. "
"Written January 6, 2019",Natural history museum ,"This is one of best museum I have ever been. This museum will sure teach you lots of things and knowledge. I recently visit to see blue whale skeleton. They always have new things in display and also exhibition of best photos and collections. I would like to go this museum whenever I can. The building architecture is amazing. If you have kids please take them, I am sure they will love it. "
"Written January 6, 2019",A great place to study crowds & noise,"The collection is old but still fascinating. However, children running and screaming, grown-ups reading out-loud the descriptions or proclaiming whatever they see  is so cute, makes it hard to concentrate on the exhibits.  It is high time that museums start 'silent days'; days on which visitors only whisper."
"Written January 6, 2019",Educational,Great museum with wide variety of exhibits from volcanos and earthquakes to dinosaurs and whales and everything in between. A must visist place in london
"Written January 16, 2019",Interactive fun,Well worth a visit - lots of interactive exhibits Great for a family and you could easily spend a few hours pottering. 
"Written January 15, 2019",GO and be WOW,"It will be one of those best half day spend indoors. you probably won't be able to complete everything because there are just so much to cover, so take a map, go to the one that interest you  most and work you way around. "
"Written January 15, 2019",The building alone is worth the trip,This is a magnificent museum that can be enjoyed on many levels: it's as wonderful for adults as it is for children. And the museum's architecture is a marvel. This museum really shouldn't be missed.
"Written January 15, 2019",Our second visit,"Visited again as last time we did not manage to see everything. Had a great time again, kids learned a lot about life and animals. Would recommend to anybody but specially to families with young children. "
"Written February 5, 2019",Amazing even for adults,"My husband and I visited here on Sunday.  Free entry.  We spent a good three hours in there, visiting the Darwin Centre and the dinosaurs and mammals and so much more.  It was brilliant.  "
"Written February 4, 2019",Never disappoints,"I've been to the museum more times than I can count but will never be bored by the immense number of exhibits. Brought family and friends, both of whom were in awe of the vast great hall. Make time to spend more than a couple of hours there if you want to view everything in one trip. Recommended for everyone at least once!"
"Written February 4, 2019",TERRIBLE,never ever visit this absolutely awful museum ! there is only 1 entrance for some strange reason that takes you ages to get into ! you have to walk round the entire building to get in ! Avoid !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Written February 3, 2019",Awesome! Hard to believe it was free too!!!!,My family and I went to this and you could spend all day going around this as there’s so much to see. If you have kids this is a must for a trip to London. The fact that it is free is a huge bonus as I’ve paid lots of money to go to attractions that aren’t half as good as this! 
"Written February 3, 2019",Dinosaurs!!,At first we were disappointed that Dippy the Diplodocus was on tour and not there to greet us but there is just so much to see there. We happily got lost amongst the various displays and spent a good few hours meandering amongst the animals. Would gladly go back and experience their Dino-Snore evenings! 
"Written January 29, 2019","""In awe of this place""","Visiting this place during the Christmas season is definitely something amazing. We got to visit the museum, spent almost half a day there and the kids loved it. During the winter period, the ice skating ring is magical in the night as the lights turn on. Definitely a great place for young and old to visit!"
"Written January 27, 2019",Dinosnores,"Just returned from a night at the museum having stayed at Dinosnores as part of a group with four adults and four children. The children had a great time; taking part in the activities and sleeping on the 1st floor of Hintz Hall. There are a few things that need addressing though..there were about 600 in attendance which was ok most of the time as you were split into groups however the toilet facilities were not up to scratch, they smelt and there was no way near enough open to accommodate the crowds. We were lucky at bedtime in that we were located on the first floor well away from the main stairs and toilets, I felt sorry for the people who were placed near these as there was a lot of footfall. The breakfast was pretty poor... a tiny muffin and a little natural yogurt, it would not have taken much to have improved on this. There wasn’t enough time allocated for the T-shirt drawing which left you feeling rushed, like you were on a conveyor belt, they could just go straight into drawing on the T-shirt rather than practicing on paper first. Despite the negatives which I do feel need addressing given that if there was 590 people in attendance (as advised )and each had paid £60 which must have totalled in the region of £35k it was a good memorable experience. The staff were helpful and the likes of Leonie and her team did their best given the volume of people.  "
"Written January 26, 2019",One of the best in its class!,"Great museum, with plenty to see in its diverse sections. We’ve visited the Dinosaurs, the Mammals (with a huge blue whale in it), the Earth section, which houses an impressive 5,000+ gems collection and also an earthquake simulator. Unfortunately we could not cover it all in half a day but it was well worth the visit.We had the chance to have lunch at the main restaurant, which was very good, indeed.Recommended as a top attraction to be seen in London!"
"Written January 24, 2019",Dino Butts,I wanted to give a 5 for this attraction so badly. But I felt the dinosaur hall was neglected. It looks like they had an awesome suspended walkway at one time that gave an up close view of the dinosaur skeletons - but it was closed when we went. This made it so your only view of most the dinosaur skeletons was from underneath them. So basically your view was of dinosaur bellies and butts. 
"Written January 24, 2019",W O W,"This was our first choice attraction when we arrived in London mid December. After a long walk to Cromwell Road we walked down the ramp to see the most exquisite setting with the Museum, a divinely lit carousel, Christmas tree and ice skating rink. Wow. Will never forget that image. What a beautiful welcome. The architecture of the museum is stunning, inside and out. Be prepared to go back and forth a bit, maybe a map might have helped, but we didn't have one. Displays are impressive. Wish I'd have brought the kids when they were still interested in dinosaurs. But so much to see and experience. Unless you're a local who can return regularly to see specific areas, allow plenty of time, including a break. It's almost overwhelming to just keep going from room to room. We stayed for around 5 hours and still did not complete the entire museum.  Suggest later in the afternoon and into the nights when they open until extra late, so that the crowds are much less ... we could barely walk a centimetre at a time in the dinosaur exhibit. Not pleasant.The museum is free, as all state or national museums around the world should be. I didn't appreciate the aggressive suggestion to donate 5 pounds upon entry. The female staff even said as such directly to the children. Appalling. I had no intention of donating 30 pounds for our family visit, which is nearly double in AUD. Note to that lady: I add to the coffers everywhere we visit by way of donation or purchasing something onsite depending on the situation ... I spend a lot more than 5 pounds each to feed each person in my family during our breaks. And then the mementoes ... that contributes to the coffers. Maybe just smile and say ""Welcome"". Ironic if you earned a wage."
"Written January 15, 2019",4 year old birthday,"We took our 4 year old to the museum to see the dinosaurs. We hadn’t been for years, probably since we were kids! I think it’s definitly suited to older children, the dinosaur section has moved and is in a smaller area now which is shame. There’s lots of interesting things to see and read about for older children."
"Written January 15, 2019",Best Natural History Museum in the World? Maybe certainly the most beautiful,Loved by every member of our family young and old. Doesn't falter. The baby Blue whale has replaced the familiar Diplodocus but only whilst it is on tour. They still have a great Triceratops specimen as well. You can spend a day here and not see it all. Free with some paid visiting exhibitions that sell out fast.
"Written January 13, 2019",Blown my mind!,Can not believe how amazing this place was! Really is spectacular snd the pictures and seeing it on TV does not do it justice!Place is extremely warm however so make sure you can take off a layer of clothing!
"Written January 13, 2019",Magnificent Blue Whale Skeleton Hanging Above Your Head,"Amazing place everyone should visit. The building itself is quite impressive, especially its grand, jaw-dropping hall. Under a roof there is a blue whale skeleton suspended that once belonged to the biggest species on Earth. The range of exhibits is enormous and they are well described. The downside of the free entry is literally dozens of hundreds of people you encounter there when trying to get close to everything you are interested in. Most of the younger children - 10 years old and younger - are disinterested and annoying but not as much as silly adults who head to the museum not to learn and see the priceless exhibits but to take dozens of stupid selfies with artefacts as a background. And this is really pathetic but what can you do... The mankind`s IQ is getting lower and lower, with a dramatic speed."
"Written January 12, 2019",Super Interesting...,"Worths every moment you have to spend there... It is huge, but the exhibitions are designed to educate people, especially children. The descriptions are sort and comprehensive. Even for a biologist like myself it is extremely interesting, due to the complete collection of animals, skeletons, plants, minerals.... I would say THE natural history you should pay a visit. There is no admission fee for the permanet exhibitions, donations are suggested. Some exhibitions require additional ticket, but better book them before, cause some days are sold out. The building itself is very interesting, and if you want to rest during your visit, try a snack or beverage in the central cafe... for royal atmosphere!"
"Written January 12, 2019","Don`t miss the ""Life in the Dark""!","Just been to see the Life in the Dark- exhibition It is absolutely amazing! Take your time and don`t rush through it, there is so much to see and learn. I had ""wow!""-moments in every nook and cranny of it, there are so many interesting details. The exhibition is beautifully made and knowledge about how animals, bats, insects, fish and other creatures survive in dark environments such as caves, deep sea and so on is effectively demonstrated. Excellent place to bring your kids or just go by yourself to learn more about nature. "
"Written January 12, 2019",Grand morning out,Sure its lovelyNot the louvre but a lovely morning spent wandering aroundDo search for events coming up there...we missed the photos of 2018 which would have been fab to get tickets for

"Written January 12, 2019",Beautiful ,Grat day for young and old many levels amazing artifacts every level many cultureal items displayed need a wjole day there but you will be amazed
"Written January 11, 2019",The best museum of this kind in the world,"The collection of the 'Natural History Museum' is truly huge and is the largest of its kind in the world. The most popular part of the museum is the Dinosaur Gallery, a place where visitors can learn more about these giant creatures. It is possible to see different skeletons and models, including those known as T-rex. The museum is free - no tickets. There was no crowd! my visit time: 2 hours in the afternoon (working day).Something beautiful in London (my taste). One of the favorite parts of the Museum is the Power Within gallery where you can experience simulations of volcano eruption or simulation of earthquake."
"Written February 13, 2019","Returning to the favorite museum of my youth, it’s not changed at all but of course it’s not the same without Dippy.","For me as for many people this is simply one of the most magical buildings in London.  As a kid this was always my favorite museum and I even held a few birthday parties here but life happens and I had not returned in ages.  In my opinion I would be as bold as to say it has not changed at all bar one MAJOR loss, that of Dippy :( the blue whale just does not have the wow or lovability factor that Dippy possessed.  Other than that the huge slice of tree trunk, Blue Whale, Mammoth and Dinosaurs are in place but I was quite surprised and a tad disappointed at the lack of noticeable evolution (pun intended haha).   Having the main entrance out of use at the height of the season seemed not the best timing and sacrilege given what a stunning entrance it is.  Is it wonderful though to see people passing on their own memories of the place to their own kids etc and long may it continue.Of course it’s still magnificent in essence but feels a little like it stood still in time.  The facilities are great, with bag drop off etc.  Worth a revisit for nostalgia’s sake."
"Written February 12, 2019",Reminds me of Hogwarts,"I know a lot of people might skip this in lieu of the V&A or the British museum (both of which are amazing and excellent), but we loved this place so much!  The building itself is so magical with all the carvings of creatures everywhere and gilded tiles on the ceiling.  It was one of my most favorite place we visited in London and will be one of the first places I revisit when I return.  What was your favorite dinosaur when you were a kid?  Mine was Plesiosaur and they have so many of them!!-that was an unexpected bonus."
"Written February 11, 2019",Amazing,"Love this museum. There is so much to see and so much to discover. Love the part with all the dinosaurs, the big skeletons and the journey through the earth. "
"Written February 11, 2019",Simply fantastic,"My favourite building in London, It is beautiful inside and outside. Exhibits are fascinating. And to think there is no entry fees.Only negative is that in the summer the queues are so long. You have to be patient."
"Written February 10, 2019",The Wider Earth,"We went to see The Wider Earth at the Natural History Museum and in the first half we (including the other people in our row) were regularly  disturbed by the young children (aged 3 or 4) behind us. They were constantly wandering up and down their row touching our heads. In addition there was also a baby in the row which started crying and which the mother finally took out after repeated efforts to quieten it. The people in our row said the minimum age for children was supposed to be 8. Anyway all  the row behind  us left at the interval, so the second half was fine. I did have correspondence with the National History Museum after this and they said that 8 was only a guideline and that they ‘welcomed children of all ages’. I replied this was irresponsible as this was a play not a pantomime and I also pointed out that as the tickets were not cheap they NHM) should have handled things better. With regard to the play itself I would say that it was aimed at 8-12 year olds so don’t expect any depth."
"Written February 9, 2019",Great to look at but food was disappointing ,"Me and my boyfriend loved looking around the museum on a Saturday morning but sadly was disappointed when it came to the food. I have coeliac disease so eating gluten free is crucial for me. After arriving at the TRex restaurant we asked if they had gluten free options and was told they could provide pizzas and salads, 10 -15mins later after we gave our order reminding the waiter for GF options and that was that. He then came back and told us that they had “run out” of gluten free bases despite the fact it was 11:50am. Time wasted, hungry and disappointed so we left the museum."
"Written February 6, 2019",Not enough time,"Given my limited time in London, I chose to graze among the various museums, rather than see them in any depth. The place was knee deep in school groups; my choice of exhibits was entirely dependent on where the children were not.A great deal of thought and imagination went into the exhibits: the history of the steam engine, Darwin, gift shop. My guess is there are very few days without crowds."
"Written February 5, 2019",Amazing even for adults,"My husband and I visited here on Sunday.  Free entry.  We spent a good three hours in there, visiting the Darwin Centre and the dinosaurs and mammals and so much more.  It was brilliant.  "

"Written November 25, 2018",Never too old to learn ,Great time spent in stunning surroundings. There’s so much to see that you’re bound to miss something. Enjoy the exhibits and marvel at the building. Go early and use the side entrance if you can. The queue was huge when we left but it was a Saturday. 
"Written November 24, 2018",Exciting at any age,"My husband and I were at the Natural History Museum for the first time and it's a very interesting and exciting place! You don't need to be a child or to come here with children to truly enjoy the visit.We went straight to the Dinosaurs exhibit which is amazingly made, very informative and interesting. There is also a great dinosaur themed gift shop near the exhibit. All other exhibits, like mammals, minerals etc., are also very interesting. The building itself is a piece of art and worth reading about at the top floor.The entrance is free and you can easily spend here few hours, it's a perfect activity for a rainy day."
"Written November 20, 2018",Natural History Museum,"The Natural History was cool, but I wouldn't rank it at the top compared to the other things to do in London, or even just compared against some of the other museums around London.The building itself is beautiful, but it is massive.  You could easily spend an entire day here and just scratch the surface of the depth and breadth of the collection.  Be sure to have a plan before you arrive because the museum doesn't give away maps and the museum itself is confusingly arranged into zones.We did some research before we went and purchased a guide book that included a map of the building so that we wouldn't have to buy one there.  We allocated 3 hours to tour the museum and that was plenty of time for us to see what we wanted to see with a break at the café to have lunch.  We were also there on Remembrance Day, so the museum was packed with people.We arrived right as the museum was opening, so we didn't have to queue long to get in.  The Dinosaurs, Minerals, and the Treasures Room were our top favorites.They have a few restaurants to choose from.  We ate at the cafe and it was really good!  They also have a fancier table service restaurant and a cafeteria style food court.  There are a few gift shops as well if you want to pick out some souvenirs.  We arranged our day to have a walk through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens before walking over to the museum which opens at 10.  I thought that was a good use of time."
"Written November 19, 2018",A London Landmark,"I have been to NHM many times, as a child on school trips and now taking my own children to go and see the dinosaurs. My children absolutely love the museum and all the interesting exhibitions. We tend to get there early before it opens but even then there is always a queue, but once you are in the crowds disperse and it's actually quite a nice morning out. We have eaten at the restaurant on site too as this was reasonably priced for London with a good selection of food. But the best visit was for a wedding reception in the main hall. It was beautiful! If I could go back and marry my husband again, I would most definitely have our reception here as it is so different and magical. "
"Written November 19, 2018",Informative half day activity for the family,This museum is free to enter and great for something to do with the slightly older children as there is quite a bit to get around!
"Written November 17, 2018",Great museum,"Thoroughly enjoyed most of the museum. A great place to walk around and spend time. Also, free but donations are definitely welcomed."
"Written November 17, 2018",Best museum in London,"We visited the museum mainly to see the whale but then the more we started to explore it was super interesting. They had different categories from fossils, gems, science, sea creatures, birds and more. We need a good half day in order to go through all. I suggest a full day for a nice and relaxing time specially if you go with kids. Definitely worth the visit I recommend!"
"Written November 14, 2018",Dino Snores,"Amazing - what an incredible experience for the kids and adults.  We intentionally didn't visit the museum before so it was all new and exciting.  Arrived to make up our camp then run around exploring (burning off some energy)!  Met new friends, designed a t-shirt, did a torch light trail in the dinosaur hall, had snack and then watched a science show.  Mid-night lights out and 7am breakfast then an Animal Man Show.  We spent all day Sunday in the museum and could have stayed longer.  Few things I wish I'd known but they didn't spoil the experience at all - there is a snack vending machine in the dining hall so don't panic looking for a shop if you haven't remembered to pack snack, the hall got very cold at night so bring a jumper to sleep in, if you didn't book on the same booking with friends you will be put in different groups even if you chose the same group name, breakfast is a fruit muffin and yoghurt which very few kids ate so bring something they will eat and very importantly tea and coffee is available for the adults at snack time and at breakfast!  Suggestions for the planners - the science show was last so around 10pm and a lot of the kids fell asleep in the chairs so didn't see it or participate.  Might be an idea to switch the order of activities somehow.  Also, the rubbings in the dinotrail didn't work and the strings were too short for the kids to hold.  Stamping might work better."

"Written December 11, 2018",Very busy,Should have realised school holiday. In school half term DO NOT use South Kensington station. Use nearby Gloucester rd station instead only a min or two further to walk but well worth hassle of battling with horrendously overcrowded South Kensington
"Written December 9, 2018",History come to life,"We specifically went there with the sole purpose of viewing the Mary Anning fossil.  Most of us read the book ""Remarkable Creatures"" by Tracy Chevalier.  There was an actress playing the part of Mary which added to the experience.  There was so much to see at this museum, we did not have the time to do this museum justice. Perhaps our next trip to London. "

"Written December 3, 2018",Lots of fun,We arrived 5 minutes before the doors open and there was a huge queue but when it got to 10am it moved really fast. I thought there would be a bag search and more security but there wasn’t. It’s donations & no charge for the museum so we put £5 in for about an hours visit. Lots to see and the ice skating/carousel made it feel nice and Christmassy

"Written November 7, 2018",Interesting prehistoric fossils in beautiful architecture,"Housed in one of the most architecturally beautiful buildings in the city, one could very well go just to admire the large halls and towering facades. In the main hall you now have the skeleton of a prehistoric blue whale, replacing its dinosaur predecessor. They have fun events every now and then, like showcasing horror movies this past Halloween, so do check their page. Otherwise, they have nice displays of all kinds of prehistoric creatures ranging from creepy crawlies to mammoths. Great for family days out and will keep children engaged.  "
"Written November 6, 2018",Best to Visit Earlier In The Day,We were there at 10.00 am and already it was starting to become busy. Going a weekday there was the usual school excursion groups. It was a nice way to spend a few hours with excellent displays. The Dinosaurs were very popular so going early helped with a bit lesser crowds to get round. This is Free to enter so well worth a visit.
"Written November 6, 2018",Very busy - but still great day out,"We visited this the week after the main half term and were amazed at just how busy it still was. There was an hour to queue before getting in. Once inside there are some fabulous exhibits - the dinosaurs were a big hit, as was the giant whale. There were also a couple of volunteers who were really engaging - our little girl was fascinated and loved being able to handle the shells and other exhibits there."
"Written November 6, 2018",A fascinating place for many hours of visiting,"A very interesting exhibit that poses, among other things, various types of animals, including those that have long since perished - it is worth seeing a corner of dinosaurs.A great collection of minerals made also a very big impression on me."
"Written November 4, 2018","A great place to learn about the past, present and future of our planet.","What a great museum. If you want to learn about our planet and see things that you would not normally be able to appreciate and experience then visit the Natural History Museum. The amazing full size whale (previously a dinosaur) is amazing to see.The guides are very approachable, educated, friendly and willing to share their knowledge with you. The food can be expensive so probably best to take a packed lunch for families. Great souvenirs and A great experience for people of all ages! You could spend a whole day there."

"Written October 31, 2018",Review of 'The Wider Earth' play and cafes!,"This review is intended for people searching for reviews of 'The Wider Earth', a play about Charles Darwin that is currently on at the NHM for a few months. Don't be put off by my 4* rating - the play itself, including the script, actors, set, effects, music, setting, seating and associated staff on their own would gain a 5* rating from me – however the signage and catering at the NHM was poor and I would give a 3* for that – so averaged out to 4*!Let me review the play first. I took my 13 and 11 year olds to see this at a half term matinee, as we often go to the theatre and this sounded right up our street. We love not only the natural world and the history of those who have explored it, but also being made to think. It clearly says on the information about the play that those aged 10 or under may enjoy the puppetry and effects but may not fully grasp the concepts - so I am rather surprised that another reviewer with much younger children has complained that they didn't understand it - the advice is there in the event information! For my secondary school aged children it was perfect. It is a play that is equally well aimed at adults and older children. There are many scenes which involve quite a lot of extensive and intellectual dialogue between, for example, Darwin and his Cambridge professor, his father, the captain, and so on. This would be well beneath the heads of very young children. However, young children would indeed like the music, clever puppetry and the images portrayed, as well as the clever revolving set, but do choose wisely so as not to inconvenience either your children or other audience members!We had top price seats in Row H but to be honest, having now been there, I think the next priced down tickets would have given an equally good view, and probably even those priced lower still. Plenty of leg room in our row, with good raking and sight lines, and comfortable seats. Theatre staff were very pleasant and efficient. Note that you get a stamp put on your hand when they’ve checked your tickets – sometimes these things are useful to know if you have a child on the autistic spectrum, for example, so you can advise them in advance.However, the things that weren't so great about the visit as a whole, which are absolutely not the fault of the theatre company, and some tips, are as follows.We hadn’t been to the NHM for several years and so don’t know the layout, so it was hard to work out how to get to the Darwin Centre area, which was what we needed for the play. Their maps are terrible and confusing! If you are coming in from the entrance by that wing, which is only open for evening performances, you’ll be fine, but if coming from the usual ones in the day it is at the other end of the building. There were no signs to it until we found ourselves by chance in the main central hall bit, and we found it was down the same corridor as the dinosaurs, that leads off this. Having located where we needed to be for the play, we went to try and get some lunch.This was not straightforward either! On arrival we had already tried ‘The Kitchen’ but this had an odd layout and it was unclear if you had to queue all the way, even in front of sections you might not need, as some of it has drinks, some cold food such as sandwiches and some is serving hot food. It was unclear if you could just dip in for the bits you needed.So we left that. Then we looked in at the T Rex Grill, and found that it was table service only and there was a queue to be seated. We were worried that if service was slow we might run late for the play, though we had left plenty of time, so we left the queue there too! That was a shame as we would have liked a table service lunch.We then found ourselves at the Central Café, behind the main hall. This was packed but we found a table that was just being vacated. We struggled a bit with the choice of baguettes and wraps there, as they were quite fussy ones. I enjoyed my green falafel wrap, but my children both chose the emmental and ham baguettes and found them really tasteless, with the ham horribly stringy. They left most of them and had to rely on their crisps! There are little lunch boxes available for small children but I’m not sure what was in them. Had we not been concerned about missing the play, I would have asked for a refund for the baguettes. I then had to spend more money buying some cakes to fill them up!We would have gone to the Darwin Centre Café, right by the play, but a member of staff who we’d asked for advice on where to lunch had said it was mostly cakes, so we didn’t try it. After the play we popped in there and found that it actually would have been the nicest café of the lot as it was less busy and had a good range of sandwiches and lunch items too.I can’t comment on the rest of the Museum or exhibits as we didn’t visit these on this occasion, but beware of going at half term as in the middle of the day when we were there it was really, really, really busy in all areas that we passed through with many very young children either very excited or very stressed! I’m not sure how anyone would actually be able to get to see anything!If anyone from the Museum reads this I’d really recommend that the signage to ‘The Wider Earth’ is improved, and also that the food quality, range of offer and queueing systems are improved.However, I would thoroughly recommend ‘The Wider Earth’ but if you can I would go in the evening when it is quieter and you can enter by the entrance near the theatre, and eat somewhere else beforehand!"
"Written October 29, 2018",Fabulous museum! Kids loved it!,Absolutely amazing museum! It is huge with lots and lots to see. We didn’t manage to see it all as it was a little too much for our youngest to walk. But we’ll come back next time. The whale is an absolute classic and amazing to see. The T-Rex was the highlight for our kids. We had a blast! 
"Written October 24, 2018",Packed but informative ,Brilliant for something free in London. Full of educational opportunities and set in a magnificent building not far from most other things in the capital. Well worth a look if you are in London.
"Written October 23, 2018",Free admission. Amazing,"Free admission. There will be staff standing along the entrance asking for donations. Choose wisely whether to donate or not. After all, it is free admission. Toilets and cafes available. Beautiful architectural. Easy to get to the museum by bus or underground train. "
"Written October 23, 2018",A surprising theatre treat - The Wider Earth,Went to this Museum on a recent visit and was thrilled to see that there was a theatre now built in the Jerwood Gallery with a show about Charles Darwin (looking very different to the statue in the museum) and his voyage on the Beagle. Done by an Australian puppet company it has the most gorgeous visual effects and amazing puppets. Great insight into how Darwin developed his theory of evolution. Sheer delight!
"Written October 23, 2018",Excellent and Family Friendly Museum,"Great museum that has something for everyone - stuff to touch and a playroom for children/toddlers, gorgeous gems, and a moving dinosaur.  Plus, an outdoor area that is refreshing in the concrete jungle of London."
"Written October 22, 2018",Amazing,"Great place to visit with the kids, been twice now and loved it both times. Incredible building with lots to see and do. Brilliant."
"Written October 19, 2018",Grand place,Although very busy we loved our time there. The cafe was reasonable with friendly staff. The exhibitions are truly historically impressive and important. Both my younger son and teenager found the place mesmerising. The entrance is free but donations are requested which we liked. 
"Written October 19, 2018",School Groups,The Natural History Museum was the last place I visited in London prior to leaving for Heathrow. It was a Friday so I didn’t think that they would be that busy but I forgot about the school groups. They were everyone and had no supervision. Also the museum was lacking staff to ask questions throughout the museum but had about ten people working the shop. I was limited on time so I visited two areas: the treasures and the dinosaurs. The treasure were very interesting and some of the most important  items in the museum. The dinosaurs was more geared towards children but they had some nice skeletons. Worth some time but the crowds are huge. Plus it is free. 
"Written October 18, 2018",Spectacular - many wonderful displays,"Both inside and outside, this is a spectacular building.  It is vast, and very popular.  So you might want to make some plans ahead of time.While it is free to get in there are some displays that have a charge,"
"Written October 14, 2018",Good museum,"Large museum; with great exhibitions, however very crowded, and the lunch menu was average. Probably better on weekdays than rainy weekend."
"Written October 10, 2018",Go and see the big whale fossil,The whale fossil hanging from the ceiling of the hall is huge.  experience the earthquake in Kobe supermarket - it was fun.  Free admission - excellent place for primary school kids.
"Written October 8, 2018",Great day,"Fantastic museum with endless models, exhibits and displays of notable natural history discoveries and knowledge.Loads of stuff to see and do, especially for kids. The cavernous mineral hall is exceptional, as is the section of trunk from the giant Sequoia tree.Plan to spend several hours looking round."
"Written October 8, 2018",Kids love it,"The Natural History Museum is a must on a visit to London and kids of all ages love it, though mostly for the dinosaurs and whales. It is easily accessible, has multiple cafes that are family friendly and reasonably priced. A great place to visit if it is raining and you are up for a wander. Entry is free although a donation is requested."
"Written October 8, 2018",So much fjn,For a first time visiter (in my 20s) I can honestly say that I enjoyed myself tremendously. We were there for roughly two and a half hours and looked through maybe half of the exhibits. There was a wide range that everyone enjoyed. 
"Written October 7, 2018",Yep,"What to say. Exactly what expected. Nice experience. Full of crowds in weekend, rainy day, visit; but still, perfectly enjoyable"
"Written October 2, 2018",GREAT EXHIBITION,Our family of four (2 teens) attended the museum and had a terrific time looking through the exhibits.
"Written October 2, 2018",Amazing ,"This place is huge! And divided into many interesting segments.Sure there are dinosaurs, fossils, and precious stones. But there is a lot more, including a simulated earthquake and a futuristic looking escalator ascending into a giant planet earth. Well worth a few hours for the whole family."
"Written September 30, 2018",Fun activity for a quick tour,"On a rainy day, we decided to do a museum and this was close to where we ate breakfast. Boyfriend loved the minerals and gems floor, whereas I loved all the animal exhibits. Very family friendly."
"Written September 28, 2018",It's not just for kids!,"Fascinating for all kids, young and old!  Just the stunning escalator is worth the visit and the building is beautiful."
"Written September 26, 2018",Nice to explore ,"It is huge, full of things to explore, you feel like you are in adventure of travelling in time to see different species and kinds Very good experience "
"Written September 25, 2018",Amazing displays and building,"This was our kids (5 & 7) favorite museum in Europe - especially the animals and the dinosaurs exhibits.  Kids loved the animatronic dino in the back of the dinosaur section.  Don't turn around early to skip this area.  We targeted 2 hours, but stayed more than 3 and probably could have gone longer if we wanted to test our kid endurance. The T-Rex Cafe in the building was very convenient, and had surprising good food and fun kids meals.  Especially if you have kids, I'd recommend eating there rather than trying to find somewhere else nearby to eat.  That way you can take a break to eat and continue exploring.  "
"Written September 23, 2018",Beautiful,Great day walking through this museum. Much like many other cities with a different presentation. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. I'm a very for this sort of stuff.
"Written September 11, 2018",Awesome.,The museum is incredible. We really liked the Dinosaur and the Mammal sections but the Human Body section was also really good. It's better to go there early since it gets really busy around noon and there are large amounts of people in the more popular exhibits such as the animatronic T-Rex.
"Written September 9, 2018",It's worth a visit,"We were highly recommended by our friends to visit this Museum when we were in the UK for a short trip. So we did and the big blue whale skeleton had caught our attention when we entered into the building. There's a lot to see and in fact a lot to learn. After the visited, we realized how little that we know about the nature creation. Highly recommend for everyone during your stay in London."
"Written September 8, 2018",Great for kids from 3 to 90,Lots to see and do here.  Good on wet days but it is always busy in school holidays.  Jump the queue by pre-booking one of the special exhibits. Try to choose what you want to see before you go.
"Written September 5, 2018","If in London , go here !","Amazing place , architecture outside and in is absolutely fantastic. Walking in the entrance you are immediately blown away , a very special and educational location. Couldn't believe it was free admission. You could spend the whole day here or just pick a few exhibits that you are interested in.Some bar and food vendors on the grounds outside , really nice place to chill for a while.Beautiful place , extremely helpful staff. Can't recommend highly enough , had to force my 10 year old out of there."
"Written September 3, 2018",Gorgeous building!,"Our family enjoys museums so it is a bonus that they’re free in London. Only issue is that it has limited hours (10am to 5:30pm). We were there on a Sunday in mid-June and went early, so the entrance line moved pretty fast. We went in the Exhibition Road entrance as I had read there are no lines there. This entrance is across from the V&A and we almost thought it was an employee entrance and we wouldn’t be let in. But nope, it is not crowded because nobody knows about it. This entrance leads you to the giant earth model and is near the volcanos and earthquakes. Since dinosaurs are the most popular and we knew that would get more crowded as the day progressed, we walked over to that first (which is across the museum). The main entrance (Cromwell Road) is closer to the dinosaurs but takes a lot longer to get in. After we did the dinosaurs, we walked up to the Cadogen Treasures Gallery (straight up the stairs, behind the Darwin statue) and got to see the “greatest hits” of the museum (e.g., dodo skeleton, moon rock, stuffed extinct auk, dinosaur tooth). There is also a Vault at the back of the green zone / back of the gemstones/minerals/rocks, which has some treasures (e.g., meteorite from Mars, Aurora Pyramid of Hope, Microscopic Cosmic Diamonds - oldest thing you will ever see). The museum has something like 70 million species and at times, it will feel like they’re all on display. At the end of the day, we walked through the Darwin Center just to peek at the specimens in the jars — very cool. Also loved the architecture of the building, just beautiful."
"Written September 2, 2018",Excellent collection ,"Suggested duration was 2-3 hours for this museum. I only planned to spend 2 hours here, however looking at such and extensive collection of natural history, I would love to spend more time and make a whole day trip out of this place. It’s so much to see and do. Many different areas such as dinosaurs, human biology, minerals and gemstones etc. Also a lot more that I couldn’t even see due to time constraints. Definitely would love to visit again. "
"Written September 2, 2018",Awesome ,"Loved visiting this museum.  Just not enough time to look at everything, could have done with setting 4hrs aside. Would defiantly recommend to anyone. "
"Written September 1, 2018",Stunning museum followed by the silent disco - what fun,"Met a friend who is a member of the museum and first we went to see the nocturnal animal exhibition, which was great.  The main entrance to the museum is fantastic, with the recent installation of the blue whale skeleton (but I do miss the dinosaur that is on holiday travelling).  We had a few lovely gin and tonics and then at 22.00 the 'silent disco' started in the main hall.  There were three colours to choose from that correlated with the x3 DJs on the steps.  You then listened and danced to the music you wanted to.  What fun that was.  While silent, it was so funny when you took your headset off as everyone was singing or talking.  Would recommend that - I believe it is the last Friday of certain months of the year - check their website."
"Written September 1, 2018",A must see in London!,"This museum is always a winner as it’s free and you can spend hours in here seeing everything it has to offer. I went with my partner but this is great for kids of all ages as there is something to do. I would definitely recommend going as well as to it’s sister museum ,which is also free, in Tring which features an extensive animal collection! "
"Written August 31, 2018",A great day out.,"We visited this museum as it was directly facing our hotel and the rooms weren’t ready and as entrance is free with a suggested donation, we walked over to kill a few hours. I was pleasantly surprised at how much there was to see. Some fantastic exhibitions especially around volcanoes and tsunamis and great interactive exhibits as well. Ensure you go out the back of the museum and enjoy a lunch by the courtyard pool. "
"Written August 29, 2018",Excellent Place of Interest ,"My favourite museum in London. Exterior of bldg is fascinating and museum is big with many areas of interest. Enjoyed the red zone on volcanos and earthquakes immensely. As the  Museum is popular with families, it is very crowded. Try to visit early when museum first opened and one can easily spent half a day here with so much to see."
"Written August 29, 2018",The best,"This museum is the museum i have ever been in, the mineral and rock collection is vast and beautiful. "
"Written August 29, 2018",Busy but brilliant first visit ,Super museum and well worth a visit. Our kids aged 8 & 6 loved it. Favourite for us was mammal section. 
"Written August 28, 2018",Don’t get me started on the architecture,I spent as much time in awe of the glorious architecture as I did the very clever dinosaur exhibit.  Walk with your eyes wide to take it all in...
"Written August 28, 2018",WOW,"From the minute you walk in, and you see the massive whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling, it takes your breath away. You feel like you are in some sort of Harry Potter building. The dinosaur display is incredible. To be 100% honest, every time we walked around a corner there was a display that made us feel like kids in a candy shop, followed by a ""wow, this is awesome"". I would definitely recommend a visit here. Its incredible.   "
"Written August 27, 2018",Fascinating!,"A really interesting museum which is big enough to keep you busy for hours! Great for individuals and families with children of all ages. Can be a little confusing to find your way around, but if you’re visiting London as a tourist then you shouldn’t miss this!"
"Written August 27, 2018","Go for the animals, stay for the architecture!","The museum collection is very nice, including robotic dinosaurs, so great place for kids of all ages.  But if you're an architecture fan, you must go here! Throughout the building are beautiful original stained glass windows, millwork and tiles.  I'd love to take a tour just for that! "
"Written August 26, 2018",Fantastic museum for the whole family,"Absolutely loved this museum, great interactive exhibits. My 7 year old son loved the dinosaur exhibit and the Kobe earthquake demonstration. This museum is spectacular, we spend about 3 hours here and had a good whirlwind tour. I think you could easily spend a lot more time here and the next time we’re in London we’ll be back. "
"Written August 25, 2018","Amazing place, a lot to see",You sure need more than one day to really explore everything that this museum has to offer. Huge with lots of interesting things for all ages
"Written August 25, 2018",What a building,Needed a little more time to explore but had a wonderful time. The building is amazing. A walk through the garden is a nice break from the crowds. 
"Written September 23, 2018",Must visit,Fantastic trip and a look back into the past. Really glad we decided to go here. Make a day of it. 3 museums all right next to each other. 
"Written September 22, 2018",Very interesting museum,"Very interesting. Recommended for families, teens, children, all ages. We especially liked the dinosaur skeletons and the mineral stones. You can spend 2 hours there and just see everything, or you can spend the whole day and read explanations, depends how much you are interested in nature, biology, geology, science, history etc."
"Written September 21, 2018",Perfect Family Free Option for London,"I was on my own and decided to do the museum. It was fascinating, free (but It’s good to make a donation). They have an extensive dinosaur exhibit and body exhibit. I didn’t get to rest but it looked great.  I would recommend for families. "
"Written September 21, 2018",Really interesting,"This museum is  HUGE and if you want to see it all, you have to dedicate a whole day. We spent about 4 hrs and we did not see all of the museum. I really liked to volcanoes and earthquakes section since it was so interactive. "
"Written September 20, 2018",A must see in London - combine with the Science museum (around the corner) for a great day out,"I grew up in the UK and drove past the Natural History Museum every day on my way to and from work... it wasn't until I moved to Asia and had kids that I came to appreciate it.I took my 7, 9 and 10-year-old kids back to London over the summer and did all the sights... without question, the Natual History Museum was by far the best, the staff were great, the displays engaging and my kids loved it. In that area, you also have London zoo (don't bother), the Science Museum (very good) and the V&A (also good)."
"Written September 19, 2018",Stunning ,"What an amazingly beautiful building. The exhibitions are tippy top quality. You should plan to stay for a few hours minimum, or a second day if you want to take it all in. There is a Restaurant/Cafe."
"Written September 17, 2018",Brilliant musuem so much to see,"we had a really lovely day out here, highly recommend comfy shoes as theres lots of walking. Felt the dinosaur exhibit was a bit of a let down as compared to the New York Natural History museum they are displayed better so you can get better pictures and you can view from a high vantage pint whereas in London everything was on ground level and a lot of the time the volume of people made it difficult to see everything. Found the volcano and earthquakes exhibit really interesting especially where you can go on an earthquake simulator. The animal exhibit again is amazing with lots to see and learn. And particularly liked the precious gem section as well. There's a nice cafe where we stopped for cake with plenty of assortment plus the gift shop had lots of things to buy as souvenirs although not much choice of postcards."
"Written September 12, 2018",Superb Day out . ,Last came many years ago with my children .enjoyed it very much just as I remembered it .Be aware that the t rex is being maintained atm & is unavailable till end of September. The earthquake / volcano exhibition was our fave Please remember to leave a donation. 
"Written September 12, 2018",Where do I start,Living in the DC area we have a great natural history museum.  This one comes close to the local museum (maybe I am being a bit prejudice)  Great visit especially if you are traveling with children.
"Written September 11, 2018",Beautiful Architecture ,"Another beautiful view of London we adore.most happiest place for kids,needed a month to explore this place.25 metre long skeleton of blue whale 🐋 is amazing.romanesque style architecture is mind blowing.worth visiting for the amazing permanent collection."
"Written August 6, 2018",A gold mine for exploring.,"Our family spent a full day (more than 6 hours) here. There is lot of interesting things to see, so we could probably do that again and visit the parts were we didn't go or rushed past.We visited the ticketed ""Life in the Dark"" exhibition which our kids enjoyed exploring. It was worth the tickets. (The big majority of the museum is free)Some parts of the the museum is more updated than others - but what a trove of stuff to explore. Available food, drinks and snacks were quite decent, better than I would expect at such a ""tourist magnet"". All of us quite happy in that regards. The shops in the museum is also worth a visit. We came fairly early and could not see the massive queues we had been warned about even at the height of the holiday season. Our visit was during the heat wave in London. It was hot. Cool down in front of the big floor fans!"
"Written August 6, 2018",Tons of great stuff to see,"Quite a lovely museum. Lots of stuff to see, stunning building. Very oriented towards children, but we had a fun time as well as adults. "
"Written August 6, 2018",Dino Snores - Excellent,"Booked Dino Snores for my two grandsons. They were so excited about having a night in a museum, particularly as this is their favourite one.  We were directed by the staff to the beautiful Hintze Hall where we selected a sleeping spot in the company of the great Charles Darwin statue and of course the Blue Whale skeleton. Then the fun began.It was a truly amazing event and the kids and adults were enthralled at the displays and talks given by experts in the fields of science, nature and animals.  I just loved the children's faces as they turned the corner in the torchlit gallery to be confronted by a life-sized roaring Tyrannosaurus Rex,  made me jump too.This is something the kids will remember all their lives and they learnt an awful lot as did we adults.  Won't say too much about the event as it can spoil the fun if you know too much, but just to say I felt it was worth every penny.On a practical note the sleeping mats are very thin so if you need more comfort take an extra mat and small pillow, as they suggest in the notes.  Fans were running all night so it was not too hot. Plenty of tap water and toilet facilities.  Your own food was taken in the eating area at a set time in the evening. Very light and simple breakfast was provided with plenty of coffee, tea and juice. You need comfy clothes that you can sleep in, a torch, a camera and plenty of refillable water bottles.The staff were friendly, welcoming, enthusiastic and inspiring and the whole event was very well organised from start to finish. Top marks from me."
"Written August 5, 2018",Another great London museum,"The natural history museum is fantastic. It has something for everyone to enjoy. You could spend hours here if not days and not see everything in one visit. We find it better to visit a few times, taking a few sections at a time to see, that way you fully appreciate all that is on display. Anyone interested in natural history will love the museum. Free entry apart from certain exhibits. Disabled access. Nice cafe. "
"Written August 5, 2018",Where history makes sense,Simply the best place to learn about our planets past. Thoroughly informative and highly educational
"Written August 3, 2018",Excellent ,Very nice museum with lots of nice things to see. I would say that this is as good as the one in Washington DC 
"Written August 2, 2018","Packed in like sardines, some useful info","Let me begin by stating that museums in the UK are mostly free for the public. And this is a great thing. But recently visited the Natural History museum after previously going a few years back and there have been some improvements and some disappointments. One main issue was air conditioning. Temperatures were very uncomfortable in some areas. Industrial fans just shifted the warm air around. Admittedly me and my partner went through the school holidays so it was bound to be busy. We expected this and was prepared. But what we were not prepared for, was the funneling of people (almost like cattle) through the dinosaur section. We couldn't read any of the information as there were so many people packed in like sardines that you couldn't stop! There were too many people crammed into the tiny corridor like pathway which is supposed to lead you around the dinosaur section. I couldn't wait to get out. It was a shame. What was interesting was finding out their dinosaur ""gift shop"" was almost if not bigger than the entire dinosaur section. I think we know what the museum is trying to do here. Disney springs to mind. The human biology section was good although not updated. it was a little more spaced out so we spent a bit longer in this section. Finally learning things! The animal section with the huge blue whale was again good but nothing updated. We decided to head outside for some air and have a quick look at their ""garden"". This area is to promote biodiversity. It was nice to grab some air but this area was far from a garden. It was overgrown, messy, full of weeds....nothing like the picture of what it was mean't to look like. The pond was nice though, lots of dragonflys, ladybirds and a few others. We then made our way to the red zone, by passing yet another gift shop and 2 cafes. We stopped for some food. The price was reasonable (About £12 each) for some hot food and a drink.The red zone.This was an area where the museum got it right. Plenty of information about human evolution, lots of exhibits. The earthquake zone again, lots of information plus the earthquake ""demonstration"" was great. We spent most of our time here as there was lots to take in. Overall, not the best experience. I'd have to say I've visited much better museums around the world and this is supposed to be London, one of the best cities in the world and this is all we have to offer? The British Museum wins this time. Areas to improve:Garden - Make it a garden. Not a wasteland.Air con - Needed in summer.Open up the dino section - Seriously thought this could be a fire hazard. Stop trying to sell things and just be a museum.Perhaps have a section for Live animals? Insects would be great as would fish. A living reef? Discuss climate issues? How these affect living reefs? 3/5"
"Written August 2, 2018","Beautiful Space, dated exhibits","The Natural History Museum building is simply amazing. And worth the visit. It took us two tries to get in—the first time we intended to go was a rainy Sunday and it was so mobbed that we didn’t wait to go in. We came back on a sunny Tuesday and we were at least able to get in without a very long wait. As mentioned, the architecture in the building is spectacular but the exhibits are showing their age. "
"Written July 31, 2018",Awe Inspiring,"There is not enough time in the day to see this place in one sitting. If you enjoy architecture, this place will have your jaw drop. My little loves dinosaurs and she was able to see so many things that we have not been able to find here in the states. There is something for everyone. With so many different floors and exhibits, it is fantastic for everyone. One of our favorite parts was the butterfly exhibit. The people who work/volunteer there will spend so much time with you helping you enjoy and learn more about the exhibits, and you will be able to see the entire life cycle of a butterfly up close.The cafe there is a bit pricey, so do not be surprised if you choose to have a meal there that it will be a little more on the expensive side in comparison to eating out in town. If you have an inquisitive child, or are an inquisitive child at heart, this is definitely a place to go."
"Written July 24, 2018",Amazing museum but avoid the T Rex Grill restaurant at all costs,"Hugely overpriced, poor quality food. Bad service, rude staff who expect a tip for rubbish work. Cold food which sat on the pass for 20 minutes and went rubbery. Absolute rip off. Take picnic or go to a local cafe or outlet near the station. Or even chew a guidebook ... it would be tastier for same price."
"Written August 13, 2018",GO,"if you love the world, GO !    and even if you don't !This place is unique, I used to sit and read in the beautiful ground of it, under the imposing arches, feeling other times. loving the bricks. totally recommended"
"Written August 12, 2018",Fascinating for Children,The many exhibits in the Natural History Museum are fascinating for children...especially the dinosaurs. Very educational and fun for all ages
"Written August 11, 2018",Needs a little more love ,"For such a large and well known museum we had high expectations.However, I think we should have lowered our expectations a few notches. Most the exhibits were ok, a lot are very dated.  Some of the taxidermy animals are even faded (and worn)The museum is categorised clearly and set out in a helpful way.  It’s easy to wander through and check out the exhibits.  However, it is packed, and we’re talking theme park during a public holiday packed (based on conversations and other reviews it’s always packed).  It’s hard to move and hard to see. And there is no airflow (ie: no aircon, limited fans). Lots of people we just sitting around in the Dinostore because it was cool in there.The toilets were passable but not real clean.  Some of the drink fountains didn’t work. And there’s not a lot of places to sit.That all being said, even though the exhibit was dated, our kids (7 & 5) loved the hands on stuff at the human body exhibit. So it was a surprise hit.It’s worth noting that entry is only a donation so if you leave and go outside and get some lunch or something you can always go back in.Top tips:- don’t go on a hot day or at a time you think it may be busy- take your own water - be prepared to cycle back round if a particular exhibit is crowded"
"Written August 11, 2018",Great day out !,Took the grandchildren and they really really enjoyed it ! Loads to see and staff very friendly and informative 
"Written August 9, 2018",Fantastic Museum but be prepared!,"This is a fantastic museum and one of the better natural history museums I've been too. If you have been to the one in Washington D.C. along the National Mall then you know what I am comparing this to, and I would say it is better. The building is amazing and has some fantastic architecture. The mammals and dinosaurs are must sees and for me, the human history section could be easily skipped as it was a little basic we felt. As far as the queues, we didn't realize this in the beginning but there are three entrances into the museum all of which had lines, but the one on exhibition road looked about a quarter as long as the one which we stood in and which was a direct exit from the tube via the underground walking tunnel and wrapped us in a very long long line along the building just inside the beautiful gate; see pictures. Lastly, we were just a couple on this trip, but this would have been tops for our boys who are 5 & 7, after we made it through the queue that is which we felt would have been very tough for them and us as a result. We joked at how many times we would have heard, I'm bored, I have to go to the bathroom, are we there yet; you know what I mean if you have kids.Lastly, as a general London trip information, bring a rain jacket, and H&M along Kensington High St. sells cheap collapsible umbrellas for £6 pounds. There is also a large pharmacy in the same general location and near the Kensington High St. Tube that sold larger yet more expensive umbrellas. Don't be the people standing in the rain in a tee shirt, shorts, and flip flops as we saw plenty of those drowned rats. Being from the Pacific Northwest, the rain wasn't an issue for us as we always travel with lightweight rain coats. Lastly, apparently in London 50% chance of rain in the for sat means raining cats and dogs where as at home it means off and on light showers. Enjoy your trip!*Pictures to follow shortly."
"Written August 9, 2018",Always great!,"Not been here for years! So much to see and do, one day does not really do it justice. Free entry, but I really encourage you to donate a little something as it's a worthy cause. However be aware that the temporary exhibit ""Life on the Dark"", whilst very good, is also quite pricey for what you get, in my opinion. Although if you offset that with the fact the rest of the Museum is free, then maybe it's not so bad."
"Written August 8, 2018",Amazing visit!,"Amazing visit, thoroughly enjoyed! Could have easily spent a week here and still not have seen everything. Only a couple issues; there may be toilets dotted around the building but there are still only a small number of toilets available, and some of the exhibits were unbelievably warm. Would definitely return and recommend."
"Written August 7, 2018",well documented and educative,The Natural History Museum is well equipped and tells us the history of nature in all its aspects. A good museum for children and for adults.
"Written August 7, 2018",Beautiful building,"Went with hubby, and 12 and 14 year old boys. First visit to London. Went first thing in the morning on a Saturday and the line was minimal to get in, no more than 10 min. Headed straight for the dinosaurs, which was a good idea because it was packed with people shortly after. Really enjoyed all the displays-my favorite was the earthquake. We were jet lagged, so didn’t see everything. But had a nice time. I loved the architecture of the building as well. The cafe was good for a little snack and soda to keep us going. "
"Written August 7, 2018",Always a joy.,I have gone to this museum since I was a kid. I wanted to see the whale that has replaced Dippy. This museum is a gem. You could go a million times and never tire of it or see everything. The exhibits are amazing and the staff helpful and knowledgeable.
"Written July 12, 2018",“A cathedral to nature”,"The building itself is so extraordinarily beautiful that it is worth a visit even if you have no interest in animals or plants. I was last here at least 10 years ago and was interested to see what had changed. I have to admit that Dippy the Diplodocus made a more dramatic impact in the entrance hall than the whale that has replaced him. The exhibits in the alcoves around it were all new and interesting. My daughter and I visited the marine biology section where I noticed some exhibits had been “temporarily removed” in 2014! It seems a shame to leave gaps for that long when the museum has so many exhibits in storage that are never displayed. The mammals section, to be honest, needed a good dusting and was quite dated looking. I hope visitors are paying the £5 requested donation (as we did) and that the slight air of neglect I observed is not for lack of funds. "
"Written July 11, 2018",Just Amazing!,"Visited with 2 children age 9 & 7- travelled from Ireland for a few days to London.....This was by far the highlight of our trip. First day we went, was on a Tuesday in the first week in June @ 1pm - no queues. Second day we went was the next Saturday (yes we went twice because we loved it so much) @ 10am - big queues but seemingly queues get even bigger during school summer holidays. Building itself is beautiful & worth seeing inside. Range of skeletal animals, bug species and nature artefacts are huge. The Dinosaur section is class-don’t miss that.   Plant section is v interesting and laid out so well- children were never board. Talks for children take place in different areas at different times- we didn’t attend any due to time constraints but sound v good. Don’t miss the blue whale! Give yourself a full day to go and explore - it takes a while to see everything. Lots of toilets on-site and a lovely restaurant . Go early in morn and mid-week to avoid queues. I will be visiting again soon - such a nice day out! "
"Written July 10, 2018",One of the best museums in the world,You could spend days in here and a visit is absolutely essential if you are in London. The building is beautiful and the collection and general level of information on exhibits is second to none.
"Written July 9, 2018",Great Museum,"Really nice museum, loved the dinosaurs!  Free entry, donations optional.  Easy to get around and well worth a visit"
"Written July 9, 2018",Great exhibits - very interesting,"My husband and I spent a few hours here and really enjoyed all of the dinosaur and wildlife exhibits.  There is also a large, fantastic gift shop full of nature-themed gifts.  A great place to spend an afternoon."

"Written June 30, 2018",Worth the visit,"If you are considering wether to visit it or not, if you are an art lover I think you MUST visit it because the have some of the most important art pieces in the world It’s for free just take the guide with money and enjoy the information of the art There is one section the art for money but was worth it although I wasn’t allowed to take pictures but I did haha"
"Written July 24, 2018",Interesting museum!,"The museum itself is huge, and got a little bit tiring in this heat, but overall it was fun! The crowds were also a bit too much, but we went in the afternoon so the queue was not bad. I would definitely recommend for groups!"
"Written July 23, 2018",Fantastic place to while away several hours or even days.....,"It began by visiting the temporary Butterfly House, adjacent to the main building.  After a brief spell in there, where we were both very impressed by the knowledgeable staff and their passion for the Lepidoptera, we moved into the Museum itself.No matter how many times you visit, the first glimpse in the main hall is just spine tingling.We spent over 4 hours walking around, enjoying the exhibits, of special mention would be the Dinosaurs, not just a collection of dead bones,  ut faithfully recreated animatronic interpretations of a few of them, made the kids gasp in awe.A quick Coffee and we were about to leave when I gentleman came in and over the din of the people enjoying Coffee, Soda etc, he announced there was to be a brief lecture in theatre.The subject was “Lepidoptera of Madagascar”, presented by a Mr Lee.  Now I have been interested in Lepidoptera for at least 50 years, so this appealed and we headed out to locate the said theatre.It was the Attenborough Theatre and the lecture was part of an ongoing “Nature Live”, series of talks.  It’s a very intimate setting with fewer than 75 seats.  Mr Lee, did a great job, holding the attention of small children and people like myself enthralled.It only lasted 30 minutes or so but afterwards I took the time to speak to and to thank Mr Lee, saying that if only one person in that audience had learned a new appreciation of Moths and Butterflies, it would be fantastic.There is no cost to enter the Museum, it is free..  However, if like me, you enjoyed the visit, please leave a donation, no matter how small, to keep this wonderful place open for our Children’s, Children’s Children........"
"Written July 22, 2018",Excellent ,"We visited this amazing museum with our little daughters, 1 is 5 and the other is 3, both loved it. It’s an excellent place to make little ones interested in natural history. It is a must for everyone visiting London. We will definitely come back again soon! "
"Written July 21, 2018",Easy to spend hours here,"I really enjoyed my visit to this museum. I love how it has both classic and modern parts to it. You can see impressive skeletons and traditional museum display cases but you can also go to their more modern exhibits about earthquakes, rocks, volcanos etc. It was educational in an entertaining way. I was amazed by some of the things they had - diamond star dust from the start of the universe was one that really stuck out. I recommend visiting the Treasures exhibit in the Cadogan gallery and The Vault, and make sure you see the grand entrance hall and the dinosaur exhibit of course. It is free to enter, which I think is great, but they ask for a £10 donation. "
"Written July 21, 2018",I love this place,"For my boys on their first trip to London this was non negotiable.  I loved it too.  We got dropped by the cab right outside and got there about 20 minutes before it opened so not much of a queue.  We went in the enterance and was immediately greeted by a stegosaurus (that set the boys up nicely!) and an escalator through the earths crust.  Seriously that escalator goes on forever!!! So much to see and do that we could have spent all day there but we were there for the dinosaurs. Get to the dinos early!We went early but not knowing a direct route and getting seduced by that escalator, we arrived at the dinosaurs with loads of others, which did make some of it a procession, just be prepared. However, you can not escape the lure of the big beasts. My boys loved it, as did we all. We even saw Andy’s clock!!!!! 😄 Definitely go and go with a plan of what you want to see. Go early. We ate there and coming out for an early lunch to a sea of people was a surprise!  Enjoy!"
"Written July 20, 2018",Beautiful Building and Well-Done Exhibits,"Even if you only have time to see a few things, this is a free museum and it's worth it to enter just to see the spectacular entry hall with its skeletons and statue of Darwin.  We visited the dinosaur hall.  It was quite crowded and hot, but the exhibit was well laid out and the information was presented nicely."
"Written July 19, 2018",A  great  visit,"This  museum  is  a  really  great  place  to  visit  and spend  time at. It  has  four  sections for  example one  on dinosaures , one  on  minerals , stone and  crystals , even a a big Charles Darwin section , and  an  impressing huge structure  which  they  call the  Cocoon which is  concerned  with research about  the DNA of  plants  and  animals! really  a  great  place  to visit"
"Written July 18, 2018",My tryst with history ,"I think for any tourist and even londoners, this is a sure shot must visit museum, i was completely bowled over by what all the museum had to offer. Some pictures attached with this review for you folks to enjoy. The big one is a blue whale if you believe it. "
"Written July 18, 2018",See Dinosaurs & Blue Whale Skeleton,I spent half day at Oxford and I arrived this museum at 15:50.  Due to heavy rain and I waited on queue for an hour.  I have only 50 min. to explore museum.  I visited Blue Zone-dinosaurs to mammals; and Green Zone-Jewelry & Minerals.  Until 17:50 I saw nobody leaves but it 's time for me to leave.  I'd take London by night bus.
"Written July 16, 2018","Dinosaurs, skeletons, fossils","With children is a very good museum. You can see interesting fossils from the sea, dinosaurs, skeletons, prepared birds mammals etc. Good atmosphere, not so big museum, walkable yards, you have to pick up a free map at the entrance, and buy a guidebook! People are distributed inside, no overcrowded."
"Written July 16, 2018",Superb - time well spent,This museum flows beautifully and is very interesting . Over several levels with a timeline that starts in the ice age concluding in the current times.
"Written July 15, 2018",A must do in London,"With sections very well organized, this is one of the most interesting museums in London, for kids and adults alike. Kind of a natural history plus science museum. "
"Written July 15, 2018",Simply astounding ,"I have visited the museum of natural history around 7 times and I make it a must to visit it again every time I'm in London to catch up on recent discoveries and displays. My all time favourite section is the dinosaurs and this museum is constantly up to date with its newsletters, website, etc. It caters for families with young children as well as the disabled and most displays and guides have different languages to avoid there being a language barrier. I have not had not one problem during my visits. Of course seasons effect how busy and packed it gets but it is still definitely worth the visit. "
"Written July 15, 2018",Fun family day,"We were on vacation and knew we wanted to visit NHM because of the dinosaurs and butterfly exhibit.It was a hit! Our 3 year old twin girls loved the butterflies and Dinosaurs! The T-Rex was incredible, haven’t seen anything like that before.Other areas that were a hit with the kids was the escalator that goes up into what looks like earth and the earthquake shake.I think NHM will have something for everyone. We didn’t see everything just the areas of interest for our family.The building is beautiful. It’s definitely worth a visit for all ages and it’s free :)))))"
"Written July 15, 2018",Nice museum,"Lots of dinosaur, animal exhibits. Moving dinosaur models are pretty cool. Exhibits on humans, memory, vision etc are pretty cool as well. Beautiful exterior.close to Science museum and V&A museum.Free entry but can donate to museum if you wish"
"Written July 14, 2018",Lots of fun ,Great fun and wide variety of exhibits to suit all ages and interests. One of the many museums which offer a free entry. Great gift shop available. 
"Written July 13, 2018",Dinosnores,"What appeared to be a fun ‘big kid’ experience turned out to be a rushed, school trip throw back of an evening. The museum is fantastic and the building itself is striking, however the management of the dinosnores event was poor. The food is expensive and poor in quality which was a shame and the itinerary is a bit lacking in the execution. Pop up stalls that focus on ticking the box rather than offering something of value. The real challenge is security, literally. It’s obvious that they don’t like the event and it’s an inconvenience to have people around after hours, I over heard a number of conversations as I moved around where security guards were complaining and saying the guests were ‘taking the piss’ and they were generally rude. I’m not usually thin skinned so it wouldn’t have bothered me but the movie marathon they run all night if you can’t sleep was pointless as security goaded you back from anywhere other than the main hall where guests are expected to sleep, again a real shame. Could have been great but I wouldn’t recommend this in view of what’s on offer elsewhere in London."
"Written July 13, 2018",Very informative,"Free entrance,you can contribute if you like for maintenance .Beautiful building, very informative for all age group"
"Written July 12, 2018",Excellent free museum to view with kids,We had to see this museum after watching Paddington Bear. It is just as cool as the movie showed with room after grand room of amazing stuffed animals. The architecture is amazing and best of all it is free. What is not to love?

Full of amazing artefacts, dinosaurs, birds etc.No doubt we will be back when the boy is slightly older.Considering how busy it was it wasn’t chaotic.Very pleasant stroll around."
"Written August 25, 2018",You can spend hours here,Many remarkable painting from many classic artists and its free to enter. You can spend hours in here so be prepared to get exhausted. 
"Written August 25, 2018",Fabulous British treasure,"Absolutely fabulous free indoor activity in London. They ask for a small donation on entry (not compulsory) and it’s well worth giving. Stunningly beautiful building and a fabulous display of so many interesting exhibits. Interaction for little ones to keep them interested too. Staff very helpful and friendly, and although we visited at a busy time, we could still see what we wanted too. Only negatives were it’s difficult to find the public toilets and there are not enough. Also not enough healthy snacks for sale in the restaurant/cafe. Definitely worth a visit, whatever your age. "
"Written August 24, 2018",One of London’s top attractions ,"It has a very large collection covering everything from geological samples to human reproduction. It’s most famous for the dinosaurs and the full size blue whale.Visitors will probably spend a full day there. It has some nice cafes for lunch and has a “picnic area” for visitors who bring a packed lunch.Because it’s a great attraction, it does get very busy.It’s free to enter but the suggested donation is £5 and some exhibitions cost extra."
"Written August 23, 2018",Too busy,This is a great museum and whilst we got there early it was too busy. The dinosaur section in particular was manic and it was difficult to spend time reading any of the information. To be fair it’s free and this is similar to many others. If position the only advice I could give is to avoid peak times but do go 
"Written August 23, 2018",A must for families with children,We had a great time in the museum . The children enjoyed many interesting displays especially the dinosaurs. We had limited time so a full day is recommend . The resturant was very nice with children menue and good vegetarian options.
"Written August 22, 2018",Amazing and free!,We got lucky and didn’t have to queue. 12 noon Tuesday. Just fascinating and it’s all free! Our 6 year old loved the earthquakes and dinosaur sections. Was busy but not unbearably so and very well organised. 
"Written August 20, 2018",Fantastic,You could spend all day in here! Great for kids of all ages. The human body section is now looking very dated compared to the rest but still worth a visit. 
"Written August 18, 2018",Educational and fascinating and for free.,"The building is really exceptional, its what I imagine Hogwarts to look like, and the displays are really exceptional."
"Written August 16, 2018",For everyone,"A nice museum with a lot of information and exhibits. Really nice to walk through looking a bit here or there, but also a place where you can spend a lot of time and learn new things. And they have a mechanical T-rex... Who doesn't love a mechanical T-rex!? "

"Written June 28, 2018",The minerals and gems area is worth the visit ,My daughter and I really enjoyed this museum even more than the British museum. Really interesting exhibits and the minerals and gems section was awesome. We could have stayed there longer. Great for kids and adults. 
"Written June 28, 2018",Great way to spend time in London and it is free!,One can spend a full day here easily or just few hours and select those parts of museum that interest you. Went mainly to see the dinosaur fossils but ended up browsing around for three hours. The museum is also free to enter and there is donation possibility if you want to pay for your visit. Definitely worth seeing in London 
"Written June 28, 2018",Fun Museum to Visit,"I definitely recommend this for families with small children because it is quite the layout of dinosaur bones and interesting animal life. Though, visiting it with my grandmother, we found it a pleasant stop but not an ""must-see"" though the architecture of the museum is quite stunning. "
"Written June 28, 2018",Excellence as expected!,"Have visited this museum more than once in the past, but remains a favourite.

"Written June 16, 2018",National Treasure ,"Recommend arriving early, we were there at 10.15am on a Friday and crowds were few, by time we left at 1pm the museum was very busy. Highlight was the Wildlife photographer of the Year exhibition. We paid £15 each and was worth every penny with each photo telling a story. My husband and I have been a few times throughout the years but this magical museum never fails to impress from the smallest of animals such as the creepy crawly exhibition to the main entrance hall to see the blue whale. "
"Written June 15, 2018",Best museum I’ve seen,"I thoroughly enjoyed myself in the NHM. It is very entertaining and it teaches a lot of different things on animals. I enjoyed the part « human biology » that was very interesting and entertaining at the same time. For me, it was the best museum of those I have visited, and it is absolutely fantastic for children and teens! (And also for adults of course). You have to go there ;) "
"Written June 14, 2018",Must visit,Its a wonderful experience for free. The exhibits are good and easy to follow.Should keep about minimum 4 hours aside to see it.
"Written June 12, 2018",Excellent collection of dinosaur fossils! Great for kids!,We spent about 2 hours here and did not get to see everything. 3-4 hours would be a good time frame. Very similar to other Natural History museums we have visited. The treasure room was amazing and was the highlight for us. I would say this is best for children age 5 and up.

"Written April 3, 2018",Snap shot of history,Close to Harrod's this museum is an interesting perspective on what used to be the British Empire. The various sections of the museum house different time periods as well as different themes. We did not get enough time in this wonderful building but it would probably take more than a day to do it justice. The building is magnificent and the staff helpful. There is a great gift shop  inside so take your time and enjoy it.

"Written April 2, 2018",Brilliant visit,The natural history museum never disappoints. It’s free to visit with the option of giving a contribution. We visited after lunch during the Easter holidays and we were only queuing for around 10 minutes. It has loads to see and do and our daughters aged 7 and 3 absolutely loved it. It clean and well laid out. We particularly enjoyed the dinosaur section.  
"Written April 1, 2018",A great day out with family and friends, Visited NHM on 1st April and i was absolutely pleased from start to end. Once we got to the museum we had to wait in a queue which was long but was moving at a steady pace. Took us around 20mins to get in but was definitely worth the wait. Staff were great and attentive. Knew all the answers to questions we were throwing at them and did there absolute best to help us. The museum itself is an awesome experience for any one who is any age. Tonnes of knowledge to indulge in and a lot to see.We spent 2 hours here and still didnt finish some parts of the museum. Definitely will return to complete the tour.

"Written March 28, 2018","Popular, free entry","Visited on a weekend where there is a controlled queue entering into the museum due to large crowds.

Will recommend to all types of travellers including families. "

"Written March 27, 2018",Amazing museum !,A must go to in London ! Despite the crowd we were able to see at our pace what we liked most ! An app is available to plan your visit before if needed !
"Written March 27, 2018","Honestly, it use to be so much better.....","I will say that a majority of reviews on here are visitors to London or foreign tourists?? (total assumption). The reason I say this is that I have seen this Museum turn from one of the worlds best into something resembling an after thought. My first visit was over 30 years ago and numerous times up until recently and today what I saw was nothing like what it once was, the obvious attraction here is the Dinosaurs, sadly the exhibition here you are cattle pen trough the area and it is just absurd (Why such a small area to view from??), there use to be copious amounts of display cases from the moment you walked through the door into the main hall but they seem to have been replaced with tall boards with TV's mounted in this ""new style"" area off from the main hall on the left and since the crowds in this tiny narrow arrangement are constantly moving you just end up being pushed through and before you know it you have not seen much and you are at the exit, you can forget taking decent photos as the area is just so over crowded.The other thing to note is the queue to get in which I see others have mentioned, I remember just being able to walk up the big main stairs into the museum and away you go, whilst I see the need for security do they really need to let small children stand for ages outside to gain entry via a almost airport style security cordon?. All in I was really disappointed in the museum to what it use to be, I have even in the past had my own Meteorites authenticated here by simply walking in and asking to speak with a specialist which they where always happy to do, I very much doubt would be entertained these days??.The building is obviously beautiful and if you have small children under 10 they may find something here worth a look but honestly I will not be back.. I know this seems to go totally against what most of the reviews say but when you look at something like the British museum and the shear volume of artifacts and areas to view which are substantial I have to ask just what has happened to the exhibits in the Natural history museum?, why is the cattle pen area needed to view what is is obviously a main crowd pull?...The only saving grace was it is still free with the strong point of sale being a £5 donation, had I of put in £20 as would be the cost at most museums I would not have been happy..Only advice I could give is try to avoid peak times and school holidays, have a plan in place if you have little ones as the wait to get to the security area can be very long.."
"Written May 22, 2018",Lots to see,There is much to see. Went there with friends and wr had a great time. You can walk through how life began all the way through now. 
"Written May 21, 2018",Really crowded,It was very hot and crowded so plan when you go accordingly. We had a hard time seeing much of the exhibits but the dinosaur one is really great.
"Written May 21, 2018",Nice place,Natural history museums aren't my favorite type of museums by this one was very nice. Its size isnt as overwhelming as some of the museums in the area. Lots of kids. Bring patience
"Written May 11, 2018","Gorgeous building, so-so exhibits","We planned a mid-week visit, but were unaware that the day was a bank holiday, so it was really crowded. If you go, you must be very tolerant of parents of young children. The dinosaur exhibit appears to have undergone a fairly recent re-do, but traffic control is not ideal in the area, and most of the information placards still refer to dinosaurs as reptiles. It is also a challenge to match up the exhibit with its identifying information.Most surprising and disappointing was the condition of a great deal of the mammal exhibits. These are housed in an area where there is a great deal of natural light. The specimens are very, very faded and look quite shabby. An explanatory plaque states that the museum does not want to replace the specimens, because of the endangered status of many of the animals. While commendable, it would make for a better exhibit if they attempted some sort of restoration with the specimens they have on display. The coloration on the giant panda and the cheetah are barely discernible. The building itself is gorgeous, and worth a look around even if you decide to skip the exhibits, but if you are accustomed to the natural history museums in New York, Washington DC, and Chicago, this one might be a bit of a letdown."
"Written May 11, 2018",Go early and avoid weekends!,One of the best museums that I have been to in a long time. The photography exhibit is a small charge but the entry to the museum is free. The butterfly exhibit is going on until summer of 2018 too.
"Written May 9, 2018",Best collection of bones in the world!,"I'm pretty sure that my dog has dreams that are very similar to the contents of this museum :DIt is absolutely amazing to see all these species, all so different in one place. it's kind of humbling really. Brilliant place for Kids and Grown ups!"
"Written May 8, 2018",A Huge Museum With Items Collected From All Over The World,This museum is much larger then the ones that I have seen in the US. They have huge sections each with it's own exhibits. My favorite exhibit was the mineral exhibit. The room was larger then some museums. I also paid extra to visit the Wildlife Photography exhibit. It was outstanding. If you like photography then you will love this exhibit. Overall this museum has a lot to see and it will take you the better part of a day to see it all. This place is worth a visit. Young and old will be amazed.
"Written May 8, 2018","Way too busy, and the dust!","Sure, it is sort of blasphemous to give the NHM such a low rating. It is such a marvelous building, awe inspiring. But let’s be fair: many of the displays are outdated, the interactive ones didn’t work half the time. You walk around cramped corridors. And look at the amount of dust on the displays! Especially the blue zone (have a look from above at the whale)...!there is a interesting simulated disaster zone at the Earth gallery, but with so many people cramped in the restaurant at ground floor level, and all the litter lying around just there, they created a non-simulated disaster zone right there."
"Written May 3, 2018",Margboyle,I was there last wk it was a fantastic place to visit so much to see and would recommend this to everyone 
"Written May 1, 2018",Beautiful but crowded,"I made the mistake of going a rainy Saturday and it was quite packed! The museum itself is beautiful, I really liked the idea of touching most things and interactive features! But make sure you go on a weekday if you don’t like kids running everywhere"
"Written March 20, 2018",Awesome,This place is great. We spent a morning here on a chilly Sunday and loved it. The dinosaurs are amaxing and little kids would love it. The architecture is inspiring and the vibe positive.
"Written March 19, 2018",Whales: Beneath the Surface,Went for the evening with friends and it was really nice. Mostly adults and you could have a drink of beer/wine to take with you. After the exhibition you had access to all of the Museum which was so much better than queuing to get in on a weekend or a busy bank holiday. I wish I had gone in the evening before. I will definitely go again and recommend to everyone.
"Written March 17, 2018",Day trip,Well worth a visit really enjoyed this museum. This museum is ideal to visit with kids a lot of exhibits which they qould like
"Written March 13, 2018",Amazing,"fantastic, could spend hours here and we did! caters for all ages, very busy saturday afternoon. no admission fee, close to south kensington tube"
"Written March 6, 2018",Love it!!!,"My second visit to the museum and for the second time I was more than happy with it! The exhibitions are stunning. I went there to see the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition and unfortunately the tickets were sold out, so we had to buy a family membership. After all it summed up to be a good decision and for sure we gonna come back again... this time with kids!"
"Written March 5, 2018",London weekend,When we first arrived we went to main entrance big queues but were advised by staff to go side entrance for lesser queues he was right hardly had to wait inside you are searched we were on last day of holiday so had suitcases with us big mistake they weigh your bags and our bags worked out a fiver each at the cloakroom we weren’t allowed to take through even though bags checked .Museum itself is huge lots of displays could easy spend half day full day hear number of exhibitions going in also although they were full Very  pretty minerals in the vault and a massive one on the top floor .Lots of information around and there is a floor for schools and restaurants if your hungry.Shop with souvenirs for sale .Inside if the buildings reminds me of Harry Potter.Toilets and lifts available.
"Written March 4, 2018",Great way to spend some time,This is an iconic venue with extremely impressive exhibits. It's also free although a £5 donation is requested. Would be a bit churlish not to help.Fantastic place... highly recommended 
"Written March 4, 2018",Never on a Saturday!,Standing in a mile long line on a rainy Saturday morning finally led to admittance to this wonder of a museum.  Thousands of people packed the exhibit halls.  Many children used their time chasing and yelling.  Choose a time to visit this grand old dame on a week-day.
"Written March 2, 2018",Great collection,"but awfully crowded. Maybe one should visited shortly before closing and decide on just one exhebition. Especially the dinosaurs are very popular. At the moment they're changing or refurbishing some parts. The main entrance is closed.The Tube Station 'South Kensington' is nearby and around the corner you can find the V & A, as well. "
"Written February 27, 2018",THE BEST MUSEUM IN LONDON!!,"We come here every time we go to London. The building is gorgeous, it is free, and it has such an incredible collection! Some items are getting a little faded as there are some very old pieces but there are plenty of modern displays and we like that the museum combines old and new. Don't miss the very popular dinosaur exhibit with an animated T rex (which can be a bit too scary for very young kids). Easy to reach via the 74 bus or South Kensington tube. Super gift shop!"
"Written June 9, 2018",To visit,"The location is amazing and what's inside even more. Good also the interactive wings to entertain our daughter. At no cost, free offer, what to expect more."
"Written June 1, 2018",Must-Go when travelling with kids,"Houses an amazing collection of skeletons, animal specimens, information on dinosaur and other animals. My daughter simply loved it...especially the human biology segment. Every exhibit is explained and sometime in very interactive way. It is in South Kensington and entry is free. "
"Written May 26, 2018",Rich exhibition ,My 14 year old boy ran from room to room and was amazed of the varied exhibitions and beautiful building. 
"Written May 26, 2018","Come for the natural history, stay for the building.",This place is such a treasure trove of information and cool little finds. It's amazing to walk around in such a stunning building and look at all the animals. But it's easy to find yourself imagining all those adventurers that went out around the world collecting all the strange and wonderful things for the crown & science. 
"Written May 26, 2018",Butterflies,Absolutely loved the butterfly garden. My husband gave me a hard time at first for buying tickets to the exhibit but it was one of the coolest things we have ever done!
"Written May 26, 2018",The building is gorgeous! The exhibits amazing!,"What's a gorgeous place !  You can spend a long time just walking around the building looking at the details of this gorgeous place.The exhibits are a amazing. Love the one of the dinasours and the one of the minerals.You need few hours to be able to see the whole museum. We were there 2 hours and did not see it all!The courtyard of this museum is so gorgeous ! The lighting perfect.The museum store, love it! Great things to buy!"
"Written May 26, 2018",Interesting Place for Children,"My wife, two-and-a-half year old son and I visited the Natural History Museum on a Thursday afternoon. It was busy but not over-crowded. My son loved the numerous exhibits/skeletons, some pre-historic, including those of fish, birds and mammals. I guess, when he visits in future, he would be able to benefit from the written information and interactive displays pertaining to the exhibits.   If anything, dinosaurs appear to be over-valued and over-presented, even in the museum shop. Otherwise, the shop has plenty to offer for children ranging from stuffed toys to sophisticated scientific models. The paid “Butterfly exhibition” in the outside lawn was not worth the heavy cost. The visit was not fabulous but evokes pleasant memories."
"Written May 25, 2018",Fun place for children,This is the best museum for the children to enjoy. A pleasant connection to the many areas of its collection are most enjoyable and an attractive way to spend time on a rainy day or educational pursuits. 
"Written May 24, 2018","Been a while,but still absorbing","Long time since been to this venueLoads of up-dated exhibits and activities Our fault,there were lots of school groups,although these did only cause minor irritations Great venue to spend a significant quantity of time in,regardless of the weather"
"Written May 23, 2018",Wonderful and exciting!,"I’ve been here so many times as a child and it really does get better with age. The artefacts are so varied and old, from parts of the planet mars to precious gems to some of the worlds most complete skeleton structures discovered of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals. You have to visit here for sure! There’s bones that are like 40000 years old!The only downside is the way they make you enter and “force” you to donate. I felt very pressurised to give a suggested donation of £5. I understand that they need funding but why have a free museum but you can’t enter until you donate? (There are ropes and desks set up you can’t get past and the staff are very happy to suggest the entry fee). You can just walk past but there’s a security guard and an kiosk merchant stood right in the way."
"Written February 23, 2018",Some great exhibts for kids but a few tired ones too,Visited with 2 young kids.  The place is fantastically vast and worth it for the architecture alone.  There are some great exhibits dinosaurs and the mamals with good combination of exhibits and details.The age/funding of the museum is also showing in other areas such as the marine section which looked very tired.
"Written February 23, 2018",Flying,Just a flying visit to take a look at the blue whale skeleton that has replaced the dinosaur skeletonExcellent as usual 
"Written February 23, 2018",Amazing gem,Very interesting and exciting for children and adults alike.  The blue whale is impressive but I would love to see Dippy the dinosaur back home 
"Written February 22, 2018",Amazing ,"Really it is a nice historic place ... the entry is free , you just queue for security checkpoints . The museum is full of fossils and lots of information you can share with your little ones. The kids love being there . After enjoying the museum there is a room down stairs where kids can stay to eat and play and there is toilets as well . Before leaving check the shop for some unique stuff that kids will love it . "
"Written February 20, 2018",Stunning Collection & Architecture ,"I only had a few hours to myself last week in London so I decided to spend them here. It turned out to be an extremely enjoyable and memorable decision. Visitors shouldn’t be intimidated by lines to get in. Hint: The line on the side street moved very quickly. While in line, take note of the shrapnel marks from the WWII German bombing raids near the side entrance. The line entering at the front of the museum moved slower I was told. There’s no cost for admission but a donation is properly encouraged. I gladly obliged. The varied, fascinating collections and exhibits blew me away. Seeing things in-person that I’d only read about and studied in school was a special experience. The architecture was just as stunning as the items on display. If you have even a marginal interest in natural history and/or science this museum is for you. Since I visited by myself, I was able to make it through the major areas in 3 hours. It was my 3rd visit to London but this was my first visit to the Natural History Museum. I now realize what I  missed on those previous visits. For visitors seeking an important, indoor, unforgettable, uniquely London experience (that’s Free!), I highly suggest you invest the time and effort into visiting and exploring this magnificent, extremely significant edifice."
"Written February 18, 2018",Great choice!,"Recommended to families and kids! I spent a couple of hours in it and ti was amazing! The whale skeleton al the entrance is super, and so it is the whole museum. "
"Written February 15, 2018",Inspiring museum!,One of my top moments visiting London. A journey through time and science. The Darwin Centre and the Cocoon are breathtaking!  
"Written February 14, 2018","Fascinating place, if you’re ok with crowds","The museum is understandably a real crowd puller. The dinosaur exhibits are a predictable hit, especially with the animatronic T. rex which is impressive. The pay for Exhibit on venom was worth a look if you’re interested in that sort of thing and we also liked the experience an earthquake exhibit. There’s obviously so much more besides. And of course it’s free to visit, though donations are, as with other museums, encouraged.You have to be ready for crowds though. We went school half term which obviously wasn’t great; but term time isn’t much better with school trips and tourists."
"Written February 14, 2018",You won’t be bored!,"Oh boy! They have everything here,every person in your party will find something of interest from toddlers to the not so toddlers. How they have so much to show in one place is beyond me,spacious,well laid out. Be aware that exhibitions can carry a charge and the museum can get very crowded,I have had to queue on a few occasions,it’s well worth the wait though. Nice place for a bite to eat or a cuppa inside too. Of course they have the Butterfly exhibit in the summer,and the ice skating rink in the winter,truly something for everyone,especially on a rainy day."
"Written February 14, 2018",Nothing to see here,"The building is lovely, queued for over half an hour in the rain to get in. Yes it was half term and yes it was total chaos, but despite the crowds, there really isn't much to see here. The mammals section - all the the stuff hanging from the ceiling is caked in thick dust - revolting! Most of the dinosaur bones are in fact plaster casts....The best thing was the escalator - which is a bit sad isn't it? Kids didn't like it either and were bored.Can't understand what all the fuss is about!"
"Written April 13, 2018",Dinosaurs rock :),but the remaining exhibits are also very interesting. Definitely a must see if you are in London (entrance is free)
"Written April 12, 2018",Interesting,A free exhibition..very interesting. We enjoyed the volcano exhibit.. spent a few hours wandering about 
"Written April 12, 2018",Dinosaurs and a great gift shop,Go early to avoid the crowds. There is a queue for security that slows down entry.  Spectacular Dinosaur exhibition.  Hugely educational and enjoyable
"Written April 11, 2018",Lived up to expectation,You cannot underestimate how fantastic our free museums are!We arrived shortly after opening which was a real benefit as the crowds hadn’t truly built up. By the time we left 3 hours after opening the queues snaked down the street. The exhibits did not feel crowded and we did the ever popular dinosaurs first. That left us time and space to explore the less popular parts after the crowds built up.The facilities have certainly improved since I was last there but I guess that was when I was a child.Great to visit but get there early!
"Written April 9, 2018",Wild...,"Great for kids and grandparents.  It meets everyones must see list. From the skeleton of a great white, to the frightening dinosaur.  It was a beautiful museum and well worth your time."
"Written April 9, 2018",Dated,Everything is getting a bit old.... most of the displays and interactive displays are broken or damaged. 5year old daughter wasn’t overly amused.
"Written April 6, 2018",Easter break,"After queuing about an hour , we headed straight for the coffee shop... The cakes looked and tasted great although pricey , the coffee was dishwater though . It was all so cramped that we struggled to find seats. Saw a couple eating from the top of a bin where they'd balanced their cups. If you can go when it's quieter for as theres no time to stop and look before following the herd around the corridors..."
"Written April 6, 2018",Lots of fossils,"So just know that there is a long queue (line for Americans) to get into this free museum! The line moves quickly but expect to stand in line at least 20-30 minutes unless you go around 4-4:30. Very similar to the American Museum of Natural History, inclusive of the large whale hanging from the ceiling. It is very informative, interactive, and engaging. There are fossils of all sorts everywhere in the museum. I would caution those with small children to maybe avoid the Humans wing. There is a section on reproduction that gives accurate images of how humans reproduce and babies are made. "
"Written April 5, 2018",Beautiful but outdated,"Both the interior and exterior of the museum are extraordinary,  definitely a must-see. Some exhibits are wonderfully assembled (like the dinosaur exhibit! ) but others are painfully outdated (human biology exhibit). Still well worth a visit, despite the queue - especially because it's free! "
"Written April 5, 2018","Educational, busy and ever so slightly dull","We queued for half an hour to enter but it was Easter weekend so I guess it's to be expected. Our first stop was the dinosaurs. The exhibition was too busy to enjoy. We were ushered like cattle and told to keep moving - no time to see anything in detail. If you are planning a visit make sure you see this part very early or very late when it will be quieter. The rest of the place, whilst worthy and packed full of information was just a bit dull. Case after case of stuffed animals became a little repetitive. There was a lack of interactive exhibitions to break the stuffed animals up. Worth seeing as the building is amazing but not worth a repeat visit."
"Written April 30, 2018",So much to see!,We saw a few exhibits but just a few.  We didn’t allow enough time.  The volcano exhibit was most informative!
"Written April 29, 2018",You will see pictures here you didn’t know you knew!,Fantastic gallery to see some of the world most famous art within touching distance and for free. From the life size horse painting by Stubbs to Turners Haywain and Monets water lilies
"Written April 29, 2018",When in London was very cold and rainy!,We visited this very beautiful and interesting museum in rainy day. There is big hall with dinosaurs- very interesting facts about it. and the museum itself is a very beautiful place.
"Written April 29, 2018",Great place for kids and grown ups,We spent a great day in the museum. Even those that don't like museums had a great time. There is something for everyone and it's a great option on a rainy day
"Written April 28, 2018",Amazing,"Everytime I visit London, this museum is a must! You will need couple of hours, but it is worth the walk "
"Written April 25, 2018",One word - AMAZING!,"I've visited the Natural History Museum (NHM) many times (my last visit was last Friday) so I think I have to give them a proper review on Tripadvisor. Natural History Museum was founded in 1881 and it used to be part of the British Museum (Natural History). It had only officially separated from the British Museum in 1992 and became today's Natural History Museum. The museum has a collection of more than 80 million items of botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. In summary, the museum is divided into 4 main zones: Red, Green, Blue and Orange zones.1) The Red Zone exhibits everything about Earth, such as Treasury (i.e. gemstones, minerals), Volcanoes, Surfaces changing history and a very simple exhibition of our Solar System. However, in my opinion, what really stands out is the escalator through the ""Spinning Globe"" at the Earth hall. The escalator is also sandwiched between 2 big walls, one is painted with planets from our Solar System and the other one is painted with the constellations in the sky. There is also a new display of the skeletons from a Stegosaurus which I think it looks amazingly beautiful. I always attracted by this cool interior design every time I entered the Red Zone (through the Exhibition Road entrance).2) The Green Zone gallery holds the taxidermy of birds, fossil of marine reptiles and the creepy insects. What I like the most is the long hall where displays a lot of fossil of reptiles and the jaw dropping giant Pliosaur fossil on the wall, which I think is grand & amazing. However, there is a real need to refurbish the insect gallery as everything inside looks so dated, like everything from the 90s.3) The Blue Zone, which I think it represents the landmark of NHM. It is the gallery where its theme is focus on the dinosaurs' skeletons and the taxidermy of mammals. The dinosaur exhibition is not as good as before due to the closure of the upper level walkway but it's still fascinating. The gallery holds a number of dinosaur skeletons, such as Triceratops, Baryonyx, Stegosaurus and the unmissable roaring T-Rex...etc. However. what really stands out is the new 85 feet female blue whale's (its name called Hope) skeleton which replaced the Dippy the dinosaur at the main entrance. (the Hintze Hall). The hall also exhibits many other fascinating taxidermy/ skeletons, such as ""marlin sailfish"", ""elephant"" and my most beloved Giraffe  ...etc. After visiting the dinosaurs, don't forget to pay a visit to the mammals' rooms. The mammals room displays the taxidermy of giant cats (tigers, lions...etc.), Bears, Boars, Deer and the cute Beavers...etc. Plus the huge giant big whale is also a MUST SEE!4) The Orange Zone is mainly about the Darwin Centre, which is showing thousands of preserved specimens and the scientific staffs' laboratories. It is always quiet because it is not very interesting and it's not many people's cup of tea.There are rooms of improvement for Natural History Museum. For example, the earthquake simulator had been there for at least 20 years and it's a bit dated and boring now. The exhibition of Solar System is far too basic and simple, even for kids' standard; the Creepy insect gallery is crying out loud for the need of modernisation; The central cafe, Deli cafe and the T.rex restaurant's food quality are always poor, with small menu and it's over priced...etc. Despite of these, I still love the NHM as this is no doubt my most favourite museum in London. Afterall, who isn't interested to see the big teeth and the Spinning Globe?Highly recommended for kids and adults!  Tips: NHM is always more busy than the Science Museum and V&A. If you plan to visit all 3 museums in one day, I'd recommend you to visit NHM first and arrived when the door is opened in order to avoid the big crowds flooding in the afternoon. Use the entrance on Exhibition Road as it's always less crowded than the main entrance on the Cromwell Road."
"Written April 21, 2018",Lots to see!,Amazing stuff. In a beautiful building. Well worth a visit. Suggested fiver donation but entrance is officially free. We went to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition which was £15 but there was no queue on a Friday lunchtime and it was worth the fee for sure. Imagine its always a busy place whenever you visit. Places to sit and eat or drink both inside and out. Easy to find.....its linked to South Ken tube via a tunnel. A must see for everyone really..
"Written April 16, 2018",Excellent,One of the best. for adults and children as well. We spend 3 hours in it and it was wonderful. We will return to it next time - for sure !!
"Written April 16, 2018",Sunday morning visit,"Very enjoyable visit to a wonderful museum. Fantastic exhibits and the kids will love it especially the dinorsaurs!! One tip; come early. We arrived at 11am and no queue. As we were leaving at 1.30pm, it was very busy at the entrances."
"Written April 13, 2018",WOW,This free museum was absolutely AMAZING! We had a great time looking at the dinosaurs and the skeleton of the blue whale was unbelievable. You could spend an entire day in the museum.
"Written February 3, 2018",What a disappointment,"Booked a special trip just to see the museum. I found the place full of screaming children and couldn't move for people taking photos on their phones. Couldn't read the labels or see the exhibits properly as it was so dark, a lot of lights weren't working and the cases were filthy. Even the dinosaurs were covered in dust. The tacky shops were a complete rip-off. Thank goodness for the V&A next door! That was properly lit - but if art and textiles can be lit properly, why can't fossils be ! (and they won't fade!)"
"Written February 3, 2018",My favourite museum EVER,"It's free, a stunning building and an interactive place to learn. Perfect for any age group to explore - to do it any justice allow all day "
"Written February 2, 2018",Girlie 50th Birthday Celebrations!,We did not have long to stop here so we all chose one thing we wanted to do and did that. Could spend all day here and not see everything.  It is such an amazing place to go and free too (donations accepted).

"Written January 26, 2018",Well laid out ,"Very well laid out, interesting, interactive and enjoyable. Dinosaurs section particularly interesting. Only negative some of the interactve screens not working."
"Written January 24, 2018",School trip,Topic on Darwin. Very educational talks and he even had a teacher getting involved in the tours. It’s a very big museum so seeing it all in one day willBe very exhausting so try to plan out the day
"Written January 24, 2018",Very impressive,"This museum is huge with so much to see, all of it impressive. Give yourself at least three hours if you want to see it all. "
"Written January 23, 2018",A Week's Worth of Wonders,We spent two consecutive days at the Natural History Museum and still were not able to see it all.  Two hours in the rocks and minerals gallery could have been a whole day if we had the time.  The gemstone collection is breathtaking.  Take in the architectural details of the building itself.  A highlight of our time in London
"Written January 23, 2018",Simply my favourite building on Earth,"I love the Natural History Museum. We try and visit as often as possible. It's the most gorgeous building, I love how the animal carvings match the content of the building itself. The new whale skeleton is interesting although not quite an impactful as the old dinosaur model in the main hintze hall. Beware! Its always incredibly busy at the weekend, so you better to go during the week."
"Written January 22, 2018",Good Value if you make a donation,"This is a classic museum born of the pride and entrepreneurship of the Victorian era, housed in a stunning building. Much has been done to make the museum modern and bring it into the digital age but the classic exhibits still grab the attention of visitors young and old.The staff are wonderfully knowledgeable and great presenters not to be missed."
"Written February 13, 2018",Very good day out,I had a very good day out there with my family. I would come again but I would suggest that you would bring younger children to this as it is based for them.Very expensive suggest bringing lunch.
"Written February 12, 2018",Fantastic experience for kids and grownups alike,I had already visited the great place some 15 years ago but this time I took my son of 8. Besides the obvious beautiful architecture of the building one can find lots of information about our world and every natural for or being in it. The “swim with whales” special section was particularly nice! A must visit when in London
"Written February 11, 2018",wonderfull,was an amazxing visit but was toooo crowded were guided  to a  side entrance which confused us because we really wanted to see the new whale in the main hall which we saw after going a really long way
"Written February 11, 2018",Sometimes to trust friends is a good thing,"A friend of mine is a veterinary. We organized a five days trip in London for his fiftieth birthday. He likes wild life and science laike me, while his wife likes mummies and dusty stones, so we went to the NHM. I must say it was a great visit. The museum is very well organized in sections for the difefrent parts of natura history, including earthquakes, tectonic, animals, dinosaus, insects and biology. There is a wonderful room only for minerals, inlcuding  at the end of it the vault with precoius minerals and stones (diamonds, emeralds and rubies!!!). All thsi free of charge. Recommended, heartly recommended."
"Written February 10, 2018",Must visit.,"This is a special place, architecturally so stunning anyway, before you factor in the collections. You need a full afternoon and more if possible to take it all in and absorb. Again best advice is to avoid school holidays and get there early. A proper London experience with knowledgable staff, printed guides and wonderment for all ages."
"Written February 9, 2018",EPIC,This place is awesome. I love dinosaurs and this is the place to be when looking for some dino-info. The rest of the expositions are really really nice and they are all free. You will never regret a visit to this museum.
"Written February 9, 2018",Great museum with lots of variety,"First visit to the Natural History Museum but we'll be back; the suggested donation of £5 was excellent value for money. We went to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition which was fantastic, amazing photographs from very talented people"
"Written February 9, 2018","Varied, Eclectic, Fantastic","You need some real time on your hands to give this place the respect it deserves, the dinosaur area is super impressive. The building itself is magnificent. A great way to get children immersed and learning without even knowing that they're doing so, or alternatively for adults to have a refresher and a great day out.It was extremely busy which isn't surprising as it's free (with the option of a donation). I'd recommend if in the area that you give this place a visit, I defy anybody not to find something that takes your fancy, a real all rounder."
"Written February 5, 2018",Great Experience,Fantastic experience for all ages and a  great day out also for the youngsters you can buy tickets to stay overnight in the Museum my granddaughter is going in May she is so excited we are very lucky to have such a wonderful museum
"Written February 4, 2018",A Visit to the Natural World Before IMAX...and then hitting the Ice Rink!,"We popped in during Christmas holidays on a weekday and had mixed emotions like the rest of the attendees choosing to review the Grand Dame. The bottom line is we needed to burn two hours before our IMAX movie and it did the trick.For starters, it’s free and the architecture alone is stunning. The staff is helpful and there seems to be something for everyone in terms of collections: spiders, volcanoes, rocks, dinosaurs, the infamous blue whale model, and more! Our favorite (boys ages 12 and 15) is the world-class display of animals and birds. The sheer volume is unbelievable and priceless.However, no exhibit will be left undiscovered unless you intend to spend hours and hours at the Natural History Museum, if not days.Remember, we had 120 minutes! This meant we skipped the two temporary exhibits, the Ocean and the Wildlife Photographer of the Year, which was each offered for a fee, and roamed freely until it was time for our show.My takeaway…this is an old-school museum. Does it need to be updated? Yeah, but then it changes the dynamics. I’m not embarrassed to say I loved showing my boys items I grew up using such as telescopes, typewriters, and telephones. Plus let’s face it, the approach in terms of style and display IS part of the attraction. Truly, it is like being in a Harry Potter movie.Perhaps we’re too accustomed to flash and pomp, and forget that treasures like this STILL do serve a purpose for all ages.(Do note they offer Movie Nights, Dino Snores for Grown-ups, Crime Scene Live, and IMAX movies for additional fun at a price.)But having said that, it’s time for small changes/improvements. There IS ample room for additional interactive exhibits and absolutely fix the two-dozen or so dirty cases and broken buttons. The lack of attention to detail and upkeep did not make me want to donate funds. (What are you doing with the income from gift shops, cafés and donors?) And, please, ban selfie-sticks.In the end, it’s not a must-do in the city of smoke…but no doubt you’ll see something interesting, if not, leave and walk over to the Museum Ice Rink and experience the thrill of skating surrounded by fairy lights nestled in frost-trees, with the smell of mulled wine and toasted marshmallows in the air!"
"Written October 13, 2017",Well worth the trip,If you’re a bit of a science buff or have kids the museum is definitely worth the trip. Lots of interactive exhibits and very informative. The museum is HUGE so wear your comfy shoes and be ready to walk for a long time. Would recommend the t-Rex cafe as an intermission stop. 
"Written October 13, 2017",Still An Awesome Museum.,"My favourite London Museum. Easy to spend the best part of a whole day here. The building itself and the architecture is mind blowing, but the displays on the various floors are still impressive. Dinosaur gallery is still simply The Best!"

"Written October 13, 2017",Allow plenty of time to take it all in,Love national museums in London. There is no entrance fee to see some great exhibits. The building is as interesting as the exhibits. Has a snack bar inside too. The queue appears to be long but it moves along fairly quickly.
"Written October 12, 2017",A must!,London museum of Natural History is an amazing experience for both adults and children! It's a perfect opportunity to make your children get interested in learning and science!(check also the London science museum!)
"Written October 11, 2017",First trip for my toddler...,My little princess loves dinosaurs! So for her to see the animatronics of the T. rex it was a big hit.The rest is really for older kids etc etc but that alone got us a big hit for the trip.Some of the rest was a bit tired. Looked like a bunch of exhibits needed a face lift and too many times things were out of service.Some of it was also too 1990’s needed to be brought into the 21st century. Amazing building and facility so deserves to be more wow factor for the exhibits. Too many stuffed animals in a glass cabinet!Come on GB we can do better than this!!
"Written October 10, 2017",Recommend an early start!,"A little hesitant to start with about how the visit might go, with a two and four year old in tow. We got there early avoiding big queues and having an easier flow through the obligatory security screening. From the entrance and the giant whalebone overhead and the dinosaurs at the side our charges were in awe!It continued from exhibit to exhibit holding their interest and attention far better than we could have expected. Don't get me wrong, we  older folk enjoyed it just as much. Easy to traverse,, no chance of getting lost. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The cafe was Ok too, and the facilities good and easy to find."
"Written October 9, 2017",WOW !,"my son's love this place , always very interesting , always well laid out , one day is not enough , spend a hour or days , a great place for adults or kids ."
"Written October 6, 2017",World class museum & free admission ,Every time the wife and I turned a corner we were delighted but interesting and impressive exhibits . A must go to and you can eat there as well . Food is second to none . 
"Written October 5, 2017",Great,"Iv been wanting to go to this museum for ages, and when i arrived i wasn't disappointed. Admission was free. There was plenty to see, we got around in a few hours. The animal exhibitions were great and interesting along with the geography area (space,earthquakes,volcano). It was busy and very warm inside but didn't stop me enjoying what was to see. It was easily accessible by tube and the queue wasn't very long to get in either.  The dinosaur area was slightly boring in my opinion. There is defiantly lots to see and do and would be great for children."
"Written December 28, 2017",Huge museum,"A must visit place in London. The entrance is free and they have many categories in separate halls. Outside the museum, there is a ski area in winter which is very nice. You need to pay for the ski."
"Written December 26, 2017",Amazing... one of the best museums I have ever been! And free!!!,"Simply A M A Z I N G! One of the best museums I have ever been and for sure one of the best museums in the world. Please, go!!! Don't hesitate also to make a donation, the place is free and you can totally go without paying but once you're there and see how amazing it is your heart will tell you to do right and make a donation, if you can't that's no matter, you still can go freely and enjoy everything but the important thing is YOU MUST GO!"
"Written December 22, 2017",Fascinating day out,"My husband and I visited this Museum in December, we could have spent most of the day here. So much to see among the fascinating displays. We found the dinosaur displays to be particularly well done, especially the Tyrannosaurus Rex life size model which moves and 'appears' to come to life! This Museum is perfect for any age young or old."
"Written December 22, 2017",Venom exhibition,"Wonderful place! We go there frequently because in addition to their permanent exhibits they always introduce new temporary exhibitions. Yesterday we visited the Venom exhibition. As usual fun, informative and successful in engaging all age groups. A must see if you are in London. The actual building is also great to see every time!"
"Written December 21, 2017",NHM Visit,"This is our 2nd time visiting NHM whenever we are in London. NHM never fail to impress us. Good job NHM. will visit again. NHM is just opposite V&A, another amazing museum. "
"Written December 20, 2017",Awesome!,"It's so cool to see all the animals, the history behind them, the building itself is fantastic, I loved every single minute spent there."
"Written December 20, 2017",Worth going,"For a free entry, it is no doubt worth a look, with a wide range of exhibits and some stunning architecture. Perhaps not enough for an entire day, but easily a couple of solid hours of entertainment"
"Written December 14, 2017",So much to see and learn..,"Our museums are so busy that their enjoyment can be impaired. I also think that there should be an entrance fee. What is ""free"" is not appreciated. There are few donations..such a shame. It also looks like ""begging"". "
"Written December 11, 2017",Areas of interest for everyone,"No matter what your age, from a 2 year old toddler to 90 years, everybody will find something that sparks their interest. There are so many radiating exhibits. Wonderful."
"Written December 8, 2017",Boring!,"I was excited to go here since it was free and I would be able to see fossils and real skeletons of dinosaurs, however I was left disappointed. I do not think that that they have real skeletons of dinosaurs. There was too much fakeness in the museum as they just had artificial models of animals. That, for me, was what made the visit a big let down since nothing was authentic as you would expect in an actual museum. Not all of the museum is free as there are some areas where you have to buy a ticket in order to get in. Also, I felt that the museum is more ideal for families, young kids and teenage students. I will never return back here again. I think a zoo is better off!"
"Written January 22, 2018",The highlight of any trip to London,Always visit the Natural History Museum when we are in London as we love the exhibits and the building with all the tiny animal sculptures and also seeing Darwin sitting there on the stairs looking thoughtful while hundreds of noisy children bustle past him.  
"Written January 13, 2018",Great place to lose yourself in time and space,Brilliant museum!!  Download the free app on the way in and the go through an incredible entryway and just have fun!! Even the architecture of the building is first rate and it is easy to navigate and just brilliantly put together.  I had my 12 year old and he was just enthralled from start to finish.  More complete fossils than we had ever seen and displayed well!  The gems and rocks were fascinating and I am generally left cold by rocks.
"Written January 13, 2018",Night at the museum personified!!!,This museum is really quite impressive with its various exhibits. Was surprised that they did not capitalize on the movie since it was shot here. It's an amazing  place to spend several hours or even a day with all of the interactive exhibits. And it's FREE!!!
"Written January 12, 2018",Interactive and informative,It will be good to go early in the morning and dedicate the entire day to visit the museum. A good place to learn!
"Written January 11, 2018",Excellent ,This museum is perfect ! I love it and also it is a incredible idea to go there with children the place is a dream ! Lovely ! 
"Written January 9, 2018",Incredible number of things yo see,This museum is really interactive and fun. We visited the Dinosaur area and were really impressed wth the automation and path through this area with lots of explanations and a few surprises!  Each if my family was able to find something of interest and this was just a small part of the museum. The architecture of the building itself is also stunning. I will definitely go back!
"Written January 7, 2018",Fab museum ,"We visited the Natural history museum today it was our second trip. As usual the dinosaur and fossil exhibits were my sons favourite. However we discovered a fab area in the basement of the green zone beneath the main shop which was a discovery area. This areas allowed everyone to hold, examine and research bones, and fossils all with fab microscopes, reference books and research kits. My son who is 10 loved it as did all the children. Great staff on hand also to explain how to use the equipment. Next door is a really good picnic area where you can buy our eat your own food ( a lot cheaper than using the cafes!).Also we always find it is best to use the Cromwell room entrance to Avoid the main Queue's. "
"Written January 6, 2018",Fun day out,Fun day out for all of the family. So much to see & do. Exhibitions change but always worth the trip. You will probably have to queue to get in but the queue moves quickly. Great for all ages
"Written January 5, 2018",Favourite museum in London ,"One of the best museums in London, loved the entrance hall and the Dino section is incredible, also the animals part we enjoyed been there many many times . Can get really busy over the weekends and kids holidays. "
"Written December 28, 2017",Another great historic place to visit... and another one that's free!,This place is either a short bus or tube ride if you are centrally located.  You can easily spend a day here looking at all the exhibits.  If you like history... you will love this place and it is well worth a visit
"Written November 9, 2017",A wonderful way to lose time,"We went here just to fill in a morning before our flight and lost ourselves here. We had intended to visit the Wildlife Photo exhibit but simply ran out of time; there IS that much to see. Some of the exhibits are now starting to fade in colour (grey and white Great Panda!) but the exhibits are exhaustive. Considering that it is free, this is one place you should definitely visit. "
"Written November 9, 2017",AMAZING PLACE,Such an amazing place.  One visit was not enough. So much to see. Love the animatronic dinosaur. Long lines to get in but worth the wait. Can’t wait to go back!
"Written November 9, 2017",Great visit (much better than the Science Museum!),"We were a little apprehensive visiting after going to the Science Museum and being disappointed the previous day, but we could have spent the whole day here. The museum is free with currently just one discreet exhibition to opt to pay to see. It is a lovely building, with plenty of room, lots of great exhibitions  - mammals, dinosaurs, volcanoes, fossils great interactive elements and the children loved the escalator. The staff were good, talking to us about predators. Lots of places to eat and good shops.In the garden is the Indian Ocean Tsunami memorial which is of personal significance so important to visit for us."
"Written November 7, 2017",Another amazing museum in London,"This museum has so many different facets and topics covered, it should have something for everyone, especially if you throw in the amazing architecture. Our personal highlights: the earthquake simulator, the dinosaurs (don't miss the TRex robot), the large hall with the whale skeleton and the gem and minerals hall"
"Written November 3, 2017",Nice,"Visited it with my husband and three kids (12, 10 and 7). Went on a weekday so it wasn’t very crowded. My kids enjoyed all the different sections. I loved the planet escalator. We had a break at the restaurant where the kids had fries & hot chocolate. We had a lovely time "
"Written November 1, 2017",Amazing place,"The Natural History Museum was my number one museum to visit in London and it turned out to be my favourite. The beautiful building makes just walking up to the entrance impressive and walking through the door into the huge entrance hall impresses just as much. I've wanted to see it since seeing Attenborough make shows there and it is a great place, very informative and is a place to definitely bring kids if they have any interest in nature or animals."
"Written November 1, 2017",Interesting...,"A must see for tourists and Londoners alike. Was a lovely time... one of the best activities we did with my sister and friends during the school holidays.Very, very busy on Saturdays, as you can imagine."
"Written November 1, 2017",Dinosaurs a big hit,Very busy and would want to keep a close eye on small kids.  The size of the building allows for the volume of people that go through it.  The dinosaur exhibit was a big hit and the moving t-rex was excellent.   Great place to visit with kids 5+
"Written October 31, 2017",Trip down memory lane with my grown up children ,"Really lovely building , but the exhibits are looking a bit tired in some areas . Overall though worth a visit . "
"Written October 27, 2017",A plunge into the past,The Natural and History Museum of London is another amazing place where you can go to have a fun and discover interesting things about the world and take a photos of you with the most important attractions. At the moment they are building an amazing Ice rink.
"Written December 8, 2017",So much to see,"Even if you don't care about aby of the exhibitions the building along is worth seeing. As the museum is free (although you're encouraged to make a donation, which you really should as this is a great place). Even if some of the regular exhibitions are a little old the museum manages to capture your imagination and gets you interested. There are a number of things you can do, try, test that will entertain and teach regardless of whether you're an adult or a kid. Because the place is so big is doesn't feel crowded. There are so many difference shows and areas of natural history that you are bound to find some to your liking ... and most likely you'll discover that you have too little time on your hands. Also I dare you to count the number of 'wow' you hear from amazed kids."
"Written December 7, 2017",Great Exhibits,"Going to the museum is easy, just get off the tube at South Kensington Stn. The entrance is free except for a few exhibits. There's plenty of exhibits and you really need to plan, else you can get lost going round and round.. its like a maze in there.The dinosaur and ancient animal fossils were Great! There's sections for children as well. Allocate enough time there..4 hours not enough to see all. Will come back again"
"Written December 5, 2017",Had a good time here,I haven't been to a natural history museum in a while . This was very nice- only thing I didn't like- The admission did not include some of the new ( and what I thought would have been interesting ) exhibits . You had to pay extra- which I did not do.
"Written December 4, 2017",The building itself is already worth of visit,Natural History Museum is probably one of the most beautiful buildings in London. It's already by itself worth of visiting. Museum itself is huge and there is no point even trying to see it all in once. I really enjoyed the animal history on my visit!
"Written December 2, 2017",Fantastic ,"Wow, what a fabulous place to visit. The building itself is quite spectacular. Visited with my son while staying in London for a mid week break. We spent many hours here as there is plenty to see. By far the best museum in London. Highly recommend a visit if you are in London. "
"Written December 1, 2017",You could spend a whole day here,"This place remains an amazing example of Britain at its very best. A wonderful collection of natural history exhibits, housed in exquisite surroundings."
"Written November 29, 2017",One of the best museums in the world,"Some of the best exhibits, set in a gorgeous building, with no entry fee. What more could you ask for? When I visit museums in other countries I travel to, which are very rarely free, I'm always underwhelmed compared to the museums London has to offer.I've been going here probably once a year since I was a child and there's always something new to see. The 'late' nights are fun if you're over 18 - no screaming kids running around and alcohol is served!"
"Written November 28, 2017",Good visit of geology area,"I went there mainly interested to the geological sector and it is simply awesome. At Sunday, full of families ( mainly at the dinosaurs)!"
"Written November 28, 2017",Incredible Museam With Everything You Could Think Of!!!!!,We have been to the natural history museum multiple times and it has NEVER failed to impress us! It has everything from animals to mummys and it is perfect for any families day out.
"Written November 24, 2017",Loved it. Wear comfy shoes!,"Planned on spending 2hr.. ended up leaving after 4hr!Went early, short line for security check. Earths crust... gems... Dinosaurs.. bugs.. whales.. dinosaurs.. elephants.. did I mention dinosaurs? HahaAnyways, we left the best till last.. Hintze Hall was MAGNIFICENT as always. Thank God photos are now digital or I'll be broke developing all the pics I took!"
"Written October 4, 2017",Wildlife Photographer of the Year,Visited the museum solely for the WPOY exhibition which was not free but totally worth the visit. The entire building was evacuated due to an unknown reason while there and they honoured our tickets for a revisit. 
"Written October 3, 2017",So fun!!,"This museum is lovely for kids, but for adults as well, the whales and the dinosaurs in particular are amazing, and all free admission! It is a tourist attraction in South Kensington, there are loads of people almost too many, but its a 'must see' place! Theres is a cafe thats quite nice too, expensive though, and also a small shop that sells books, toys, clothes!"
"Written October 3, 2017",Incredible,I saw so many dinosaurs! It's a donation to enter which is amazing anyone can go in! The line took no time at all! The security is friendlyThere is a massive cafe area with lovely food. The exhibitions are so well kept and beautifully presentedAnd the place is so massive I could've spent all day here!!! You walked for hours and around every corner something new to learn!!! I loved it every second 
"Written October 1, 2017","Great, great, great",Great for adults and children. Free entry and can spend ages here. Sometimes have to queue but it's great to happy to do so
"Written September 28, 2017",A fine museum ,"We had a few hours, and walked past the nature historical museum and went in. There are lots of exhebisions and things to look at. The entrance is free but you are encourraged to donate £5. You can join guided tours for about £20.There are also interactive zones where you can test things and push buttons. Great for learning children about nature.I learned that insects do not have lungs. How about that? "
"Written September 27, 2017",Free family fun,I wanted to skip this museum as I thought animals look the same in every country and wanted to do something more British but I am glad I didn't miss it. It is well laid out for in depth or casual viewing. There were fun hands on things for kids; many of which my teenager enjoyed as well. It is less spread out than the British museum so it can feel more full but it also requires less walking to see a lot more. They have donation boxes but they did not ask for money at any time. Security checks your bags so make sure you don't carry sharp items on you when you go. The bag drop was a lifesaver. For a small fee you can have your bags safely stored for you while you enjoy the museum.
"Written September 25, 2017",A truly fascinating museum. Prepare to spend many hours there.,"A large comprehensive museum with outstanding exhibits. In particular, the Whale exhibit was amazing."
"Written September 24, 2017",Simply Brilliant!!,"What can I stay that others haven't? London's Natural History Museum houses the most incredible collection and exhibits for adults and the young. This is a must see attraction if you're visiting London - and it's free! We arrived at 5 minutes to 10:00 (opening) on a Sunday and there was already a line of people waiting to go in. Once open they let sections of groups through but it only took us around 10 minutes to get in. Not sure about the price of food sorry but they toilets were clean and the staff were very helpful. I wish I could have stayed all day. Would I go again? Well, this is my 3rd visit and yes, I'll be back again."
"Written September 24, 2017",What a great museum!,"This is by far our favourite museum in London. You need more than one day to see everything, They have constant new exhibitions so make sure to always come back. Our favourite was the dinosaurs, the whale exhibition and the buttery section they have outside. Can get pretty busy during the season so make sure to apply for the family membership which allows you quick access to enter and no fees for the exhibitions."
"Written September 23, 2017",After 35 years....., It's 35 years since we were here and this 2017 visit was wonderful. The initial exhibition rooms were crowded and had a bit of a dated feel to the exhibits but we found our way to the Cocoon and pretty well had the place to ourselves. It was brilliant and fascinating to see how scientists research and investigate our natural world. The interactive displays and opportunities to peep through the large windows watching people use various equipment was a real eye opener. This is the area to take kids to open their eyes about opportunities in science. 
"Written October 25, 2017",Awesome ,"Visited last weekend with my brother, his girlfriend and my almost 5 year old son. Free entry, well worth a visit. Lots of interactive activities for children to get involved in. We spent around 3 hours here and could have stayed longer. Amazing and highly recommend for adults and children alike. "
"Written October 24, 2017",Family day out ,"I took my 2 teenage daughters, 9 year old son and 5 year old daughter to visit the museum.We got the at 9.45am, luckily there wasn't much queue and we got in within 10 minutes. The Dinosaurs section was amazing, we all enjoyed it and thought that was the best part.The building is beautiful with lots to see.Well worth a visit and appealing to all ages. "
"Written October 23, 2017",Hope left us in Awe,"A visit to see Hope and we were not disappointed. The Blue Whale Skeleton is astonishing and we stood for ages just mesmerised by it. The building itself is just beautiful and impressive at that.We particularly liked, after Hope, the Birds section.Taxidermy at it's finest.Educational, inspiring and fun for all ages the museum is a must if you are in London."
"Written September 22, 2017",My favourite building in London housing everything wonderful in the world ,"Awesome says it all. The building is a masterpiece with works of art on every pillar and staircase, floor and ceiling.The newly hung blue whale skeleton is fantastic.You have to really just pick one gallery and concentrate on that. We did minerals this time. Saw and learnt so much just to Holme us again with our amazing beautiful earth.A God given wonder this museum is."
"Written September 21, 2017",A superb museum!,It's taken a long time to get round to visiting this superb museum but it was worth the wait and didn't disappoint. An absolute must visit!
"Written September 19, 2017","A ""must go"" in London",Fantastic Place! Always new attractions. My kid was mesmerized with all the animals! The T-Rex is fantastic.
"Written September 18, 2017",Could spend days here!,"My favourite museum in London by far. It's not London-specific for sure, but the exhibits are a must-see. Am hoping to see 'Dippy' make a return, but for now 'Hope' is still a very imposing skeleton in the Hintze Hall. The audio guide runs on Wi-Fi here, and is free to boot."
"Written September 16, 2017",Another fantastic British Museum,You need to be here when it opens to avoid the crowds.  There is so much to see it is mind boggling.  Plan most of the day.  The museum itself it huge.
"Written September 16, 2017",I think I prefer Oxford Natural History Museum ,"... because you can properly look at their dinosaurs (castes) without the clutter of edutainment and the crowds. The Natural History Museum in Kensington is of course larger than Oxford and has some gems like the corridor with the plesiosaurs in which are a wonder but the main event was a disappointment with dinos suspended in the air and so you really only get to see lots of panels of text. The second floor of the red zone with the mineral and stone collection is impressive. Other reviews that refer to be overcrowded and being in a constant stream of people with no chance to actually stop, look and be absorbed in exhibits are spot in their assessment. "
"Written September 11, 2017",Dinosnores! Be careful where you choose to sleep,"Went to Dinosnores on Saturday, and it was fantastic... the event is so well run, and the staff are all enthusiastic and helpful. It seems they’ve been doing it a while so its a finely oiled machine dealing with so many people.I’ve only one negative, hence not giving the five stars, and that is choosing where you are to sleep, we chose a place where it had minimum possibility for people to be walking through and set off for the evening activities... Had a great time, got back to our sleeping bags and settled in at 11:15... at this point there is loads of noise and excitement while people are getting ready to sleep, going to brush their teeth etc and then the lights go out at 12... it was amazing as loads of people were shining their torches on Hope the blue whale and up high into the rafters... the issue however was when noise of everyone died down, and the sound of the air conditioning or something was very loud... of course it was dark now and everyone was trying to sleep so we couldn’t move, so for 6 hours we got very little sleep...At around 6 o’clock everyone started to wake up, and I got up and from walking about you only need to move about 5 meters away and the sound has kind of gone... So the only reason I’m posting this, is first advice for people not to sleep towards the back where the steps are (being in one of the alcoves might of made a difference), and secondly for the organisers to perhaps just move the mats slightly away from there, as it only takes a few metres for the noise to not be so loud as it disappears up into the roof... If no one has ever mentioned it, they’ll never know.Again, we loved the activities, and this is just a heads up... as we really struggled the next day with the amazing animal show!"
"Written September 8, 2017",Best museum for kids,"What a wonderful, magical museum for kids! To properly explore this huge museum, you really need several days! The exhibits and explanations are tailored for kids, and there are a lot of hands-on experiences.If you only have a limited amount of time, its difficult to decide whether to have a walk-through and see as much as you can, or just focus on one or two galleries.Favourites are definitely the dinosaurs, the mammals, and volcanoes.Great shops with lots of educational items.The food can be a bit hit and miss, but there are healthy kids options available."
"Written September 7, 2017",Allow lots of time,"Visited on a Saturday morning before catching train home at 1 pm.  Queuing but didn't take long to get through bag check.  Left suitcases at left luggage, charge of £5 per case.  Entrance was spectacular - escalator through the earth.  5 year old granddaughter was mesmerised.  The volcano themed part of first floor held out attention for so long that we had to rush through to see the Bugs and Insects and then the Whale replacing the dinosaur.  Oh so interesting but plenty of time needed to do it justice.   Will be visiting again, but for a day at least."
"Written September 5, 2017",Mini break,"Wow....got here nice and early to avoid large queues like last time,  what a absolutely fabulous museum..spent about 3 hrs wandering round and still didn't see everything. ..can't wait to go back"
"Written November 23, 2017",The best free museum in London.,"The Natural History Museum is the best free museum of natural history in London. This museum have about 80 million items. Here you can see dinosaurs skeletons, fish, reptiles, birds, mammals and more. The Natural History Museum is amazing place for the children and dinosaurs lovers (don’t forget to visit moving roaring model of a T.rex in the dinosaur area). "
"Written November 18, 2017",Great for all ages,Amazing photographic exhibition.  Building worth visiting whether you like museums or not. Ice rink outside in Christmas season
"Written November 18, 2017",Better than expected,"Exhibitions range from really modern to old and dusty – but that made the experience charming. I would advice to come as early as possible, it got really crowded after a while. The café had good pricing and friendly service."
"Written November 18, 2017",Amazing.,"I actually have nothing to say. The title explain everything. Free entrance museum that would be worthy of a 30 pounds entrance ticket. Except for a couple section that were close cause they were working on them, every single corner of this museum will leave you amazed. If you're coming to London this is a MUST see. "
"Written November 18, 2017",A pefect place for children,We visited the museum last week and my six years old son couldn't get enough of this. He loved it. Beautiful building inside and outside and every room keeps a surpise for everyone. And of course there is a lovely place to enjoy your coffee or your food.
"Written November 16, 2017",A great day out for adults and kids.,"The Natural History Museum is wonderful for any age. It's always a good day out! You need to dedicate a few hours to it, but it's worth looking round all of it, there's so much variety."
"Written November 14, 2017",Great place,"visited the museum and was very impressed. I did not have all the time that i would have liked to spend there, but from what i have seen it is a great place to see and learn about a lot of things. Great place for youngsters, and school children, which there were many during my visit."
"Written November 12, 2017",Not what i expected,"Maybe i had the wrong type of idea in mind but the museum just didn't really have the amount of stuff i thought it would and so was left disappointed. Don't get me wrong, for a free museum it's brilliant and has a fantastic section on dinosaurs! There's plenty of shops and eateries to use too. The worse part of the trip was the millions of school children just running wild all over the place with the teachers just leaving them to it, but what can you do? "
"Written November 10, 2017",Amazing!!,We spent all day there and still not enough time to see it all. The building is gorgeous and we most enjoyed the mineral and gem exhibits. Tons of families and kids and I could see they really enjoyed the dinosaurs and whales exhibits. We took a break and had cake and coffee and the quality was very good. What a special place.
"Written November 10, 2017",Most Interesting of Museums-Several visits needed,"This is a wonderful experience and has exhibits that many museums around the world lock away as they believe the public are not interested. London museums are free but they had a tout at the door trying to extract 5 pounds from me.We only spent 3 hours here and will  return next visit, so choose the exhibits you want to see and go for it. The dinosaurs were fantastic, but make sure you read everything on offer so that you can learn some new facts"
"Written October 20, 2017",That whale hanging from the ceiling...,"My friend and I were walking on Cromwell road as we spotted a pretty interesting cathedral-like building... we steped in to have a looksy and we realised what sort of ""building"" that was only when we spotted that amazing reproduction of a blue whale's skeleton hanging from the ceiling...wow, what a place!! Free entry but it deserves all the donations it can it!"

"Written October 17, 2017",Whale Show,The whale show at the NHS is a must see. Learned so much. Not crowded on a weekday morning. Lovely building.
"Written October 16, 2017",Jennie and Elliot Museum Day,"This museum is opposite the Q & A, so you can do the two in one day, however in the afternoons especially holidays and weekends it is really crowded and you will have to queue to wait to enter.  Great for children. We were hoping to see the dinoseaur exhibits again but they have been replaced by ""the whale"" at the moment. Probably more for children than adults, but great just the same"
"Written October 16, 2017",So much to see,You really need a day at each Musuem not just a few hours. This building is beautiful inside and out. Displays are grouped in sections and the dinosaurs are very ones favorites. Who knew “Sid” from movie Ice Age was soooo big.

An amazing museum and you could easily spend all day here with interactive demos and soooo much to see and do.   There are some sections of the museum you need to pay extra for to access like the current whales exhibition but so much is free, it's just wonderful to walk around and you could spend all day here easy and get lost in everything it offers.  Get there early as queues start to build up quickly.  Easily accessible via tube (South Kensington).  You will love it! "
"Written September 2, 2017",Excellent Museum,"Absolutely wonderful museum, and the building is beautiful and deserves more attention. The carvings on thr pillars of animalss, birds and plants are wonderful. Still, though I miss Dippy."
"Written August 31, 2017",Nostalgic Day Trip,"Been to museum many times as my two kiddies grew up. They enjoyed every minute of it.A nostalgic trip with them as grown up kiddies. Bit disappointed the Dinosaur has been replaced with a whale. 😪 The actual dinosaur area apart from the T. rex was extremely disappointing - seems the museum has had a make over of partitioning boards and posters, The raised platform viewed dusty exhibits A museum of history  should still have that old world look, people in the lines around exhibits agreed it was disappointing 🤔Such a shame "
"Written August 30, 2017",Another Great Free Museum in London!,"Stood in line (but only for about 20 mins) the museum is crowded because it is so popular, but it has something for everyone.  The kids were loving the dinosaurs and fossils.  Great family entertainment.  I had a very nice lunch in the sit-down cafe and had a nice burger and a beer, a bit pricey but good food and service and I was on holiday and wanted a nice respite from walking and site seeing.  Most enjoyable morning and early afternoon.  Very convenient to get to via public transportation (Tube or Bus).  "
"Written August 29, 2017",Thoroughly captivating,"We took our kids (aged 6, 8 and 13) here. We had to line up for about 20mins, which wasn't too bad as the weather was OK - but be warned if it's inclement. Once inside, we purchased a map and then set off the see as much as we could. There is so much to see it would take more than the afternoon we devoted to it, but with kids you have to be selective. To that end, part of our trip included going to Iceland so we went and lookjed at the exhibit about Volcanos and the workings of the Earth. After that, my son was keen to see dinosaurs and following that, we went into the exhibit about mammals. My eldest daughter was fascinated with the human evolution exhibition and in all there was something for everyone."
"Written August 28, 2017",Fantastic place.,"This place is for everyone. Since we are into science. This place was very attractive to us. In my opinion blue and green sections are really vast and they must be seen. We started from top and couldn't finish ground floor. We intend to visit again. If you're really into science, you can easily spend 2-3 hours in this place, maybe more."
"Written August 28, 2017",Beautiful architecture and interesting exhibits,"In my opinion, Earth's Treasury was the best exhibit hall in the museum.  Compared to other natural history museums, this one has one of the best mineral exhibits I have seen and the Vault is a must see.  The dinosaur exhibit seemed popular with the many children at the museum, and was quite crowded.  We had 2 hours to spend here, and I would have liked more time to spend in the exhibits I found particularly engaging, we were definitely rushed.  This was also the most crowded museum we visited in London."
"Written August 28, 2017",Disappointing ,"I don't know what to say. I don't know whether it was the darkness, or the relatively small spaces, or the great many visitors but it felt like I was forced into a mechanical viewing of the exhibits; people  were waiting behind me anxious to see what I was seeing and immediately in front of me the people who had just left. Awful experience. Nice and interesting exhibits, but couldn't really take them in."
"Written August 27, 2017",Briliant ,"Exciting, knowledgeable, great for both kids and elderly. Well organised. The dinosaur section is the best, but mammal section, volcano section and most of the other sections are also worth visiting. "
"Written August 27, 2017",Great place to visit with kids ,Our children had a great day here. Lots for all age groups. Staff very helpful and friendly. It's free but they suggest £5 donation which is well worth it.
"Written August 20, 2017",Use the back door,Massive queues for the main entrance on Exhibition Road can be avoided by using the rear entrance on Queens Gate. We walked in with no delays when it seemed people were waiting hours on the other side. The main hall is very impressive for its architecture alone. 
"Written August 19, 2017","With the dinosaurs, whales and volcano","It's a huge museum filled with awesome dinosaur collection , whales and all other gods creature. And It also has a huge section about earth and volcanos and stimulated earthquake. If you are a kid you are definitely going to enjoy it, my 30 years old little brother enjoyed. And it's free. But a small donation is encouraged and frankly speaking it deserves it"
"Written August 19, 2017",A must go to!,Everybody loved the natural history museum..there's so much to see and suits all ages! Staff are really friendly and are always happy to talk to the children about cool stuff! Go early to avoid queues!
"Written August 17, 2017",Fantastic museum and FREE (mostly)!,"My wife visited the museum as a child and was keen that we take our 10 & 14 year old kids as part of our short trip to London.The main entrance is closed so we entered via the Queen's Gate.  Having arrived at 10.30am queue's were pretty good and it only took 15 mins to gain entry and on this side of the museum our first port of call was the BLUE zone and the Mammals section which was excellent other than the fact the weighing machine reckoned a Polar Bear only weighed 4 times my body weight.... the kids thought this was very funny too!?Next on to the Dinosaurs section.... this was my favourite bit with fascinating information and even a moving T-Rex model to bring it to life!  Fantastic!!!The Human Biology bit while holding lots of information is clearly one of the oldest parts of the museum and needs updating.... I felt like I was back in one of my boring 1980s Biology school lessons and I'm not sure my kids felt any different.Before heading on we went for lunch passing through the main hall (Hintze Hall) with the skeleton of 'Hope' the Big Blue Whale..... wow that is an impressive sight and the hall is stunning, reminding me of Hogwarts staircases etc in Harry Potter!Next up the GREEN zone... not really my cup of tea with minerals, birds, fossils etc but my wife was particularly taken by the VAULT where there were some pretty impressive gem stones.  I had to point out I didn't have that sort of money available to buy her one!Having already spent over 2 hours in this half of the museum we headed to the RED zone.  Unfortunately by this time the museum was extremely busy and while we attempted to have a look around, firstly taking the impressive escalator (in Earth Hall) to the top floor, it was far too busy to look at the earths evolution, volcanoes etc.... we instead headed for the exit.There is so much more to see and next time we are in London we will get there early and start at the opposite side (Exhibition Road).   We will also go to the Orange Zone and the special exhibitions (additionally paid for) as they look teriffic too.I can't believe this museum is free.... we left a donation (as you are asked too) and it was well worth it!!"
"Written August 16, 2017",The most beautiful building,"I love everything about natural History museum. I think it is a great place for adults and kids to go. Just very busy in summer, get there early."
"Written August 15, 2017",So much fun!,"As someone who has spent hours in the Natural History Museum in New York, I was expecting to be disappointed by this museum, but was pleasantly surprised at the breadth and depth of the exhibits. The main hall is absolutely breathtaking, and the museum is aesthetically pleasing and architecturally impressive as well as educational. Definitely something not to miss on a trip to London!"
"Written August 14, 2017","Crowded, badly sign posted with fake exhibitions","I was really looking forward to going here and the queue to get in was insane. It definitely wasn't worth the wait, the staff on entry are rude and not very helpful when asking for guidance. The exhibits more often than not seem to be fake sculptures rather than genuine. It was badly crowded with tight hallways to get from one place to another. The signposts are laid out badly which makes it harder to find anything! I'm gutted I wasted my time with it I just hope it improves. "
"Written August 10, 2017",Doesn't disappoint ,"Had a really enjoyable few hours here today, first at the butterfly experience and then inside the main museum.It is worth pointing out at this point that when paying to go into the butterflies you then qualify to fast track into the museum ( the queue was at 30 mins at 11.30 when we went in today)The new blue whale is amazing and so informativeAn amazing place, great for kids as the displays are very interactive. A beautiful building too"
"Written August 9, 2017",Great day out,"Visited here with my 3 kids.,as expected it did not let down. Huge amount to see and do,kids loved it ,hardest part was taking it all in. Wear comfortable shoes  and enjoy! "
"Written August 9, 2017",A paradise for the natural history lovers!,"This museum is housed in a huge beatiful building with the recently opened wing in Hintze hall (although it was still closes when i visitied). It houses a huge collection of fossils, semiprecious stones, skeletons of dinosaurs and many more like interactive activities about the human body, real size moving dinosaurs, and a simulation of an earthquake! Visit it early in the morning to avoid the huge queues. Free entrance."
"Written July 12, 2017","Been going since I was born, wonderful building and great exhibits","I have been visiting this beautiful place with my father and now my children for 30 odd years. The museum itself is a wonder but the building is also stunningly beautiful in its own right, intricate and beautiful with animal carvings etc. I grew up with the diplodocus in the maiin hall so miss it but thats a personal preference. Nearby are the science and british museums too and lovely restaurants and cafes to visit. All is all a wonderful corner of london"
"Written July 12, 2017",Dinosaurs.... gggrrrrrrr,"Took my two year old daughter- she loved the dinosaurs, photo exhibition and butterfly house. We didn't get to anything else- ran out of time "
"Written July 9, 2017",Oh so amazing. ,This is a must see attraction in London! The escalator up is amazing! The outside is great. And the exhibits will just blow you away! But be sure you arrive early as the queues can go right down the street!
"Written July 6, 2017","Good, if you like animals & their history.","My husband and I went to the Natural History Museum whilst on our honeymoon in London, and it was a nice experience, although not absolutely amazing. If you really like animals and learning about their history (especially dinosaurs, extinct and endangered animals, etc.) It is worth seeing. It is a beautiful museum, massive and spacious. It is definitely worth seeing at least once, but not exactly at the top of the must-see list when in London. "
"Written July 6, 2017",Somewhat disappointing.,"I had been here before and loved it. However, this time it was undergoing renovations and it seems like they are enclosing that grand hall to make smaller rooms.  I hope I'm wrong because that was the highlight of the whole museum. This visit felt really claustrophobic.  My daughter still loved the dinosaur room and seeing all of the stuffed animals. Hopefully the renovations will turn out fine in the end."
"Written July 5, 2017",Good for a first time but...,"They are renovating so the feel of the museum was different for me this time.  There are still many of the fun things to explore- the dinasaurs, the gems, animals, etc. but getting to the temporary entrance was not easy."
"Written July 4, 2017",Amazing!!,"The museum is a must-go destination if you are visiting London!! The whole experience is very fascinating and you will see things you cannot see anywhere else from dinosaur bones to precious rocks!! You will deffinately learn some fascinating facts and broaden your knowledge!! Although you might have to wait for a really long time in line to enter, its worth the wait!! Deffinately an amazing experience and would suggest this!!"
"Written June 30, 2017",Wonderful Museum,Our 16 year old granddaughter loved this museum and no wonder as it is so well done with attention to detail and animation.  It is a perfect museum for younger kids as well as adults--in summary it has appeal to every age group which is unique.
"Written June 30, 2017","A real ""old style"" museum","I was here with my wife and my two small daughters (3 and 5) and we enjoyed.You can see quite a lot of attractions, the ""typical"" skeletons, the animals, but also a lot about human being and all what is related to humans.The museums contain also couple of good bars to get refreshments and food."
"Written June 30, 2017",The best museum in London,This place is really really cool and I've been there a bunch of times. Always learn something new. Great for kids and adults. Their gift shop is amazing. It's free. Food options in the museum are not great but you can bring your own packed food or wander around to find something nearby. They do have a picnic area.
"Written June 29, 2017",Wow,"This was my first visit at the museum, it was very educational. I went with my children who found the dinosaur a bit scary but realised it's fake. overall we enjoyed our time at the Museum and we highly recommend for everyone to come here for some good knowledge"
"Written June 29, 2017",brill,absolutely brilliant not only for children but for adults all you got to make is a contribution to the history museum it's got loads of interesting things to do my friends and the kids really enjoyed the dinosaur bit the most but I personally really enjoyed the human body part the most it's packed loads with facts and information not only do the kids learn new things but so do the adults as well . very much recommend going there 
"Written June 29, 2017",Sensational Butterflies in the garden!,"Today we really enjoyed the visite of this museum, especially the special exhibition 'Sensational Butterflies' in the garden of the museum, where you can walk through a big tent with living butterflies (admission is 6.50£). Also the 'real' museum was really interesting ^-^"
"Written June 27, 2017",Tourist,"Absolutely loved coming here, you could easily spend a day here. Learned a few new things and is very informative for children. The way the place is designed is amazing especially the dinosaurs section. Me and my husband enjoyed it so much."
"Written June 22, 2017",Very interesting,"Have visited London on numerous occasions and have seen the usual sights so decided this visit to see some museums.  Why have I not done this sooner. A full day was spent here with plenty of interesting zones to keep everyone happy.  The prices for refreshments were a bit high but as entry was free, I suppose it's a way of making some profit.  Will definitely be visiting again as I'm sure there are still some areas yet to explore."
"Written June 21, 2017",Interesting but annoyed ,"Waited until a week day to visit as I assumed it would be less busy, so not the case. There were NUMEROUS groups of school children running around the place. It was extremely busy. It's a great place to go if you are looking to waste some time. I don't think I would choose to re-do if I re-visit London. There was also a lot of construction and much-needed upgrades ongoing which made the self guided tour quite confusing.  Found myself in a couple empty dead end hallways as there was construction boards covering the openings. Posted signboards with arrows led no where. I did miss a couple of the exhibits as it was a beautiful day outside and it was too crowded to enjoy. Find off peak times to visit but keep in mind that posted off peak times does not account for school events. "
"Written June 16, 2017",Great for jet lag recovery,"The NH Museum is a good place to go the day of arrival in London to walk, browse, and learn.  Not too strenuous, well-behaved crowds even if there are lots of children.  Very very interesting."
"Written June 11, 2017",Large museum that's great for kids,"This museum seemed to go on forever. There is so much history here. Great for kids. The dinosaur exhibit is vast, but if there are a lot of people it can feel a bit crowded and it's hard to view some of the details of the exhibits.  "
"Written June 6, 2017",Sprawling museum - split into different zoned,In the Red Zone there is a marked lack of seating for people with mobility problems seeking to rest. Most toilets require climbing flights of stairs. The seating is much more abundant in the Green Zone.Bag search upon entry. Free wi-fi. Several cafes and restaurants.
"Written June 3, 2017",Spare an entire day to do it justice. Its superb.,"The museum is simply superb. It has so many sections and and the information is so uniquely explained, it's fun for all ages. In the earth quake section, there is a quake simulator!! The section on animals and birds where there are real birds and animals taxidermied. There are so many fossils. Superb it is! Do visit if you are in London with or without kids. "
"Written July 26, 2017",Impressive,Be prepared to queue or arrive early. Museum is an impressive building with plenty to keep all ages entertained. Well worth a visit as long as you don't mind crowds especially in peak season and are able to tolerate rude visitors (nothing to do with the museum). Cafe not the best and expensive. We would visit again.
"Written July 26, 2017",I could spent a whole week in there,It seemed there was a long cue when we arrived but luckily it moved pretty quick. Amazing collection of dinosaur remanning. The whale skeletons and the full size replica of a whale were impressive.
"Written July 21, 2017",Beautiful building,Don't miss the details of the building itself. Beautiful!! The collection is fabulous as well. No line at the Queen's Gate entrance. 
"Written July 21, 2017",Save for a rainy day!,A fantastic museum. The exhibits are second to none. It was very crowded the day we visited but was still reasonable easy to negotiate with our sizable stroller.The kids loved the T-Rex!!! 
"Written July 19, 2017",Disappointing ,I felt it was aimed very much at young children with a huge amount of fake or mock exhibitions rather than actual skeletons. The equivalent in Oxford was far more fascinating. Glad I saw it!
"Written July 16, 2017",Pleasant museum,This was an interesting museum with lots of exhibits. Would be very good for kids but was interesting for this adult too. I found a lot of the collections to be very interesting  and mostly collected in another time. Couldn't get some of the exhibits today. Pleasant was ro spend a day and much better than the science museum next door.
"Written July 15, 2017",Better Than New York's and That Says it All,"My 10 year old son was getting a little cranky as travel can wear on all children.  Decided to go here on a rainy afternoon and bet him an ice cream that this one would be better than the Natural History museum in NYC.  Well at first he was quite adamant about our beloved NYC, but at the end it was no contest.  The entire family agreed.  Free entry makes it all the better.    "
"Written July 13, 2017",Interesting,"We visited last weekend. It's a big museum, very nice but we found very much for children and families.It would be nice day out and kids will love it. The only downfall was that no Aircon was on and it was just too hot and quite smelly inside.They should put some nice air fresheners used in big hotels, areas in Asia. It would make a huge difference. "
"Written July 12, 2017",A must see in London,"Amazing place to visit.So many things to explore for all people.Free entry (donations welcomed).Large building so never crowded, lovely food and very clean/tidy.Have visited a few times and is always on my list when I visit London."
"Written July 12, 2017",Interesting ,"I just loved the museum. It can be a whole day visit, there are so many things to see and learn. Amazing! "
"Written August 27, 2017",Extensive Mineral Collection!,"Easy to get to via tube from South Kensington stop. Great museum for all ages.  Excellent displays of fossils, wildlife, mammals, etc.  I was very impressed with the mineral display which took up almost the entire floor!  We always had a strong interest in minerals yet this collection was so vast from all over the world.  It was displayed beautifully and ws very organized.  I haven't seen anything like it!  The minerals displayed ranged from very large to small minerals.  (Sorry AZ) It was stunning and took a while to walk the entire area.  If you are a fan of minerals, this is where you want to be.  The vault with the real jewels (much smaller exhibit) is located at the back of the mineral display which is equally stunning.  Gift shop was large with a nice selection and reasonably priced.  No renovations were conducted nor other obstructions occurred during my visit."
"Written August 27, 2017",Loved it!,"Absolutely loved this museum! If you have an interest in natural sciences this is definitely a must! Make sure you go in the morning though, I went after lunch and hadn't even seen the whole museum before they told us they were closing and we had to leave. I was sad that I didn't get to see the rest of the museum but what I saw was incredible! "
"Written August 25, 2017","Great for kids, busy at peak times",The dinosaur exhibition in particular is great for kids. Has dinosaurs which move and call out. The marine exhibition is a bit worn now. Was busy on a Sunday morning with lots of families. Would still come but would be better when not so busy.
"Written August 25, 2017",Cracking place - as ever,First time returning to the NHM for many years and the first time with Children.The staff have been great with the kids and it's on visits like today when you appreciate the number of toilets available across the museum! 
"Written August 24, 2017",Fantastic Museum,Very crowded but well worth the visit. Had excellent assistance in gift shop from staff when purchasing the correct size of shirt. This museum was very busy when I visited last Sunday. Excellent Darwin exhibit. Will visit again. Not just for kids!
"Written August 23, 2017",Extraordinary experience which your kids will love ... and you too,"It is absolutely one of the place that cannot be missed if you are visiting London, above all if you have kids ... the museum and its collection have many ideas for reflection to deepen the knowledge, especially of kids and teenagers, about the evolution of humanity and of the ""home"" that we all live in."
"Written August 23, 2017",Incredible everytime,"The NHM has to be one of my favourite places to visit in London when I'm at a spare end. The building alone fills you with inspiration and wonder from its scale and intricacy. The well presented collections and exhibitions take you on a journey of discovery. The fact the main exhibition is free to all is fantastic and the quality of the displays and exhibits are second to none. My favouite, although slightly sad is seeing the preserved Dodo. Such a shame we wiped them out but Always reminds me to treat all wildlife with respect and as little interference as possible because of their fragility.Easily accessed by tube, free wifi hotspots, great food and the ability to enthrall make it a must do on any London visitors list, even if it's only for a couple of hours. V&A next door for another day. Get here early, like first thing, during school holidays otherwise it's mentally busy..."
"Written August 22, 2017","So many (great)  museums, so little time!",Another great museum for the family.    you need 2-3 hrs minimum here.  This museum is better in the morning vs later in the day especially if you have kids in tow.  (Lots of stairs)
"Written August 22, 2017",Enormous museum,"You have to have a lot of time to  go around this museum.it has different sections like mammals,reptiles,humans......my son's enjoyed how humans develop and the part of the dinosaurs.the entrance is free and there is a restaurant too."
"Written August 21, 2017",Fantastic day out!,We took our Finnish friends here on their first trip to London. I hadn't been for years but it was a lovely day out with plenty of interactive exhibits and it's free. All the children learn't so much and it was a memorable day. The staff were very friendly especially in the cafe.
"Written May 5, 2017",A Must for all Tourists to London,"I have been going here with my grand-daughter for about 6 years but you will neversee it all I am sure.Unless we are able to get there very early, we tend to leave it as the queues can be horrendous"
"Written May 3, 2017",Be prepared for the builders ,"After checking online we noticed no restrictions listed, after getting the tube over and walking towards the entrance covered in scaffolding we found we had to go back on ourselves to the street to find the entrance. Then we were told for certain exhibits we had to go back on our selves again and for some keep walking to find the other entrance. When we finally got in, their wasn't enough exhibits open to deal with the crowds in there, you simply couldn't get moved and the experience was so stressful and exhausting! Just not worth it until it's fully open again "
"Written May 2, 2017",Nice and enjoyable place !,"For adults and child, a ver nice place, full of things to interact or just see !!!Dinosaurs and mammals, whales, big or smalls insects, and a LOT OF TIPS and things to live and remind. "
"Written April 29, 2017",Interesting and HUGE museum... ,The entrance hall alone is worth seeing. There's an earthquake simulator in the second floor! And quite a lot of facts about animals and the human body. You learn a lot. 
"Written April 28, 2017",Great museum ,Spent quite a few hours here and could've spent a lot more. So much to see and the exhibits are all very engaging as well as some are interactive.  The mechanical model of the T-Rex dinosaur was pretty realistic and a must see. Highly recommend a visit for people of all ages.
"Written April 27, 2017",Good for children,"Well to start with, I think my expectations for this museum were quite high. I had read several really good reviews and people told me that it was definitely worth a visit. I was a bit disappointed to be honest. When we arrived there was this really long queue to get in because they were searching bags. I think we waited like half an hour. Then when we finally got in I was a bit disappointed that it were just a lot of taxidermy. I think for children it would be really great to learn about all of this but for me it just creeped me out a bit and there wasn't really anything of new information about them. The moving T-rex however is great, we had a really good laugh. The other downside was that it wasn't just busy outside but also on the inside. You couldn't walk freely but had to queue to move slowly past each animal. We left after being inside for a quarter of an hour."
"Written April 27, 2017",Great museum with a lot of visitors,"First of all I want to say that the museum itself is amazing. The things one can explore are really great and interesting.The only problem is the distribution of visitors. It is extremely crowded, so that one cannot read the signs properly, because one has to make space for 10 other people waiting to read it. If you don't like crowded places, avoid this museum. Unfortunately we were unlucky that the dinosaur area was rebuild, so we couldn't enjoy the exhibition fully."
"Written April 25, 2017",Dinosaur display is not what I expected ,"I purposely visit for its dinosaur but was left dissapointed mainly because I carry lots of expectation. Was hoping to see bone that is taller than a house but it was only a few small sizes on display.  I've been to the museum in Washington DC 12-15 years ago and that one has amazing dinosaur fossils and sceleton display, so I guess this is the reason why I was dissapointed in this London museum.My hubby has never been to the D.C. Museum and he seems quite amused with the displAy. Good to bring along children."
"Written April 24, 2017",Crowds,"A great museum but crowded with people bumping into each other all along the way. We visited on a weekday afternoon, I can only imagine what it's like on a weekend."

"Written August 7, 2017","Impressive architecture, fascinating taxidermy and a mesmerizing collection of gemstones","It's one of my favourite museum in London! I will suggest to go in the morning around 10AM to avoid the queue. Our 3 hours visit route:1- RED ZONE (East Lawn)(entrance from exhibition Road), we took the elevator to learn about the origin of earth (Floor 2 Volcanoes & Earthquakes)  => quick look on Floor 1 (Earth’s Treasury) => take elevator to ground floor and head to Green Zone.2- GREEN ZONELook at a impressive number of stuffed animals (Birds) and marine fossils (Fossil Marine Reptiles). => Walk up the stairs to the 2nd floor where you could see beautiful display of birds and minerals, head to ""Minerals"" and ""the Vault"". => walk up the stairs to the ""Giant Sequoia"" and head back to ground floor (Hintze Hall). NB: Dippy, the Diplodocus is on tour and replaced by a Blue whale skeleton on display in the Hintze Hall. 3- BLUE ZONE (West lawn)We stopped by the Central Cafe for a short rest, then headed to the ""Mammals"" and finished our visit with the ""Dinosaurs"". The museum is free (except for the temporary exhibition), but my parents and I left a donation.Have fun!"

Since it was our last day in London we didn't have time to see everything, you need to spend a whole day to experience everything!The skeleton of the blue whale was fascinating! Clearly worth a visit, with or without children! :)"
"Written August 3, 2017",Great experience - lived the whale exhibit ,"My 12 year old and I loved the visit! Easy to get to via subway corridor. All staff we met was helpful and friendly. The line to get in was not horrible. The place was packed with people but we still enjoyed our visit and got a table at the Darwin cafeteria. Good that you make coffee with soy milk! The whale exhibit was worth the 20 pounds and had great presentation and good facts. Recommend the visit! A lady at the Darwin cafeteria was in despair when we were there, she lost a small child, and I noticed the staff was apparently handling this swiftly, communicating with radio and managing the situation. Hope it turned out fine in the end. Definitely a very challenging site to lose sight of a small child, given the crowds!Donate 5 pounds at the entrance with a smile people! The museum does good work!

"Written July 31, 2017",Great displays but something must be done in terms of children,"The museum is incredible as it has many historical displays, explains each in detail and a variety of themes to explore.Unfortunately, when I went there, the front great was closed for improvement which lead to a longer cue to the side door.Since the museum is free to enter and they rely on donations, you get so many children entering, running around, screaming etc. which takes you away from the immersion of the fantastic displays this museum offers. Something must be done, such as an entrance fee or have signs/employees to stress for silence."
"Written July 30, 2017",Not as good as previous visits.,"They've changed some of the exhibits around, and not for the better.The dinosaurs section was a let down today, not as good as previously.Also, lots of people, more than ever experienced before, felt it was too crowded.If you've been before, I'd wait some time before a repeat visit."
"Written July 29, 2017",Good place ,We went on a Saturday and it was packed! I suggest you go for it around 9.30 am to wait just a little. Good cafes and restaurants nearby as well! Worth it
"Written April 19, 2017",You can see more at every visit,"Having been 3 times now, and we always visit the dinosaurs (can't not see the t-rex!) and the mammals but the creepy crawlies, birds and human biology are also worth a visit. I always feel like we see more each time, and there is still much more there to see that's perhaps not quite so attractive to an 8 year old but may be when she's older. "
"Written April 17, 2017",Awesome Museum--plan for a long visit,"This was such a great visit and one of the best museums I've visited. If you're strapped for time, they have a list of the most popular attractions to streamline the visit. When we went, we attempted to wander for the first while, and eventually became a bit exhausted and hit up the best of list and whatever was along the way."
"Written April 16, 2017",Free attraction!,"Been quite a few times down the years and it is overall an enjoyable & interesting place to visit. The building is up there with the best in the city in my opinion! Great for a rainy day with the kids, but get there at opening time or you could queue outside for ages if it's busy, which it usually is!  Good attraction but can get far to crowded and you can find yourself just walking past stuff without seeing it as you are forced on by the crowds... be prepared for a colossal amount of ignorant people who think nothing of pushing you or standing in front of you while trying to take a family picture. Best time to visit would be midweek during school term if possible!! "
"Written April 15, 2017",natural history,Very large museum with lots to see. They have a nice section of Dinosaurs. I especially liked the gemstones area. Get there early to avoid a long line.
"Written April 14, 2017",brilliant,everything so interesting staff really helpful one member of our party is disabled and everybody was extremely helpful the elevator to the first floor is amazing 
"Written April 12, 2017",So huge,The Natural History Museum is just so vast. It's too bad that the front entrance is closed for the time being as that was such a great entrance. Another free place with so much to see. You could spend days in here.
"Written April 10, 2017",Family day out,"Get there early it gets quite busy during peak times and you will end up queuing. Great family day out, expect to walk miles once inside . Ideal free family activity."
"Written April 9, 2017",Need another 10 visits,"We were visiting for the first time aged 32 and 33.It was an amazing day but despite the 4 hours there, we could do with some more.We enjoyed it all, especially the dinosaurs! The cafe's were lovely too.It was really busy when we went as it was a Saturday and the schools Easter break but even on a busy day, the queues were well managed and moved quickly.I would recommend this to everyone but be prepared to walk your shoes off! "
"Written April 4, 2017",So much to see and learn!!,My first time and I totally enjoyed my visit! So much to see and learn!! Spent nearly a whole day there and finished off the outing with shopping at the souvenirs shop 😆A must visit for tourists!
"Written March 29, 2017",Excellent but shame the dinosaur was moved,"I love it here in particular the fossils (bit like me),  that are displayed to great effect. Lots of information about the exhibits and plenty to amuse children. It does get very busy and you may have to queue to get in. Nice Cafes but I haven't tried the restaurant. I think try and avoid weekends if you can. Bonus is you can cross the road and go in to the V&A another treat."
"Written May 31, 2017",Natural Travelling,"Very nice, modern and well equipped museum! Very interesting all about the Universe, earthquakes, experiments, prehistoric animals and rocks. The building is awasome!!!"
"Written May 26, 2017",Excellent dinosaur exhibit,We enjoyed our visit to the Natural History Museum - especially the fantastic dinosaur exhibits. The Darwin center is also very interesting and we were totally enthralled during our 4 hour visit to the museum - we could have spent longer had time permitted. Note that this museum is very busy and was rather crowded at some of the exhibits.
"Written May 25, 2017",A great experience . Everything about Science.,"Wonderful Museum. Everything everybody want to know about science. Earth volcanos dinossaurs , name it. You will fins there.  "
"Written May 22, 2017",Lots to see,"If you want to see dinosaur bones, they have them. If you want to see a variety of animals that live (and used to live) around the world, they have them. If you want to see many different types of rocks, gems, and other geological items, they have them.A great museum for all things natural history. It has its collections arranged and located in different ""zones"". Example: Green Zone for collections related to Earth's evolution.Plus, plenty of shops, usually themed to the zone they are in. Note: the Hintze Hall is closed for until July and the Diplodocus skeleton will be no longer be in the hall. Because of this, the main entrance on Cromwell Road is temporarily closed."
"Written May 21, 2017",Amazing Museum,"The natural history museum is huge and located in a really nice building. I would advise anyone to visit on a week day as it is super crowded on the weekend. It is also perfect to bring children along as they have dinosaur exhibitions and various other exhibitions which are interesting for children. If you have many days to spend in London or live there, you might want to consider dividing the museum over several days."
"Written May 15, 2017",Wonderful!,What a great museum.  There is so much to see and do - loads of interactive attractions. An architecturally stunning building. The admission is free - it doesn't get much better than that!
"Written May 12, 2017",Brilliant and it is free,"Great attraction for a rainy day. You can leave your bags in the cloakroom, this is great for tourists. But cloakroom is not free!"
"Written May 10, 2017",Entire History within one building,Visited this place last month. This place is very close and walking distance from the nearest tube station. The collections are enormous and very interesting. One can spend full day here. Mornings are crowded and hence afternoon sessions are better. Admission is free to all. The Science museum and Victoria and Albert Museums ate also very close and within walking distance. Highly recommended.
"Written May 10, 2017",A thing of beauty.,"Don't get me wrong i'm not a usual Museum goer, saying that my son wanted to see the dinosaurs so this is where we went. Well, when I say it is the most impressive spectacle I have ever seen is an understatement. This place is amazing. You could walk around it for hours. We went on Saturday afternoon and it was packed to the rafters, so for little legs at 3ft tall the crowds were a little overwhelming but it was beautiful, yes that's the word for this place, pure beauty. The dinosaur exhibit is amazing and very informative, a real live (kinda) T-Rex and other moving pieces made it even more exiting. Would highly recommend it, maybe mid week for smallies."
"Written May 7, 2017",An amazing museum,You should definitely visit if you like natural history. An amazing place with a lot of different exhibitions and well curated rooms. Wildlife photographer of the year is a must so try to combine your visit with this exhibition too and you will be a winner! Best museum in London? Maybe 
"Written March 29, 2017","What a treat, great place to spend a day","The collection is superb, especially the prehistoric dinosaur exhibition.  It is free, 5 pounds are recommended as a donation.  Get there in the afternoon to avoid school and keen tourists.  If it becomes overwhelming, you can come out to enter a science museum or Victoria and Albert Museum."
"Written March 29, 2017",Perfect visit for kids!,"This was a great visit for my 4 year old, especially the dinosaur exhibit. We went on a Saturday morning around 10, and had to stay in line for about 30 min. The cafe was a perfect stop before we went inside. "
"Written March 27, 2017",Great for all ages,Fantastic museum with loads to see.Great that it is a free attraction with a suggested donation.Easily spend over an hour here.
"Written March 23, 2017",Fantastic Museum Well Worth Your Time,I would put this on a par with the Smithsonian as a must see if you have the time. Understanding that British history is much longer than US. The evening I attended they were opening a new exhibit and everyone was walking around enjoying a glass of wine (cash bar) - classy and relaxing. Everything from the Renaissance to the Romans to Dinosaurs and Science. The exhibits of Gothic architecture were impressive and memorable. 
"Written March 22, 2017",Seeing dinosaurs was the best experience at this museum,"I love dinosaurs, and I was very excited to go to this museum. It didn't disappoint me! My favorite museum, worth a visit! Get ready to be there for about 2 hours, because there are really many interesting things there."
"Written March 19, 2017",An experience to remember,"We went with our children as it is a family favourite. Our parents took us many years ago, we take ours & they ask to return. You can only really do about 1/7 of the museum per visit , there is such a variety - so it's wise to plan what you want to see in advance. The restaurant is excellent but as expected gets very busy and waiting time for a table can easily be 40 minutes - we planned to eat early & had no wait. The main hall is spectacular, the surroundings and architecture as awesome as the exhibits."
"Written March 19, 2017",Afternoon Visit,Good to know in advance that the main entrance is currently closed - use side entrance next to V&A Museum.  This means walking through the whole museum to get to the dinosaur exhibit (the reason for our visit).  Look forward to seeing the main hall this summer once the blue whale skeleton is up and the refurb is finished.  We went on a Saturday and the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit was sold out - buy tickets in advance online if you're interested in that specific exhibit.  Great spot to visit with the kids and lots of good gift shops too.  Wonderful that museums like this are still free to the public.
"Written March 18, 2017",Superb exhibits on display in a magnificent building,"I went to this museum specifically to see the ""Wildlife Photographer of the Year"" exhibit, and I was not disappointed. The photographs are simply stunning and exceptionally well displayed. (There's an app that allows visitors to read the captions on their mobile devices so that they can stand back to enjoy the full impact of the image rather than having to stand up close, jostling elbows with other viewers.) So I heartily recommend paying the entrance fee for this exhibit. But given that I was inside the museum, I found myself drawn to the different displays. The dinosaurs were really well done -- you can see there's tremendous appeal for kids. Other exhibits were equally informative and attractive.In fact, just looking at the interior architecture of the building was a real joy and worth the time spent: I was especially intrigued by the symbols that twined their way up exquisitely carved stone pillars."
"Written March 18, 2017",What used to be a premium museum has turned into a disaster,"Don't go. Anyone who visited this museum before the late nineties will be horrified with the terrible mismanagement that has turned what was a must visit attraction into a unmitigated disaster.The lack of exhibits is a scandal as is the clear attempts to maximise the museums profits (10 food outlets + 1 shop), by removing exhibit space to fit in all these food outlets has turned the museum into a joke.It's true that the museum is overrun with young children, however, I would think that is somewhat encouraging that their parents have managed to drag them away from their tablets.The costs to visit some of the exhibitions upstairs are ridiculous, far better to charge an admission fee and allow everyone access to whatever grabs their fancy.Go to the V&A for an insight into how the NHM used to be and weep at the cultural vandalism inflicted by obviously common purpose type savages."
"Written March 17, 2017",Lovely and calm,Nice calm museum and lots of fun with friends and family have been here many times and I love the earthquake Chinese shop bit! I love the escalators that lead through the centre of the earth and the dinosaur exhibit is a must see but sadly this month when I came it was closed. The food here is expensive but the shops and souvenirs are mostly affordable and really lovely! You have to go! 
"Written January 6, 2017",Make sure you visit!,"What a great place to visit! I visited after being recommended by several friends and I found the museum exceeded my expectations, there's several floors all of which contain history varying from the evolution of man to the history of natural disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes. Additionally your visit costs nothing! Which I found amazing as I'd pay good money to visit a place like this. Make sure you go if your planning a trip to London."
"Written January 4, 2017",Keep on updating,"The museum is being continually updated.  Took a niece there a few years back, now took the children.  Dinosaurs, mammals, fish.  I still remember going as a kid ? years or so ago.Everything clean. Well presented.Thoughtful curators.I would donate more if I could."
"Written January 4, 2017","Beautiful Building, Great Exhibits","If you love Dinosaurs and Nature this is your museum.  Great exhibits lots of information to read, use the guides to help you appreciate what your seeing.  Our Teen kids really enjoyed this museum and we spent 3-4 hours there.  As it was New Years Day it was very crowded and some sections were closed off which was a little disappointing.  Would visit again."
"Written January 1, 2017",Wonderful!!!!!,We stayed at Ibis Hotel Earl's Court(The wife and me) and took the underground from West Brompton station to South Kensington station to visit the Natural Museum. We were simply astounded by the enormity of the building and the multitude of displays and exhibitions in it. Given that the entrance is free the quality of the exhibits was nothing short of amazing! My wife's a secondary school teacher and she remarked how much effort and money the U.K spent on maintaining the museum and henceforth on education. We spent quite a bit of time in the dinosaurs exhibit with the giant scorpion and t- rex mechanical displays. The large fossils of sea predators displayed on the walls of the museum were simply amazing. The lighting was good and helped amplify the visual effects they wanted to create. I'd say this is probably the best place to spend your whole day if you have the time in London. We were there for slightly over 3 hours only as we had plans for high tea at Milestone Hotel not that faraway. If we make our way back to London we'll definitely visit the Natural History Museum again for a longer visit and walk. This is a must visit for all ages. 
"Written January 1, 2017",Almost a negative...yawn,"Nearly gave this 2 out of 5 but I'm feeling in a generous mood. The building itself is beautiful and very impressive, but the contents are simply depressing on the whole. Yes there are a few gems, but 90% of the content is just awful, outdated and frankly boring. The whole place feels like time has stood still. Maybe this is their intention, or maybe they lack the budget and imagination to achieve more. I wouldn't discourage any enthusiastic taxidermist or family on a tight budget from popping in, but if you have a limited time in this great city, steer well clear-there is very little worth seeing."
"Written December 31, 2016",Amazingly educational for young ones,"First time in London with my grade schooler. An abundance of museums side-by-side but the Natural History Museum struck a cord and we headed there first!A cathedral-style building and definitely inspiring 👍🏼One day was simply not enough. We took our time walking through the Hintze Hall where the skeleton of ""Dippy"" (the gigantic herbivore, Diplodocus) occupies center stage - mind you he will go on a tour outside of the museum in 2017. This naturally led to the dinosaur exhibition and we spent a good 3 hours there.In the afternoon we joined the behind-the-scenes tour (min. age 8) and our little one was awed by the numerous glass gaskets in Darwin Centre displaying the many preserved specimens. We had a brief glance of the blue whale model and will surely have to return to the museum many times (& will need to plan a trip to London every year)!A final note, there is no entrance fee and we bought the kid's guide. "
"Written December 28, 2016",Love this placw,"If you love animals and history this is perfect for you! Lots you to see, they also do great talks which are well worth it if you have time"
"Written December 25, 2016",Natural History Museum for Free,"We've been to many natural history museums and this one ranks up with the best.  The problem, is that we've been to many natural history museums and the good ones of course cover the same things.  If you don't go to many museums, than this is exceptional especially since it's free (you can give an optional donation).  What's funny, is that the kids found the bubble blowing street act almost as interesting---what small kids find interesting still blows me away.  Tip--there are two entries into the museum.  Queues buildup about an hour before opening. If you want to be there early, checkout the queue on the side entrance NOT the main entrance.  Alternatively, go later in the day when there isn't anyone in line--possibly even just a few hours after opening.My summary--go if you have 2 hours and are nearby--or if you don't get a chance to visit a natural history museum often.  Don't go if you're looking to be wowed by something extraordinary or visit these types of museums at home.  The R&A and British Museums are different and interesting with items that we don't necessarily have in the USA."
"Written December 16, 2016",Highly Reccomend!,National History Museum in London! What a great experience to learn more about London! There is a Diplodocus Dinosaur in the main room/hall and more!
"Written December 13, 2016",no queue ,I've visited this museum last Sunday around 4pm and there was no queue. However it was so crowded that sometimes you lose time waiting to get free way and other times there are too many people in your front seeing the same piece.
"Written December 13, 2016",Immense repository of knowledge - something for everyone,"Visiting this place is a no-brainer for me each time I have 2 or 3 hours to spare during a trip to London. Unfortunately, I invariably spend those hours perusing the World Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibit. I know its wall harbour a phenomenal vastness of information and I think (hope) that eventually, I will begin to broaden my savouring of its offerings. I cannot imagine that anyone will be disappointed by a visit."
"Written December 12, 2016",Nice museum,"Been there for some hours, it's really cool if you like science, biology and dinosaurs. It's a big place, no tickets need, amazing building to see from the inside."
"Written December 7, 2016",Dinοsaurs  in  London?,Indeed.The  Natural  History  Museum  is  an  ideal  place  to  visit  in  London  and  guess  what: the entrance  is  free.This  is  a  perfect  place  to  visit  even  if  you  travel  alone.I  went  there  twice.
"Written December 7, 2016",A stunning piece of architecture,"We didn't stay here for long but what we saw was very interesting, especially the dinosaur exhibit. I loved the architecture of the entrance/exit hall - stunning!"
"Written December 3, 2016",Dinosaurs cool!,Free entry and dinosaurs - enough said!  Went here before my Stonehenge tour commenced at Victoria station.  This is only 1 or 2 stops away at South Kensington tube station.  Beautiful building inside and out!
"Written November 28, 2016","haven't been here for years, so worth coming again","visited late on a Sunday, around 4pm, but a decent enough time to wander around and see some very interesting things (and buy a cuddly penguin from the shop), as well as get free parking right outside, and no queues.  Loved it - especially the volcano section in the red area, and the huge T-rex that moves and roars in the blue section.  another half hour would have been perfect for us to also fit the whales in, but still can';t complain.  Ice rink is open, had a watch - way too many very capable skaters but still a beautiful sight to behold with the lovely xmas tree in the middle and the lights all over the trees.  the building itself is absoutley beautiful "
"Written November 27, 2016",NHM is a brilliant day out!,"London's Natural History Museum is my all time favourite building in London. The architecture is awesome, all of the details in Hintze hall give me goosebumps! Fun day out, plus its free. They have an ice-skating rink out front in the winter, and when it is lit up at night it just looks magical! Cant wait to see the blue whale hanging fom the cieling in 2017 :-)"
"Written November 25, 2016",Amazing place! ,"I was in London for a business trip and had some time to kill and so I decided to pay this place a visit one late afternoon. I regret not going in the morning as I could have spent my whole day there! The place closes at 6pm if I bring correctly. This place is amazing with life-size sculptures of almost every living being from centuries ago right till present time.  If you have kids this place has to be on the top of yr go-to places.  Even if you don't have kids this place is a must visit haha. I was never a museum enthusiast but even I was mesmerised by this place and best of all its free entry, and you can drop a donation before you leave the place (which I generously did as I felt it was truly well worth it). Make sure to visit this place when in London, it's definitely worth every minute! "
"Written November 22, 2016",Dinosaur day,Visited with my grandson and we both thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We focused on the dinosaurs which were brilliantly exhibited with the animatedT Rex an absolute show stopper. Great museum and look forward to further visits to see more. 
"Written November 22, 2016",the place is becoming a dinosaur,"Visited the museum after a few years away and was shocked on how much the place had changed (not for the good). Gallery staff did not know any information about exhibits or could not be bothered about their job, (remember what happened to the dinosaurs). "
"Written January 29, 2017",Dinosaurs!!!!!!!,"Smegging dinosaurs, winner winner dino dinner! Who doesn't love a dinosaur? When it gets to the human body section I get told off for sniggering at light up testicles (a must see).Slightly confused by the pricing of the eateries as they vary for the same items."
"Written January 28, 2017",Superb!,"Perfect place for kinds on a winter day, specially if they're first timers in London! The Museum is amazing, the exhibitions beautifully arranged and organized and the staff well-trained and kind. And you don't have to pay to get in! Will be back, for sure!"
"Written January 28, 2017",Brilliant Day Out,"The National History Museum is a fun filled day out for animal lovers. It is packed with exhibitions, displays and interactive activities that are fun for all the family. Admission is free, cafe inside the museum and lots of things to buy to remember your visit. Recommend for families with small children and animal lovers."
"Written January 27, 2017",very interesting! the Whale is a must have,"I love animals so i visited. amazing. very organized, clean and easy to roam around. the Shop is wonderful too!"
"Written January 24, 2017",Enjoyable but not as much as expected. ,We visited with a toddler expecting great things and lots for our son to do. However we felt there wasn't much to do for young children and found it quiet difficult to keep him entertained. My husband and I would have thoroughly enjoyed it without the little one! 
"Written January 18, 2017","Interesting, big and free!","As a nature lover I was truly amazed by a lot of what the natural history museum could offer. I really liked the dinosaur exhibition a lot! The cafe is nice but expensive, they could even offer three different gluten free cakes for us! The down side (and that's what makes the 4 of 5) is that the whole interior and the most exhibition feels old, like from the 70's, if they would make an update it would be amazing!"
"Written January 18, 2017",Wildlife Photographer of the Year Exhibition ,"A breath taking exhibition of fabulous photographs of wildlife. The variety is amazing - botanical, tiny eggs, jellyfish, orangutan and much more. This is a must see. I am going back very soon. The museum building is spectacular externally and internally, while a lifetime would not be long enough to appreciate all the exhibits. There is something for everyone."
"Written January 17, 2017",Visiting is a must!,"Allow quite a few hours for this attraction. There is so much to see! A fascinating look through millions of years of history. Plenty of unusual exhibits, and the stories behind them."
"Written January 15, 2017","Really interesting place and a must-see for tourists, adults and kids!",We visited the museum on a Saturday morning just after it opened (had to wait in a fairly long queue at quarter to 11am beforehand but worth the wait!). It's close to the local tube station and there's a few museums nearby so you could make a day of it. It's a really beautiful building with some very interesting pieces. Our favourites were definitely the dinosaurs (and we're grown adults!). 
"Written January 10, 2017",fantastic day out,"This was so much fun! I was very excited to visit the dinosaur exhibit and was not disappointed! The museum is huge and can be very busy, so if you don't like crowds avoiding the weekends is best. The admission is free but they do ask that you make a donation, we donated £5 each. There is loads to see, with little games and interactive points around each part. Loads to entertain children and make learning fun. There were lots of little shops and places to eat around."
"Written November 21, 2016",I became a member on the first visit,I absolutely love this museum. I arrived just after opening and skipped the line by joining as a member. I then spent 5 hours looking around. The intriguing collections and history was incredible. Highly enjoyed the mineral and gem collections as well as the wildlife specimens.Was also invited to a sit in on a lecture. I am so glad I did. Learned a lot and was very neat to see how the science behind the displays works. I highly recommend to any visitor. 
"Written November 20, 2016",Wow ,A must if you have any time to spare in London. So big that you will only get a  taste and be prepared to come back. Well worth putting it on your things to do. 
"Written November 20, 2016","Loved it, give yourself plenty of time.",Lovely place which leaves you awestruck before you even go inside. Plenty to see and do. Make sure you wear flat comfortable shoes. 
"Written November 19, 2016",Lots to See,"This place takes more than one day. Plan what you want to see and stick to it. Most popular is the Dinosaur display, a use see is T Rex model that was just wow. Mammal section best seen at a zoo these are just stuffed or replicas. Worth a visit is the living earth and all the natural jewels. Plenty of toilets and cafe. Did not rate the Darwin centre to much but worth a visit.  "
"Written November 18, 2016",High Quality museum collections and it is FREE.,"I been to many museums all over the world and for England to make their museums free[ almost] is remarkable. The presentation is top notch and the collections, out of this world. As a Canadian from the City of White Rock, I am very proud of the British Govt to make these many museums available to anyone that visit England. Highly recommended and words can't describe my appreciation."
"Written November 18, 2016",Ok but not great,I didn't enjoy it that much. Felt it was mainly for kids.It was well organized but very crowded in the summer.Overall an average experience.
"Written November 11, 2016",Great afternoon out!,This museum is fantastic. We spent a great afternoon here and wish we'd arrived earlier in the day! Kids were fascinated by the fossils and all the geological information. DId ask as we left why they don't charge for entry . I understand (and applaud) the noble rationale given but think it is misplaced in this modern world! Museums of this calibre need our support and even an adult-only pay system would surely be better than a poor fellow 'begging' for donations at the exit! Thank you for a very enjoyable and instructive visit!
"Written November 10, 2016",nice amazing museum,"the museum itself is big, it has free entry but you are welcome to donate $$ as a form of entry fee. lots of things to see. i didnt managed to go the whole museum as we are short of time. i do recommend u need at least half a day to go thru all the museum display."
"Written November 10, 2016",Inspirational,My 1st visit after having NHM on my to do list for many years. I would love to live locally to appreciate it at my leisure. You are better off to allocate an entire day to spend there to appreciate the colossal collections
"Written November 3, 2016",Great for kids and adults,"The Natural History Museum was my favorite museum in London! There are several great expositions, such as dinosaurs, animals, human body, earth rocks and crystals, volcanoes, human evolution and insects. It's very interesting for all ages, but the kids love it. It's an excellent free family attraction."
"Written March 15, 2017",Superb,Superb. The building is magnificent. Guaranteed great time for kids and grown-ups alike. Definitely a must. Dinosaurs section is the best. Free entrance - to avoid the long lines use the entrance on Exhibition Road.
"Written March 8, 2017",See the Portraits,Every time I go to London I visit the National Portrait Gallery it's always a highlight. Very highly recommended.
"Written March 7, 2017",Not very impressed ,"My boyfriend and I visited the Natural History Museum during a trip to London for my birthday and were not particularly impressed. We had to queue up in the rain for a good 25-30 mins before getting in and this was at 10.30am! We had to reschedule a reservation we had for later on that day so that we could visit the museum and I'm afraid to say it wasn't worth it.There were several groups of school children on field trips which is great but they were running riot, making loads of noise and were really rude. I know this is down to the adults responsible for these children but it really made it a bad experience for us. I think they're renovating at the moment so we missed out on a couple of things which was a shame but again, these things have to be done and can't be helped. We spent a good 3 hrs here but were quick to leave and probably won't be returning. I was really disappointed but might give it another chance if I'm ever back in London."
"Written March 4, 2017",Very busy but well worth going to,"We visited this early afternoon, and there was only a short queue (Wednesday). Inside however was very busy, especially at the start (earthquakes & volcanoes), and at the dinosaurs. If you have younger kids they should love this. The dinosaur exhibition is being redone so not as impressive as expected.  I would have loved more time, we just had under 2 hours so were quite quick.  "
"Written February 27, 2017",Lots to see,"We visited this on our second day, we arrived too late the first day and the queue was huge so we didn't go in. We were there for it opening the next day and still had about 50 people in front of us. Kids love it, especially the dinosaurs and the whale. Really somewhere everyone should visit. However we called into the kitchen for food but there was nothing available early on for a coeliac to eat so just had tea, one of the milk jugs and cups had to be returned as they were dirty, several people in the queue behind us also returned their jugs of milk so that wasn't too good.  Other than that was a great day out."
"Written February 25, 2017",Huge and free!!!,Amazing big museum. One day is not enough for the whole place. And it's free!!I would love for it to be paid on weekends so that the crowd is limited.
"Written February 24, 2017",Great few hours ,"Best museum I have ever been in.  Just do it . The dinosaur side,  queens entrance is the better place to start. "
"Written February 23, 2017",Stuck in the past?,"Sorry but we were disappointed. The queue to get in horrendous, constantly being queue jumped by school parties. the place was overrun by noisy school kids, couldn't look at the exhibitions. We found the exhibits to be dusty and just not looking at their best, the whole place needs a good clean.You'd be better off spending your time in the V & A, far more tranquil and enjoyable.Sorry for the poor review but we based our entire stay around going to this museum and felt let down. "
"Written February 21, 2017",The building itself was even amazing!,"Beautiful architecture, great exhibits and a gorgeous building! I didn't go with any kids-it was just me and my husband, so I didn't go into all the kids exhibits...but what I did see I enjoyed. They also had a exhibit showing award winning animal or nature photography by kids-some as young as 10...stunning! That was a separate charge from the museum entrance, but worth every penny. "
"Written February 20, 2017",Amazing ,"My 10 year old son was buzzing, so many things to see and well set out and veryInteresting, also cafe and toilet facilities excellent. Well done "
"Written February 20, 2017",Lovely Museum,"A great place for adults and children.. Their are interactive areas where you and your kid's can enjoy taking part in the games and tasks.. Best of all, it's free..!"
"Written February 17, 2017",Lovely museum!,Lovely museum with many interesting exhibitions. It was extremely busy when we visited so we would recommend going early to avoid the large crowds. 
"Written February 13, 2017",Fab attraction,"Easily accessible as on bus route, a fantastic FREE attraction. Lots to see, really interesting and friendly staff. Thank-you!"
"Written February 5, 2017",Excellent and historic few hours,We had food at the T Rex Restaurant in the museum and the food was very tasty. Highly recommended the T Rex Burger and the pepperoni pizza too. The staff in the restaurant were friendly and helpful. Free is always good and the museum was very entertaining and informative especially the Dinosaur exhibition part. A good few hours definitely worth a go.
"Written February 4, 2017","Noisy, tacky and over run with screaming children","The building is a masterpiece, both externally and internally, beautiful and impressive. The science that goes on out of sight is world class and the collection is one of the best in the world. The problem begins with the public sections of the museum, it's far too much focused on entertainment and not education, when we went everywhere was packed with screaming hysterical children, running around banging things and ruining the museum for everyone else.The older display halls were less popular with the children and hence tolerable, and have interesting stuff on display. There was very little attempt at education in these halls, they were simply static displays of stuff. In some respects they were the best part of the building.The more modern halls were full of broken electronic/interactive things, and while there was an attempt to explain, it was mostly entertain and there were many glaring factual errors and issues with the displays.The restaurants (of which there are several) are variable in price, we found the light sandwich/cake bar to be the most reasonable of the ones we looked at, and it's in a nice settings. The food was also quite good and a fair price for London.There are several gift shops in the museum. We got a perfectly reasonable UK made tea towel with an old advertising image for the museum on it. Most of the stuff on sale is Chinese made tat, but there are some nice things if you bother to take your time to look.The museum does do child-free evening events now and then (we've been on one in the past). They have three advantages: No children allowed, actual guides drawn from museum staff and it's much less stress.I would strongly recommending not visiting the museum on any day when there are children in it, as it's just not worth the effort."
"Written February 2, 2017",Earthquakes and volcanoes,Our school sent us to see the exhibition for Earthquakes and Volcanoes as part of the home learning tasks of half term and what an excellent idea for a family trip it was! We took the escalator to go up the earth's 'burning core' and our son with his notepad and his camera started the best reportage he could have on the topic. The section is perfectly curated with all scientific parts explained clearly. There is even an earthquake simulator! Highly recommended for year 4 children as an extra curricular activity.
"Written February 1, 2017",Great museum.,"Great museum. Visiting this place is a very good way to spend your time while visiting London. Closed to Hyde Park, splendid building and location. Very riched natural history collection and well explained. Happy that we took the time to visit this place."
"Written February 1, 2017",Simply Amazing!,Wow! So much to see and so much to learn. Great place with what feels like thousands upon thousands of exhibits. Take your time here! go through it all. Also there is no entrance fee!! All the more reason to take your time. But please do donate as your entrance fee : ) Also a great place for kids to interact and learn about literally everything. There is a food court here but I believe its mostly just snacks and drinks. Tips: -Wear good walking shoes and comfortable clothing - DON'T rush through this place or you may regret when you see what others have posted. - Do have fun! it's okay to get excited to see an exhibit.
"Written January 30, 2017",Excellent museum to visit!,Highly recommended while visiting London. Admission is free though donations are welcomed. Plan on spending a good few hours taking it all in. The exhibits are excellent! Great for children and so much to learn! Everything from minerals to plants to dinosaurs! 
"Written January 30, 2017",Massively disappointing,"I had lovely memories of this place as a child but it's sadly not what I remember.  The exhibits are squeezed together, gems are few and far between and the majority of the exhibits now seem to be educational (for children) stands, most of which could be learned online or from books with little or nothing innovative or interesting.  The place is overwhelmed with children, making it impossible to relax at all.  If you want something for your kids to do for a few hours it's worth a visit (since it's free), but if you are looking for an interesting experience as an adult avoid it - there are many better places to spend your time in London - the V&A is right across the street and staggeringly better."
"Written November 3, 2016",Huge Museum Collection,"The museum was huge so I only managed to complete the left part for Dinosaur, Animals and Human Body with our remarkable history in centuries. Great collection!Note: schedule your visiting time as the museum got really crowded during school holidays"
"Written November 2, 2016",Fun day,Very cool spot very interesting with lots to see!! We also got a bit of celeb spotting in as prince Charles was also visiting on the day. There is also a cool ice rink set up for winter reasonably priced and good fun. Definitely give it a visit if in London.
"Written November 2, 2016",Fabulous for everyone!,We took our 13-year old grandson and he loved it and so did we. There were so many interactive and hands-on activities.  We learned so much.  We went twice and spent about six hours in total and we could have spent more time there. A wonderful experience!
"Written October 31, 2016",Interesting and educational!,"Do make it a point to drop by this museum that takes you on a journey through time. Highly educational given that it houses an extensive collection of exhibits from the natural world, starting from pre-historic times. Visited in May 2015."
"Written October 26, 2016",Great visit,Busiest week of the year they said at the entrance!  Exceptional museum. A lot of activities for children. And the staff is helpful and friendly
"Written October 25, 2016",Overrated and overcrowded,Had a museum day in londom. Chose this museum as a grest start due to its association with David Attenborough. Love the idea of the museum but not a fan of the 1hr wait in line to get inside or the then very crowded inside of the museum. Cant argue with the free entrance fee.  Most people just seemed to be sitting around on floors eating and resting. In hindsight would of spent most of the day at the British museum and just ducked in for a quickish look around. Would of liked a behind the scenes tour and would of been happy to pay to see it.
"Written October 24, 2016",Natural Museum London,"Great Museum for Kids perfect. Lot of Dinos from old history, thousands of years ago. Expext long waiting Slots to get inside in morning time"
"Written October 23, 2016",Fantastic Visit,"Visited the museum on a recent Monday afternoon and had a great time, especially with our 2 toddlers.  They LOVED it.  They had a great time seeing all the animals and especially the dinosaurs.  It was a little busy .. but still plenty of room to let them walk/run about between exhibits.  Kids or not, this is a brilliant museum and a definite visit if in London."
"Written October 22, 2016",best museum ever!! ,had so much fun! very interesting and a nice place to educate yourself and spend your time! would love to go back there! 
"Written October 21, 2016","Much to see, and kids will love it!","And it's free!! We went there with our three young kids (ages 3, 6, and 8), and they all loved it. The highlight of our time there was the dinosaur exhibit for sure. We spent most of our time there. There is lots to see, so plan on spending a good chunk of time there or just pick and choose what rooms/exhibits you want to see, as we did based on time constraints. It does get crowded, but the line to get in does move. Just be prepared to wait in line for a bit and the earlier you go, the better."
"Written October 6, 2016","""Lots Of Cool Stuff""","Although I don't share a lot of the explanations the museum puts forward in their exhibits, I still found lot to fascinate me and my boys. The Prehistoric Gallery was very interesting, as well as the galleries on marine mammals and all the other animals. My boys thought it was pretty cool and they enjoyed themselves a lot."
"Written October 6, 2016",This is an awesome museum!,"Lots to see, very well laid out in logical format. Many hands on displays and fun things for the kids to do. Great learning experience. Could easily spend all day there."
"Written October 3, 2016",Tourists who love museums/ natural history,"So so fantastic. Amazing buildings packed with so many wonderful well organised displays. The Treasures, fossils, gems/ minerals vault area, dinosaur and evolution of man areas were my favourites. A Must see. I hope to return in the future. Reputation as the worlds greatest natural history museum is justified."
"Written October 1, 2016",Absolutely Fantastic,Something for everyone!  We spent almost 4 hours and didn't see everything.  My 6 year old is a dinosaur enthusiast and we couldn't believe the amazing displays.  The building itself is truly an incredible work of art.  Can't believe it has FREE admission!
"Written October 1, 2016",Free fun day out for all to see and learn,"The dinosaur exhibition was excellent. Don't miss out on the blue whale, which is enormous. Will be going back again as it was a great day out. "
"Written October 1, 2016",Interesting,That was absolutely fascinating and attractive. There was an incredibile variety of  scenarios and masterpieces. Very well done!!!
"Written September 30, 2016",Astoundingly good,"Prepare for your jaws to drop. Just amazing the collection of species here. Spent a couple of hours here. Wish there were more dinosaur fossils! Bit of a lineup outside (probably took 30-40 mins to get in), but well worth it! The shop doesn't have a wide selection. Excellent range of historical artefacts to admire and appreciate. "
"Written September 29, 2016",A Smattering of Everything,"A classic museum to be sure, and there's a little of everything here, which may be its only drawback.  For example, there are dinosaur exhibits, but not as extensive as other museums that specialize in dinos (e.g. Drumheller, BC Canada).It is free, and the lines to get in on a Sunday morning were not that bad.  In fact we sat on a nearby bench and waited for the line to almost disappear before we went in."
"Written September 29, 2016",cathedral to science and the history of science,"This is an extraordinary experience. We have been to visit a number of times, the most recent just last week. I would recommend coming on one occasion to just look at the building itself. It resembles a cathedral more than a science exhibit. The wonderfully carved columns and the magnificent stained glass windows are just the beginning. Enjoy the ceilings and the staircases."
"Written September 26, 2016",dinosaur to bird fossil,"Close to a London tube station. Nice statues and sculptures, planetary and vulcanism displays. Japanese earthquake shake room fun for kids. "
"Written October 14, 2016",Always a classic ,Second trip to London in the last year from Scotland. This venue remains a permanent fixture during any trip with the kids. A little disappointing to discover that they have removed the little adventurer pack. Aside from this a free activity in London is rare to come by. Always great for all ages and well located. Will definitely return. 
"Written October 11, 2016","Best for children, skip if you're adults","Definitely a must go if you have young children. Don't bother if with teenagers and adults. The biology section was interesting but the exhibits were very old. Was a flashback from the 90s.. The dinosaur section was quite cramped with most of the dinosaur bone exhibits suspended above you. They had exhibits on: mammals, biology, dinosaurs, underwater creaturesMost were still displays and not the high tech interactive displays we see in newer exhibits."
"Written October 10, 2016",Great displays,Very interesting and informative displays. Having visited loads of dinosaur sections of museums still found new and interesting facts. 
"Written October 9, 2016",wonderful museum - and available to all without charge,Our last day in London was rainy and a perfect day to explore a museum.  It is all interesting but we particularly liked the section on earthquakes and volcanoes.
"Written October 9, 2016",You cant go wrong here.,"What can i say, this place is wonderful.  You can easy spend a whole day here if you spend your time looking over the exhibits.  Easy to get to, right next to a tube entrance.      Make sure you go in via the old main entrance so you get to see ""Dippy"" the huge Brontosaurus.I could keep going back here time and time again.  Take the kids, the wife, the girl or boyfriend and enjoy a day there. "
"Written October 9, 2016",Great building ,"This was the first museum I ever visited in London, probably stimulated by my nieces good review. I really loved the gothic building! Not particularly a science person but could also appreciate some of the content  ;) Avoid the weekend if you can, even in January it was packed with people. "
"Written October 8, 2016",Such a Cool Place,"I have to admit, I love natural history museums so I'm a little bias. I've been to the ""biggies"" in the US and while each are different and special, the London Museum really isn't to be missed. The is a big place, plan to walk a lot and spend several hours during your visit. If you visit any of the special exhibits (the photography awards are not to be missed and start on Oct 21st) you should probably plan to spend 4-5 hours here. The Darwin museum attached is a really interesting part of the visit. Take some time just to take in the architecture of the buildings. Free to get in, special exhibits have a cost."
"Written October 8, 2016",The most beautiful Natural History Museum in Europe,"You will like this museum because there are so many things to see, to learn, to play... yes playing :-) (you'll know why if you're going there).This museum are good for children, students, adults."
"Written October 8, 2016",Brilliant fun ,"Great place to spend a blustery day, get there early because the question are insane!! Once in the architecture of the actual building itself is amazing like something from Harry Potter! Instantly greeted with a dinosaur skeleton and the other rooms have just as much to offer.There are rooms full of books and taxidermy animals, rows of shells and crystals in wooden glass fronted cases and a mechanical dinosaur which the children seem to love.Brilliant for kids and big kids alike!!! "
"Written October 7, 2016",Be aware before booking for Dino-Snore,"My son and Grandson (age 6) visited Dino-Snore on 24th September '16.  Added in to the £60 each fee for the overnight stay was the return train fare from Wales - not an inexpensive adventure.  Doors opened at 7.30pm to FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE!  An evening 'snack' had to be taken from home, plus sleeping bags, toiletries etc.  Staff to customer ratio was 2 to 50. The breakfast provided was a very inadequate muffin, tiny yogurt, a cup of tea for grown-ups and a carton of apple juice for children.  Toilet facilities had to be queued for - particularly last thing at night and first thing in the morning.  Basically, it was a very expensive, unsatisfactory overnight stay, doing things that could have been done for free during the day.  Numbers were overwhelming and a rip-off for the price."
"Written August 30, 2016",What an amazing place for all ages,What an amazing place for all ages. My kids enjoined from every minute in the museum and it's free. Dont miss it 
"Written August 25, 2016",Go!  It's FREE!,Crowded but FREE...how could you go wrong!  My kids especially loved it here with lots to see and look at!
"Written August 24, 2016",Use the side entrance!,"We visited on a Sunday lunchtime and there were crowds spilling out of the tube station to get to the Museum. There were some museum guides advising to use the side entrance as there were no queues - and we walked straight in! Inside it was really busy, but we got some great pictures by the Diplodocus. We walked around the Dino exhibit just after 3pm and it was less crowded there. The animatronic T Rex was very noisy and a great watch. The human body exhibit was enjoyable, but some of the interactive parts were broken.The blue whale was impressive but it was too busy to see properly. My two children were quite taken with a very 80s interactive demo of how heat affects humans and camels.We will definitely return here, outside of school holidays when we can have a good look around with hopefully less crowds! We are so lucky to live in a country where gems like this museum are free for all to attend. "
"Written August 20, 2016",Great place for 3- to 7 year-olds,"My kids love the NHM. The dinosaur skeletons, the mammal and bird galleries, the creepy-crawly and the all rest is just a big treat for young kids.  And it's free!  If you go there in the winter, you can also enjoy the ice-ring.  Highly recommended."
"Written August 18, 2016",It is huge,Don't plan to do anything else the same day as you come to this place because it is gigantic. Me and my husband spent 4 hours there and couldn't finish the whole thing. 
"Written August 18, 2016",One of the Great Museums of the World,This is one of the finest museums in the world. Filled with natural history exhibits that delight and surprize. The main hall is dominated by a skeleton of a huge dinosaur that somehow fits the architecture of the building. The dinosaur exhibit itself is filled with information and anamatronic displays that make you believe that you just stepped into the world of 75 million years ago. Modern day animals are not neglected either and the skeleton of a blue whale hanging over your head to give you a sense of the tremendous size of these creatures. A London must-see!
"Written August 18, 2016",Worth a visit,"I recommend the visit even if you're not particularly interested in natural history: the building is awesome, both outside and inside. Admittance is free, we just had to stand in a queue for about 20 minutes, and it's high season. It's one of those huge museums you should visit more than once to see it all at ease, but if, like me, you're staying in London for a short holiday you need to walk around to have a general idea. Kids appreciate the section on dinosaurs very much, and the hall with the big mammals. For adults, I would recommend also going on the second floor to see the giant sequoia section and the ceiling decoration, then go down a few steps to the first floor, walk along the minerals rooms and stop at the end: in The Vault you can see diamonds, stones and meteorites.I liked also the animals in vases in the Darwin section.We were too tired to appreciate the section on human kind or to go out in the garden, next time."
"Written August 16, 2016",Amazing day out with our three young boys! ,What a great place! Our three very young lads had a ball.  We were there 6 hours! Very helpful friendly staff! There's something for everyone. Highly recommended. 
"Written August 15, 2016",Great place and so much to see,"we visited mid week and so glad we got there when it opened , only had to wait 20 mins and in by 10:10 , got in the dinosaur bit and managed to get round a few areas before it started to fill up.Have to say we ate in the museum and was impressed with quality and price , same thing with the shop , plenty of things to buy that were not over priced . The queue when we left at midday was crazy so be warned and go as early as you can manage so worth it !!"
"Written August 14, 2016",Beautiful Building,What a beautiful setting for a museum!  We spent hours wandering around and viewing the exhibits.  This is a very crowded venue so be prepared to wait in line to get in.  The exhibits were geared more for older children and adults.  Admission is free so you can't really complain.
"Written September 18, 2016",One of the Classics!,"If you like Natural History museums, don't miss this one!  One of the best, with extensive collections- and even the food at the cafe is fantastic!"
"Written September 17, 2016",Fantastic place to visit,"This Museum is a must if you are visiting London,we were on a tight schedule,so only spent around 2 hrs here but you could make a day of it easily.We were there early so didn't have to queue  but when we left the queue's were very long.It was free to enter but I understand you will have to pay in the future,so check before you go.The dinosaurs are unbelievable,so many interesting & educational things to see & do.I am so glad I visited it was part of a great day out."
"Written September 13, 2016",So amazingly interesting! ,"This is such a cool museum! We didn't have much time, still spent over two hours here but didn't really make a dent, there are still many things I want to see! It was free and we saw dinosaur bones and a lot on the earths history. There was also a cool bit on memory and perception. We had to watch a video of a robbery and then they went back and asked different questions to see what we remembered! "
"Written September 8, 2016",Totally Fantastic Visit. Great Coffee and indoor picnic area,"We cannot praise the Museum enough for a fantastic visit. Be prepared to queue, and if possible avoid school holiday times, it is still really busy but the queues are not unbearable. The best bits for us were of course the dinosaurs, the stairs, ( if you have visited before as a child you will know what I mean) the coffee in the small coffee shop, served by a very pleasant young man,, going up the escalator through earth was excellent and looked slightly surreal and finding the indoor picnic area,, which was a little oasis of calm, perfect for families on a tight budget as you can bring your own picnic and still enjoy all the facilities of the museum."
"Written September 8, 2016",One of My Favourite Places in London,"History, Nature all under one roof. Best to visit in the winter (summer is a madhouse) - check what exhibits are on, and bring the whole family --- one of the best museums in the world within walking distance to so much "
"Written September 8, 2016",Enjoyable,This museum is very informative and would be a great place to take your kids! I went with my friends and really enjoyed it and acknowledged how enjoyable a child would find it! Free admission makes it a great day out as well as you don't have to worry about gathering costs.
"Written September 5, 2016",Definite must-go if you have the time - worth the while,Very extensive museum - probably need most of a day to visit it if you want to see everything. I would say this attraction should be a must-go if you are in London and have the time. Very extensive dinosaur collection - children absolutely love it. Beautiful building (recently modernised and extended too) and easy to get to by public transport (tube - South Kensington tube station/bus).
"Written September 4, 2016",Great day,It's free and informative some great artifacts to see and imagine yourselves submerged in the time when some of these things walked the earth.

"Written August 31, 2016",Absolutely  Awesome!,"From the moment you enter  and are greeted by  the amazing  dinosaur, you know you're  in for a real treat!  The recreations of the dinosaurs  and the other exhibits are astoundingly  good.  I loved photographing  in this museum, got some great shots.  It's a lot to see, so pace yourself."
"Written August 14, 2016",Busy But A Must See,"I travelled here during February half term which I found out on the day is their busiest week in the year. If you want to avoid the queues, get there as close to 10am as possible and just be prepared for a bit of waiting around. We stayed for around 5 hours and only got around 1/3 of the museum, partly due to it being so busy but really down to the fact that it is just so vast. A fantastic and spell binding place, especially for the children. "
"Written August 11, 2016",Beautiful museum,"The Natural History museum is in an incredible building which has tonnes of character. It was very busy when we visited, a bit too busy (about 1pm) would be best to go after 3pm to have the best experience. For a free museum it is well worth a visit. "
"Written August 11, 2016",WOW! My Favorite,"If you like nature, Dinosaurs, Darwin this is a must goAmazing place!Save at least 4 hours to spend inside, you will need it, this place is just awesome! Unbelievable!!!!"
"Written August 11, 2016",Recommend the David Attenborough VirtualReality Experience,"The NHM is wonderful.  We wanted to avoid the queues so arrived at 3pm; pretty much walked in!  We had booked fore the David Attenborough virtual reality trip (Book online) and it was amazing---throughly recommend.The great thing about the NHM is you can simply 'dip in and dip out' so children don't get bored and over-faced.  Like eating an elephant, the NHM is best consumed in small chunks..!"
"Written August 11, 2016",Amazing,We arrived late and could only fit in one exhibition.  We went for the dinosaurs.  It was fab and I will definitely be back.
"Written August 7, 2016",Great for a late night trip,I happened to be able to go at 9:00 on a Friday night which was perfect for me.  Intense science experience.  Great dinosaurs.  Loved the earthquake experience.  Long queues and kids during the day so lucking into a night it was open was great for me.
"Written August 6, 2016",Great for Children,A great museum and very good for children with lots of activities and displays aimed at a younger audience.  Huge queue to get in - it took about 40 minutes to get inside which was far too long.  Seasonal areas do cost more and during our visit there was a large greenhouse type of building that you had to pay to go into but were then surrounded by butterflies. 
"Written August 5, 2016",Brilliant for children of all ages,Took our 5 year old here for the first time. When you get there expect a large queue to get in. I'm guessing you need to get there about 9:30 to get in quickly when it opens at 10. We got there about 10:15. That said the queue did move fairly quickly. We were in by 11:00. Inside you are face to face with a diplodocus. Expect children to start getting a little bit excited.We only had a short time to spend in there so naturally we headed for the dinosaurs. This is probably the most visited area and it showed. It was very busy but you get to see everything a small boy would want. We had lunch here. The cafe in the entrance hall was pretty poor. There was a choice of ham sandwiches or you could have ham sandwiches. No other sandwiches to be seen. That's not really useful when you have a child who won't eat ham. I'm sure vegetarians were thrilled as well. So we went to the restaurant which was great. The others went round the creepy crawlies while I stayed a safe distance away. It sounded like a great exhibition if you like that kind of thing. There is a handling area which we didn't have time to go to but we did get to hold a dinosaur bone. Highlight of my trip but a bit lost on a small child. The museum is massive. We hardly scratched the surface. To go round it all properly would take days or probably weeks. A must for children who love dinosaurs. 
"Written August 4, 2016",Loved it,What can I say.  I loved it.  You could spend days in here.  Great for school age children.  Lots to keep their attention and interest
"Written August 3, 2016",A Must See in London,"Iconic museum. Brilliant and magic space, starting with its beautiful building. Its a fantastic experience, specially with children. Undoubtelly a must see in London."
"Written October 20, 2016",A true British gem,"We have been coming here for years as a family, often with grandparents, extended family and friends in tow. The building is an architectural delight and would be worth visiting for its own merit as such! The dinosaur exhibition is of course one of the main highlights; there are so many other amazing exhibits too, that are explained in a really interesting and engaging way - for children of all ages and for us adults too!We have been to many of the special exhibitions, the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibitions and the Butterfly house, when it's on. All of them have been so very interesting and intellectually stimulating. There is even a little nature garden with educational aspects to it to the left of the building and of course the lawns to picnic on, should you wish to in good weather.A top tip from our family would be to take the annual membership if you're likely to go more than once, or with a larger family/friends. For a very reasonable price, you receive quarterly magazines, including for the children and free entry to all of the paid special exhibitions, of which there are several each year. There are several other perks and for us, jumping the huge queues, during holiday season and walking straight up the front stairs, had to be one of the most enticing!The proximity to other favourite, iconic museums, the National Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert museum, is another draw as you can split up if people have different interests, or spend literally all day in 2 or 3 of them. Wishing you a wonderful visit."
"Written October 19, 2016",Enjoyed my visit,"Although I visited the museum by my self, I would very recommend it to families with children.I'll sure bring my young boy with me when we'll visit London together next time.Very interestingand exciting stuff  for people who interested in nature and animals."
"Written October 18, 2016",a nostalgia trip,"My first visit was when I was 3 or 4 and I was impressed then my nan told a story about the skeleton dinosaur coming to life ( in 1976 - way before 'Night at the Museum!') and I am glad to say 'Diny' is still the centrepiece. I was a little disappointed that we now have to follow the rope system to view him so visit 'off peak' if you can! I've been a few times since the 1970's, with my own son, and it's still a fascinating place, full of the nostalgia of the Victorian era with the 'things in glass cases' and traditional grandeur. It's exhausting and you need to do it in two halves - you definitely need more than one visit because after a while you get 'museum fatigue' so pick your favourite sections to really focus on if this is a one off visit! You have to queue to get in at any time but if it looks daunting don't worry - it moves fast."
"Written October 18, 2016",Educational,"We went to the Natural History Museum on a somewhat chilly day, so it was an excellent place to be.  There was a special butterfly exhibit on the grounds, all within a heated tent (and it was warm - I'm from Florida and had to take off my jacket).  The exhibits in the museum were very well done.  There is an outdoor garden and at the time we visited there were grazing sheep there taking care of the ""lawn"" - no gas powered mowers here.  Quite enjoyable, followed by the V&A Museum just across the street."
"Written October 18, 2016",Kids..... Big and Little,"This was amazing and fun and informative. The dinosaurs, the special exhibits, the actual buildings and the grounds..... Do not miss this venue."
"Written October 17, 2016","Great visit, but don't go to the restaurant if your on a tight schedule ","The museum was pretty impressive. We had to queue for about half hour for entry (as expected for a free museum) on a Sunday morning. It's well laid and information for both adults and children alike. The building itself is just stunning, just look at the detail in the brickwork whilst waiting in the queue, it's beautiful. We went to the restaurant for dinner whilst there. Whilst the food was ok, the service was lacking and on 2 occasions I had to ask for our desserts to be delivered, we were sat in the corner and we seemed to be invisible for nearly an hour!  "
"Written October 17, 2016",Great free attraction ,If you want a free educational excursion this is the place to go wonderful exhibits and if you aren't too sure there are staff to point you in the right direction.  This place is close to the tube and buses
"Written October 16, 2016",Awesome,"Housed in a stunningly beautiful vast building, entry is free.There is so much to see and do you will need at least 4 hours to run around like an adult child and there are plenty of restaurants and shops to make up for that lack of entrance fee. There are live experiences and educational talks throughout the day, from toddler age upwards, children will be amazed with the experience.I would recommend arriving by public transport as parking in the area will cost a lot."
"Written October 15, 2016",Funny!,Very funny!!! We spent three hours as a blink. It is also very educative for school children and teenagers. The dinosaurs appear as if they were going to catch you!
"Written October 14, 2016",Absolutely brilliant place!!!,"Loved every bit of it!!! Need to go back and spend more time there. Excellent place for the kids a lot of interactive displays which pleased the kids very much. And with free entry is really good value for money. Ate at the restaurant food was ok and not too expensive, but there is a picnic area indoors if raining to those who which to bring some nibbles! Did pay to see the exhibition although this i thought was not that good for the money paid. Otherwise a very positive experience."
"Written August 1, 2016",Excellent experience ,"Loved this, lots to see and interact with. They even have a life sized t rex. We went with teens and they found it just as interesting. "
"Written August 1, 2016",Great every time,We live 5mins away and go quite a few times a year as we all love the place. Obviously Dino are is the highlight and the Blue Whale. You can liaise a day here easily. 
"Written August 1, 2016",the collection is very interesting,"a huge place to be in and enjoy, but was very crauded when we visited so come early as possible. the kids were very interested cause the diplay is unusual and diverced"
"Written July 31, 2016",We love it let Dippy continue to greet you as you arrive! ,This is a fantastic place. I remember going as a young school boy and now at 50 am taking my young boys who love it. Every time we go to London it's the first place they want to go. The dinosaur area is their favourite but there is so much to see and learn. It compare to the natural history in NY. If ever in Manchester need to go to Manchester museum not as grand as this place but kids of all ages and parents will love it. 
"Written July 27, 2016",Fantastic Museum,"The Natural History Museum is something of a national treasure. Sure, it's in a building that was designed a long time back and might not be entirely fit for purpose, but that merely adds character to any visit.Like many of the attractions around London the Natural History Museum is free to visit. This can be a bit of a double edged sword, as it gets very busy during the summer months. If you can visit out of season or aside from peak times the museum has lots to offer.I have vivid memories of visiting the museum as a child. At this point the large dinosaurs stick out in my memory, as does the huge whale. As I've grown older different areas of the museum now interest me and I semi-frequently visit the museum to check in on favourite exhibits.If you have a family and are visiting London this should be towards the top of your list of places to visit. It's also worth noting that the Victoria & Albert Museum is across the road, and the the Science Museum is next door; this means that you can easily fill a whole day visiting three of the best museums on the planet and walk virtually no distance between each venue."
"Written July 21, 2016",Plenty to Occupy all Ages,"Took 2 Grandchildren and our eldest son.  Plan you timings and which door you go through and you will avoid the queues.  Have a plan of Must see, would like to see, not bothered and get around and see them.  Catering a little ""cattle market"" but OK.  The stars of the show are the exhibits, old and new - The whales (especially large blue) and dinosaurs are not to be missed"
"Written July 19, 2016","Excellent, but avoid for lunch!","We took my eight year old son here midweek, thinking it would be quiet! It was very busy, but very enjoyable for all of us. My son was fascinated by the interactive exhibits, particularly the dinosaur area. The only down side was where to eat lunch. We headed for the picnic area which was a dark basement. We then found every table was reserved for schools and the benches were busy. It should be clear that the picnic area is for schools and there should be another area for the public to sit as you cannot eat your own food in the cafes. "
"Written July 17, 2016",History - Good for Throwback!,"It would be nice to turn our head to our past and refresh what the world really was? Yes, this museum is such a good help, for learning and quality bonding for family and friends. It was a nice visit."
"Written July 16, 2016",Nothing special,"This museum is free which makes it very busy. We visited on a rainy day and evidently plenty of families with children had the same idea. The crowds notwithstanding, I didn't find this museum particularly interesting, although the building itself is beautiful and visitors with children may feel differently. There is a lot to see but I didn't feel the educational aspect was very successful or engaging."
"Written July 16, 2016",London 2016,"Excellent attraction, we go every time we're in London, and discover something new every time. My son loves this museum! "
"Written May 25, 2016",Best ever museum,"To start with, it's a stunning building. If you have children then you owe it to them to visit the dinosaurs. Not just skeletons (awe inspiring as the are) but animated T Rex! Thrilling for all. Just an adult? Then explore the educational stuff - human history is a must see. The other good thing is that there are really good places to eat, varied menu, inexpensive and plenty of room. When you're absolutely exhausted but educated you can head for nearby Kensington Gardens for rest."
"Written May 24, 2016",FREE to do in London. Great for dinosaur lovers.,"If you are a fan of dinosaurs this is a must see! There is a exhibition soley dedicated to dinosaurs. It is full of interesting facts for adults too and not just for children. There are real dinosaur bones as well as models and animated models. There are also plenty of models you can touch -models of dino teeth, skulls and tusks. I Particularly enjoyed the mammal exhibition with stuffed animals(not as creepy as it sounds) and huge model of a blue whale. Very educational in a fun way.  "
"Written May 19, 2016",Great Museum,"I had a great time at this museum and loved it more than I expected. The dinosaur exhibition was awesome! The fact that it is also free to get in is a bonus. Definitely worth a visit, particularly if its a rainy day!"
"Written May 19, 2016",Natural History Museum,"Wonderful museum for the whole family, young and old.  We have visited many times over the years.  I would strongly recommend for those who have never been before, especially with young families."
"Written May 17, 2016",You must not miss it with or without kids,"Probably the best natural history museum in the world with plenty of activities, unique specimen, videos, experiments and much more. You would never leave and would go back over and over again."
"Written May 12, 2016",Wonderful Museum!,"This is a top notch museum with fantastic exhibits in an exceptional building.  Because it was so close to our hotel, we made this our first stop upon arriving in town.  The grassy open space makes for a perfect picnic spot, but there are places to buy food inside, too.  We spent only a few hours here and skipped the very expensive butterfly exhibit (at an extra cost), but we loved this stop and would recommend it to anyone - especially families with younger children."
"Written May 11, 2016",dragged here but glad i went,"my girlfriend wanted to go here when we were on a short break to London, cant say it was on my priorty but I was really glad I did very very interesting and informative, plenty of fun facts and games to do as well, kids would love it."
"Written May 9, 2016",Nice and interesting,"A lot's of dinos (sceletons, modells) and natural stuff (birds, volcano, life size whale modell, etc.) can be seen here.Especially for kids it's top level fun for sure."
"Written May 6, 2016",Crowds - but dinosaurs are the draw!,"I entered from the Exhibition Rd (side) entrance and went straight up (dramatic entrance!) to the volcanoes and earthquakes exhibit, which was well done, especially the Kobe Earthquake simulator. I then went through the other floors on that side, but as I moved westward toward the dinosaurs and other fossils, it really began to get exciting. What a collection, and what a setting. Don't miss the full-sized animated model tyrannosaurus as it goes through its day!"
"Written April 28, 2016",Very interesting for all ages,The offer is surprisingly large and varied for a free entry! The dinosaur section is especially well designed. The building is beautiful and carries the feel of the institution. 
"Written June 10, 2016",Good activity,"We enjoyed the visit.But we where also lucky to see the Butterfly exhibition outside. We recommend that one. We been in the valley of butterflies in Rhodes Island, we did see only few butterflies. Here we did walk amongst a thousand beautiful ones. The museum itself is maybe a bit outdated on how they present things, and more fun for school aged children, but we made it fun anyways for our small ones 2&5 years. Educational for us adults that need to take some dust of our school day's. Nice cafe and rest areas. The stairs can be a bit trouble for the stroller, and elevators a bit crowded at the popular day's. The building and architecture itself is also very appealing and atmosphere as it should in a museum. Free entrance to museum. Butterflies costs a few pounds pr. person . But defiantly worth every penny. Enjoy a good old museum, we recommend it.  "
"Written June 9, 2016",A visit to the Sensational  Butterfly exhibition was high on our list of priorities,"We heard so much about this wonderful exhibition in the center of London. It would please the family in particular my 6 year-old granddaughter. In the end I think the adults enjoyed it even more. The butterflies are contained in a specially constructed double skin tent which, (when on entering,  you'll feel the  damp and  hot air and beware, camera lens gets fogged up initially),   is sprinkled  with colourful and exotic fluttering butterflies.There are plenty of signs informing the visitor all there's to know about the transformation of the chrysalis into a beautiful butterfly,. Allow yourself to be at one with these beautiful little creatures which come primarily fronm  Africa, Southeast Asia and North and South America,"
"Written June 9, 2016","So much to see,and its free.","Great place to go,with kids or without and best of all its free admission.You need to leave yourself a day to see everything as there is so much to see and do.There are heaps of eating places inside with a variety of food choices.Get there when the doors open,get yourself a map and enjoy a wonderful museum."
"Written June 5, 2016",For the kids,"This is a fairly old fashioned museum and, while it is probably worth the visit with kids, as an adult, I would definitely not queue to visit again."
"Written June 3, 2016",Great museum,"We went on a busy holiday weekend. We were pleased with the quality and amount of attractions, small line, and cost (free!!). Definitely make time to see ancient artifacts!"
"Written June 3, 2016",Building or the artifacts--which is more amazing?,"Awesome, awesome awesome.Not sure if the artifacts or the building is most impressive.Fossils, taxidermy, full animal and dino replicas & skeletons, etc. Also has a first edition of ""Origen of species""  Thank you Charley D!"
"Written May 31, 2016",Outstanding museum with an amazing dinosaur collection ,"My family and I visited the Natural History Museum on the May Bank Holiday Weekend.This is a fantastic museum for both kids and adults alike. The dinosaur collection is excellent, and they also have a roaring, moving T Rex!There is a comprehensive mammal section including a huge whale. There is also an escalator through the earth to levels including an earthquake simulator.All the above are free. There are also a number of additional exhibitions that incur a charge. We went to the butterfly exhibition (live butterflies in a tent) which cost £22 for a family ticket. It's a little pricey for what it is, but everyone thoroughly enjoyed. If you live in London there are some membership options that are reasonably priced and provide access to the paid exhibits, queue jump entry and 10 passes to give to friends and family to have free access to all the chargeable exhibits. Overall this is one of the best museums I have ever visited and I heartily recommend it to all, and especially if you have kids who like dinosaurs. "
"Written May 29, 2016",Disappointing visit,"Went back to the natural history museum after a 15 year gap and was very sad to see that most of the exhibitions haven't been modernised or refreshed with the most up to date information on subjects. Many of the interactive displays were incredibly old and dated and were from the 80/90'sHowever we did take a behind the scenes tour which was fantastic, showing preservation methods preserved fish/Mammals including a 15ft squid along with Darwin's personal collection.General facilities of the museum were good with the cafes offering decent food."
"Written May 27, 2016",Very suitable for children,"Excellent museum with an exhibition about dinosaurs (there is a full size model of the T-Rex), stuffed animals and minerals."
"Written May 27, 2016",Natural History Meuseam,Good for the kids. It has a dino section. I recommend you bring the kids there. On Exibition Road and Cromwell Road.
"Written July 15, 2016","Absolutely, and in every way, completely appaling - Give it a miss and go to the Science Museum right next door","Shocking - That such a change could overcome such a once-wondrous placeHorrific - that such a change be allowed, uncheckedHorrifying -that no one stood in the way of this collapse of one of the modern wonders of the worldHorrible - that no one else seems to have noticed or made mention of this previously?Terrible - that the National Museum of Scotland knocks the NHM of London into a cocked hat; Awful - the behaviour of the brats running screaming around rooms and corridors with no teacher control or museum staff present to curtail such behaviour;Dreadful - the prices paid for x3 lemonades, a coffee and three slices of cake - £38(!) Ghastly - the preponderance of 'press this button' rubbish that was ridiculous, even if it were working, which 80% were notHideous - the dust that was atop the blue whale exhibit - truly, astonishing to behold, more so than the bloody whale;Horrendous - the loss of all of the sample cases of beautiful creatures to see and compare;  Frightful - the addition of an animatronic T-Rex  Atrocious - the waste of such a beautiful building  Abominable - that the entrance hall dinosaur was the only thing reminscent of the once magnificent museum that used to be... Abhorrent, outrageous, hateful, loathsome, odious, monstrous, nightmarish, heinous, harrowing, dire, vile, shameful, unspeakable, unforgivable, unpardonable; that I built up my children to expect such wonders as I had beheld 30 years ago and to then behold their polite confusion at Daddy's ramblings given the reality that was in front of them."
"Written July 13, 2016",Great exhibits for both adults and children,Lots of interactive and interesting exhibits and activities. Try to go early though as it gets busy. We particularly enjoyed the dinosaurs.
"Written July 13, 2016",Fantastic museum,Wonderful experience. Best museum we visited in london. Kids and adults alike were mesmerised. Would highly recommend a visit
"Written July 13, 2016",Great museum!,"This museum is similar to the New York version. Very interesting, specially for children. Free entry. Next to the Science Museum."
"Written July 8, 2016",Nice 👍,Near the museum there is Butterflies garden. It's so beautiful. And  the museum is so interesting you must to visit it both  
"Written July 4, 2016",Busy but brilliant,"An excellent way to spend a day, particularly for families as the museum offers much in the way of interactive displays from dinosaurs to human anatomy with games and things to press and touch. It is easy to get to on the tube as you come up literally by the main gate- I'd recommend starting early though as it gets very busy."
"Written July 2, 2016",Dinosaurs,this is a gem of a place  if nothing else the building is gorgeous inside  and they have an extensive collection for dinosaur fossils  loved seeing the fossils that mary anning found in the 1800s 
"Written July 2, 2016",An Amazing Day Out,I've been here before but this was the first time I have been with kids who were old enough to really appreciate this museum. It's such a fascinating place that it kept the kids interested and it goes on for ever so it's definitely a day trip. The queue to get in was long but moved fairly well. I can't believe it's free admission still so definitely donate on the way in. There's enough seating dispersed throughout the museum to take rest regularly. There's a couple of eating places within the museum - we ate at the cafe. A little bit pricey but this is London and the entrance is free so they need to raise money some way and I was happy with the quality which was very good. Many different exhibitions within the museum so won't go into detail on these but all good. Definitely a must do for anyone's London itinerary. 
"Written July 2, 2016",The museum,"It was very interesting to visit this museum. Free admission to enter, also free wifi. Great collection including the dinosaurs."
"Written July 1, 2016","Our past,present, and future. ","Interesting to walk through the ages of our world. I recommend starting with the geological exhibits and working your way through our past (Neanderthals, etc) and see our ancient ancestors. Then explore the animals and appreciate the wonders we've lost due to our negligence and appreciate why we must protect what we still have. Seeing taxidermy animals I can see alive is not extremely interesting or exciting but appreciating the extinct animals we've lost makes you realize our impact on the world around us. "
"Written September 25, 2016",Loaded Knowledge!!!,"If you are looking for a science adventure. This museum is a must in your list. From different kind of animals be it land, air, water, forest and many more, physics, human body, physiology are just some of the things you can explore. An entire day tour may be required in order to stroll the most part of the museum. Every age group from kids to adults will have their own experience by having a good time and learning something at the same time.It is not so difficult  navigate and is very accessible by public transport by bus or underground tube. And the best part is that it is FREE."
"Written September 25, 2016",Beautiful Building (and nice stuff inside),I could spend hours just admiring the gorgeous architecture (both inside and out). The dinosaur exhibit is obviously a must see. The cafe has a nice selection of sweets and sandwiches when you need a rest.  Lots of hands on stuff for the kid in all of us. 
"Written September 25, 2016",Wonderful place ,We've been many times and none of us ever get tired to the Natural History museum.  Every time we get to London we make sure to go on a weekday morning when it is not too crowded. 
"Written September 24, 2016","Medium museum, unless the precious stones up in the 2nd floor.","I liked the building and the big dinosaur skeleton, but the rest of the animals are the same that I have seen in many many other museums. The most spectacular for me in this museum were the precious stones, the gemstomes that I saw in the 2nd floor of this building. They are extraordinary, magnificent!!!!!! So you can skip the rest of the rooms and go upstairs first and see those beautiful stones. "
"Written September 23, 2016",A must Visit,"This museum is a must visit, the building itself is wonderful. It is a very easy museum to navigate your way around all colour coded. Would recommend going for when it opens and go to the dinosaur section first. It gets very busy there later on. Plenty of places to get something to eat and drink."
"Written September 21, 2016",London Must See!,"Amazing museum with so much to see! Must go, especially recommend for family with kids.  It's a beautiful museum and so educational for everyone interested in science and animals."
"Written September 21, 2016","Wow, just wow.",Words can not describe how much I love this museum. Only the building itself makes it worth the visit and I've actually lost count how many times I've been here. If I had to choose only one place to visit in London this would easily be it. 
"Written September 20, 2016",Make Sure You Go See the HUGE Blue Whale!,"Love this museum, I live locally in London and when we have visitors its the first place we go! Its loved by all ages and is absolutely massive! make sure you take a walk through the Dinosaurs exhibition and get a photo with Dippy in the main hallway. Not to mention you have to go see the giant blue whale and all his friends! If you London even just for short period I recommend you go visit. Preferably on early if on a Saturday. It can get very busy!"
"Written September 19, 2016",Memorable family visit.,"Our recent trip to London had,as one of its many highlights, a memorable trip to this museum.  Wonderfully laid out and so easy to move around.  The many exhibits  take you from prehistory to the present day.  The skeletons from millions of years ago combined with modern animatronics impact  on the imagination.  I particularly liked the volcano section.  Highly recommendable and great to combine with the science museum which is just alongside."
"Written September 19, 2016",Haven't been for 35 years,"Such an amazing place!Do not ignore the building - the design, architecture and funny items like the monkeys climbing the main internal arch.All day here with dinosaurs, animals, birds, planet earth and the new Cocoon exhibit.You will find something that interests you for sure - not to be missed."
"Written June 29, 2016",Into the Volcano,We drank in all the exhibits we visited in London but a high point this trip was the Volcanoes and Earthquakes exhiibition.  Who knew that looking at rocks could be so enjoyable.
"Written June 27, 2016",Amazing building. Easy to see why it is so popular,The building itself is stunning. It is for big kids and little kids alike. I highly recommend a visit. 
"Written June 22, 2016",Could Spend Days Here,"You have to be a museum person to enjoy this, obviously. I wouldn't say it's for everyone because I appreciate that not everyone enjoys walking around and looking at things. :) BUT. It's one of the most wonderful museums I've been to, and I couldn't believe it was free!! We paid for the butterfly exhibit, which was absolutely, completely magical and a must-do for anyone with a sense of whimsy. We also did the 3D water movie (sorry - I can't recall the name), but it wasn't that worth it. Cool concept, but could have passed. The stone exhibit was awesome, and the gems were gorgeous. We spent hours, could have spent hours more."
"Written June 21, 2016",Great exibhits but maybe more interaction?,"Not my first visit to the Natural history museum, and probably not my last. The exhibits are very impressive al though some parts (i.e. stuffed animals) look a bit dusty. It´s a great place to bring kids, especially between 4-10 yrs. Don´t be put off by the possibly long que outside. It moves quicker than you think."
"Written June 19, 2016",Amazing,This is a fantastic place for kids and grownups alike. Obviously the dinosaurs are the main attraction but the other areas are also fascinating - however don't expect to see it all in a day or even 10. We spent the afternoon there and made it around two areas. Architecturally the building is also stunning! 
"Written June 19, 2016",Visit of the Natural History Museum,"it is very interesting for any age people. It is possible to learn about human being evolution, animal species, types of earthquakes."
"Written June 18, 2016",This is a must,"Absolutely beautiful building and we are glad we came here to visit.  Our children really loved all the exibitis and are still talking about everything viewed, these memories will last them a lifetime - stunning."
"Written June 17, 2016",The kids absolutely love every part of it!,"I have visited couple of times with my boys/6,8 and11 yrs/ up to now, but the museum is so big that we'll defenatey make another visit. Every time there they are amaized and find it interesting. The building itself is gorgeous, when I step in I really love the feeling just walking inside. If You think that You can see everything in a day - that's absolutely not possible. I plan every our visit - looking at the map of the museum and choosing few exhibitions. First time there we visited the Dinosaurs and the Mammals. Next time we visited the Earth zone. The kids absolutely love every part of it!"
"Written June 16, 2016",Just pause before you go in.....,"Please take the time before you go in to look at this superb example of Victorian architecture. Finished in ceramic tiles to resist the then prevalent air pollution superb neo-Norman arches over the main south entrance, carved animals and beasts, a well proportioned building which is a gem in its own right.Sadly as so often happens money ran out too soon so the two additional wings were never built and the internal decoration was not completed.Inside is a collection to delight any child and every adult, take your time, at least two hours is a minimum need.Looks, cafes all good tho not cheap"
"Written June 12, 2016",Just Go there!,"Absolutely amazing... One of the best museums in the world, and FREE (although I encourage everyone to leave a suitable donation if you enjoy it).We try to take our children every time we visit London! There is something for everyone. The architecture of the building alone is worth the visit, but it also has loads of wonderful exhibits, and is very well laid out in individual halls so you can easily make your way to the ones you are most interested in.TOP TIP - use the side entrance to avoid the queues. Coming up from the tube station take your photos of the building then head up and along the street above/behind you to the little used side entrance. As long as it isn't school holidays (lots of locals in the know) - the side entrance normally has NO QUEUE, even when there are 100's of people lined up for the front entrance."
"Written April 28, 2016",Beautiful ,"Leaving in London and having a 4 year old, we've been here quite a few time and it's always a joy to visit and discover something new each time. The coffee place is good with delicious cakes. They also have kids lunch boxes. Amazingly rich architecture and contents. A must see."

"Written April 28, 2016",Breath taking,Finally get to see fossils of prehistoric animals. This museum is filled with lots of exhibits. Spent close to 3-4 hours around the museum checking out all the display. Worth the visit!
"Written April 28, 2016",Fantastic view.,It is top level of museum area in Europe(I think).Every thing are arranged for good feeling in this NHM.Thank for chance to see this marvelous trip.
"Written April 27, 2016",A Museum that will amaze anyone!,"This Museum is a good reason to spend some hours from your visit to London. As I didn't know the size of this museum, Ι thought 1-2 hours would be enough to see everything in it, but i was so amazed and intrested by the exhibits that i spent 4 hours. You get knowledge and history from all of the species on earth, the planet, natural phenomena such earthquakes and so much more. Great rooms and spaces such the one with sea mammals and the dinosaurs. I was really amazed! Sure, in my future visit to London city i will spend some time to see again Natural History Museum!"
"Written April 26, 2016",Amazing ,"All the tourist need to go in Natural History Museum, it's incredible! It was a good experience there, but you need came really early because it's to big, and in my opinion just one day isn't much to see all the details, all the pieces at the museum. "
"Written April 23, 2016",A London must do,"Avoid weekends due to crowds but if you have no choice, line up just before 10am openings. Spectacular interactive exhibits and a great place for children. A visit to ""The Restaurant"" will break the day up with excellent food, prompt service, at a reasonable price & alternate diets catered for."
"Written April 23, 2016",Guaranteed fun for kids,You can't go wrong for such a wide range of interesting things to do and see here. From volcano and earthquake action to the classic dinosaur collection. Some well needed Refurbs and upgrades seem to be in motion which is good to see.

"Written April 18, 2016",Good for kids,I took my son to see the dinosaur skeleton. They had a stegosaurus n another veggie eating dinosaur which was the biggest so far from their collection. Its a must go I think.
"Written April 18, 2016",Another massive museum. Spend a day here.,Great museum that has alot going for it. Make sure you visit the vault at the top floor to see some of the most rare and beautiful precious stones in the world. You come out of here with a massive appreciation for the natural world and this place is so big you could probably spend a week going about it and still not see everything.  Brilliant for large groups as well as the entrance is free. Just make sure you have some way of identifying them in the large crowds.  Well worth a visit.
"Written April 17, 2016",First visit,Excellently laid out exhibitions with activities. This is a place for the whole family as there is something for all ages. Learnt things about dinosaurs I never knew before.
"Written April 17, 2016",The Place To Go - Anytime Any Age,Went to the Natural History Museum yesterday and came in particular to see the dinosaur exhibition and we were not disappointed! Absolutely amazing! The building and architecture are an added bonus. Breathtaking and a piece of art in its own right. Went to the mammal section too. It was good and educational but maintenance of the area appeared pretty poor.
"Written April 17, 2016",Quick trip but excellent destination,The NHM is great for adults or children. I am a biologist and couldn't pass up a visit. The main Hall is beautiful in itself and the displays are breath taking. 
"Written April 17, 2016",Very interesting and informative,"The Natural History Museum's collections were built over centuries so there is a lot to see, give yourself several hours for a visit. This is a good activity for older children too. This is one of my favorite museums in the world, and I visit nearly every time I come to London."
"Written April 16, 2016",Rainy day exploration,This beautiful building houses an enormous amount of historical items.  You could wander around all day in there and not see everything.  Pick 2 sections and really immerse yourself in the time periods to get the full effect.
"Written April 16, 2016","So much to see and do, for free!","The Natural History Museum is in a beautiful building housing many taxidermy and model animals, exhibits, a dinosaur section and so much more.  You can spend hours exploring and learning here.  It is free so be prepared, there will probably be a queue."
"Written April 15, 2016",Very exciting and nice museum.  Worth a visit if you have kids but great for adults too.,"We went when it was a bank holiday and the lines at the entrance were long.  However, worth every second of that wait.  Amazing exhibits and very helpful and friendly staff inside if you happen to get lost :)  Beautiful architecture too !"
"Written March 18, 2016",A must,"Excellent place to spend a couple of hours away from the cold, the fossils are awesome my four year old son was trill, also the mammals exhibition is awesome they have a big wheal hanging!!   "
"Written March 18, 2016",Where is Trex?,"Was here with my 4 year old. We were in Science Museum first, and good thing that the museum closes later (at 5:45 p.m.). We went straight to the dinosaurs, and my son really enjoyed it. Last time we were here, some years ago, my husband and I remembered that there was a complete T-Rex. But we did not find it during our trip. The TREX we found this time, was a TREX moving model (and my little boy got a little scared).We also love the museum shop :)You need to buy the museum maps at 1 GBP. But at least there is no recommended donations."
"Written March 15, 2016","""Must be"" London attraction",so much to see also some interactive parts. Entry is free but a small donation is appreciated (and definitely worth!).
"Written March 12, 2016",Excellent day out! ,"I'm 26 years old and came for a day out with my friend. Simply had to experience it and I wasn't disappointed! Loved every second. There's so much to look at I'd definitely recommend going first thing in the morning. Queues can be long but we got inside within 40 mins. Lots of history, animals, dinosaurs, biology and more! Food in the restaurant was also excellent! Loved my day here! "
"Written March 11, 2016",Incredible,"Went to London for 2 nights, tried to squeeze in this place in the morning before our flight. Needs a full day in my opinion, incredible place. So many amazing exhibits, will go back down to spend my full day there. Love it."
"Written March 11, 2016",Worth visiting,"All the 3 major museums are just nearby each other, must visit all - Victoria and albert museum, science museum and natural museum - would highly recommend it."
"Written March 11, 2016",Great Free Attraction,My daughter loves Dinosaurs and the fact that the museum was close by to where we stay was a bonus. Wished we had spent more time here. with kids you have to be able to spend the whole day here. 
"Written March 10, 2016",London Holiday Great visit to natural History Museum,"Though New York will always be my favorite, London's NHM is a great visit and not to be missed.   Great restaurant, coffee shop and gift shops as well as exhibits."
"Written March 8, 2016",Awesome!,Seriously not to be missed. Amazing dinosaur exhibit. No excuse not to go. One of the best science museums in the world. 
"Written March 6, 2016",Great day,"If you have any budding explores , then this is where you take them to ignite that spark for the rest of their life's adventures a must for all of the family "
"Written February 18, 2016",Great day out ,"We had a fabulous day out with our children at the Natural History museum. The exhibits are amazing, my 6 year old son was in his element looking at the moon rock in the 'Treasures room' and the volcanoes and earthquakes exhibit. Couldn't fault any of the museum facilities or exhibits. Because the visit was in the school holidays it was extremely busy! It's a free, indoor activity so it will be busy in a winter school holiday. We got off the tube and walked the short journey to the museum, when we arrived there was a queue snaking up and down the road at both entrances. We chose the entrance opposite the V & A, we was told when we joined the queue that it would be at least 40 minutes until we got to the entrance.The queue was fast moving and it was a 40 minute wait. Everyone was in good spirits and what was behind the door far outweighed the queue. Be prepared to queue for the dinosaurs once inside also. It was 20 minutes when we joined the queue but we only waited 10 minutes. It was worth the wait.My boys absolutely loved the exhibit and the museum. Well worth a visit. "
"Written February 18, 2016",not another boring museum,Well organized and a whole unknown world to explore.We went for an hour or less and it ended for us leaving four and a half hours later with a promise to come back one day.
"Written April 5, 2016",A wonderful experience if you like natural history,"This museum is filled up with dinosaur skeletons, real bugs (not alive), fossils, a full size blue whale figurine (they're big!), animals, fishes, specimens in jars - it was amazing. No live animals inside the museum. Get there early, there is a long queue to get in, and from noon to about three PM, when we were there, there's a lot of other people there, so despite the building being huge, some areas (especially the dinosaur part) felt really crowded. Sometimes, you can even see scientists doing real work at the labs around the museum. There's also a part where, if you're lucky, you can ask the scientists questions about what  they're doing through a microphone, but, sadly, they were working somewhere else the day we were there. Suits both children and grown-ups alike - we went there as a 30+ couple with no kids, and we had a great time. "
"Written April 4, 2016",Solar system exhibition,Went to see the photographic exhibition on our solar system currently running - amazing photographs but Brian Eno's accompanying music a bit disappointing. 
"Written April 3, 2016",Still the best museum in the world,I remember visiting this museum as a kid many years ago and memories came flooding back when I took my son there last year. This is an amazing museum. It's huge. The atmosphere is great and there are always different exhibitions that children love. If you happen to be in London and want to take your kids on a really fulfilling trip then head to the natural history museum. Good museum shop for souvenirs and a cafe available so you can enjoy your lunch without leaving the premises. Strongly recommended. 
"Written March 29, 2016",Wow!,"Of all the times I've been to London, this was my very first visit to the Natural History Museum. My husband and I decided that this was one of the must-see places during our Christmas trip to London with our children because our daughter in particular loves science, dinosaurs, etc. The museum is located in South Kensington, getting there was really convenient. Two tube stops away to the South Kensington tube stop and underground walkway that basically led you to the entrance of the museum. We visited on Boxing Day (December 26) and made the mistake of arriving about 10:30 a.m. or so. There was already a long line to get into the museum, it moved rather quickly so it wasn't too bad but once you were inside, it was crazy crowded. The building itself is impressive as many buildings in London and the inside will leave you in awe as well. Exhibits were located in different sections which made it a lot less confusing. I think the highlight of our visit was going to the Dinosaur area...the huge brontosaurus (at least I hope it was a brontosaurus) skeleton was a fantastic way to start of the tour, the lines were long once again as it seemed like everyone in London was there but it kept moving and allowed us to take a ton of pictures of the kids in front of the skeleton. From there, you went into an area which housed all the dino exhibits, our kids absolutely loved that, you couldn't touch anything but just being able to see everything dinosaur related was a treat to them. We spent a total of 4 hours there but didn't get to see all the exhibits because of the number of people visiting that day that we were there. I would say on a non holiday visit, maybe 4 hours would have suffice, going on Boxing Day should have been a hint to us that we needed to allocated at least 6 hours to see all that this museum has to offer. Maybe the next time we're back in London, we'll stop by again but it definitely is a must see and best of all, it's FREE,  which in a place like London is very much appreciated!"
"Written March 28, 2016",Really nice natural history museum,This was my ten year old sons very favorite place we visited.  The line was very long.  Be sure to go early in the day.  We waited one hour to get into the museum and all the exhibits were very crowded.  
"Written March 28, 2016","If the NHM were a clothing item, it would be a pair of comfortable old slippers.","It's a while since I last visited the NHM and they have made significant investments in new exhibits and building extensions in that time. This is the first time we have visited as a family, with kids in the 6-12 yr old range and so it was interesting to see what they made of it.Many of the exhibits are as I remember them, but I was blown away by the quality of the Earth Hall and Geology exhibits as well as the Darwin Centre. The latter provides an overview of what it is to be a researcher and takes you through research methods and the lighter side of the peer-review process. It's very informative and well worth taking the time to understand properly, but as others note, it would be nice to have some friendly faces to talk town real life, rather than digitize the whole thing.Parts of the museum are showing their age. It's a little dogeared and scruffy in places, with some of the exhibits in need of serious refresh or replacement to bring them up to date, but more importantly, it's free.Packed and crazy with roving herds of diminutive school kids, it's exactly what you'd expect from a national museum. Don't expect peace and quiet, aside from outside in the Wildlife Garden. Don't forget to take in the majesty of Waterhouse's architecture when you get a chance."
"Written March 23, 2016",Great!!!,There are lots of sign around so you don't get lost and workers there to help you and talk to you about the exhibit. A fantastic place to go and very fascinating I had a great time. I have been twice and both times I have learnt something new. It's not only education but very fun!
"Written March 23, 2016",For adults and kids,Really enjoyed visiting the museum. A lot to see. I think it would be good to have a tour guide bring you along but it is easy to find your way around. I think definitely do it if you can. 
"Written March 21, 2016","Science fans, beware! :)",Wow!! This museum is simply amazing! As soon as you enter the door you can tell you are about to spend a good time deep in the science world! From fossils to Darwin's evolution of the species..you can easily spend most of your day inside this museum and have loads of fun & learning time. All of this is free but you can help by giving some money for the museum's maintenance. There are restaurants inside so you don't need to worry about going out and back again in the waiting line.
"Written March 19, 2016","Fun, Full day for Free","A full day can be lost in the museum as it is filled full of wonder. As a family the children who were all young, enjoyed every aspect. The attraction is free and provides fun for all the family. We went in the holidays and it was extremely busy so get there early otherwise expect a queue."
"Written February 17, 2016",Great day out,"What a place the kids loved it having a boy who is a big dinosaur fan this is the place to visit so much to see,leave a couple of hours to see everything and get there early as it gets very busy."
"Written February 16, 2016",Amazing Place to Visit!,"Absolutely breath taking building! Amazing features and statues of different creatures! Brilliant stuff for a free museum, high recommend you attend if and when you are ever in London, learned alot while I was there and took loads of photos! :)"
"Written February 15, 2016",Fantastic place,Fantastic place to go really enjoyed it had hours of fun they're seeing the history of evolution and everything really great fun would recommend
"Written February 14, 2016",Needed 2 days to see it all!!,"Wow what a place I've never seen anything like it on this scale. The building alone is a wonder to behold absolutely stunning architecture, the inside is just as breathtaking as the outside. For this I will overlook the loooooong queue to get in!! In all seriousness it was long, but moved quickly. It was well orchestrated in order to avoid bottle necking. Upon entry you cannot help but marvel at the sheer enormity of the place, especially when you are presented with the bones of a Diplodocus standing front and centre of the main entrance hall. We visited the dinosaur exhibit first, again there was a queue that moved quickly however the volume of people visiting meant the walk through felt more like IKEA on a Saturday so you couldn't really take it in, but it was impressive nonetheless. Our Dinosaur obsessed 3 year old was totally captivated so that's a plus!!There were a lot of really good exhibits, but my personal favourite was the large Mars like planet that had an escalator running through it, with huge expansive walls covered in constellations it really was impressive. There are plenty of places to sit down which is welcomed for the size of the place, there are also ample places for you to purchase food and gifts. We went on the first Sunday before half term so it was busy in London in general but as long as you expect that you should have a great time. "
"Written February 13, 2016",Superb exhibits but what a stunning building,Had a flying visit here earlier this week & would highly recommend it to others. The building is absolutely outstanding & the exhibits fantastic. Well worth a look.
"Written February 10, 2016",Wonderful experience through the beauty of our world,I use to visit the Museum once a year in combination with the exhibition of the wildlife photographer of the year. I feel always attracted by the different aspects of the nature that are collected and visible in the museum from the ancient marine reptiles fossils extremely well preserved to the tiny birds that often are we shown on beautiful paintings. The photo exhibition is also a great opportunity to not miss!
"Written February 4, 2016",A Must See for Anyone Visiting London,"It's big, it's extensive, it's interesting and it's free. Go and take a picture with the Giant Sloth. Bump into (not literally) a terror from the past, those oh-so-extinct dinolizards. And then just marvel at the amount of exhibits on different fields of natural sciences.Just go there and wander around. You won't be disappointed."
"Written January 30, 2016",Geweldig!,Really good museum. if you are travelling with children its a good oportunity to do something intersting for them and dont need to pay entrance. Take your time at this place because has a lot to see. Have fun!
"Written January 23, 2016",Must see,Absolutely amazing and well worth visiting. Could have spent three times longer in there than we actually did.The stewards at the entrance were a bit pushy for donations but the exhibits were well worth the small cost.
"Written January 19, 2016",One museum you have to go to!,"If there is but a museum you can go to, this is the museum to go to! Especially if you like dinosours!"
"Written January 18, 2016",Disappointing ,"I have visited the natural history museum in New York which was around $20 per ticket, I am glad we did not pay to use this museum. This museum was our first stop when we arrived in London and we soon discovered that the two main attractions (the blue whale and the dinosaur exhibition) were both closed for refurbishments. We understand work must be done at some point but what a silly idea to close both the big attractions at the same time. Cafe was simple. Toilets clean and restaurant facility also. Good interactive display for children however half the ""games"" were broken."
"Written January 16, 2016",Very good option for a rainy day,"London is a beautiful city and you have thousand of things to do. This museum is great for kids and adults.Extremely well documented with great pieces to be visited ( hominid skeletons, dinosaur skeletons...) very good option for visits with kids, they'll enjoy "
"Written January 14, 2016",Impresive place for free,Hard to do it better. An amaizing location where you blow your mind. Huge building full of history and collections. One must in London. 
"Written January 13, 2016",wonderful and free attraction,"shame blue whale was out, but super big dino bones were great....and of course this is the home of the wildlife photo of the year"
"Written January 6, 2016","Greay exhibits, very interesting!","We had a great visit to the Natural History Museum in London - the architecture is beautiful, really breathtaking. There are many exhibits to explore and look through and you could easily spend hours and hours here, everything was really interesting. We loved being greeted by the smiling diplodocus skeleton on arrival in the main entrance! He will shortly be going on tour and will be replaced by the blue whale.There were many school groups here when we visited, so some exhibits were a little crowded at times, but to hear and see the excitement of the school children was nice.There were lots of interactive displays and activities throughout the museum, which we enjoyed doing and would also be great for families and children.The museum is free activity this is fantastic, interesting and educational and is also close to other attractions nearby that would be worth a visit too."
"Written January 6, 2016",Even just pop in to look at the building,"Could spend the entire day in here. Unfortunately the amount of time we had in London did not allow for a whole day. Even if you don't like or don't have any interest in going to a museum, at least go to see the building. Probably my favourite building in the whole of London. And it's free! (A rare thing in London) "
"Written January 4, 2016",Splendid ,Not to missing if you are traveling to London with children . Free entrance  with suggested donation 5 pouds each. Very nice hold building plenty of interrsting thing . Impossibile to visit all. 
"Written January 1, 2016",Good,"Recommend to visit if first time in London, the stones and gems are lovely to look at... if you have a problem staff are always about went here during the day ques wasn't that long"
"Written April 15, 2016",Going the Darwin route,"There is so many positives from this visit, I don't even know where to start.I was there for watching two photo exhibitions, but ended up being in the dino section.The queues are endless, meaning you should be there before 11.00.I bought a ticket in a booth not far away from the adjacent tube station. This meant I could walk past the endless queue, and enter the museum with no fuss whatsoever.Great experience. Will definately be back."
"Written April 14, 2016",A nice place!,"I really liked this museum, mainly because of the dinosaurs, but they had alot of other cool stuff there too, alot of whales and underwater animals showed in their real size which was pretty impressive, and alot of rocks too. The only minus was the queues, but i mean.. Thats what you have to expect on these places"
"Written April 14, 2016",Fantastic and free,"With an impressive range of artefacts  on display, the museum is a must for all tourists. It is informative and educational but also highly interesting. Most importantly the museum is free of charge."
"Written April 13, 2016",Gorgeous Building!,"The ""very good"" rating is primarily from the beauty of the building.  It's not any better than the Smithsonian or the one in New York, but it's great for kids.  It has a large, moving T-rex that I'm sure scares the pants off little kids.  Along with the architecture is the history in this place.  The information about Darwin, the do-do bird, feuds between explorers (intercepting artifacts as they were shipped to the UK!), and the general destruction of habitats by the explorers, is all fascinating (yet unfortunate) stuff.  "
"Written April 9, 2016",Blast From The Past,"The Natural History Museum is the best museum in the world. There is so much to do and so much to see, for example: you can experience a mini earthquake, you can learn about the solar system, you can study Earth's rock formations, you can learn about reptiles,dinosaurs and sea creatures such as The Blue Whale, eat at the Museum's restaurant and enjoy the museum's souvenir shop and there is also a shop for the kids. I would recommend going early in the morning as there is no queue and you get to see more of the museum. Out of ten, I would rate it a ten."
"Written April 7, 2016","Overcrowded, 3h queues, not worth it","Went to the museum on a Saturday morning, so expected it to be a bit crowded. Once we came to the museum entrance, we saw a massive queue, which we were told it was for the paid exhibition. Thinking that the normal queue will go faster, we decided to join the regular visitors queue. Worst mistake! We were standing outside in the rain and cold for nearly 3 hours. Once we got inside, it was impossible to move around or see any exhibits with the amount of people that were there! It create a massive congestion and it took us 30min to go from one section to another - ridiculous! I'm giving it 2* because the T-Rex and Kobe earthquake simulator were quite impressive. Other than that - the museum should really invest in either some policies to ease congestion or to update their website regularly saying whether it'll be a busy day or not."
"Written April 7, 2016",An Incredible Museum!,"This is one of those museums that can ""touch"" even the heart of somebody who doesn't enjoy wandering inside such buildings. Dinosaurs, the beginning of earth, human body, space... this place has everything. Incredible collections of historical artefacts....exhibitions that will amaze you...!"
"Written April 6, 2016",Perhaps the greatest museum of natural history in the world!,"This beautiful museum, set in an awe-inspiring stone building is stunning inside and out!

Look out for the dinosaurs!"

"Written April 5, 2016",It has Dinosaurs - what else is there to say? It has lots of other stuff!,The museum itself is an amazing piece of architecture. The dinosaurs themselves do not occupy a vast amount of the space but they get you in and then there are so many other things to see.And it has a café so relax with a sandwich and a beer (they also sell coffee etc.).
"Written December 29, 2015",Plenty To Discover,"The place has different sections of interest and caters to people of all ages - young or old. There are exhibits and information on dinosaurs, planetary system, fishes and animals, precious stones, mammals, birds, and so much more. There is also a cafetera within the museum. It was a wonderful visit and it was a great learning experience having gone through the exhibts at this large museum."

We spent well over 3hrs in this museum and time just flew by. Everything felt modern, thought-through and wellmade. The building is which houses the museum is stunning aswell. A hallmark for museums everywhere and well worth a visit for anyone coming to London either couples, familys or single travelers. The museum is closely located to the tube and easily reached, admission is free (at least it was at the time of our visit) and nice and affordable food options were avaliable inside aswell!"

We saw children in school uniform around, probably on a learning journey to the museum. We liked that it was near the tube, admission was free (yay for budget travellers who want to see as much as possible of London), free wifi (double YAY), and there was SO MUCH TO SEE for a free admission. We zoomed in for the dinosaurs exhibit, but stopped along other sections like marine biology and human biology. Took us about 2 hours. We left feeling happy and dropped some cash into the donation box as we felt we learnt something during the visit."

Only took about an hour or so to walk around where all the dinosaurs/animals were but we did have to queue for a while to get in but you can't really complain as it's free!

Once thats done you can enjoy the rest of the museum in relative peace (as long as its not half term) and relish in the fact you and the children your with aren't in a boring queue and instead enjoying the museum.

"Written February 21, 2016",Excellent museum. Dangerous food labelling in the restaurant.,"We went on a family outing with friends to the museum, and thoroughly enjoyed all the artefacts. The museum has many beautiful rooms and you cannot do it all in a day- but if you are in London, it is a real must! The museum is stunning and caters for all age groups. The people working at the museum are helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. The museum gets very busy, so its best to get there early. My only criticism about the museum is The Restaurant- which is the main restaurant of the museum. We went there for lunch. The food itself is not that great, the pasta we ordered was cold, the pizzas tasted a little odd (pre-cooked and reheated). So not great. However, that is not the worst bit. My son has a severe nut allergy. When we saw the menu we were really happy because they had a box that had key letters to state if foods were vegetarian/gluten free/dairy free/nut free. So we thought its great!! When we looked at the foods- not a single item of food was listed as containing nuts, which suggests that all foods were nut free. However, on a closer look we found that one of their cakes had pecan nuts (See pictures)- and was labelled as nut free. This is complete mislabelling! When I told a lady who works at the restaurant she insisted that 'contains nuts' is the same as 'nut free'...! SO - if you have any allergies, please be very careful and ask to see the allergy book list. Other than that we had a thoroughly fabulous day!"
"Written February 21, 2016",Taking in the sights ,"Haven't been for over 8 years and this still remains an outstanding place to visit. Even on a weekend and during half term, you were still able to flow freely through the museum. There are ample seats to rest should you need and just so much to see. My only recommendation would be to try and make it 2 half days rather than one full day. "
"Written February 21, 2016",Heartbreaking,"Here is a wonderfully beautiful building that draws thousands of visitors every day and has the potential to display and share information about possibly the most important topic on the planet. This at a time when our planet needs a lot of help and we need to learn a lot about what we can do to help it. This potential is sadly wasted to the point where it became upsetting to walk around the museum.  The mammal hall and other animal corridors are an embarrassment to the museum.  They are tired, very dusty and the early 80's style screen with broken plastic button interactive exhibits scream of a venue that is so far behind the times I was left wondering and why the museum seemed to be so uncared for.  To see people not really engaged with what they were seeing and just wandering around uninspired by LIFE ITSELF was heartbreaking.   Money must be understandably tight but for me the museum is risking its reputation.  I went in at 3pm and even then the paid-for exhibits had long queues once inside.  No matter how good those are I don't want to spend  hours of trip to London waiting in line.  I certainly don't want to spend it waiting for a £2.60 cup of tea it £4.80 slice of cake.  It is difficult to see what the donation I left might be used for.  Building upkeep?The place needs an overhaul, even one  part at a time.  Where is all the conservation work happening around the world?  Where is the plight of endangered species and global warming? Where is modern technology, recent news and current education?If you want natural history you would have a far better experience staying home and watching an Attenborough BBC documentary.  As a science teacher I would actually avoid taking students here for fear of switching them off of such an important area of learning.Sad times indeed."
"Written February 20, 2016",Great resource,"Something for everyone. If you enjoy the natural world so much to take in. Beautiful building and gardens too. Very busy, go early as queues each time we have gone. Easy access from public transport."
"Written October 11, 2015",I love this museum,Full of interesting and varied displays with the opportunity to interact with some of them.  Imaginatively presented - apart from the room full of rocks.  The Human Body area is especially fascinating.  And entry is free!
"Written October 11, 2015",Dull,Dull and not much to see. Very dated in there and poorly laid out. Smellie and toilets were disgusting!! 
"Written October 9, 2015",Amazing architecture!,"The collections are great, but for me the real treasure is the building itself. The main hall is gorgeous with open stairs carved with a variety of animals and plants, a statute of Charles Darwin, and the ceiling panels are painted with different plants. I could spend hours just exploring the architecture. But, we did look at some other things and saw dinosaurs, a huge blue whale, and a free talk on arthropods.  The Natural History Museum also has an ourdoor garden. It's a bit late in the season, but it was still a nice little walk in the middle of the city and a chance to get outside before heading back in for more Science!"
"Written October 8, 2015",Good place to go after the V&A,"The building is beautiful, but the exhibits need updating. I made sure to donate to help improve here. We loved the animatronic dinosaurs and the earthquake simulator though. A bit disappointed that half of the bird gallery was removed on our visit. Well, that maybe for the best. Also liked the fact that they are letting their stuffed animals fade and the explanation. They no longer want to kill animals just to put them stuffed on display.  I actually got vertigo on the escalator up to the earth displays. That was kinda fun (and funny!)."
"Written September 30, 2015",Always great,I always go to the wildlife photo of the year exhibition which is always very inspiring/off putting. The build is always worth looking at and the exhibits always interesting. 
"Written September 28, 2015",visit to national history museum,"Really interesting .including the life size dinosaur reconstruction.Both impressive and informative,.Excellent wheelchair access,No charge but you can leave a voluntary contribution."
"Written September 24, 2015","Fantastic building, helpful staff, clean toilets, great exhibitions","We visited on a Sunday and queued outside for about 20 minutes. The queue was civilised and fast moving when the museum opened. The staff handled the crowed really well. As we got closer to the door a young staff member greeted the crowd and promoted a tour book for £5 which we bought. Quick bag search as you go in. Amazing first impressions, the architecture is incredible and the first thing you see if a giant dinosaur skeleton. Was advised by staff to do the dinosaur (blue zone) zone first due to it getting busier later. Great exhibitions. We were limited on time so also quickly saw the earth section, volcanoes, earthquakes, human biology section and briefly saw the aquatic section - shame that the whales and other aquatic mammals section was closed.Clean toilets, helpful staff, easy to read map and a fantastic day out!"
"Written September 20, 2015",a must see!,"We weren't planning on coming here but thought why not as we had a bit of time to kill! Amazing amazing museum! Its fun and very interesting, would be great for people of all ages but two in the 20s loved it! Great exhibitions and so much to see, we wish we allowed more time."
"Written September 17, 2015",A dream,"Absolutely a amazing plaze. Join the fantastic dinosaur creatures, exibitions and the building it self. Its free and lots of exibitions, one word: fantatsic"
"Written September 16, 2015",Dinosaurs,Favorite museum. Beautiful both on the outside and inside. The Dinosaurs exposition is great. Everyone is going to have lots of fun while learning facts and biology. Simply amazing 
"Written September 16, 2015",Oh!!! Oh!!!,"I'm in love with fossils and here I saw something I will never forget! Ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, and specimens collected by Mary Anning and her brother Joseph in the early 1800s.I experienced a earthquake and a volcano too!!!"
"Written September 15, 2015",Best rainy day activity ever!!!,"We are in London on our honeymoon and we needed something to do out of the miserable and cold rain so hubby suggested this museum... I was initially hesitant about going along to this museum as I thought it would be just rooms with taxidermy animals and little cards with the animals name in Latin... But my husband really, really wanted to see the dinosaur fossils, so we went along as something to do... Well, we had the most fun we have had in a long time!!!!!!!! There were kids everywhere and they all seemed to be having an absolute blast and so were we! The museum is a lot of fun for kids, parents and people like us who were just trying to kills some time! We wish we had of skipped the science museum up the road and spent our whole day here!!!! Loved every moment here and would highly recommend this place to anyone!!! had such a blast, really brought out the kid inside hubby and I!!!"
"Written September 11, 2015",One not too miss in London,Great for the kids.  The dinosaur section has been really well done and is informative for the whole family.  Definitely one for the littlies to visit.  Some stunning treasures on display and worth a visit.  
"Written September 7, 2015","Beautiful building, great exhibits and expensive food","As an attraction that is free, this is one of the best things to do on your visit to London! That being said, there are some individual exhibits such as the David Attenborough experience and a Coral exhibit amongst others, that are paid (around about a fiver and well worth it). However these aren't essential as the regular exhibits are fascinating and will keep you going all day! The dinosaur walkthrough was a favourite of ours. A piece of advice - take a packed lunch!! Particularly for families as the food available was limited and overpriced. Other than that, one of the best (and cheapest!!) things to do in London! "
"Written September 6, 2015","free, must go, be there early",+once inside pls queue for the most popular exhibition first before the crowd comes in+very large inside and can easily spend half a day here
"Written September 4, 2015",wonderful for all ages,Amazing exhibitions in a wonderful environment and beautiful buildings. We always love to visit and learn something every time. This time it was mainly the 'Red Zone' but with required return to dinosaurs and the Butterfly exhibition - worth the entrance fee.
"Written September 3, 2015",Crowds and crowds!,"After multiple visits to London, I finally made my way to this museum. I came towards the end of the day during the week and it was PACKED. Still, there is no entry fee and the museum is relatively good (I'm not a huge museum person to begin with). The building itself is also very pretty. I waited in line for about an hour to see the dinosaur exhibit, which I felt was okay for adults but probably way cooler for kids (if they can tolerate the long wait in the very hot room). This place isn't on my list of London favorites, but it's worth a look."
"Written September 3, 2015","2 hours queue for dinosaurs exhibition. With kids: either that, or the rest of the museum.","The exhibition is very interesting, though most of the exhibits are replicas and not the real thing… There are a few fossils that are really amazing! The thing is, that after queuing for so long,  especially with children, they don't have patience to see the rest of the very interesting exhibitions. The museum is huge! Bottom line : if you go there, its either the dinosaurs exhibition,  or the rest of the museum. "
"Written September 1, 2015",Went there every time I could ...,"Every time I ever took my children to London we went here, it is just brilliant! We would go late afternoon (I think because it was free after 4pm), it's a 'must do' in London ..."
"Written August 31, 2015","A ""must"" when visiting London","Enjoyed our few hours in the museum. Was good that there wasn't pressure on entry to make a donation (as had been the case in the Science Museum), we did chose to make a donation which felt more rewarding because of the lack of pressure. Lots to see and well laid out. Down points would be the dinosaur display - queued for ages with 2 small children and the heat in the room itself was incredibly unpleasant. When my children wanted to leave as they were so hot I was worried about them, there was no easy way out, had to walk through all of the remainder of the exhibition through the queues to ""escape"". This should be better organised, I don't normally feel claustrophobic but the amount of people coupled with the heat (it wasn't a hot day) made me very uncomfortable. Also the cost of the food in the cafe was extortionate - 3 small children's ham rolls, 1 cheese sandwich, 2 cans of coke, 2 small caramel shortcakes and 2 small cookies - £24 !! Very very overpriced - a slice of cake was £4.20, can of coke £1.95 etc. I know they are self-funded but having already made a reasonable donation on entry, I felt rather ripped off. So be warned - do not choose to eat here."
"Written August 9, 2015",Worth visiting,"This is a museum that has something for everyone unlike the more specialised museums. There are loads of different and varied displays laid out by a grouping system of collections. The museum gets quite busy during the day and can even have a queue before opening but certainly the earlier the better. Admission is free. Overall, given the variety of objects on display and the free admission, this is well worth visiting for all the family."
"Written August 8, 2015",Good option of museum,"Great place, interesting things to see!! For sure, a good option to do in London. The entrance is also free."
"Written August 7, 2015",An armadillo as big as a room and the architecture takes your breath away.,Visit for the building and architecture.  Amazing and the exhibits take your breath away.  This is a must.  You will never be in another building like this.  Incredible and beautiful. 
"Written August 6, 2015",Excellent Human Biology Section,"We approached this museum with the goal of seeing things we could not see at a natural history museum in the US, and it delivered.  The section that focused on human biology was especially good.  It was fun to see a couple of exhibits that would never have made it past the Moral Standards Police in America.  I also liked seeing an early copy of Darwin's ""Origin of Species"".  This is a very good museum that really deserved a whole day."
"Written August 5, 2015",Worth the wait.,It was our second visit to the NHM and thus we were better prepared.1) expected the queue (as start of summer break - although an hour was longer than we expected).2) Better to do 1 (ideal) or 2 halls properly and still have your senses together at the end of it.3) we divided up to 2 parties (dinosaurs and minerals) to enjoy it more.A wonderful morning which ended with us all still talking (to eachother) at the end of the visit. An excellent museum with a first class pedigree.
"Written August 4, 2015",Amazing Place,"If you have children who are able to walk and have a curious nature, this is THE place to visit. The kids 9 and 4 year olds, loved everything. The dinosaurs were amazing as was the butterfly exhibit. If you are going make sure you plan what you'll be doing, there is an app which I highly recommend you download before you visit. Really good day out."
"Written August 3, 2015",Great for the whole family,"We visited the first thing in the morning, arriving about a half hour before opening, and there was a line - 10 minutes before opening the line was getting pretty long. We going to leave for Paris that afternoon so we knew that we would need to have an abbreviated visit, but we did very well - we entered through the Exhibition Road entrance (as opposed to the Cromwell Road entrance where you see the large dinosaur skeleton in the Central Hall right away). We entered in to the Earth Hall, going up an escalator that passed through a large red display that feels like you are passing through the earth's core. One of our attractions in this area was the display on volcanoes and earthquakes. I had heard about the earthquake simulator and really wanted to try it. It is essentially a display of a store in Kobe, Japan that simulates an earthquake. The floor moves, the items on the shelving shakes. It was interesting, but it is not an amusement ride. I really enjoyed the Treasures section and if you are short on time, make sure you do this. It is 22 specially selected objects that are either unique, valuable, famous or surprising. A rare dodo skeleton, the first Neanderthal skull discovered, a rare first edition of Darwin's On the Origin of the Species, one of the three penguin eggs brought back from the Antarctic by Captain Scott's expedition. We saw the giant sequoia in the second floor landing. It is a massive slice taken from one of the world's largest trees. I was interested in going to Vault at the end of the minerals gallery - it showcases the most precious specimens from the museum's mineralogy collections. There is the historic Latrobe nugget from the Australian gold rush, meteorites rom Mars and the moon, etc. My teenage son was fascinated with the mammals section. There is a huge blue whale model on display which is really awesome. In various sections one gets to see dinosaur remains (including the central hall) - we knew that we were not going to have the time to do the dinosaur exhibit which includes the animatronic T-Rex. We had to make a decision - either see a lot of the rest of the museum, or spend a fair bit of our precious time in the long line up. We had been to the New York and Washington Natural History Museums, we had certainly seen our share of dinosaur displays, and we were content with the dinosaur remains we saw elsewhere in the museum. Finally the building itself is lovely and is a marvel in itself. It is a huge museum, hard to do in one visit, you do get worn out after a while -  2-3 hours is my limit in a museum. Even though we did see a lot, we know there is so much more. One final note: the admission is free to the permanent exhibits, there are fees for temporary exhibits."
"Written July 30, 2015",The story of our world under one roof!,"its so huge so make sure you plan for what you want to see, if not you will be missing lots of its valuable contents.i visited with my family, but its not always wise to do so because you don't want to wait for each and every one to follow you so you may need to decide on a meeting spot then every one find his own way.even though one day will not be enough to get around it so keep it on your agenda for a second visit later.some modern parts might be more attractive for kids than history so let them find there way."
"Written July 29, 2015",Loved it ,Absolutely loved this especially cause it was free only downside was the queue to get in and to get in to see the dinosaurs was very busy and wasn't nice walking along the bridge with all those people and was very warm in there but overall a gd day out  
"Written July 29, 2015","Beautiful Museum, Amazing for kids, overcrowded at some times","We went to the Natural history Museum on a Tuesday morning (Thinking that it would not be so crowded). To our surprise, there was a HUGE line-up to go in (About 30 minutes wait.) We were told that if we made a small donation (8 pounds), we can get the butterfly tickets and skip the line to go straight in. We tried that and we were in no time. The Dinosaurs exposition was really breath taking especially for the kids. But again we were stuck in a line-up inside and it took us at least 20 minutes to get out of the Dinosaurs exposition. The Butterfly experience was so exciting for the kids. Just seeing all these beautiful insects flying around us made the kids super excited. Definitely worth spending a day at the Museum. It is both Fun and Educational."
"Written August 26, 2015",Fun for families,"This museum is perfect for families with small children (actually children of all ages will love it) especially the dinosaur exhibition. The dinosaur exhibition is so much fun, but ALWAYS has huge queues; go when the museum first opens of don't bother.Also there are lots of constructions going on at the moment which makes the museum a bit less pretty than usual, and some of the littler exhibitions are closed, but it's still a great museum."
"Written August 25, 2015",Entertaining and Informative,I have never before had to queue to get into a museum but a half hour wait was well worth it for this attraction.Apart from the fact that it is a beautiful building on its own the exhibits are excellent to. Many different areas and thousands of exhibits. Good for adults and children.
"Written August 25, 2015",Exciting experience,This museum is closest to experiencr a real tryst with some of the extinct species. It is well maintained and is absolutely free for tourists. It is a must go if you are in London no matter how old are you.
"Written August 23, 2015",Great time out,"I visited the Natural History Museum as a recommendation from a friend, and it did not disappoint. I was travelling solo so I was able to go at my own pace and enjoy. There is a lot to see. I first went in the morning and it was already busy being summer. If you are going in peak season allow a good half a day to see everything. The fact that this place is free to go to is even more a reason to go."
"Written August 19, 2015",Brill museum,This is a brilliant museum. A full day with so much to see for people of all ages. I would visit again. 
"Written August 16, 2015",Natural History Museum,"I last went to the museum quite a few years ago. It was brilliant.Today, however I found it very disappointing.If you want to see the dinosaurs, you have to queue for a very long time. Then you are pushed and shoved along a raised gangway without having time to stop and look at anything. It`s like sheep being led to their slaughter.Most of the rooms were just filled with infant school style education boards. You don`t really get to see anything unless you go into the basement to the education centre and use the microscopes which are good fun.Would I go back again ? Probably not if they are going to keep it like this."
"Written August 14, 2015",Butterfly experience was wonderful!,After visiting the nearby Victoria and Albert Museum and the Science Museum we on our way to the tube station when we saw the signs for the Butterfly tent next to the Natural History Museum. The butterflies were beautiful with a huge variety in colour and size and it was impossible to smile. It was a wonderful surprise!
"Written August 13, 2015",Don't miss the building itself!,"This really is a treasure.  The dinosaur exhibit in particular is really well done.  Get there early to avoid the crowds.  While you're there, don't forget to look at the building itself - adorned with intricate carvings of animals and a beautiful sight to behold as a structure."
"Written August 10, 2015",Best Natural History Museum in the World,Huge museum with many exhibits regarding the geological and biological history of our earth. Haven't seen a natural museum that is bigger and provides that many things to see. Definitely a must go for any London visitors!
"Written August 9, 2015",Don't be Afraid of the Queue!  You'll Love Your Experience!,"When we first saw the queue, we thought our day's plans were dashed.  The line snaked back and around and up and sideways . . . but when we noticed that it continually moved, we decided to give it a shot.   . . .  And my 14 year old son and I were thrilled we did.  What a tremendous place!! And it really only took about 15 or 20 minutes before we were inside exploring!!   I think those managing the New York City Natural History Museum should come take a few lessons.  Everything works here in London!  The interactive bits for children are just right, encouraging thought and playfulness. . . .  but they never overpromise.  The variety of exhibits is tremendous.  We especially loved the experience of the earthquake and volcano exhibits!!   But perhaps the highlight was the photography exhibit.  This annual exhibit of wildlife photographs was breathtaking.  I will never forget the beauty and color of those images.   This particular exhibit may be a once-a-year thing but it seems that there are special exhibits of the sort all the time.  I have been to London many many times but this visit to Natural History Museum was the first.  It won't be the last!"
"Written October 27, 2015",Dinosaur Hunting,Took our 4.5 year old little boy on his first trip to London to see Dippy and he wasn't disappointed. The museum is as fantastic as I remembered it we only saw a small part of it as its a long day for a 4 year old and there is a lot of walking involved. the exhibits were great. we will be coming back you need to leave a good 1.5hrs just to do the dinosaurs. be prepared to queue to get in at busy times but it's well worth it just to see the look of amazement on your child's face when the first see dippy the diplodocus in the entrance. A must do with your kids
"Written October 26, 2015",A must,A fabulous building with exhibits that could have kept me there for days!! The geological section alone took over half my allocated time. Just so much to see & children will love the dinosaur sections. A further visit will be necessary....
"Written October 26, 2015",A wonderful place!,"The NHM is my favourite of all of the museums in the UK and I make sure I visit every time I am in London! The exhibits held here are wonderful, it's just a shame that they can't put them all out (they have over 80 million specimens)! I think that it is predominantly more adult focused but that is not to say that it is not suited to children; it is more just that there is so much to see that smaller children may struggle to keep their concentration for so many items!  It is definitely worth spending an extra £10 to go on the Spirit Collection tour to see the backroom workings of the museum and some of the weird and wonderful specimens held behind the scenes. Our guide on the tour, Katie, was excellent and was able to engage with adults and children (including some rather challenging questions from some of the children). "
"Written October 24, 2015",Excellent!,"Love this museum! There are simply a lot of things to see, do and read. Many levels to explore. Love the dinosaurs exhibition. There was a little garden (farm?) just outside at the back of the building. I think not many know about it. It was only open for a period of time and we like that little area a whole lot."
"Written October 23, 2015",Good day out in London.,"Interesting for children and adults, actually went for the Attenborough 3D show, this is good but will cost £6.50 per person for around a 30 minute show, however we felt the experience was worth it. The 3D kit is superior to the glasses handed out at the cinema.The museum is free, only queues we experienced were for a dinosaur exhibition. Lots of animals, and other exhibits to keep you occupied , outside there is a pretty good wildlife garden with a water feature.Food available, this is a similar high price that you find at other attractions, I would avoid in school holidays if you do not have children."
"Written October 21, 2015","Really nice day out, even for scientists","I visited the Natural History Museum on a Sunday for a nice day out to look at some nice artefacts and exhibits. We got there at 9.30 in the morning and had a short line to wait in before the museum opened at 10am.We decided to skip the dinosaurs because everyone rushed there first and went through so of the other human biology and extinct animal exhibits. We saw the amazing dinosaur skeletons, but it was kind of ruined by all of the pushy children and parents with enormous prams (hint, don't go in school holidays, families don't care about anyone else).We had booked the David Attenborough virtual reality experience which was seriously the coolest thing I've done in ages! I wish it had gone longer but it was definitely worth the money!!We had lunch at the restaurant and got the meal deal (about £12 each, not bad for a whole pizza, dessert and drink in the middle of London), but it did take a while to get our food.We spent the rest of the afternoon walking through the geology and ecology sections, which we found more interesting but over stimulating - we just stopped caring about some of the sections towards the end because there was too much take in. We were too exhausted to pay much attention to the fantastic collection of minerals. There is not a lot of seating around the place so be aware!Highlights: The virtual reality experience, going up the escalator through the planet and the brilliant dinosaur skeletons."
"Written October 20, 2015",A great day out in London,"Truly a beautiful building. Some of the exhibits are dated but there is much to see so chances are something will be of interest to you.  My children love the dinosaur exhibit, newer and with some moving animatronics - very cool.  Great place to spend a rainy afternoon and free for all to enter!"
"Written October 17, 2015","Interesting and beautiful, but outdated and crowded","We visited twice- once in an adult-only visit and once with our children (8 & 5). For adults, the only reason to visit is to get a flavor of an old-style nature collection: see the amazing building, go through the big hall and then, really, just wander around a bit, see the dodo etc. All in all, an hour well spent on the same day we visited the science museum next door.For children it was slightly more interesting - the dinosaur exhibit was a hit and we just browsed through some other sections. But what made this visit worthwhile was the 'research' room on the basement floor, where kids can explore, touch, measure and research various specimen, from bones to insects. We stayed there for over an hour and the kids would've stayed longer if possible. So... make sure you visit this section, entry is free but you need to reserve a time-slot at the room's entrance."
"Written October 17, 2015",Pleased we went,"It was a wet and dreary day and as visitors to London sightseeing in the rain did not appeal.  We had not been to the Natural History Museum so why not.  When we arrived the queue at the main entrance was very, very, long so we were directed to the side entrance where it was only very long. There were children everywhere, little kids with parents, little kids with grandparents, little kids with older siblings and when we arrived inside it was easy to understand why.  This is a marvellous interactive museum with excellent exhibits set inside an equally architecturally stunning Victorian building.  I took a few photos and when we returned home showed them to my 8 year old grandson.  His one word response I think sums up the museum ""wow""."
"Written October 12, 2015",Natural History Museum is a must visit!,"It is so well laid out with the names of the animals, minerals etc, that one learns a lot.  A great place to go with children. It holds their attention and is cultural at the same time."
"Written November 17, 2015",Magical night of Ice Skating!,We had gone to the BNHM for Ice Skating on Monday night. The place was beautfully lit up and looked like a place out of a fairytale. Highly recommended!!
"Written November 17, 2015",Attended a wedding as a venue,If you are looking to organise a function in this museum unfortunately the rooms does not lend itself to a reception. The room to the side of the main entrance is long and narrow. If you are 600 people you get stuck at the end will miss out on food and drinks. Once you move to the main hall once again where the bar stations and food stations are placed. It is not practical and gets very busy when serving.  With the dance floor large bar and occasional tables it is not possible move around freely. It is disappointing
"Written November 16, 2015",really good and educating,"I really enjoyed walking round and seeing the different types of animals, dinosaurs, the way of life and nature. however I must say that when it got to getting in to the museum we had to que for half an hour because we had to have bag searches, which I didn't mind but It was raining and cold! also the food was very very expensive it was £5.00 for a ham and cheese baguette my partner had to go without having food because he didn't want to pay that when you could get the same from another shop! all in all the museum was really good and I would go back!"
"Written November 7, 2015",Best museum ever visited!,"This museum has everything if you are interested in biology and science in general. They are currently working on the skeleton of a blue whale, can't wait to see that once finished. "
"Written November 3, 2015",Too big? Best for dinosaurs lovers.,"This is first of all a great and beautiful building, inside and out.It has so many interesting things to see that you can easily spend a hole day there! And this can be a problem when you're in this amazing city that is London. It's mostly about minerals and animals: the Human specie, other living creatures and of course the Dinosaurs. It's free and has a lot of interesting things for kids."
"Written November 2, 2015",Go when (if ever) you can avoid the crowds ...,"Having just arrived in England after a long stretch in France and having no idea that the English kids were on school holidays I ambled off to the Natural History Museum mainly because I was staying nearby for some days.The queues to get in from the start of the day were stupendous!  It was the dawning of the knowledge that it was school holiday time. Enthusiastic kids of all ages, including quite young ones,  had arrived with parents in tow (I think that is the right way to put it) and I was aghast at first at the idea of queuing and then milling inside with so many little ones.However it was quite an eye-opening experience on a number of points:  firstly the 'crowd-control' security staff had the whole process well in-hand.  We were informed of progress, staff kept kids amused, the English parents and littlies as well as older children showed remarkable patience and perseverance and lost none of their enthusiasm at all.Secondly, I was astonished at the sheer excitement of and interest of all the kids, from really quite young children to high-school aged ones too.  It was an experience in itself to watch the utter delight of parents and kids together, especially in the Dinosaurs sections.The Museum itself was worth the queuing for me as it was a most interesting, surprising and extensive display on many themes and areas of research and learning.Do not miss the Room of Treasures!  Allow a full day - you can get a reasonable meal there!"
"Written November 2, 2015",A fun way to spend a few hours,I made the mistake of visiting the museum on a wet day in the last week of the summer holidays. The line to get in was long. It took approximately 45 minutes to get in.I enjoyed the museum. I did cut my time short because of the kids. It was too busy for me to relax and fully enjoy it.
"Written October 30, 2015",awesome,AWESOME....and free....is huge ..nice ... impossible to get bored. i advice everyone  if possible to visit during the week time  and  avoid weekends  as is crazy busy ....i was impressed  and i am not the type of person who enjoy museums in general ... but this one love it .. spend about 3 hrs inside  and was a general visit . if u pay attention to everything will be like 5 hr visit i think
"Written October 28, 2015","Fun, educational, and free!","This is an absolute must visit! I've been with many friends and family who have visited (ages between 19-50 somethings - but would be a great outing with children as well), all of whom have given it rave reviews. The museum is well laid out with a range of exhibits. However, it can get quite busy on weekends so if possible, I suggest going during the week days. The museum is directly in front of the South Kensington tube station so very easy access and is next door to the Science museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum so you can make a day of it, if you like. There is also plenty of outdoor space if you want to have your lunch outside."
"Written October 27, 2015","Educational, fun & well put together","This is a delight for anyone with a passion for finding out about our beginnings. We very happily spent nearly an entire day pottering around and only left when we did because we needed to catch the train home!It's busy & popular because the UK has this wonderful concept of making museums free to enter thus ensuring that everyone has equal access. There were plenty of kids in there having a great time (except one who was terrified of the dinosaurs) and they were learning at the same time - brilliant! The museum has bins for donations, and if you visit, please do consider donating to enable them to keep doing what they do so wonderfully. We all benefit from them."
"Written March 21, 2015",A good although noisy museum,A very good and interesting experience and good set out although was full of school children so unable to truly appreciate the exhibits.
"Written March 17, 2015",Amazing ,Great place to travel with young children very informative and fun The volunteers are awesome think of it as their own home am sure if they get paid for this but their motivation levels are inspiring great job for anyone managing them 
"Written March 16, 2015",Dino Snore Sleep over,"This is just the best experience in a museum! It is very well organised, and there is plenty to keep you occupied. We have visited this Museum a few times in the past and always enjoyed it, but to see it when the doors are locked, and to sleep under the Diplodocus tail is something else!  I cant begin to tell you how much fun this was, and well worth every penny.  If you are thinking about signing up for this, it is exactly how they describe it, and would love other people to have as much fun as we did.  The treasure hunt in the pitch dark dinosaur room was great by torchlight."
"Written March 15, 2015",You could spend a day here,What an amazing place. We only managed to see one whole section in a few hours. The building itself is incredible and there is a variety of exhibitions. The weekends are much busier than during the week so if you wish to move around freely then first thing on a weekday would be the ideal time to visit.
"Written March 14, 2015",A must visit during London stay,"I visited the museum for second time. I must say that its a must visit if you are in London. I think its the best natural history museum of the world. It fascinates adults but kids, too. Beware that the weekends may be overcrowded. The admission is free to anyone."
"Written March 14, 2015",recommendation,"Beautiful place to visit.The only thing we struggled with was the very long waiting to enter in the front, but we managed to get in around the corner, no cue there :-)museum is divided in different parts and we enjoyed the lot of themcertainly a visit worth"
"Written March 9, 2015",Wow!,Free entrance just temping you to come over here. You need around 2 hours to see everything. A lot of interactive places so you time flow so quickly and in neighbourhood you have science museum so 2in1 ;) perfect place to museums lovers!
"Written March 6, 2015",May need more than one day,"This museum is HUGE...the displays are broken up into sections. Be prepared for a lot of walking and if you want to see everything, plan on a full day, at least. The building itself is beautiful and the displays are certainly worth seeing."
"Written March 5, 2015",Good museum especially for families,The Natural History Museum in Kensington is one of the best family oriented museums in London. The lines for the dinosaur exhibits testify to this as well. On this visit I explored the second and third floors which was fascinating. The treasures room is on the second floor and contains many rare pieces from the permanent collections. I was fascinated by Scott's Penguin eggs from Antarctica and the experiment that was performed on them.  There were also pages from Audobon's folios. The birds are exquisitely executed.  The mineral vault is overwhelming and it was impossible to see all of it in a few hours.The third floor contains a cross section from a giant Sequoia tree.  Another visit is needed to go through more on these floors.
"Written March 1, 2015",Fantastic visit,"Right, the key to visiting the museum is to get there early. Being our dinosaur obsessed sons birthday we decided to visit and arrived at 0930 on a Sat morning. About 20 people in front of us in the queue but when doors opened we were first into the dinosaur exhibit. Result. We spent an hour wandering around taking it all in before we visited the dinosaur shop. A quick coffee and we were set to tackle the rest of the museum. We spent a lot of time in Red zone which covers earth, volcanos and earthquakes and a lot of time in blue zone which covers mammals and human biology. We left at 4pm and didn't get to everything. We had a very reasonably priced and tasty lunch in the Deli Cafe and needless to say dinosaur items and other things purchased at the well stocked shops. This was mine (not hubby's) and kids first visit to the NHM and we all came away talking endlessly about what a great day we had. Such a great place to visit and fantastic for kids as so interesting for them. I was apprehensive about the queues and the amount of time time we would have to wait but getting there half an early (remember, on a Sat) was a good choice. It must be said it got packed really quickly but I didn't find the crowds an issue. But seriously if you want to visit the dinosaur exhibit you need to be there early. We couldn't get over the queue when we were leaving at 4pm. Go early and avoid disappointment. Enjoy. "
"Written July 25, 2015",Another Museum-Naturally!,Had a lovely time venturing around and there are many hands on activities-don't forget to bring your hand sanitizer as you will need it after your visit to this place...lots to see worth coming along a couple of times to allow you to see it all.
"Written July 24, 2015",A long wait followed by a long wait ,I would suggest avoiding the museum in the school holidays unless you get there first thing in the morning . I arrived with my family and had to wait over 2 hours just to be let in the door . Then when inside we had to wait in line again to see the dinosaurs . Lovely and interesting museum but will never go during the holidays again . 
"Written July 24, 2015","outdated, hot, crowded","I wouldn't recommend going during the summer as it gets very hot and crowded. Yes admission is free but you will pay dearly for anything else especially food. Lines for anything interesting and many of the displays look straight out of the 70s....many don't work properly, are missing, or are completely broken. We wanted to see the famous dodo but he is all covered up along with most of the birds as they are redoing the exhibit....which is good but why at the height of tourist season? They should redo the bug hall instead anyway. Special butterfly exhibit was nice but cost way too much for tickets. Sorry if this sounds bitter but there are so many better free museums in London to visit."
"Written July 23, 2015",Darwin Lives,"If you like natural history, this is the place to go.   Not so interested?  Still a good visit because 1.  it's free, and 2. you can pick as much or as little as you like.  A nice tearoom and a GREAT shop.  All sorts of things for kids, plus a lot of attractive items for grownups.   Some made in China, but hey.  Prices are a wee bit high, but I suppose some of it goes to science?"
"Written July 22, 2015",Fabulous but avoid the queues by using side entrance off exhibition road!,Being school summer holidays it was very busy with families and tourists etc surprised at lack of air conditioning... It was very hot and busy for families with young children.Blue section zone is where the dinosaurs are & was by far the most crowded area. Restless earth however was fascinating including an earthquake simulator of the Kobe earthquake! 
"Written July 22, 2015",Natural History Museum,"Favourite building, museum and exhibitions for families in my opinion. Natural History Museum can be visited again and again, all ages and never gets dull; best of British."
"Written July 21, 2015",Fantastic and free!,The museum was full of wonderful things to look at and read about from dinosaurs to volcanoes. you can spend hours just wandering about this magnificent building.We had the added bonus of being able to visit the butterflies on display in the gardens which wasn't free but worth the fee.Do make sure small children like butterflies flying around as many ended up screaming once inside and had to be taken out.
"Written July 21, 2015",If you have kids you have to bring them here.,"Its one of those places that everyone should go and see at least once and if you have kids then its a must. Get there early as the Que starts early to get in. My kids loved the dinosaurs but there is so much to see and do you can walk the feet of yourself and see more stuff than you can possibly take in.Entry is free but some of the exhibitions you have to pay for in advance so check before you go, but there is well enough to see and do for people of any age."
"Written July 19, 2015",Top 5 museums,"This is definately one of the top 5 museums in London, and it's in Exhibition road along with the others so it's worth a visit. Entrance is free! "
"Written July 19, 2015",Always amazing!,I could get lost in here forever and still never see everything.  This is one of the best museums in the world and justifies a full day to get the most from it.  Rainy day in London? This is the place!
"Written July 1, 2015",Crowded,Went with my family and it was packed. Staff were directing crowds - not that there was anywhere to go. People were crammed into small exhibition rooms and were unable to move forward or backwards as a result of the staff directing more people into the area. Really disappointed in what should have been a great day out.
"Written June 29, 2015",So much to see,The museum seemed huge to me.  Almost endless rooms of interesting collections.  What amazed me though was the beauty of the building itself.  That even if the museum was emptied of all their artifacts it would still be worth visiting for the detailed architecture.
"Written June 28, 2015",Very Interesting!,"You could spend a couple of days here to see everything. We only had a few hours so we saw the dinosaurs and the rocks and fossil areas.Go early because the dinosaur area gets crowded since the new Jurassic World movie is out. My favorite part was the diamonds and colored gems,"
"Written June 26, 2015",Perfect for learning,"It is my opinion that everybody should visit this museum, a lot of things can be learnt and of course, it is also fun to be in. They don't charge a fee (like other museums, which is nice) and it is amazing! Do not miss out! "
"Written June 26, 2015","Filled with gems, literally","The National History Museum is divided into four Zones - Blue, Red, Green and Orange - and here are my personal recommendations from each Zone:1) Blue Zone - Dinosaurs2) Red Zone - Earth Lab, Earth's Treasury, Volcanoes and Earthquakes3) Green Zone - Hintze Hall, The Vault4) Orange Zone - Wildlife GardenIt should take at least an hour to explore each Zone, and two to properly go through each of them. If you don't want to spend too much time checking out this interactive museum, three hours should be enough. Just make sure you don't miss The Vault.Admission is free. There are a good number of bathroom facilities, and cafes are available. Souvenirs are not too pricey. What can I say? It has a well-rounded collection, plenty of facilities ...... the Natural History Museum may not be colossal like the British Museum, but it certainly is special in its own right."
"Written June 24, 2015",Couldn't Ask for More,"I am not a big fan of museum tours. but, I absolutely like this one here with a wide range of things to see. but the aquarium where they charge you for entrance is not worth coz there's basically nothing to see"
"Written June 22, 2015",Dinosaurs,giving a high rating only and only for the massive collection of dinosaurus relics. Can be a fun place for kids . but if you are a grown up just visit the Dinosaurus zone and get out.  
"Written June 18, 2015",So MUCH to see :),"A must visit London attraction for kids and adults. This museum is a great way to spend about 3-4 hours while you are in London. About 80% exhibits were really interesting and mind-blowing (especially the dinosaurs, human and mammal part)."
"Written June 18, 2015",Probably the best in the World,"Located in a very centrally located London area and in the most unusual building London has to offer, this incredible Museum is entirely free and open to anyone. It has everything you would expect for a world class Museum and a gigantic and grandiose size grouping so many species of animals, insects, minerals, etc. The Dinosaur skeleton in the lobby is just mind boggling. Outstanding place to visit for all ages."
"Written June 14, 2015",Enjoyable for both parents and kids,"We had some time to kill prior to leaving for the airport, and made a visit to the Natural History Museum. They have a well above average collection of animals and other items in their exhibitions. We espacially enjoyed the dinosaur and earth history exhibitions. The museum is good for both a quick walkthrough and a more thorough walk to learn a lot of details. If you want to avoid too many people and school classes, you should visit early. Will definately recommend."
"Written June 12, 2015",Great for kids and adults alike,Entering the museum and seeing the large dinosaur starts the exciting adventure.  The museum is full of interesting rooms and can be done in an a couple of hours or stay all day.  Plenty to keep kids from getting bored.
"Written June 11, 2015",Nice place to see of you have some extra time,"The building that houses the museum is breathtaking. The Giant sequoia, the earth exhibits are fascinating. The minerals section is very detailed and vast. If it gets too much for you, head to the back of the minerals section to a smaller exhibit which features gemstones and even a cursed amethyst. "
"Written June 9, 2015","please go.....dont hesitate..fab, fab, fab!","Impressive, informative, exciting and fun. Such an enjoyable time spent in this beautiful building, my daughter,  7yr old grandson and myself had a wonderful time here. The exhibits are so impressive and everythinfs laid out in such a way you really are learning all the time. Taking an escalator through the centre of the earth, standing in a shop and experiencing an earthquake and being roared at by a dinosaur are just some of the memories that will stay with me always.....and all free.....fabulous a must for all the family, pkease go."
"Written June 8, 2015",Dont take away the Dinosaur!!!!,"Visited recently with my dinosaur loving kids, will be terrible if they take away the main dinosaur exhibit to replace it with a whale.Great stuff to see, for kids and adults alike, exhibits changing all the time, so can visit often."
"Written June 8, 2015",Great and free museum!,"We went to this museum twice as we did not have enough time first time around to see everything it has to offer. It's a great place for kids of all ages as well as for adults. Lots of different exhibits! Free entrance, however, some exhibitions could be for a fee. It can get very crowdy as well as schools tend to bring students there for day trips. For that reason I would recommend going there in the afternoon towards the end of the day, but be aware that they are open until 5.50 pm and you probably going to need at least 2 hours to get through most things."
"Written June 7, 2015",One of the best Natural History museums in the world ,"It has an impressive collection of skeletons, reproductions and stuffed animals, including one of the most impressive dinosaur collections in the world. The dinosaur in the main hall alone is worth the visit (which is free). "
"Written June 5, 2015",Should be on your Bucketlist,"An absolute must visit. If you went to the UK and only been to that museum, it would have made your trip worthwhile.Free entrance, cafe and restaurant available at the location, takes half a day to tour it."
"Written June 4, 2015",The walls are alive with the sound of living!,"This remarkable building is a testament to the brilliance and vision of the best of Victorian adventure and architecture ! With free admission it has to be one of the best experiences in London for you and your family. Crammed with an incredibly diverse collection it juxtaposes its complex terracotta tiles entwining stone lizards and birds with life size dinasours and state of the art digital displays. As an institution it has come a long way academically , abandoning its 19th century reputation of being a place dominated by appointments made by gentlemanly favouri it now sparks thinking , investigation and occasionally fear! Just check the 5 year old encountering the 32m long Diplodocus Carnegie skeleton for the first time or the Anti-evolutionist coming across the marble Statue of  Darwin in the corridor! With regularly changing exhibitions this great institution never loses its sparkle and synthesises a certain kind of spirit and endeavour that apparently we never lost. No excuses- visitor or Londoner- get down there with the fam !"

"Written June 2, 2015",Great museum for the whole family,Tons of wonderful exhibits.  Very crowded so be prepared.  We went early in the morning and there was a small line to get in --later when we left line was very long so try to get there early.

Volcanoes, earthquakes, climate change, dinosaurs: what's there not to LIKE!  Congratulations to the people in charge.  It was good to see all the little children on school field trips showing so much interest.  LOVED MY VISIT to the museum.  AND IT WAS FOR FREE!"
"Written May 30, 2015",Massive museum,We went to the NHM during half term break and luckily we got there early as there was a long line forming right when it opened. This place is massive and the architecture of the building itself was incredible. I wish we would have had more time in the museum and wish it wasn't as busy so we could have enjoyed it more. Would definitely go back and its FREE!!
"Written May 24, 2015",Amazing museum,"Very big museum with stunning architecture and amazing exhibitions. Lots of dinosaur skeletons, mammal, fish, retail exhibitions and precious stones. I can spend days and days in there! Definitely recommend it to anyone. "
"Written May 23, 2015",Super!, Must for scientists and children. It should take at least 2-3 hours to see dinos and others.Also a building is impressive.
"Written May 20, 2015",Incredible experience,"First time at the museum and I was amazed at the scale of the place. Everything is free except the exhibitions, and they only ask for donation. By getting the membership, not only you but also your families and friends would be able to view any exhibitions for free throughout the year. There are lots of displays in different zones, and they're all so interesting that you can spend hours in the museum without realizing it! They're informative and interactive, so it's great for families. Since the coral exhibition's main purpose is to send out a message to save the coral reef, it might not be as amazing as other areas in the museum. I love the fish tank at the end though! I would recommend going on weekdays as it can get really crowded on weekends and you'd have to wait in line to get in."
"Written May 19, 2015",Nice for the kids ,Great for kids.  Lots of activities for diffrent ages coffee shops are a bit pricy so take a pack lunch. 
"Written May 7, 2015",Visit to the most beautiful building,After a long queue to get in the kids were full of life and we feel to young to enjoy really as getting in is just the beginning of the queues.  Maybe try late in the day as they loved seeing all the moving dinosores But from an adult point if view the building itself is just amazing and filled with amazing facts.  Wonderful place to visit
"Written April 29, 2015",Amazingly interesting and more than a days information!,Displays interesting and so much to see. Amazing building and extensive displays. Could easily spend a couple of days here. Catering extremely expensive so bring own refreshment or come well fed!
"Written April 27, 2015",Amazing adventures amongst the dinosaurs.,Taking the Tube to South Kensington links you with a large tunnel to the two museums. If it is busy you will snake you way to the entrance. Check before you go if is school holidays as it may include s wait to get in. Allow plenty of time to view the extensive visits. Visit T Rex first. It may involves queues but it is worth it. The panels of explanations gives a good foundation for other exhibits. If your interests are of the natural work there is ample to see from around the world.
"Written April 26, 2015",Very VERY interesting!,From the moment you enter the museum you uderstand how interesting it is! Many different sections for every taste and if you have plenty of time you can visit everything! (i mean A LOT OF TIME!). Loved it!
"Written July 15, 2015",London 2015 Vacation,"We were a little disappointed here, but to be fair we always compare to the Natural History Museum in NYC which cannot be beat.  We ended up wishing we had gone to the British Museum instead.  It was just ok, and not worth waiting in a long line for.  If you do go, use the side entrance opposite the V&A museum."
"Written July 15, 2015",History in the making,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. Queues looked rather long but we were in within 10 minutes.  Our two children (8&5) were totally absorbed with the place. My son in particular was in his element with the dinosaurs. The volunteers were super and particularly Charles Darwin who entertained the children and discussed Beetles with them. Spent a good three hours here and saw everything we wanted to. It was very busy but if you can be patient and return to areas later when the crowds have gone down do it.  Get there for 10am opening and then go the Science Museum in the afternoon.
"Written July 14, 2015",Disappointing,I've always wanted to go here but I left disappointed. The museum itself is a magnificent building and we didn't have to queue long to get in. Unfortunately inside it is uncomfortably warm and extremely busy so it was impossible to get close to many exhibits. I was looking forward to seeing the original dinosaur fossils but many were just plaster casts. The exhibits are predominantly aimed at children which of course is great for the kids but not so much the adults. For the size of the building I expected to see a lot more items on display. There were extra displays you could pay to see - we didn't mainly because of the heat and it seemed unlikely they'd be any better.
"Written July 14, 2015",The best museum for kids,"You can't get bored of this museum, especially of you have kids, the location is surrounded with museums and all of them got something special to see, defiantly a must for all London visitors."
"Written July 13, 2015",Amazing pizza!,"Whilst on a visit to the Natural History Museum we realised we hadn't stopped for lunch so decided to grab a pizza to share from the restaurant with a couple of drinks. The pizza was made to order and tasted delicious, definitely a good choice. Don't hesitate to eat here! We were very impressed. "
"Written July 12, 2015",This musem will blow your mind!,"Museum has very easy access through the tube which when you leave you can see the breathtaking outside view of the building. It has an enormous amount of exhibitions and even if you are small or big, you will find this place fascinating!- Plan a day or maybe two days visit, you may see all the exhibitions in approx. 4-5 hours but by walking really quick- Take a small map with you at the entrance, it will be helpfull- Get informed a day before for anything special going on from the musem's website, you might find it interesting- Try keeping track of where you've been and not as you might miss something- Since this is one the most famous museum's of London, arm yourself with patience, you will see a lot of people and maybe wait a lot as well in the lines- Very reliable and free Wi-Fi- Before you leave don't forget to visit the museum's store, very nice items"
"Written July 10, 2015",The BEST,Went there with my sister and spent the whole day there! it has everything you want and is divided into sections so you get to choose your particular interest. Believe me each section is worth a visit. Loved everything about that museum. will be going there again for sure. BTW no entry fee for the museum!!
"Written July 6, 2015","Wonderful place, never long enough to see it.","Went specifically to see the Coral Reefs exhibition which was excellent. Very informative and lots of visual guides. Great tank of live coral and fish. Food video about the reefs problems due to climate change and fishing, and pollution."
"Written July 2, 2015","Dinosaurs, fleas and rocks","This was my 10 year old sons big treat - dinosaurs, lunch, the darwin centre (which is fabulous) and the wildlife garden complete with wild bees, rocks and minerals (a room missed by most, also quiet and relaxing) and apart from the food and drink it was free.Top tips: get there early, out of holiday season, from victoria station by tube not bus (takes ages) and get a taxi back when you are worn out. Also check your bags into the luggage dept. so you can relax. Eat at the darwin centre (less noise and queuing)."
"Written July 2, 2015","Its free, whats there to complain about?",I've been here numerous times and it never ceases to be interesting. Some of the exhibits are getting a little dated (the insects and creepy crawlies) but overall as it is free you can't really complain.If you need the toilet don't use the one right by the entrance there are plenty inside which aren't as busy!
"Written March 1, 2015",Loved it,"What a great museum this place is, went with my wife and teenage daughter, she wasn't keen to go, but loved it when she was there. Well worth a visit and we do intend to go again as its too much to take in with one visit.Would recommend going early to try and avoid the queues, we literally walked straight in, when we came out a few hours later there were literally hundreds of people waiting to go in."
"Written February 27, 2015",Definitely amazing,That's the museum you don't skip. It's a complete day from open to close. One of the best ever I had seen. You will very satisfied after the visiting if you like the history. 
"Written February 25, 2015",Impressive,"Mind that many museums in London are free, so is the Natural History Museum. It is worth the visit & you will need 3-4 hours just to browse the different collections. The main Hall is amazing, an architectural gem."
"Written February 23, 2015",You need to plan your trip!,"We visited on a rainy day in half term and arrived 10 minutes before it opened at 10am.Very easy to access from South Kensington and the staff were already directing visitors when we got there. We were pretty much straight in and had already decided to go straight to the Dino exhibit first which had no queue and was fascinating. Sooooo glad we did because the queue became ridiculous very quickly. After that we went to the volcanoes and earthquake area, sea creatures and to see the blue whale. We also had lunch in one of the cafes and spent some time (and money!) in the gift shop.In the end we were there about 4 hours which, considering we had a 7 and 4 yr old with us, was enough. As we left I think I can safely say that I haven't seen as many people crammed into a museum before. It was mental with a queue under umbrellas waiting outside. Would certainly come back and arrive at opening again to avoid the main crowds. "
"Written February 22, 2015",Too busy but a good free day out just don't go on a school holiday.,"The line to get in was huge, seriously huge so we decided to come back later. No better at 3pm. Once in it was busy & with two children it became hard work. The downer was that we had been to the New York natural history museum & we're kind of comparing it to that meaning we kept thinking it wasn't as good."
"Written February 18, 2015",half term visit,Queing system in place. 40 minutes to get in ( at least it wasn't raining)! Staff selling books for £5 in queue - at least kept kids happy whilst waiting. Expensive charges for cloakroom - £2 for each of our coats. Very crowded in each section of museum. and staff moving you on in the dinosaur section (having to queue  for another 30 minutes) which was a pain as you need as much time as it takes to dwell on the exhibits and for children to ask questions/take photos etc. Shortage of places to eat and drink due to volume of people - would recommend taking own food and finding a spot on the floor to eat - more eating areas would be welcome.All staff very approachable and willing to help. Volunteers at museum very informative and engaged the childrenWide range of exhibits to interest everyone if only we could get close to them !Would definitely visit again but never in the half term!
"Written February 15, 2015",Too crowded!,"Visited with a school party and found the whole visit VERY disappointing.Although this is a fabulous museum, and is well worth a visit, I found that the sheer number of people that had been allowed in during our visit was, quite ludicrous!There was no way to view the exhibits properly. The dinosaur exhibition was so crowded, we couldn't even gain entry. The noise level was such that it was impossible to talk to our group to discuss what we were seeing.That said, there are really good facilities for eating, toilets and gift shops.It just is such a pity that our visit was made so uncomfortable, but the volume of people."
"Written February 14, 2015","Naturally, we had to visit","This has been on my 'to visit' list for some time. It was a Saturday afternoon and I only had to queue outside for around 10 minutes. Once inside I dropped my coat at the cloak-room and picked up a map.It's a pretty big museum with lots of good exhibits but some feel a little dated; still you can't complain as it is free! This does mean it's very busy though, the queue for the Dinosaur exhibition was huge.I particularly enjoyed the 'Treasures Cadogan Gallery' where the special exhibits are all displayed together, such as a piece of our moon. Doing this museum in an afternoon meant that I fell just short of time to do everything, I had to skip the Geology hall."
"Written February 11, 2015",Trip without the kids for Anniversary,"It's an incredible building and free entry, what more do you want and inspiring to see so much from the T-Rex that greats you to the amazing choices and exhibits, where else can you find so many amazing fossils in one place! Wish we could have stayed longer, it's a whole days trip really, so much to see and study!"
"Written February 11, 2015",The best,For me is the best museum I have been in my life is very complete and you have basically everything it is possible to have about the subject natural history. If you have children don't worry the museum at the same time you have the explanations for you have the same for the children.One of my favorite rooms is the dinosaurs where you have a gigantic robotic t-rex who growl at you. Absolutely amazing and please you need to take some of your time to see this museum. And the best thing....it's free =)
"Written February 9, 2015",Amazing place to see lots and lots of rocks.,"The natural history museum is a place you'll have to visit. There are lots and lots and lots of rocks.If you haven't seen enough rocks in your life. There are tons of rocks here. All sorts of rocks.Anyway, rocks aside, the exhibits are plentiful and truly worth the time to walk through if you're a science person. One can easily spend the day here to really have a look through all the exhibits."
"Written January 31, 2015",Needs a good dusting!,"Visited this museum after the V&A, so had a lot to live up to. Please take a look over your big exhibits, covered in dust! Left soon after!"
"Written January 27, 2015",Gorgeous inside and out!,"Be prepared to stand in a long line in order to get into this museum.  We waited for 2 hours, but it was worth the wait.  While waiting, enjoy the exterior architecture.  The stone creatures placed on the outside of the building entertain the eyes.  You walk into the museum and there on display is a dinosaur skeleton.  While the museum itself is free, there are exhibits for which tickets must be purchased.  Focus your tour of the museum on an area that is of interest.  There is too much to see.  Plan on spending 2 to 3 hours.  The gift shop is amazing.  I found a book called ""Sheep Keeping"" which I purchased for my daughter and the farmer with whom she works."
"Written December 13, 2014",Waste of time,Visited here as a child and then about 8 years ago To sum it up AWFUL half the exhibits have disappeared for a museum to be part of the new night at the museum film would have been nice to have an exhibition about that Couldn't get in half the dinosaur display due to queues staff hanging around bored senseless. And the security search is just ridiculous Hardly surprising it's free to get in can't see anyone paying
"Written December 6, 2014",Fun afternoon with the dino's,"One thing I love about London Museums is that they are free.  This fact makes it easy to visit and  do one exhibit at a time.  As this is all my back can handle, my son and I did the Dinosaur exhibit the other day.  Educational and fun with real and fake ""dino's"".  We had a great time looking at the fossils and reading about the ancient animals.  The building is beautiful, very ""British"" with lots of history of its own.  In the winter they have an outdoor ice skating rink.  A fun day out for any age."
"Written November 16, 2014",Dinosaurs!,"Tube station conveniently located around the corner from a tube station (South Kensington) the museum is not only very interesting, it is completely free! The dinosaur bones are a joy to behold & i feel privileged to have seen them a couple of times now. For anyone interested in history or dinosaurs you can't get much better"
"Written November 14, 2014",Fantastic Museum! Awesome exhibitons and FREE!,"I love the Natural History Museum! It is a fantastic place that is made even better by the fact that it is free! The dinosaur exhibit is great fun for younger and older kids as well as informative.  The mammals section is also really cool with a huge stock of specimens and the sheer size of the blue whale is awesome in itself.  The human body section is also very well done but my favourite exhibit is the geology wing. They have an enormous wing full of all of these different minerals with the larger more spectacular specimens in larger cases on the sides. Then, at the end of the wing, there is the vault, which is full of massive gemstones and jewels with shadowy history. Finally on the top floor is the section of an enormous tree with major events in history noted on the rings. There are many photo opportunities available throughout the museum but the tree and the main hall are the most spectacular. There is a cafe on the ground floor, which is a little expensive if you're travelling on a budget so if you want to save money bring your own food. It is very well signed and there are employees everywhere so you don't need to buy a map but it is a cool souvenir. Also they currently have an ice rink set up outside but I don't know much about prices."
"Written January 25, 2015",A beautiful building containing a world of wonders,"I don't like museums. But I love this one! Since my childhood and that of my children, I've never ceased to wonder at all it contains. Externally, it's a beautiful structure, built in the 1880s and adorned with sculptures of flora and fauna. Inside, its crammed with all manner of amazing things - dinosaurs, whales, specimens of birds, fish, creepy crawlies and creatures great and small. There are always special events or exhibitions of interest.It's a wonderful place for tourists, families and keen biologists, ornithologists and most other 'ologists' too. If you've never been, go now. If you've been before, go again, and again. Entrance is free and you'll always find things you've never seen before."
"Written January 22, 2015",Wildlife Photography Exhibit was fantastic,"We stopped in this awesome museum for a quick visit to see this outstanding wildlife photography exhibit. It was fabulous. The images were unbelievable, and the time spent on a busy vacation well worth it. There was a fee for this particular exhibit, but it was entirely reasonable."
"Written January 19, 2015",Behind the Scenes Tour,"We have been loads of times to the Natural History Museum but wanted to try something different so we booked onto a Behind the Scenes Tour in the Darwin Centre. There were just 8 of us on the tour, the guide took us around the labs where lots of research takes places, showed us how small carcasses are cleaned by flesh-eating beetles (you actually see them at work!) and then into the 'library' where thousands of specimens are stored in jars of alcohol. The stories were fascinating as were the things we saw, of special interest is a giant squid which stretches about 3 metres in a long, alcohol filled tank. The tour is free and well worth doing but allow time to find the starting place which wasn't very obvious!"
"Written January 10, 2015",The best day out in town AND IT IS FREE!!,"Especially with the kids, this is a great fun day out and free to enter.A fantastic treasure trove which cannot be fully explored in one day.Top tip - get there earlyTop tip - use side entrance as front entrance much busierTop tip - don't alway go for the obvious exhibitions; the less well known ones are not busy and often more interestingTop tip - ask for children's explorers packs in main hall receptionAlso Dinosnores; Children 7 - 11 can stay behind after hours and go on a torchlit tour of the dinosaur gallery snuggling down at midnight under the diplodocus skeleton - totally awesome."
"Written January 7, 2015",You have to go.,"The museums of Exhibition Road are little different when it comes to this type of review, as weather you think they're good, bad or indifferent, makes no difference. They will always be required visiting. Luckily all three are very good at what they do and they should all be included in you London itinerary. The Natural History Museum is a fabulous building, packed with wonders that will fire you and your kids imaginations. Myself and J were bowled over by the entrance hall, let alone the rest of the building."
"Written January 7, 2015",Something for everyone,"Free to enter, the Museum is open from 10.00am until 5.50pm, every day of the week, except Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day. This makes it the ideal destination in those quieter winter months, when children are on holiday and other attractions have already closed for the season. Once inside its hard not to have a favourite section, with most heading straight to the Dinosaur Gallery, as a result, there can be very large queues here, however you can totally avoid them by simply booking a FREE timed entry ticket on-line, via the museum's own website. At the allotted time you choose, you just walk past the queue, show your printed at home ticket to the staff and enter. Perfect! But there really is a lot more than just Dinosaurs here, in fact there is something for everyone to enjoy and its almost impossible to come away without learning something new and interesting . As a child I remember being highly impressed by the size of the Blue Whale, whilst on our most recent visit I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing an artificial earthquake, the ground actually shaking beneath my feet as I stood in the Kobe Supermarket earthquake machine. You can easily spend an entire day walking around here, so do plan on eating too. Food and drinks although very good quality, is rather expensive, so anyone on a budget, or with lots of hungry children to feed, should pack a picnic and head down to the basement for lunch, where you will find a dedicated picnic zone. I also suggest bringing along some coins, so children can help support the museum with a donation. Finally don't forget the camera, which you can use everywhere without flash."
"Written January 1, 2015",I would rate it as the best of all london museums.,"I would rate this museum as the best of all London Museums. The dinosaurs are unmissable and blue zone contains lots of information about mammal's but the star for me is the red zone. In short, there is plenty for everyone to enjoy."
"Written April 23, 2015",Wonderful!,"Lots of good exhibits, especially if you enjoy natural history. Lots of interactive things as well. On our way out, one of the docents suggested we take the lift to the upper level, mainly for the view. He was right. It was wonderful. Later, we thanked him, and got ushered to another part of the museum which, during WWII, was blocked off for secret espionage work. That was as fascinating as the exhibits. So talk with the docents. They're amazingly knowledgeable, and seem to love what they do. The museums in London are free, which is remarkable ... but seriously consider leaving a donation wherever you go. Maintaining these beautiful old buildings is costly, I'm sure ... not to mention maintenance of the exhibits."
"Written April 19, 2015","Out of date, overpriced and over crowded.","This place has really fallen behind compared to London's other attractions. It's a bit like my grandads attic - lots of interesting things but dusty, old and out of date. Yes ok the entry is free, but once you are in you are herded around like sheep, stand in queues and made to pay stupidily high prices for food and drinks. Not all the exhibits are free - to see the 'reef' it's 60 quid for a family and really not worth it. The place needs closing and refurbishing and a new system put in place so that people can visit without having to climb over each other. Very dissapointing. Avoid."
"Written April 10, 2015",natural history museum,We arrived at around half past ten and there were long queues at the main entrance. We decided to go to the Science Museum instead. When we turned the corner for the Science Museum we realised there was a second entrance which was nothing like as busy.The Natural History Museum is really a visit of at least three to four hours. There is plenty for people of all ages to see and do and it is free. Long queues formed to see the dinosaur exhibitions but we found that by carrying on around the rest of the exhibition by later in the afternoon we were able to just walk in- and it was worth the wait.One thing that it seemed not many visited but I would recommend was the film theatre where we watched two really interesting films- it also gave our feet a rest for half an hour!The whole place is full of interest and I would thoroughly recommend a visit.
"Written April 3, 2015",So much to see!,"We had to pick and choose due to time constraints, but what we did see was very good. Highlights: dinosaurs, the escalator into the red Earth, the simulated earthquake inside a store, the dynamic, moving T-Rex, and the building itself, which is gorgeous."
"Written April 3, 2015",A great tour of the world's flora and fauna.,"Dinosaur skeletons, whale skeletons, and stuffed versions of more recent animals from around the world (British Empire), put together by biologists and explorers, this may be the best of it's genre in the world.  Also, go across the street from the front entrance and take in the expanse of it's façade, really THE great example of Victorian architecture.  Just beautiful. Located next to the Science Museum AND the Victoria and Albert Museums, and only a few steps from Bromption Oratory, these should be set aside for ""Museum Day"" during your stay in London."
"Written March 30, 2015",Free - go see it!,"Spent many hours in here, it's informative and well laid out.  Time well spent. Some of the exhibits are looking a little worn but you can still appreciate the reasons why they have not been replaced."
"Written November 12, 2014",Great Museum to visit.,My wife an I visited this Museum and we wished that we had brought our kids on this trip.  Children will love this museum.
"Written November 6, 2014",Tired,We headed for this place having never visited before and found it very disappointing. It seemed very drab and displays were poorly presented. The majority were aimed at the very young but even those seemed poorly done. An animated scorpion looked dusty and grubby in need of a wash. The splendid entrance hall with the dinosaur skeleton was all there was to be pleased with and one area was off limits to us as the lift was out of order and having mobility problems we could go no further. It's sad that such a famous building is so badly displayed and tended. It may be free entry but this is no excuse to let a fine institution such as this become so tired. We will not return and I would advise going to the British museum or the National gallery rather than waste your time with this.
"Written November 5, 2014",Truly excellent.,For kicks it's free which is  the best price for a museum.  Queues can get large though for a reason. Lots of fascinating exhibits and well worth a few hours of your time. 
"Written November 4, 2014",The best museum in London in my opinion!,"The best museum, plus free, plus it is interesting to pretty much everyone who comes to visit London. The British history, for instance, might not interest quite a lot of people, natural history is interesting to almost everybody. We always take everyone who visits us in London to this museum, at least to the Dinosaurs gallery."
"Written November 1, 2014",Dinosaurs,I loved it and I especially loved the dinosaurs.There was a lot of interesting things to see.I am only     six years old.
"Written October 6, 2014",Dinos!,"I've been here many times before, but each time is better than the last. It's very kid friendly, especially the Dinosaur exhibit which I go to every time, even with the tiring long queues. This time I also visited the Darwin Centre which was intriguing and very interesting, though creepy crawlies isn't exactly my best loved thing...Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to go the Mammoth exhibit which I was dying to go to and was then closing soon, but we were on a tight schedule."
"Written March 29, 2015",Feel like a kid again,"I have been in Natural History Museum almost every time I visit London and so I did the last time too. If you have kids, this is a ""must"" stop. Spend half a day inside the Museum, since your kids will love it. If you do not have kids, I almost have to propose the same thing. You will be surprised of the feeling to stroll in the different rooms of this amazing Museum. The entrance is free, but you may donate if you like. Totally recommended, do not miss it!!"
"Written March 28, 2015",Night at the Museum 3,"This was where the movie was filmed, and it looks even better in person!  It was quite busy for a Monday, so be prepared to see large crowds any time of year."
"Written March 26, 2015",Great solo or with a family,I flew through the museum on a Sunday so really just skimmed the surface but the value was still there.With so much to see it's hard not to find some really interesting 'nuggets' even if you're taking the express tour. It was clear though that with kids in tow you would get much more out of the experience (and there is no way you'd do it justice without spending the day).
"Written March 26, 2015",Great day out with toddlers!,Visited this museum with my two toddlers on a Saturday. Be prepared to queue up to enter as it is a very popular free attraction. The kids enjoyed the dinosaurs which are in the blue zone and once again you need to queue up to enter this zone. There are lifts to access the different levels which were convenient as we had the stroller too. The stuffed mammals and  the creepy crawlies too were a big hit with the kids. The restaurant was pretty expensive but there were microwaves at the exit doors to heat up milk or kids food which was convenient.  Overall a great day out and would encourage all to make a donation of £5 for which you get the brochure with the map of all the attractions and this donation will help to upkeep the maintenance of this wonderful museum for generations to come.
"Written August 12, 2014",Looking Tired,"First visit today and won't be rushing back. Arrived about 10:30 and queued for about 30 mins to get in, not too bad considering it's school holidays. Once inside we went up the escalator to start the tour in the red zone. We quickly became disappointed with many exhibits either not working, under repair or missing altogether.Paid £10 per adult and £6 for my student son to gain admission to Mammoth exhibit. Cashier was very sarcastic about my son's student ID looking at it intently for 5 mins and then commenting it ""looked funny""! Trust me, I'm not about to try and swindle £4 saving out of a museum!! Very rude. This exhibit was very good, though I would not say it was worth the money but didn't mind as it all helps the museum. Only took us 20 mins to walk through this part. Had lunch in one of the cafés which was very poorly organised and cost us £27 for 3 sandwiches, 3 cold drinks and 2 packets of crisps!!By the time we got to the blue zone I'd had enough - too crowded, too hot (open some windows!) and everything looked so tired and unloved. There must have been a decade's worth of dust on top of some of the exhibits suspended above the blue zone!!"
"Written August 11, 2014",Capital landmark that continues to excite all ages.,"I have been visiting the natural history museum since I was a child and now, my own teenage children still cannot fail but to be enthralled by the variety of exhibitions! There's the trusty favourites ..... the dinosaurs and mammals with some fantastic interactive activities for all ages; then there's the awesome escalator which passes through the centre of the earth to get to the earth room. The building itself is architecturally spectacular, and you could easily wind away the hours wandering from exhibition to exhibition. My advice would be to 1) arrive early to avoid the crowds; 2) visit the popular exhibits (eg dinosaurs) first to avoid queues;3) take your own drinks and picnic as refreshments are ridiculously expensive. Having said that  the museum is completely free relying on donations; a silly priced drink is then not so silly if you put it into context. A must see free family venue in Central London with easy tube access (South Kensington)."
"Written August 10, 2014",Good but tired ,"Firstly get there early. We arrived at 0930 at one of the side entrances, and was second in the queue. Secondly if you want to see the dinosaurs go there first. Then meant us walking past loads but worth it. Later in the day massive wait. Then start making your way around the rest. Some exhibits a little tired, still there after 20 years.With little ones three hours will do it. Cafés available but quite pricey. "
"Written August 6, 2014",Extremely buggy unfriendly,"Don't bother visiting if your child is in a buggy. The whole place is buggy-unfriendly and you'll spend a v-e-r-y l-o-n-g t-i-m-e waiting for lifts. I gave up in the end - before we'd got a sniff of a dinosaur. That said, it's free, so it's churlish of me to complain."
"Written August 3, 2014",Great family day out for free!,"we arrived at the museum at 9:30 and there was a queue but we didn't mind just watch as people like to push in, we got into the museum and went straight to the dinosaur section (do this first as it gets very busy and you will queue for ages) the boys loved this part and there is a moving trex. we looked around the whole museum which was good there is a lot of walking but you don't really notice till afterwards.The inside picnic area was all good was cool and plenty of tables and seats for all.The only thing I would say is that there is really any entrance and exits so everybody squeezes through small doors and can get cramped also would like hand gels around as theres a lot of things to touch, it is also very hot in some parts.we left around 13:30 and to our surprise people were still waiting to get in.all in all was a good day out and we will be visiting again"
"Written August 2, 2014",Fab fab fab!,My 13 year old loved it and considering his interest in life is his xbox that is a big plus! Sadly didn't get to see it all as it got too hot and stuffy in there. We will go back though in cooler weather
"Written July 26, 2014",Great museum for free,"Arrived around 11am today, from the Exhibition Road entrance, there was no queue so walked straight in :)  Went as a family with 16mth old and 8yr old, 8 year old really enjoyed it, reading about everything in a way which was easy to understand. Was busy to go around with a pushchair but found everything we wanted to see accessible. Enjoyed the earthquakes and vulcanoes exhibition and seeing the blue whale. We prebooked our dinosaur gallery tickets and glad we did, meant we could go to the front of the queue. Only spent about 2 and a half hours there overall as it felt too hot walking around, would love to go back to spend more time looking around on a cooler day."
"Written July 26, 2014",Very warm but worth the visit,It was an extremely hot day when we visited and some of the smaller exhibit halls in the red zone were unbearable.  Blue and green zones where much better though although we couldn't stay as long as we wanted due to the heat.  Worth a revisit on a cooler day.
"Written July 8, 2014",Great free venue,"Really enjoyed learning about earthquakes!  the bat event was amazing and I got to talk to a lovely long eared bat!  the highlight for me had to be the butterfly exhibition, only £5 entry but just peaceful and magical, only a small area but I lost an hour in there, I would highly recommend it."
"Written July 8, 2014",Too busy and have seen better,"My wife and I thought that it would be a great experience to go to the Natural History Museum,  however,  what we saw the most of was people's backs school groups pushing through and some very inconsiderate people shoving their way through the long queues. Of the very few displays, that we did get to spend more time at they were often broken or in a state of much needed repair. The building itself is fantastic however for the effort required to navigate the crowds, there are much better museums around the world to visit. "
"Written September 30, 2014",Super collection shame about the heat,"We visited London with three children aged 2, 6 and 7 and they loved it. The newer section is very interactive with the volunteers being great with the kids visiting. Although it was roasting hot inside. All together a great visit!"
"Written September 5, 2014","Great specimens , horrible implementation",Wow is this place a disappointment.  Dead ends everywhere. Rooms with plywood floors and drop ceilings.  Terrible flow.  No logical flow.  No modern interactions.  The entire place needs to be redone with one coherent design.  England needs to step up.
"Written September 1, 2014",Fascinating Museum though a little tired in places,"Large museums need more than one visit to take it all in. Quite a few sections of the Natural History Museum, especially the human body are out-dated and some interactive displays don't work. The Charles Darwin section is good but even that lacked the interpretive qualities found in several other great museums of the world. Given the time spent in the queue and the superficial brochure offered for 5 pounds all told a disappointing visit."
"Written September 1, 2014",Impressive on the outside...,"The building looks amazing from the outside. You would expect the place to b spacious to walk around with impressive displays etc.....It's not. I understand that it was the tail end of the summer holidays but even if it hadn't have been so busy it would still have been poor. Having been to the small Natural history museum in Tring I expected this to be far better but Tring wins hands down. Queued forever to see a slightly realistic looking T Rex that moves it's neck,  there were a couple of animated raptors. The whole place was boiling hot and cramped. The model blue whale was pretty impressive along with its model skeleton. Nearly everything interactive either didn't work or was crap. My gf and I were bored and couldn't wait to leave and found out afterwards thay even my 3 daughters were who are 6, 8 and 10 were bored....Thank London for the science museum next door that was great. Spacious, cooler. A room with a bunch of things for kids to play in and generally more interesting. 2 stars is generous really."
"Written August 20, 2014",too many people - nightmare," way too many people - its impossible to enjoy it, You will spend all time waiting in queue - so hot there no air con. I just dindnt like it, nothing special- just stuffed animals, I think for the space they got and moneys - it should be done better.  There is dinosaurs skeletons- but so many people there it was impossible to see it - just a busy day in mcdonald. "
"Written August 20, 2014",Dissapointing,"Been there before but never saw the dinosaur section. This time around waited 30 minutes in a queue to get in the museum and 30 minutes to get to the blue dinosaur section, only for the layout to be completely useless and it to be less impressive than expected. On the plus side some sections of this museum are interesting and the building is nice, staff also seem pretty friendly., plus the museum is free and the overall sum of all its content fairly good."
"Written August 18, 2014",Wonderful day out! So much to see and do!,"I visited the museum with my boyfriend and had a wonderful day. We initially planned to spend the morning in the museum but when we arrived we realised that it would take all day to see and appreciate everything. We had to wait to get in but the line was no longer that 20 minutes and for a free attraction that is so amazing a wait is worth it. We were lucky as there was no wait for the dinosaur exhibit when we arrived and were able to see it without hassle. The dinosaurs are really a must see, along with the mammoth exhibit on show at the moment. The only downside was that the museum was very warm once it became busy and the cafe facilities were also overcrowded. Other than that we had a wonderful day and would gladly return to see the things we missed! "
"Written August 14, 2014",Absolute Letdown!,Queued for an hour got to the entrance only to be told there was a fire alarm and the staff didn't know when we were allowed in so we were told to queue for half an hour round the side door we weren't going to queue again no way so we left very annoyed and disappointed.Lets just say we won't be going back again ever a complete letdown.
"Written August 14, 2014",Don't go at this time of year,"We went on 13 August.  It was unacceptably busy. My children  were appalled at all the stuffed animals - didn't really help the by explaining that the Victorians thought it was okay or that explorers brought them back to England - our children simply thought it was wrong and couldn't understand why they were allowed to be displayed - probably an indication that these museums will soon enough have had their day.The building was uncomfortably busy.  We arrived at 1015 and did not queue to get in but, like others, were shocked at the queue for the dinosaurs and simply gave it a miss.We're not prepared to pay £10 per adult for the mammoths exhibit as standard of other exhibits didn't inspire us to believe it might be worth it.Blue whale hugely disappointing - poorly painted in times past - not up to standard.I just don't  think you can get away with running a museum on the basis that this us what museums used to be like ... This is a museum of a museum and needs to be dramatically updated.I also experienced the taps in bathroom that do not work - probably not surprising with the huge visitor numbers and I would be interested in the fire safety side of this building with the huge numbers of people allowed inside. We sought sanctuary in the cafe where the 8 & 7 year old had ""the best ever ice cream"" - hallelujah for a plus!We left at about 12 and by this time folks were queuing out into the street for entry - folks it's just not worth it!Maybe okay to return in the off season?Oh, we also struggled with directional signage which could be much improved.Overall I do not recommend this to anyone at this time of year.Yes I would return in the off season but I expect my children (7 & 8) will not want to, so horrified were they at the dead animals they simply thought it was macabre.  Preschoolers will probably love it if there is no queuing.  Overall...time for a rethink museum people :/(."
"Written August 12, 2014",Busy with long queues do something else,"what a shame.  We went in August and queued 30 mins to get but still with a sense of anticipation we made our way to passed an enormous queue for something and up an escalator into the volcano section.  It was hot - this must be because we were in a volcano, of course how clever...We quickly got through that and went looking for the dinosaurs we wandered about through various equally hot and busy places until we realised that long queue was where we had to go. We queued for 45 minutes, the children getting more tired, hot and fretful - do we really want to go in?  Yes we are almost there, but you go through the doors and you are still in the queue.  We had to go forward and up the stairs still in the queue and through the whole exhibit still in the queue it took us 1 hour to get to an animatronic Trex, by which time we couldn't care less.  The heat, the large number of people all for what?  It is of course the most fantastic building so the surroundings are very beautiful, the 3 hours we spent in queues were not worth our while.  Even the children said they didn't want to go back.  Shame."
"Written December 18, 2013",Make sure to ask about the specimen tour,"I won't write any more about the general exhibitions at the museum. The highlight of my trip was the 8 person tour of some of the specimen that are not on show, unless you take the tour. All you have to do is ask about the free tour at the information desk. During the tour, we were shown specimen from Charles Darwin's famous expeditions and much, much more."
"Written October 2, 2013",Can I give this six out of five please?,"I hadn't been to the Natural History Museum since I was a child, so my visit felt all-new. I was totally unprepared for the huge scale of the museum, the quality of the exhibits and the sheer brilliance of the place. As if all that wasn't enough, right at the end of the day I stumbled on the Cocoon. The audacity and vision of its designers absolutely delighted me.Entrance is free, though there are collection boxes where you can make a donation if you want (I certainly did!).As well as viewing the exhibits I also ate at the Benugo restaurant in the museum - I had a large salad plate, and it was both substantial and very tasty - and pretty reasonably priced for central London at £8.55 for the salad and a large latte.I spent the afternoon in the museum and I ran out of time. Next time I will allow a full day - there is so much to see."
"Written September 19, 2013",An amazing time!,"I learnt so much from that museum, did you know that more than 126 million natural science specimens and cultural artifacts are contained within the museum’s meticulously documented collections! I got to a whales stomach! Make sure you see the earthquake room, it was so amazing. I live in Singapore so I have never even felt a tremor of an earthquake so when I got to feel what it was like, I was amazed. The architecture of that place is amazing and there is so much to learn. It is a fun place for kids and adults and for everybody. I had an amazing time. Harry Winston donated the Hope Diamond to the Smithsonian in 1958 which is a whopping 45.52 carats and is also the museums greatest attractions. You should go there early in the morning so that you can see everything. Enjoy!"
"Written September 2, 2013",You're never too old to learn,"On a recent visit to London we travelled by tube to South Kensington with our three young granddaughters and their parents to visit the Natural History Museum. It was a marvellous day and we all learned something new. The Dinosaur exhibit is the standout attraction and it's great, but it's crowded, slow moving and quite dark. The T-Rex is actually so realistic that even I was frightened of it, so little children need to be prepared and be holding on to someone! Other reviewers have commented that the Museum is ""dumbed-down"" and that might be so in some areas, but it has to cater for little children as well as scientists and paleontologists and I'm really glad that our very little girls were able to see life-like animals and ask lots of questions which we could answer because there were great amounts of information for the viewers. We all really enjoyed a wonderful Presentation on Frogs and Tadpoles and the children felt really welcome at that and did not get bored. We had morning tea and lunch at the Museum and there was a good choice of food and drinks but it was not cheap. Next time we go, I'll take a packed lunch for us all! And there will certainly be a next time."
"Written August 27, 2013",Great idea to do with kids on a rainy day!,"Ideal for little (and not so little!) dinosaur lovers, but perhaps a little too busy as everybody had the same idea of something to do on a rainy day or so it seemed...Overall a great (and free!) day out."
"Written August 21, 2013",Do not visit in school holidays,"Dreadful queue, no advice on website to bring sunscreen or hat, stuck in middaysun for an hour. Inside, more queues for new exhibits as need to pay. Unable to book advance tickets as not available. Don't bother just turning up.  Boiling hot inside, cafe packed, hot and too busy. Horrible experience. Left after an hour or so."
"Written August 14, 2013",Not worth the wait,"Waited 1 hour to get in. There was nothing much to see. Will not be going again, which is a shame as the building is beautiful."
"Written August 5, 2013",Great free day out,"We got here early, just as they were opening so there was a bit of a queue to get in.  To help us get around as we had never been we did purchase a guide at the entrance, but even though the guide seems a bit pricey its a lot cheaper than your average attraction entrance fee in London!For a free museum you don't expect TOO much, but in fact you get that and a whole lot more!  I think one of the most famous collections for this museum are the dinosaurs, and I must say that to date it is the best dinosaur exhibit I have ever seen...  it is great for adults, but I bet kids would love this part!I came mainly to see their collection of stuffed animals however as I had heard that this is one of the best collection of such specimens in the world.  While I agree that it is by far the most extensive and broad collection I have seen it lacked a few species which i have seen in other museums and even in the museums of some zoos (there is a collection of some really curious animals in Artis Zoo in Amsterdam, and some very rare / extinct species in the Natural History museum in munster, Germany - both of which included animals I would have liked to see in London).  However this was a very impressive collection, especially the larger animals and bird displays!  In terms of quality I have seen better mounted animals and these were on par even with collections I have seen in Borneo where they need to contend with much bigger humidity problems etc...  But this is due to the age of the majority of this collection.  When looking at antique mounts there are some very old ones here, although in many cases it does show.One thing which we almost didn't bother looking at because I have no usual interest in Geology is the vault room upstairs.  I think many people must think this, coupled with the stairs, as the room was very quiet.  However there are some very impressive items in here and I would recommend taking a look if you come to this museum!This is a great collection and certainly worth seeing if you have the time to spare in London, however it is in an area which has a number of places to eat around it and if there is one thing I would recommend is to eat before or after entering as it is very expensive in there...  But this is to be expected."
"Written August 5, 2013",It's free! What more do you want?,"Yes there is a queue,I waited 10 minutes but it was a Sunday morning and a 10 minute wait to see a famous museum for free is ok by me.So I decided to go on a Sunday and it was very very busy! My 2 boys enjoyed themselves and as usual we wizzed round.Lots of stuff for the kids to do and see. One thing I will say is take your own food as it is quite expensive in there."
"Written July 23, 2013",A must see even while battling the crowds!,"We visited the Natural HistoryMuseum with four kids under the ages of ten and a baby in a stroller on a hot and humid London day without any of the fans or AC really working in the museum and almost all tourists in London deciding to visit the museum on the same day... Or so it seemed!!! And yet... We LOVED it!!! Despite our slowness with all these kids in tow, we managed to visit the dinosaur exhibit, the mammals and sea life and the Darwin hall... The kids were in awe with the dinosaurs, the fun facts, the volunteers who patiently held up various skulls and listened to the kids' questions and the sheer size and authenticity of everything.  We have been through several natural history museums in our globe trotting but this is the mother of all museums!!! Truly one of a kind, cannot be beat. I would say it is the number one must see attraction in London... Just realizing the size of the life-like blue whale and taking a good look at a real life T-rex should be good enough reasons to visit. Indeed the dinosaur exhibit is incomparable to anything else we have seen and if you have a day like ours then even spending the time for this ONE exhibit is still worth it. Oh and it is free too!!! One more thing-- even though the butterfly center is not free (next door in the same yard as the museum) do not miss it!!! Plus for a family of five it was just 20 pounds and well worth the experience of seeing so many live and dazzling butterflies!"
"Written June 12, 2013",With young children a planned quick visit is best,"This was our first visit to the Natural History Museum and we probably should have planned better.  We were with our 2, 4 and 6 year old daughters and it was towards the end of our 2 day London visit so energy levels were not great.  Our initial idea of covering off all areas (albeit walking through some quicker than others) was a mistake as some exhibits had little chance of holding the interest of our young daughters.  Instead we should have just headed straight to the mammals area (which was excellent) and then the dinosaurs (good but a little overrated given the queues).  The Natural History Museum is an excellent free attraction but with young children it needs to be a short targeted visit, and any attempt to see it all should be forgotten."
"Written June 1, 2013",A fantastic London museum!!,"This is one of the best museums I have ever visited. The Dinosaur collection is truly special & definitely my favourite bit. Try to get here early or on a weekday, because the queues can be long!"
"Written May 27, 2013",Sensational Butterflies Exhibition,"I went to the Sensational Butterflies Exhibition at The Natural History Museum, the butterflies were very cool and seeing them eat fruits. You get a piece of paper to stamp the life-cycle of a butterfly on your way through and there is a GREAT gift shop right outside of the butterfly exhibit."
"Written May 12, 2013",Natural History Museum,"This museum was wonderful a great place to take children.  There were different lifeforms , the dinosaurs were amazing and some were interactive and computer generated.  The building is beautiful.  There was a section of a giant sequoia tree from San Francisco. There are stuffed animals.  Everything was just amazing. There is always a large crowd."
"Written May 11, 2013",Worst website in natural history,"Sorry I have to write this one after spending one hour booking two tickets for the main exhibition.Visiting roughly 100 pages with all the 'this page cannot be displayed' error messages, get forced to enter all my details for a one off transaction, get 2 of my cards refused by the system. Appalling!Not to mention the 'voluntary' charity contribution and the ridiculous 1.50£ booking fee -excuse me but why?- and the fact that the website does not mention anywhere before the end of the transaction that the tickets have to be printed.Must cost them 50% of their online business, good for them."
"Written April 27, 2013",Make sure you visit the 'Investigate' centre in the basement if you have children - simply superb,"We've been to the Natural History Museum a couple of times, but recently discovered the 'investigate' centre in the basement. This is simply a fantastic facility, and not to be missed when you visit London! Suitable for kids age 3 up, this is a fantastic hands-on room. There are optical microscopes, digital microscopes, scales, measures, investigation sheets and there are samples galore - insects, shells, rocks, animals. The thing that really makes it is the staff - so helpful, and the kids were absolutely fascinated. My 3 year old was addicted to looking at shells under the microscope, and my 5 year old was drawing pictures of insects, measuring them, weighing them, looking up the details on the computers or in the books and asking countless questions.This is really not to be missed - I suspect it gets busy, so try for a quiet time (early morning?) and watch out because it does shut 30mins before the rest of the museum.After 90 mins in there, I had to drag the kids out as we needed to head home - even then they pleaded with me to go back in...The rest of the museum is also well worth visiting - my children love the dinosaurs as well as  the insect section, but the investigate centre turns a good location into a fantastic one."
"Written April 22, 2013",A great day out!,"After spending an hour and more in the queue I was finally able to get in the museum and realized that wait was totally worth! A giant skeleton of dinosaur welcomes you. The entire place looks so awesome. I enhoyed watching everything from fossils, to stones & diamonds to birds etc etc. Kohinoor was icing on the cake!"
"Written April 9, 2013",Highly recommended for families with young children -  Come early,You should come early the queues are long fast (if you planning to come here weekend or school holidays ) Admission is free.  Highly recommended for families with children..But nobody will disappointing for sure. The dinosaur exhibition is - epic. This is very organized and well presented museum.
"Written February 6, 2013",Interesting.....,"Very interesting, make sure you have plenty of time to have a good look around....The dinosaurs were very impressive, and great for the kids "
"Written January 26, 2013",Time to start charging an entrance fee again...?,"Let me start by saying that I love the Natural History Museum. I want my wedding reception to be held in the main hall.  I've always loved it, since I was a toddler and now, more than 20 years later I still want to love it the same way. And it's hard.What's great? The dinosaurs, the creepy crawlies and the earthquakeWhat's not? Pretty much everything else.And yet that's harsh, because I've been to the NHM in New York and that was really Snoozeville USA. What's wrong with this museum is lack of funding to update the exhibits. Some exhibits still read ""this century"" when whatever happened clearly happened in the last century. Film references to ""recent films"" focus on Jurassic park and Godzilla. Working exhibits either don't work or don't work in a way that children who have access to iPads and the internet and google can relate to and link back to their lives outside the museum.The problem is that this has most probably come about because the museum no longer charges for entry, which on the one hand means that it is probably better frequented now than when the exhibits were new and relevant 15-20 years ago but on the other means that it isn't inspiring those visitors in the same way.I hope that an overhaul is on its way otherwise I fear the future of this great Institution and it needs to stay around because I still want my reception there...."
"Written July 7, 2014","Educational, Fun & Inspiring","I love the Natural History Museum and try to make sure I visit every time I go to London.  The quality of what is on display is second to none.  The Darwin Centre was extremely inspiring, especially to be able to see scientists at work (try to go in the week as they don't work weekends).  Everything was reasonably priced (especially considering you are in London) and the staff were all wonderful.  Old or young, there is something for everyone - there's a good mix of things to see and do.  The building itself is beautiful, and it is spotlessly clean inside.  There's everything from Dinosaurs to plants and art."
"Written July 3, 2014",Such an interesting place.,"A wonderful day at the Museum. The section of the Kobe Earthquake was quite impressive.Dinosaurs and Mammals are a must see. Possibility of interaction together with an educational approach capture the attention of the whole family. Be warned, though, if you are truly interested in the exhibitions, one day might not be enough. If you are visiting but do not have more than two or three days to devote to the Museum, it might be wise to choose the areas that interest you the most, and leave the others for another future visit. You can get an overall look of rooms and exhibitions online, print a few maps and then decide on what you prefer.Tip: don't miss the T-Rex!!"
"Written June 30, 2014",A little bit dissapointing,"The first thing that strikes you is the building itself..very grand and impressive.  The next thing is the queue to get in! I have never known having to queue for a museum before, so arrive early to get in a good position and save yourself a long wait. Once inside the entrance is breathtaking as you are greeted by the huge skeleton of a diplodocus dinosaur!   The museums exhibitions are divided into coloured zones so everything is very easy to find. The highlight for us was in the blue zone where you find the dinosaur exhibit. . A brilliant collection of bones and full of interesting facts and info! Some of the other exhibitions we found a little boring..one example being the human biology room.. although some of the exhibits are interactive. .just not in a very interesting way. The same can be said with alot of the other zones..although we did like the bizarre collection of creatures displayed in specimen jars! All in all its worth a visit if you are in london! "
"Written June 28, 2014",Fascinating place to visit!,"My young son is dinosaur nuts so The Natural History Museum was first on our list of places to visit when we visited London recently. It is vast and utterly awe inspiring! There were some great highlights, particularly the skeleton of the huge diplodocus which you climb stairs to get a better appreciation of its height and the life size model of a Tyrannosaurus rex, which roars and moves!It was fairly busy - we went on a Friday afternoon at the very start of the Easter hols - which made taking our time difficult as you're forced along a bit by the flow of people constantly rushing through it. Be prepared to have your bag searched (normal for attractions in central London) but for anyone with marshalling heavy bags, there is somewhere safe to leave these for a small charge. Can't believe this is free, however for us on a tight budget the exhibitions running at the time were prohibitively expensive unfortunately for the three of us. All in all a fascinating experience though and a must for anyone visiting central London, especially with a fascination about natural history, dinosaurs and Darwin!"
"Written June 22, 2014","A busy, but entertaining, sweltering hub of nature","To kick off this review I must point out one thing: we don't have kids. This is a review based solely on two thirty year old adults visiting.Anyhow, still reading? Good, I shall continue. The Natural History Museum was my wife's most-looked-forward-to part of out London break. Sadly it didn't turn out as good as hoped.There are two entrances to the NHM. We took the entrance that led up to an escalator that took us to a zone about earthquakes and volcanoes. This was excellent - modern, interactive, and factual. We then left this zone and completed the rest of the museum, which by contrast felt old, bland, but still factual. As my wife said, 'I remember the exact words from when I was a child,' - it needed updating. It was also sweltering hot and too busy, with myself wondering if I was on the brink of fainting one too many times.As I said though, the displays were all factual and if you haven't been there it is worth a visit, but don't expect a spaceous, modern, and interactive experience. Oh, and go through the other entrance and leave the volcano bit to last as if it was the big finale."
"Written June 20, 2014",Tips for London's Dead Zoo,"- Go the last two hours of the day. The museum is absolutely packed with school children on field trips every day of the week. So instead of going at the very beginning of the day to ""beat the crowds,"" strategically visit the museum once the kids return home from school. This way you can actually move through the exhibits without fighting off frustrated chaperones or massive clusters of teenagers. The museum is open from 10:00am-5:30pm. - Go in the side entrance by the Science Museum. Most people line up at the main door and wait hours to get in while there is nearly no line at the small side entrance. - Other than the dinos, there isn't a massive attraction at the museum. Most of the exhibits are dated and the animals' vibrant colors faded. Instead of planning out exactly what you want to see throughout the museum, I would recommend casually strolling through this one. You really won't miss much. But it is a great place to tuck inside if it is raining or for a bathroom break."
"Written May 25, 2014",good museum but very overcrowded,"plenty to see, you'll never take it all in in one attempt. queues on a saturday were roughly one hour long, it is free in but it takes a long time to get anywhere. worth a look if you have a day to spare. well accessed via the underground too."
"Written May 18, 2014",Brilliant!,"Definitely worth a visit. So much to see so requires a whole morning/afternoon but you definitely won't run out of things to see! Try to go on a week day if you are in term time because the first time I tried to go, it was on a weekend and the queue was absolutely ENORMOUS. Ended up going to do something else and went back on a weekday. Definitely worth it."
"Written May 13, 2014",Moth-eaten and Neglected,"The British Museum of Natural History has both excellent collections and exceptional people on its staff. What it appears to lack is sufficient attention from those exceptional people towards the sadly neglected exhibits.Most visitors tend to head straight for the dinosaur exhibit. On one hand, the museum has gone out of their way to add animatronic dinosaurs that really do provide an eerily life-like experience which will entertain children. On the other hand, the science represented by the exhibits is mostly a decade out of date. I could not find a single word about what is now an accepted scientific truth that birds are, cladistically, dinosaurs. All dinosaurs were depicted with smooth or scaly skin, absent the feathers that most researchers now agree that many dinosaurs had. Bones were sometimes articulated in inaccurate poses. A great many skeletons were literally covered in years of dust.Moving on to the display of mammals, it was so bad that they should literally close that section down. The taxidermy of most specimens was in such poor condition that they should be thrown away. Moth-eaten, ragged-earred, sun-faded. The panda is now a single color. The tiger is beige and brown. Signs were posted with the lame excuse that specimens cannot be replaced because they are endangered in the wild. I call BS -- there are over 10,000 captive tigers in the US alone. Natural mortality from captive animals could supply replacements for most of their ruined specimens. Nor have they done anything evident to maintain the specimens that they currently have. This is especially tragic in the case of their thylacene specimen. The animal is extinct, it would be impossible to obtain a new mount, and yet they continue to allow the specimen to disintegrate from UV exposure. The whole area is just sad.The building is good, the staff is great, and many of the collections are superb. But this museum is in bad need of a facelift, updated information in their exhibits, and a change of attitude towards caring for what they have on display."
"Written May 7, 2014",Got to be on everyone's bucket list!,"Fantastic, mind blowing, great experience! First ever visit to the Natural History Museum did not disappoint.  Arrived early to be met by queues of people waiting to get in. Despite this the curators (greeters) dealt with this efficiently and speedily,. We did not have to wait long.  Upon entering you are greeted by a fantastic skeleton of a dinosaur which takes up the grand hall! The coloured zone experiences are well laid out and easy to follow. If only history had been this interesting at school. Would definitely go back for another visit when in London again. Just not enough hours in one day to see everything."
"Written May 7, 2012",Fantastic,"I take my childen, age 8 &6, to the museum every few months.Its a stunning building & an amazing place.You could spend the entire weekend wondering around, there is SO much to see and do.My son held a held a milk snake during a live animal show on our last visit.We always take a picnic and eat it in the main hall.I really cound't recommend this place enough :)"
"Written April 10, 2012",Very interesting,"The museum is enormous and has a lot to see. I found it very interesting, it takes you back to the begining of the world until now. You can see the era of the dinosaurs, our era, the animals that live in our planet, etc.I recomend it!"

"Written January 30, 2012","Poorly Organised, Old, Crowded.","Went back after about a decade and what a mistake. Firstly had to queue up outside. Not because on the number of people but because they only let you through to the security check in batches. This I would not have minded if there was actually some sort of security check, but there wasn't! I went to present my backpack only to be ushered straight through as was everyone else. Why make everyone queue up for a nonexistent security check?Once inside we had to dodge all the idiots who insist on walking around with empty baby buggies, or buggies that just held all their coats. I got so fed up with all these empty buggies getting in the way or banging into my ankles I started counting. Only one out of every seven buggies had a child in it. I would not have minded if there was a baby in it, but why get in everyone way for no reason? This again is partly the fault of the museum, why on earth won’t you sort out a buggy park? Visitor can park their buggies and collect them when the child starts to get tired. It’s not rocket science.(That’s next door in the science museum!)Then there are the even bigger idiots who allow their children to go round the museum on bloody scooters! These idiots are both the lazy parents who obviously have no common sense and allow their kids to scoot round crashing into everyone, and the museum for allowing them in with scooters in the first place!The next issue is if you want to eat or, as in my case, just want a cup of coffee. The queue for food and drink at either the restaurant or cafe was more than twenty minutes! Why not install coffee machines and sell drinks in the shops as well? Place a few vending machines around as well you’ll probably make some money. Whilst speaking about making money, the big dinosaur in the main hall you can pay to either light it up, or to make it roar. For the extortionate amount of £10! Whilst I was there I never heard it roar at all. Here’s a tip museum. Make it a pound and everyone will be doing it. You’ll make a fortune!The biggest disappointment is how little anything has changed over the years. Technology has come on leaps and bound so surely they can provide more interactive and entertaining stuff? Maybe some will like it that way, maybe it’s just because a couple of clicks on the internet and you can see videos of real animals that are alive and in their natural habitat, rather than inanimate models and dead and stuffed animals. Yes some of the dinosaurs move a bit but not much when you consider we are in the twenty first century. Can’t they show some video of the animal next to the model or the stuffed one so we can see how it moves, hunts and why certain features have evolved.I used to love the museum, I still want to. Get someone in to run it with some new ideas."

"Written December 15, 2011",Probably the best thing in London,"Little in London is of true world-class standard nowadays, but this is one of them. The museum is probably amongst the four best museums on Earth for Paleontology, and there are some seminal specimens in the collection. If possible, if one is a true naturalist, arrange a trip to see some of the archived treasures. They makes the full extent of the museum apparent. Architecturally, it is in probably my favourite Victorian building, beautiful both within and without. It is usually overcrowded and is not especially clean, but these are ubiquitous problems in the capital, and if ignored this museum will delight. Especially good for the family.  "
"Written November 28, 2011",All you could want from a day out in London,"Brilliant day out with the kids learned so many things and didn't have enough time to see every attraction whilst in the museum as there is so much in there..Dinosaurs everywhere in the main hall, with different exhibitions of all sorts of things branching off into different directions..You need a good day or two to be able to take in everything at the Natural history museum..We took our own flasks and packed lunches, but food was available to buy!If the kids are sponges for knowledge then this place is the bees knees for your young Einsteins!"
"Written April 23, 2014",excellent for a rainy afternoon,"We visited the temporary exhibition of the sensational butterflies which was really amazing. Huge butterflies come and land on you. Be warned if you have toddlers though, saw a few who were totally freaked out by it. We visited on Easter Monday which was naturally very hot and crowded but well worth going and the main museum is free"
"Written April 9, 2014",Very busy during school holidays,"I visited the museum on the first day of the school Easter holidays and it was understandably busy. We queued outside for 15 minutes but once inside the only queue was for the dinosaur exhibit. This is the most popular part of the museum so you might queue for about 15 minutes before getting in, at which point you make your way round the exhibits on the walkway still in the queue until you emerge to the lower floor and there is more space to move around.Some of the exhibits are quite old fashioned such as the insects and birds which are in glass cases with minimal information. Although this is still a wonderful exhibit, children who are used to more interactive museums might get a little bored. The Earth section has a great exhibit on natural disasters which older kids will love. The museum has a cloakroom and quite a few cafes and shops. There is a picnic area on the lower ground floor where you can eat your own food, you will not be allowed to eat outside food in the cafes and they are quite expensive. There is a cloakroom where you can leave bags, coats and umbrellas - it costs £1.50 to leave a small bag or a coat but it's worth it because the museum is very hot in places.If you have children who are not keen on large crowds I would check with the museum as to when are the quietest times of day - I would suggest as soon as the museum opens. We went at lunch time and it was very busy."
"Written April 4, 2014",Average,"I went today with my 7 and 4 year old....not in the school holidays.  The first queue in Cromwell Road entrance was very very long.  There were 2 bored staff members just standing there. I asked if there was another entrance - there is.  The Exhibition Road entrance has NO queues but of course we had to walk all the way around the building to get there...there should be staff outside directing people.In fact, the staff issues were HUGE.  Not enough of them, not enough sign posts to tell you where anything was, so lots of walking around in circles.  The dinosaur walkway is an absolute nightmare, and this is out of school holidays.  There should be staff on there helping people as the walk round it was long and very slow.  My children were shoved everywhere, and my 4 year old was hit so hard on the side of her face her eardrum nearly burst.  Packed with impatient tourists who don't seem to have the ability to queue or be polite and just push through everyone.There is a great picnic area in the basement, but many tables are reserved for school parties so get there at 11.30am or before.All the staff without fail were miserable and very unpleasant to talk to.  Some of them were downright rude.  Many of the lifts were broken, so if you have a buggy or a wheelchair you are a bit stuffed.The dinosaur section is very packed and very very very hot, you have been warned!"
"Written March 11, 2014",Very boring,"Very boring, totally not interesting. Maybe it's nice for kids, not for adults. we went here with only adults. "
"Written March 9, 2014",Be surgical and your day will be great!,"Against my better judgement, we visited the museum during the school holidays.  I employed a skill I gained whilst visiting the British Museum.The museum can be overwhelmingly busy, it is imperitive that you arrive at opening time.  We got there 20 minutes before opening and there was a queue to enter.  You must head straight for the Dinosaur display.  Even though we got there at opening time, there was still a congested walk around the display.  On leaving the dinosaur display, the queue for new visitors to see the dinosaurs was well over an hour.Once you've seen the dinosaurs, the choice is yours.  We prefer to pick the 5 things we would most like to see, and head towards them, stopping on the way to look at displays. The museum is like the worlds best zoo, with the exception that everything is dead and stuffed.  Every type of creature to have walked,crawled,slithered or flew is available to be seen, from the Dodo, to the Blue Whale.  The amount of creatures is truly overwhelming, which is why I would advise you to pick what you really want to see.Full facilities are available, toilets etc, and there is a cloak room.Meals and snacks are hideously expensive,  if bringing a family, I would advise bringing snacks etc.The museum is adjacent to the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert so if the Natural History Museum gets too much, you can go to one of these.  I would recommend the V and A."
"Written February 17, 2014",All I can say is wow!,"What an amazing museum and it's free! It's half term so we arrived early (just after 10am) and only had to wait 10/15 minutes to get in. The entrance hall certainly has the wow factor... I felt as though I'd walked onto a film set! We went straight through to the dinosaur section as I'd read that it gets very busy. The boys loved it in here, especially the moving dinosaurs and scary T-Rex! We only had a few hours spare so we had a quick walk round to see the Blue Whale, which was found close to where the boys' grandparents live. Another wow... It's huge! By the time we came out at midday, the queues to get in and to see the dinosaurs were VERY long so I'd definitely recommend getting there early. "
"Written February 9, 2014",This place is great!,"The museum is free to enter and there are loads of really interesting things to see, consequently it gets busy, especially in the school holidays and at weekends.  I would have thought it is obvious, but if like us you can't avoid busy days, get there early.  The food is a little pricey (they have to make some money out of us) so if you don't like that, take your own.  That way you can avoid the cafe queues too.  And for anyone who reads this review then rates the museum as poor/ terrible, why don't you write to your MP asking for entrance charges to be reintroduced.  That way it will be quiet and you can keep all the common people/ families out.  THIS PLACE IS WONDERFUL - TRY AND APPRECIATE HOW LUCKY WE ARE!"
"Written January 27, 2014",a must for anyone bringing children to the city,"just wandering around the building is an experience...and its free, but its so child friendly...you could easily spend a whole day here...we ate at the restaurant was really good and good value too"
"Written January 21, 2014",Unbelievable queue.,"Attempted to visit this museum on a Saturday ( January 18th). The minute I stepped foot outside the train station, there was already one hell of a queue waiting to go in. For pete's sake, why? I have been to museums in New York and never have I encountered such things before. With a heavy heart, I cancelled my plan to visit this museum and went to other places of interest."
"Written December 27, 2013",A family day out,"Booking on line to see the Dinosaurs is a must during school holidays, its free and can save you an hour or so queuing up. Another hidden offer is for young kids, for a minimal deposit kids get an explorers backpack and safari helmet. Lots of stuff inside the backpack to get the kids interacting with the displays a bit more. Will be back at some point in the near future!"
"Written September 10, 2012",Good. Masses to see.,Liked: everything we saw.Would take days to see it all.To many of the interactive things were broken & some were a bit dated.  Needs the same revamp the Science Museum seems to have had.
"Written August 29, 2012",A dreadful experience,"We were so dissapointed with our experience at the Natural History Museum. I really hope that such a negative experience can be put down to us visiting on a Bank Holiday Monday! My partner and I arrived in London with our daughter early afternoon. We thought the Natural History Museum would be a great experience to fill the rest of our afternoon. How wrong were we! The queue  to get in was horrific - it took 45 minutes. Once eventually in the buliding we had to view the vast majority of exibits in what  can only describe as a claustrophobic queue, due to the sheer volume of people, and the bizarre layout of the buliding. Taking a decent photo was impossible - too many people who seemed to lack manners and consideration to others! On a positive note it is a beautiful building. Can see why it's free to get in though!!"
"Written August 13, 2012",A must visit museum,"Whenever I visit London, my kids insist that we visit the Natural History Museum. Obviously the dinosaurs are a big attraction 9you can book free tickets so you don't have to queue but I needn't have bothered as the Olympics meant a half-empty museum (relatively) and no queue at all. The animated dinosaurs are really good. The museum has good interactive displays, those in the human body area are good fun, visitors with kids should try to visit the basement's easily missed kids' hands-on area where children can handle fossils and play with a wide range of exhibits rather than just look at them. The huge mammals hall is well worth a look too. The museum will take all day to explore and will tire you out so plan what you want to see if you have less time.During non-Olympic visits I have found the side entrance has smaller queues, we didn't have to queue at all. In the past this museum has been very busy so go early if you dislike crowds."
"Written August 11, 2012",Brilliant for young kids,"We travelled to London for the Olympic games and were there for a couple of days. On our first day in London we used Tesco Vouchers from the exchange service to take our 4 & 2year old daughters on a bus tour around London. The Original Tour Company accept vouchers and have 3different routes. One of these is called the museum route and takes you right past the front door of the Natural History Museum. This was a great service and the kids loved sitting on top of the bus watching the world go by and waving at people. Once we got to the museum, we walked in and a tour guide called Mark, asked if we had visited before. When we said no, he pulled us aside and spent 10 minutes telling us what the best areas would be for our kids to get the most out of the museum. We were in the museum for 4 hours which absolutely flew in and we only got to see a small part of the museum. Obviously the dinosaur exhibit is a must, but one gem we found only because we spoke to Mark was the Investigate Centre on the ground Floor. This is an area where kids can touch, measure, draw, weigh, and become involved loads of different things. My eldest daughter spent an hour going round the exhibit, selecting items and drawing, measuring and weighing them, and looking at them under the microscopes. She absolutely loved it, and would easily have spent more time in there. Only negative to the whole day is that food is expensive, but the museum itself is free and you could spend days in it looking at the exhibits. After leaving the museum we again hopped on the bus tour, and then changed routes to the main route and let the kids see the main sights of London. All in all it was a great day, and I would not hesitate to take our kids here again."
"Written July 12, 2012","Amazing Building, Great Exhibits",We toured the National History Museum with our 4 and 7 year old boys.  They loved the kid friendly exhibits and the dinosaur fossils.  We (Mom and Dad) loved the architecture of this amazing building.  
"Written July 9, 2012",I cannot believe that a museum like this is free,"Do not leave London without visiting this museum. Take advantage of the low price... $0.00Excellent day out for the whole family, enjoyed the dinosaurs section the most."
"Written July 4, 2012","Great Museum, Terrible Message","The Natural History Museum has an absolutely amazing collection; there is no doubt about it. And it offers a fantastic day out. But I am afraid that I cannot stand the place.What was a museum founded by Sir Richard Owen to display the glory of nature has become a temple to Darwinism. Sir Richard's statue was in fact taken from the front and put to the back, while Darwin's was put in its place (they were actually sworn enemies). Only one explanation is ever offered for the history of the universe and living things, and that is the evolution theory/naturalism.Creationism is openly mocked, while the huge gaps in the theory of evolution and our knowledge of natural history is glossed over repeatedly. I studied the Laetoli tracks at the museum and it is crystal clear they are the feet of an anatomically modern human, yet the museum insists they belonged to Australopithecus Afarensis, which is a complete impossibility. Then again, if you have shot yourself in the foot (pun intended) by saying they are 3.5 million years old what are you going to do? If you are looking for indoctrination then this is the place - if you are looking for empirical science you will be sadly disappointed."
"Written June 18, 2012",Great Museum but Avoid School Holidays (and Wet Days)!,"Spent half a day there last week but must admit a lot of that was due to the fatal mistake of going during half term on a very wet day. It is a wonderful museum but it was very overcrowded when we visited and the Dinosaur section in particular got very claustrophobic with the crowds on the walkways. Accessabiliy was also an issue as a number of lifts were not working which caused problems for people like myself who are disabled and also caused problems for parents with large buggies having to try to go back through the crowded ""one way system"" to get the buggies back to ground level. A lesson could be learned here from the wonderful Castle Museum in York - Have a buggy park and rent carriers for the youngsters.  The museum is too crowded for these large buggies.The Earth Zone is very interesting.Maps can be purchased for £1 and they are well laid out and easy to follow. The Dinosaur section would have been a lot more enjoyable without the crowds.It is a very good and interesting museum but our visit was spoiled by the overcrowding and the ""out of order"" lifts.We had planned on going to the science museum afterwards but we reckoned that would be even more crowded so gave it a miss on this visit."
"Written May 14, 2012",Excellent museum for people of all ages!,"Visited this musem together with my 76 years old father, my brother (35) an my son (6) and we all had a lovely day. There was quite a queue when we arrived at 11. AM but we tookk turns to stand in the line and the others could walk around in the park or visit the small shop outside. Perhaps a shorter queu if you arrive at 10 when they opened. There are soooo much to look at in this museum but we started with the dinousaur exhibition, then we looked at spiders, snakes and insects for like an hour and finally the vault with beautiful rocks, diamonds, and glittering things. We left the museum at appr 4.30 PM and had then also had lunch and a coffe break in the museum. It was a perfect day and we all could find interesting things to look at. The building it self is worth a visit. Like a castle or an ancient church. An its free!! :D"
"Written May 12, 2012",Educational even for adults,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here.  The dinosaur exhibition was really educational and I have learnt much.  For how impressive the exhibits are, I am very grateful that it was free."
"Written August 16, 2011",Great for kids - but dubious dinosaur exhibition!,"Taking our nephews (7 and 9) to London for their first visit wouldn't have been complete without a visit to the Natural History Museum, and on the whole they enjoyed it very much.However, as others have pointed out, the Age of the Dinosaur exhibition is a bit of a waste of money.  It cost £28 for a family ticket and took 5 minutes to see.  And be warned - you can't take pictures in here (although I didn't notice a sign and it seems to be OK in the rest of the museum).  I was taking a quick shot of the kids with my mobile and a member of staff shouted at me....I guess they're mostly used to dealing with children!  My mistake, but even so a little courtesy wouldn't go amiss.The one benefit of the exhibition ticket was that it enabled us to get fast track access to the museum which was a big plus given the length of the queue.I suppose it was inevitable that on a Saturday in school summer holidays the place was going to be overflowing with children, and this made it extremely hot, noisy and uncomfortable for adults.  Getting a seat for the highly overpriced refreshments was a struggle, so perhaps a cheaper alternative would be to bring your own food and drink. We all enjoyed a visit to the main gift shop and found some reasonably priced souvenirs and gifts. Negative points aside, the museum is a very informative and interesting place to visit.  If you don't have children with you, I'd recommend picking a weekday in school term time."
"Written July 4, 2011","Amazing, Amazing Amazing...did I say amazing?","I've been to London more times than I can count, but whenever I go, there is always something to visit that I never did before. On my last trip to London I decided to drop in at the Natural History Museum. It is one of three large museums in South Kensington, but by far for me, the best! Getting to the museum is quite easy as the closest London Underground station is South Kensington. From there, you can miss the museum when you arrive on the street level. Inside the museum is massive and reminded me of walking through the Louvre in Paris. I spent most of my time in the Blue Zone which contained exhibits such as mammals, dinosaurs and reptiles. I particularly liked the Charles Darwin exibit and there is even a statue of him in the museum as well. This attraction is excellent for a family day out and is completely free to enter. I highly recommend it!"
"Written June 30, 2011",A bit dated and worn,"I have been to a lot of museums, and they seem to be going for a more interactive, engaging approach to their subject matter.  Not so here.  This is still very much a 1970's style of museum -  small plaques describing static displays.The museum is free, so all in all it is worth the time if you happen to be in the Kensington / Hyde Park area and have a couple of hours to kill.  Not sure I would plan a day around it, however."
"Written June 21, 2011",Well worth a trip...go early,"We (myself, my wife and 12 year old daughter) went to the Natural History Museum over the Easter break. We did not attend the paid dinosaur show so cannot comment on the value of that. We spent hours looking at the various displays...my daughter loved the dinosaurs section; we found the catwalk to be an effective way to introduce the subject (cannot resist the pun in that it provided a good overview of the dinosaurs). Considering we live near Drumheller in Alberta (home of a wonderful dinosaur museum) we had no negatives in this section. The Darwin Center is also very interesting; when the scientists and researchers are there must be even better. The were lots of thoughtful and interactive displays. In essence I could see my daughter engaging in some of the research topics and concepts. The section leading to the geology and earth science areas is interesting as well. Overall, lots to see and do.The museum is well laid out (cannot comment on food as we did not eat there) and staff are friendly if they are asked questions. It is a great place to spend a few hours; go early as it gets busy and can be uncomfortably crowded by noon. It is a good walk from the tube station but it is well signed."
"Written June 13, 2011",Great day for adults and children.,"What a fantastic place! Brilliantly done - plenty to keep you amused for hours, and all for free!! Like another reviewer, I used to get taken here as a child - and going back for the first time in about 25 years, I expected to be disappointed (As the other reviewer clearly was!)Quite the opposite - all my expectations were exceeded - I had a great time. To those who say that the pay for dinosaur bit wasn't worth a tenner (or £28 for a family) - I wouldn't know, as there was so much to do everywhere else in the museum that I ran out of time - but I will happily pay the cash next time we go for the opportunity to contribute to the overall experience which is easily worth a lot more than that.take your kids, or just yourselves - have fun and allow plenty of time to get round the engaging exhibitions!!"
"Written June 7, 2011",Great place for all ages,"We took our 4 year old son to see the dinosaurs. We are not big museum lovers but the NH museum is one of a kind. There is plenty to see and do and the free dinosaur part is brilliant. HOWEVER we also paid to get into the Age of the Dinosaur exhibition  - £10 per adult and £6 per child. And it is definately NOT worth this - we lasted about 5 minutes in it. There were a few more animated dinosaurs in a time exhibition . NOT worth the extra money.The catering facilites looked great, the lous were very clean and it was easy to get around. No need for the £1 map!"
"Written April 25, 2011",Real letdown,"I loved this museam when i was little and my dad used to take me there. We were in London today with our three children so we thought we'd hop on the underground and show them the wonders. Firstly, couldn't believe the half hour queue, all to have some bored woman shine a torch in my bag...what a complete waste of time! Never had to queue in the past. Obviously the museam is free but the extra exhibits and food are extortionate! All the areas looked tired and worn, covered in dust, broken, and i hate to say it but unless you are 5, boring. Where were all the cases of artifacts, rocks, minerals...? Never found the treasures of the earth bit....sorry but will not be going back."

"Written February 23, 2011",Great place for any day - beware the half term queues,"Queued to get in – but then it was half term and to be expected.  There are roadworks outside the Victoria and Albert museum which made the place look untidy on Exhibition Road.  Once in, very busy.  Got very hot and unfortunately because of the queues outside we were unable to leave and come back in again without queuing.  If going at a peak time make sure you have a bottle of water with you (or get one from the shop).  Overall a pleasant and enjoyable experience with plenty of things to look at and read.  I would go again but not when the kids are off school."
"Written October 22, 2010",Teachers should remember their pupils are not the only visitors to the museum and show some respect to others.,"I visited the Natural History Museum yesterday with my son.  Our day was completely spoiled by groups of noisy, out-of-control school parties with teenagers who were quite clearly completely disinterested in the museum and only wanted to rush around shouting and screaming, texting and being a nuisance to others.In the Zoology Spirit Building one group of youths were pushing a low, wooden bench like structure on wheels from one end of the corridor to the other, whooping and cheering.   The accompanying teacher just glanced over his shoulder but said nothing.  The same lack of discipline was shown by another group upstairs.  We went into the mineral gallery just to get away from them.   Groups of younger children were better behaved but the teenagers seemed to view the visit as an opportunity to show off and draw attention to themselves - absolutely pathetic.I'm not an old fuddy duddy and in fact my neighbour who is in his twenties had exactly the same experience and vows never to go to this Museum again.  The Museum should employ staff to control this sort of behaviour as it appears teachers accept this as normal behaviour and do nothing to correct these selfish youngsters who spoil things for others."
"Written January 25, 2013",3rd time to visit,It's my favourite museum in London!First the building itself is fantastic!There is a very big collection of dinosaurs and many information about them.It's also very interactive.You can discover the knowledge through screens.The collections of the gemstones and the minerals are very impressive.And the entrance is ... free !!!
"Written January 15, 2013",Dinosaurs! Blue Whale!,"A very fun visit.  Went on a Saturday and got in the queue at 9:30, the museum opens at 10, and would highly recommend that strategy.  The line quickly grew behind us and we were glad we got there when we did.  We were one of the first groups into the dinosaurs exhibit and it was very interesting and had many interactive parts to it throughout although, unfortunately, the animatronic T-Rex was out of order that day.We then walked through the rest of the museum to browse.  The Blue Whale and the Giant Sloth are both very impressive.The cafe in the main hall was just alright.  The desserts were very good but my sandwich was just not what I was expecting."
"Written January 15, 2013",What an experience,We had to queue to get in on a Saturday morning. Because it's free it's very popular with London familes as well as visitors. We were in within 10 minutes. Plenty of staff inside and outside to help visitors.I don't know what we expected as it was our first visit but we were there most of the day and returned the following day and still only got a superficial look. It's one of those places that you would return to time and time again. The exhibits from dinosaurs to volcanoes are simply world class.Weekends might be best avoided because of the crowds.Unless you're starving don't eat there. I could have got a 3 course meal outside in Cromwell Road for the price we paid for 2 buns and 2 cups of tea.
"Written December 28, 2012","free , so much to see and do","We love this as it's free and you can do so much. The only downside is the food is horrendously expensive, the downstairs cafe where the picnic area is was sold out of sandwiches by 1pm and the service was so slow, my husband ran out for a cigarette, went to the shop, on his return I still had not been served 20 minutes later. As most of the clientelle are parents with little kiddies the food prices are extortionate. I understand the rest is free so it's one way to recoup money but what was on offer was trying to be up market but was actually dire. So like most families we bring out own .The exhibits are all great, the signs could be better as people were wondering around lost, and staff were not exactly helpful. The discovery centre for kiddies downstairs was great fun , the kids enjoyed it too !! There was a 45 min queue for the dinos so we went to see the creepy crawlies instead. The staff need to wear name badges prominently and be more recognisable, our little one got dislodged from us in a crowd and she didn't know whom to ask for help."
"Written December 25, 2012",NHM - Important Information for Muslim Tourists,"Another visit to the Natural History Museum and this time a couple more tips.  The queues at the main Cromwell Rd entrance was very large but the Entrance at the Exhibition Rd was empty so use that one.There is also a Faith Room right in front of the Exhibition Rd Entrance, you cant miss it, next to the First Aid Room so you can use that for your prayers, it is a small room but there are benches just outside so you can wait if it is busy.  We didn't check the ablution facilities as we had been to the Science Museum and used one of the many bathrooms there for Wudhu.Hope that helps."
"Written December 12, 2012",Shadow of what it was,Totally gutted by my experience of this once amazing museum. I'm quite sure the research etc done is as important as ever but what the public are now allowed to see is a fraction of what it was 20 years ago. Thought the whole point going to a museum was to see amazing things. This museum is only for under 12 year olds-  you'd be as well  reading an educational book than going here now.
"Written November 4, 2012",Ice Rink open for the Winter,"We all know that the NHM is probably one of the wonders of the world and is a great trip ANY day of the year, but the ice rink outside is well worth booking up, I have given it only 4 stars at when you are a family of 5 it is a little expensive to be as inclusive as the museum has always been. One important tip, buy your tickets and print them off before you get there, it is run like clockwork, meaning everyone gets their time on the ice (just under an hour, which is more than enough) and the rink does't feel crowded and there are plenty of helpers around to keep things moving, clearing the fallen bodies etc.... give it a go and have fun, another tip, you get very warm skating."
"Written October 9, 2012",Brilliant day out :-),"WOW what a great day out, we visited on a Saturday which in hindsight is probably not the best day as it was VERY busy, we had to queue for about 20 minutes to get in (arrived 1030). What a building from the entrance hall to all the zones its awe-inspiring,  on entering you are confronted with a huge dinosaur exhibit, this grabs the kids attention straight away, The dinosaur zone is just amazing, its hard to believe these creatures used to roam the earth, again the queues were annoying to get round the zone but still does not take away from the experience.Another must see is the blue whale, my family and i just stared at the display for ages, the size of it is incredible. Yes i did notice lots of dust on top of these exhibits but SO what!! This is a free experience people stop winging at silly things, the staff at the museum are doing a great job in keeping hundreds of thousands of visitors every year entertained, well done to them all.We were at the museum for 3 hours and only got through half the zones, so put a whole day aside to really see everything.The onsite restaurant is reasonably priced for London. The toilets are clean and tidy.The museum is free to enter, the guide book is only £5 and i highly recommend buying both the adult and childrens ones as they are packed full of information and facts about the different exhibits.Reading through other reviews it makes me laugh that some people moan about the number of children around the museum!!! How on earth do these people expect kids to learn?? My kids soaked up all the information they learnt like a sponge and i do not expect them to act like they are living in Victorian times, if you dont like children then visit somewhere else!! While i was looking at exhibits plenty of ADULTS pushed in front of me, but i just let it go like everyone else should.This is a fantastic place to visit, i cant wait to return. I highly recommend all ages to visit :-)"
"Written September 18, 2012",Amazing museum for adults and children alike,"This museum is my absolute favourite destination and a place I recommend to all visitors to London. Beautiful dinosaur fossils, semi precious minerals and animal specimens frozen in time are abundant. As a child we'd visit this museum at least once a year as a school trip, yet there is plenty at this museum for adults. As a child I never noticed the beautiful stone walls, covered in beautiful carved animals. The Darwin Center is a relatively recent addition and contains Darwin's original research tomes. Windows into the core of the building allow visitors to observe scientists at work. One can't help but be inspired by the Natural History Museum. It is an absolutely brilliant and magical place."
"Written September 16, 2012",free & very interactive,"This museum is free (as many others) and very interactive. It's very nice, you could visit with children and spend all day. Don't forget to visit the (free) science museum next door."

"Written October 28, 2023",World class exhibits in an iconic building,Few words in review and five stars isn’t enough to do justice to the grandiose and the importance of this place. From inside out and outside in every part of this building and its specimens are worth seeing. The architecture of the building is super impressive. Museum is free to enter but I recommend booking tickets ahead of time. Recommend to plan half a day for the visit to slowly take in the sights and information.

Inside was great fun and so much interactive activities for the children.We paid extra for the 3D imax ‘our beautiful world’ wow we really enjoyed this well worth watching if you go.

"Written May 20, 2010",Dinosaur Exhibition!,"This free museum is in the museum district Kensington, next to the Victoria & Albert Museum and Science Museum. It is big and other sections also looked great, but with 2 boys of 5 and 7 years with a short attention span we went straight to the section with the Dinosaur exhibition. Many big skeletons, fossils, and reproductions and set-up as a walking path tour based on a (chrono-)logical information flow. A great museum experience."
"Written April 9, 2010",Great Dinosaurs,"You could easy spend a full day in here and it is easy to loose track of time. The dinosaur exhibit is excellent, great displays and children will love the live 'T-Rex'. There are lots of other things to see, travel to the top floor to see the section of a sequoia tree, it's huge. It's free to get in which is a bonus in London, plenty for kids to do also. Recommend having a look on the website first to find out what you want to see and make that your priority, pick up a map when you go in, you will spend longer in here than you think. If there are lots of school parties in avoid the indoor picnic area as the tables when we went were nearly all reserved for the schools and we ended up sitting on the floor."
"Written January 6, 2010",Great Free Museum,"2nd visit to this museum, since we first went a year ago my little boy has been constantly asking to go back to the ""Dinosaur Museum"".Dinosaur section was fantastic again but very very busy.Great day out, you need to allow a full day to go round it, or just an hour for the dinosaur section.  Brilliant for the kids, especially the animated T-Rex.  And its FREE."
"Written August 12, 2009",Good day out but have a plan.,"Make sure, if you have children you pick up the explorers pack from the information desk. It is free and will give the children something to focus on. There is a lot to see in this museum so I would suggest you go and focus on one thing. My children like the dinosaurs but make sure you go either first  thing or after 5pm when there are little queues. We usually do 2 trips and spend 2 hours there seeing the things we like and avoid wondering around, which would take up and entire day. Make sure you take the children to the basement where there are lots of microscopes and real exhibits they can get their hands on. Avoid the summer months if possible, and avoid buying food inside the museum. There is a Tesco Metro on Old Bromton Road about a 5 minute walk directly in front of the museum. You are much better off spending your money there. If the children get museum fatigue then you can take them to the science museum and go directly to the basement where there is a play area and somewhere for the parents to relax and eat. There is also a place to put your pushchairs...........Overall the museum is a good day out but you must have a plan and take plenty of refreshments with you."
"Written March 6, 2009",Awesome,"This museum is utterly awesome. It is HUGE, my husband declared we could have easily spent two weeks in there rather than 4 hours. How anyone can NOT find something in there of interest is an absolute mystery! I have no interest in war, so I didn't go to the Imperial War Museum. I'm an environmental scientist, so I DID go to the Natural History Museum, and it's fabulous. There is a such a bredth of ground covered that there SHOULD be something for everyone, unless you go in with the wrong attitude. The only let-down was the marine invertebrate section which was woefully inadequate. Even the building is amazing and I feel probably overlooked since the exhibitions are so good! The food and cafes weren't amazing but that is not what museums are about, and since it is central London and entry is free, there's nothing to stop you going out for food then back in again. And therein was another surprise - it was totally free. Our family could have easily gone in there every day for a fortnight and it still wouldn't have cost us anything. I only wish my two young girls were as interested in it all as I was. I don't think I have every been to such a good museum, and that's not because I live regionally in Queensland, because I'm a Brit in Oz who's visited plenty of British museums etc before.Our snacks at the cafe may have been quite pricey, but the museum was free for goodness sake, and they do provide picnic spots too so there's no obligation to buy at all."
"Written November 26, 2008",Great Architecture,"If you enjoy architecture, the Natural History Museum is wonderful, both inside and out.  It also has a nice collection of dinosaur bones, a large animatronic T-rex, and a nice collection of stuffed or replicated animals.The rest of the exhibits didn't stand out, and the museum caters to, and is generally overrun by children.  Worth a visit if you have younger kids, want to see the architecture, or just have some time to kill since it's free."
"Written August 19, 2007",Very very busy,"Went here first Sunday in August with 3 year old+8 year old.Arrived about 12 - long queue through security, but moved quick enough. Went to dinosour exhibition just inside the door. It was packed, and took a long time to get through. Would advise anyone with a buggy to avoid. Also once you start into it, you cannot get back out except by following the crowd. It was very warm the day we were there, and we nearly passed out with the heat.We went on the Artic trip as well. Completely overpriced, would not rate at all.Rest of museum was ok, but I'd receommend for kids aged 10+, and only visit outside weekends, if you want time to inspect exhibits."
"Written June 17, 2007",Visit a dinosaur,"We spent a very interesting day at the museum.  Our children are 8 & 5 and found alot to look at they particularly enjoyed the dinosaur section and the part in the red section about the Kobe earthquake.  We paid extra and went on the Antarctic experience which was really good fun, particularly trying on all the clothing, the coats are so heavy!! and the freezer room is interesting to try.There are plenty of places to eat and the cost isn’t too bad.  It can be very tiring walking around but there are plenty of places to sit and rest as you go around.We would thoroughly recommend a visit and are looking forward to going back again and doing all the bits we didn’t have time to do this time."

"Written March 23, 2004",Great for Kids,"I took a trip to the Natural History Museum and I enjoyed it, but my friend that was with me did not! I think this place is mainly for people who enjoy doing ""kids"" stuff, there were a lot of children there so if you don't like kids - don't go! They have a great gift-shop and some of the interactive exhibits are a lot of fun. I would recommend this museum."
