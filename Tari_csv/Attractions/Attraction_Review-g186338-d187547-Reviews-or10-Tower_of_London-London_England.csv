"February 20, 2020",A good family outing,An absolutely excellent stop on the tourist trail. I highly recommend going early in the morning to avoid queues. Go see the Crown Jewels first for the same reason. The White Tower had a great interactive room for kids of all ages. 
"January 30, 2020",weekend break,"I’ve been before but decided to get the audio tour device and it was well worth the extra money . Took my time and learnt a lot about my counties history that I didn’t know ,even the pouring down with rain didn’t spoil the day .The only down point was all the children on school days out who were not interested ,rude and disruptive.Just a note book on line it’s a lot cheaper then you can afford the Audio device .Overall it’s a fantastic day out ."
"January 15, 2020","You can spend an entire day here, and enjoy the entire day, if you like History","We bought our tickets in advance and printed them and had no issues. We came when it opened and picked up our headphones for the audio tour. We skipped the Beefeater tour as it had over 50 people in it. The audio tour takes you first through the outer walls before starting on the inside where the crown jewels etc are. If you have loads of time, do it this way. If you're in a hurry, go straight to the jewels. It was everyone's favorite part of the tour, they were absolutely breathtaking.Accessibility - There are lots of stairs and even footing. The outer walls are a long walk of stairs and uneven surfaces. The jewels were on ground level and i do not recall more than a few stairs to see them. We visited late November and it was quite chilly, I can imagine just how hard it would be to do this tour during summer, so i would choose earlier in the day if you plan to visit during the hotter months."
"January 12, 2020",Wonderful family experience ,"Our family visited on a cold, very crowded day in late December. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and loved the touch of the Charles Dickens -type actors with the Christmas theme. We waited a while to see the Jewels but well worth it. Can’t imagine a visit to London being complete without a visit to Tower of London "
"October 24, 2023",Tower of London- a historical fort.,"The Tower of London is a lovely historic monument in the heart of the city. Located next to Tower Bridge, the tickets can be purchased in advance which is the best to avoid waiting in queues. Once you enter look out for the hourly tour by the Yeoman Wardens also known as Beafeaters, the care takers of this historic fort, castle and Crown Jewels. They have lots to share if the history of all whole lived and died at the tower during its almost 1,000 year history. There are multiple museums inside and many buildings. However we recommend that the Crown Jewels, the White Tower and the superstition surrounding the ravens not be missed. We were fortunate to see lots of actors portraying kings and queens past who were dressed up and moving around the property. They kept the kids very engaged. The property has two bathrooms at different locations, some food available and lots to learn about the History of England. It can get a bit tiring for the kids, so we recommend doing this as a morning activity or a time when the kids are fresh."
"January 7, 2022",This is kind of detailed!,"Ok, so this is definitely a must see, per what everyone else has said. So I am going to focus on details because as a tourist I didn't seem to be able to drudge up a brain cell when planning this visit.  *It is not cheap and nonrefundable (although they WILL try to work on a change of date) so be sure you are going to make it and make it on time. Give yourself lots of time to get there if you are using public transport because they give you an hour window. We did go early and it was nice to beat the crowds for sure. * I wondered what to wear. Sounds dumb but I am from the desert and had this idea we would be indoors mostly but the tour is outside so you def want to wear layers. There are stairs but I think if you have comfortable walking shoes on it is fine. The indoors isn't super hot but crowded which can feel stuffy. * did I use the tour book. Not really and kind of ... shouldn't have bought it. It is lovely but to pack and bring home and didn't open it really except once to see what it considered ""must sees"". *there is coffee and little snacks inside so if you are running late you WILL be able to get some stuff inside. Prices are reasonable.* I was confused about the beefeater tour thing - you just join a tour at the hour with an available beefeater. Ours was entertaining. We got there early so did the 10am tour and THEN the jewels. It seemed still fine at that time, but if you get there at 9 you can easily see the jewels, get coffee, etc and then join the 10am tour. "
"January 2, 2020",Stunning!! But be prepared to queue.,"This is a must see when you are in London. It has so much history and there is just so much to see. You really probably need a good half a day to do it justice. One of the main attractions if not the main attraction is the Crown Jewels. They are worth lining up for and you will be lining up. It took me a about 45 minutes to get inside. That was at around 11.30 am. It is worth noting that don't think that you will come back later when the line is shorter. The staff told me at the time that the line was actually quite short and that it would get much longer later. It certainly did, at around 1.00pm the line was far longer. My advice just go and line or try getting there earlier than later. Once inside the Crown Jewels are breathtaking. With something like £3 billion pounds were of riches housed there. With such value you will be equally impressed by the vault that houses them. The doors on the vault are almost as amazing as the jewels themselves. I can also recommend doing a Yeoman Warder tour (the Yoeman Warders are commonly referred to as a Beefeaters). The tour is filled with the history of the Tower which at times can be a bit grim, but they also put some appropriately placed humour throughout as well. The tour is well worth doing.Just always keep in mind that the queues are going to be big. So be prepared and patient. They are sites worth waiting for."
"January 16, 2020",The story of London in a nutshell,"The castle of London, named ""tower"", is a must go. Highly recommended are the tours guided by the Yeoman warders (or Beefeaters, which they don't really like being named that...).If the queue to the royal jewels is too long, don't worry. It will go quickly, as the system inside is made so people will not spend too much time admiring them (there is really a treadmill so you wont stop too long!).The ravens are worth a visit, as is the White Tower and their collection of old armours.All the family had a blast here. Make sure you have at least half a day to enjoy it properly."
"August 29, 2021",Pure history,"Visited Sunday 10am on 29th August 21, had to pre book tickets which were easy to do. Easy to gain entry and pass security checks. Various hand sanitizer stations around the whole site. If you love history then well worth the visit, traitors gate, the torture tower, prison tower, the main tower with Henry 8ths armour and other kings and queens equipment. The crown jules is worth seeing and you go on an escalator which keeps people moving. Be warned lots of steep steps around the towers etc so if you struggle with steps maybe just visit and do the ground stuff. Guards on duty same as Windsor castle, ravens roam free around the grounds who are used to people. Plenty of staff around to ask questions too and gain knowledge from. Per visit it takes 2-3hrs to complete. As usual gift shops around. If you live old British history with kings including Charles 1,2 Henry 3, 8 then worth the visit."
"September 26, 2021",Triple Check Closing Times,"We were a family of 4 adults and managed to get a 2 for 1 deal which I thought made the admission costs just about worth it. We started off with a Yoeman’s Tour which I thought was very good, it wasn’t too short or too long and gave me a good sense of foundational knowledge to look around afterwards. I was very surprised at how beautiful I found the jewels however I did feel like the wording of how we “occupied” some of the jewels was a little too generous. Unfortunately we hadn’t realised that the winter closing times had come into effect since we planned the trip and ended up with only 3 hours to view the place. Which meant we missed a few areas and rushed around some of the exhibits, so do allow plenty of time to look around. In our research we read that the closing time listed was the closing time for the buildings but you would have half an hour to look around after that. This is wrong, we were all ushered out a little before closing time and they wouldn’t even allow my family members outside to wait for me until I could leave the building and were politely threatened with security which left us all feeling a little sour with the place after a pleasant afternoon."
"January 5, 2020",Amazing Historic Insight,"Had an entertaining time visiting the Tower of London 4/1/20. It was a fascinating insight into the amazing and often shocking history of London. Yeoman Warden 409 Scotts’ commentary of the events was both informative and entertaining as he sought to involve us in his talk. He even encouraged us to learn more about the history with our own research, something I know I will be doing. I actually would have liked a longer tour with more insight, more information. The Crown Jewels were breathtakingly beautiful.I would highly recommend this visit to everyone, age is no limit"
"August 4, 2021",Step back into history,"Fantastic tour of The Tower of London. I was worried whether it would be worth the cost, but it definitely was. The Beefeater who conducted our tour was fantastic, really bought the site to life with his stories and facts about the tower. The stewards are all so friendly and helpful. Definitely recommend this for children over the age of 7. "
"January 18, 2020",Brilliant family afternoon ,"Spent much longer here than we anticipated, so much to see and do. Something to fascinate all ages. Did not expect it to have a village feel. Loved the Beefeater tour, they paint an especially colourful story and get the children involved. "
"January 2, 2020",700 Years of History in One Night,We were lucky enough to get tickets to watch the Ceremony of the Keys. To think this has been going on every night in one form or another for 700 years is astonishing. We feel really privileged to see the Yeomen and honour guard perform this function. Photography was not allowed of the actual ceremony. 
"February 16, 2020",Great day out,Fascinating insight into the gruesome & brutal history of theroyals and royal visitors at the Tower. The weather was appalling sadly and much of the tour was outside so we got soaked but the day was still very worthwhile. The Yeomen / Beefeater tour guides were very entertaining whilst at the same time delivering detailed accounts of history. Recommended! 
"January 20, 2020",Love this place!,"As a Londoner, I’ve visited the Tower of London on more than several occasions over the years. Most recently when I had family over from Spain and decided to take them out to the Tower and the surrounding area for the day in December 2019. We joined one of the Yeoman tours which is hugely worthwhile if you understand English as it really brings history to life. They are always highly informative and entertaining! I love the atmosphere of the Tower and the fact that you can walk around at your leisure, stop for food etc. We went on a weekday and it didn’t appear very busy. Able to see the Crown Jewels and all the other displays without needing to queue. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here. The Tower of London is probably one of my most favourite London attractions and would definitely recommend a visit!"
"January 9, 2020",Beefeater tour was hilarious!,"We joined a beefeater tour and it was such a delight.  We spent the hour learning and laughing.  My kids loved the history lesson presented in such a fun and lively way.  The Crown Jewels were quite crowded but they had a moving sidewalk that kept everyone with a limited amount of time.  The white Tower was filled with things to see and do.  It is a very expensive place to visit, but a definite must.  "
"November 30, 2021",Can I live here? Asking for a friend,"My favorite attraction by far in London. I could spend all day here - listening to the audio guide and stalking each of the Yeoman Warders. The White Chapel is in incredible condition for being 1000 years old. You can walk through, view the exhibits (some of which even interactive) and learn about the history of the first castle. Obviously, the crown jewels are the piece de resistance. They are truly remarkable to behold in person.The Yeoman Warders are delightful and tell the story of the Tower with great personality. They are funny, knowledgeable and take great pride in their role. After all, in order to be a warder, they had to serve over 20 years of military service. This is a must go, and try to go in the morning when there are fewer people. Make a beeline to the crown jewels and you can see them close up."
"March 31, 2022",Great to do once!,"If you’re visiting London and haven’t done this attraction. It’s a good one to do!Plenty of history and sights to see. Despite not being religious, my favourite experience was actually seeing the Church of St Peter,  as it’s the final resting place of Anne Boleyn. There was a beefeater patrolling inside who took time to speak to us and it was a really nice conversation.There is no doubt MUCH to see and learn and it really is fantastic if you like your British history. However…The reason I gave four stars is because the ticket prices were quite high for what it was in my opinion. And I am also not a supporter of them clipping the wings of the ravens just to force them to stay."
"August 11, 2021",Well worth and should visit if in London,"Great day out, the beef eaters really make this experience work, not bad when you consider that this is their home. Easy arrival, (pre booking was required and timed entry) but worked very well. The talk with the beef eaters is a must and Colin who did ours (his first in 15 months )was brilliant, he bought the history alive and gave our visit content. The chapel is very moving and of course the Crown Jewels. Food options were good and lots of areas to sit and enjoy a picnic, watch your food one of the ravens had a packet of crisps off somebody before they could react. Shop had the usual tack as well as some well thought out lines to buy. Can get busy and a couple of areas have a challenging access route, hardly surprising when you take in to what the site is."
"January 7, 2020",Tower of London on 12.27.19,"The Tower of London was closed for Christmas and Boxing Day, so it was EXTREMELY crowded on 12.27.  I would recommend visiting another time.  We didn't have time to see the Crown Jewels because the line looked to be several hours long.  I would also recommend doing a docent-led tour because you miss out on a lot of history otherwise.  It was so crowded we couldn't find the location to pick up the headsets for the self-guided tours, which would have made things more interesting. I don't know if there's an ""off"" season for London, but if I were to go back, I would chose that time.  Overall, the city is extremely crowded over the holidays."
"March 10, 2020",Nice Place to Visit ,If you go I highly recommend taking the time to join a free Beefeater tour. The stories and history from them make it much more interesting. The crown jewels are amazing. I was a little disappointed that none of the rooms in the living quarters part of the castle were kept original. It is all military and weapons displays now. 
"February 6, 2020","Tower of London, Yeoman Warder Tour","First time in London, traveling solo, Tower of London is a must-do tourist stop (it really is).A brief description:  Built by William the Conqueror shortly after the Battle of Hasting almost a thousand years ago, it has acted as a fortress, prison, and royal residence.  Among other things, it currently houses the crown jewels and the central building, the White Tower, houses the royal armory, a collection of arms and armor from monarchs past.Included with your ticket is a Yeoman Warder tour.  I had no idea what that meant before taking the tour.  Short version:  It's amazing - don't miss out on this!Our guide was Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly, who is the 409th to hold the title.  They are sovereign body guards and tasked with guarding the crown jewels, the Tower, and the queen on ceremonial occassions.  They also give extremely excellent tours.YWS Kelly's tour was engaging, entertaining, and educational.  The Tower's history is storied and more than a little bloody.  It's one thing to read about it, another to have it presented to you by a member of an ancient military order with a flair for the dramatic.Hoozah!"
"February 2, 2020",Amazing experience,"Every part of this castle is great. I especially recommend the White Tower with the collection of arms and armour from Tudor era and later times, exhibition called the Medieval Palace which shows how Henry III and Edward I lived in the XIII century, and the beautiful Crown Jewels. My visit took nearly 3 hours, but I wish I could spend here more time. The Tower of London is definitely worth seeing."
"March 5, 2022",Tour with a super guide,"Fantastic tour of the Tower of London made special by beefeater Scott Kelly Beefy406, who was extremely informative, funny and engaged with the entire audience all the time, taking care to get the kids involved from the start. I’ve wanted o do this tour for years and was really looking forward t it but  I’m glad I arrived when I did as beefeater Kelly made this experience so much better than I anticipated. I’m sure all the beefeaters are equally entertaining but I would so recommend the tour experience than going around solo listening to the audio guide."
"April 25, 2022",One of the 'Must Do' London attractions.,"A very enjoyable day out at the Tower of London. Make sure you search for a 'two for one' offer, such as offered by the rail companies. We joined a one hour Beefeater led tour. Slightly corny, but full of information and history. We then queued for the spectacular Crown Jewels. (You pass by on a moving walkway, but can double back and/or stand on a raised platform for a longer look.) It only took about 15 minutes to get in, but can take longer in peak holidays. Well worth the wait. Then we checked out some of the rest of the site. All in all, three hours should be enough time. Well worth doing."
"January 10, 2020",London Bridge semi self guided tour,"We went along with the intentions of walking around and learning ourselves, however we arrived in time for a beefeater 30-45 min tour - which was a great introduction to the tower of London. We also went and saw the Raven master talk about the birds that live on the grounds. If you've got some time up your sleeve you could easily spend hours wandering around reading all the signage and looking at all the suits of armour, crown jewels etc. Deffo worth a look!"
"February 2, 2020",History and Tradition brought to life,"Don’t be tempted to skip the guided tour with a beefeater when you first enter. They are hugely enjoyable and very informative. The Yeoman Warders are all seasoned military non-commissioned officers and they bring a wonderfully earthy, humerous edge to the tour, setting the tone perfectly for a great visit. They really bring the history of the place to life.Once the tour is over, you will be left to your own devices to explore such things as the Crown Jewel collection and the Royal Armouries. There really is something for everyone here and the place is, literally, iconic.Definitely a must-see attraction if you like your history colourful and palpable."
"July 31, 2022",About 15 years since first came & lot more exhibits and new Platinum Jubilee Crown,We purchased tickets in advance for the opening time of 10am on a Sunday.  We had to queue a bit as we arrived before opening but dealt with very quickly.  We didnt bother with audio guides.  We didnt stop only for photos and reading things and looking at exhibits and things and we didnt leave till 1.30pm.  So plenty to see there and so good value.  Really enjoyed it and it was great to see the new Plantinum Jubilee crown that has been made for the Queen as the longest ever serving monarch. Highly recommend going here and making sure you give yourself 3 hours really to get to see it all.
"January 15, 2020",The Tower has not fallen,"Some people will go just to look at the Crown jewels (impressive) but the real treasure of the space are the ""guides"".  Retired servicemen with great personality recount the history of the various locations within the Tower.   Coming from North America its a treat to walk around a building of historical significance for over 800 years.   They even have a dragon!"
"December 4, 2021",Interesting for all ages,"We booked online with ease a couple of months before going. Selected the midday slot so could arrive midday to 1.59pm. We arrived 12.20 and luckily there was a tour starting 1230. Reviews were good and it mer expectations. The Yeoman was very entertaining and informative. The tour is almost a hour and all outside. You can then explore inside the various buildings inc seeing the Crown Jewels.We were there 3 hours in total. If you went to the cafe or read more going around you could easily stay longer.Lovely views of Tower Bridge and amazing buildings inside the Tower walls. Lots and lots of history, Inc horrible history! "
"March 16, 2023","Looks expensive, but when you add up what you get for your money, I think it's good value.","You get a site tour, the crown jewels, the White Tower, a museum, a church, the walls walk and the ravens. I last visited 10 years ago and was concerned the tour guides might have gone 'woke' over the years - no way.  The Yeoman Warders are just as 'salty' and humorous as they were in 2013. And they are also informative.The easily offended may force themselves to be offended, but the crowd reaction underlined that he (Scott Kelly)  hit the right notes for his audience.If you've got the time to spare (I was there for 4 hours - and I don't dawdle) get yourself along to the Tower. Great place."
"August 30, 2023",The Tower of London - Don't miss it!,"We made reservations for this tour a few months before we went. The Beefeater tour, which did not cost extra, was a fun addition filled with history and lots of humor too! The guide was very informative and told us much about the Tower facility and the history of the location and people who lived there. These tours are offered during the day (at set times) and worth the time it takes to listen. I think there were also audio guides you could rent, but we did not do those.This location houses the queen's jewels, which are amazing to see, but it also has a church, apartments, display of armour,  living quarters, and torture chambers you get to see. I would allow at least two hours, but if you want to see it all allow 3 or more. We were there on a holiday weekend which may have made it more crowded, but I bet it was pretty normal attendance for a city the size of London and the tourist who are always there."
"January 4, 2020",Fun family visit to the Tower,"Yeoman's tour was the absolute highlight of the trip to London for our 13 year old daughter.  Very entertaining and educational.  The lines for the Crown Jewels were long, but lightened up towards the very end of the day.   There was definitely enough to explore to keep us busy for the whole day.   Buy tickets online in advance to take advantage of a discount and shorter wait in lines to get in."
"March 7, 2022",Yeoman Tour - Beefy409,"We strived just as the noon Yeoman tour was due to begin, and decided to join. In short, Yeoman Kelly (Beefy409) made the Tower come alive for us, informative, amusing and succinct all delivered with a smile & a wink.The Tower is an amazing visit, Crown Jewels, the Mint, the Armouries and the Ravens, you should go - and when you do, take an hour to have history brought alive by a passionate, knowledgeable Yeoman.Thank you Beefy409 👏👏👏👏👏"
"October 25, 2023",£1 tickets - restricted booking ,You are now offering £1 tickets for those on certain benefits which is great as times are hard. However I have gone to book the £1 tickets and it’s booked up on the day I want and I’ve then gone to book it at the normal price to see if there are spaces and there are spaces. So why are you restricting spaces for those that are on benefits? 
"October 27, 2021",A good day out,"It was a last minute decision to visit the Tower of London before returning home from a weekend away. Booking online was easy and the tickets emailed to us straight away.There’s a lot to do inside and it’s really informative, it was lovely to see the queens guards doing their marching outside the Crown Jewels area.I’m glad we went but it is probably something I would only do once in my lifetime. But all in all it was a good day out"
"March 5, 2022",Fantastic!,What an amazing place! We entered and joined a tour by a Beefeater called Clive who was great at  story telling and explaining the history of the tower and buildings. Leave at least 3-4 hours for a good look round. The Crown Jewels we’re just beautiful. The history is so interesting. 
"January 9, 2020",Amazing tour that surpassed our expectations!,"We cannot recommend visiting the Tower of London enough! Steeped in history, our tour with Youman Warder Scott Kelly was exceptional! Warder Kelly mixed history with humor and was the highlight of our trip to London. The ticket price includes the fantastic tour along with admission to the Crown Jewels, the White tower and the rest of the expansive grounds. This is a must do in London!"
"August 18, 2021",Ticket prices are high but a good afternoon out. ,"We visited on a Monday in August and was pleasantly surprised that it was not busy at all.The free guided tour was worth it, along with the white tower and seeing the crown jewels.My companion is serving with the British Army and especially enjoyed learning that the beefeaters are all ex military. "
"August 31, 2020",Underwhelming ,"Overall found the place a little underwhelming. A few of the exhibitions were shut due to Covid restrictions. The grounds are immaculate though. They say to allow around 3 hours for a tour but we were done  after an hour. The Yoeman Warden advised us that they usually accommodate 14,000 people on a bank holiday weekend but this was capped at 2,500 which allowed for shorter queues which was nice. We never queued for more than 5 minutes to enter the popular exhibitions (crown jewels, torture chamber, white tower). "
"April 7, 2020",Incredible!,"I certainly did not expect to spend nearly 5 hours here, but I did! I was lucky enough to arrive through the gates right when a tour was starting, which I highly recommend (and funny!). It gives you a quick history lesson and a good ""lay of the land"" to go exploring on your own when the tour finishes. There is more history packed into this place than I ever imagined! The Crown Jewels are magnificent, of course, but there is so much more to see and learn here. I highly recommend giving yourself plenty of time to go through all of the buildings, taking notice of the age of some of these places, which for an American is amazing to experience a building that is 900+ years old! "
"August 19, 2020",Crown Jewels,"Our visit was dampened by the weather and the fact the Yeomans are unable to do guided tours. I was looking forward to this, but understand the reason why. The place Is full of history and I wish we had a better day with the weather. I would advise that even there being quiet you will still need to queue to see some of the attractions including the Crown Jewels. Not great for visiting with a toddler as many steps and they will most probably get bored inside of the building and wanting to touch everything"
"February 19, 2020",A walk though history! ,"Visited here at the weekend and was a great experience! We did a guided Yeoman Warder tour, which is free and lasts about an hour. Our guide was great he had everyone engaged and had fascinating stories and knowledge on the tower and the history behind it. We arrived early and did notice as it got to around 1pm it was very busy. We headed to the Crown Jewels first to avoid the crowds and went straight through. Would highly recommend this amazing part of history and would say make sure you leave enough time to be able to get the full advantage of the place. "
"May 31, 2021",Afternoon activity,"Visited for an afternoon, it is so well organised and loads to see! We spent 2-3 hours walking around seeing everything from the Crown Jewels to the bloody tower. A few rooms where shut which is a shame but we will definitely be back for a tour and to see the remaining rooms. The beefeaters and guards were lovely to watch. The only downside is the cafe can be quite pricy for what it is so would recommend bringing a picnic or snack."
"June 6, 2021","The closest you'll get to the Crown, without a knighthood","Firstly admission is by scanning of your ticket QR code, either on mobile device or printed sheets. There are ticket machines nearby, but don't join the queue without a ticket. You don't get to skip the line at the Tower of London, as everyone joins the same queue with pre-bought tickets. Once inside, if you have young children, you can currently take them to Knight School where they'll learn how to become a knight, albeit socially distanced. You'll then follow the route around and see all the different towers, and rooms, but if you want to see the crown jewels, I'd advise going straight to them if you arrive early, this will reduce your waiting time. There really is a lot to see and it will take a good 3-4 hours to see it all. There are at least three gift shops, an ice cream vendor and a resturant on site too, but prices aren't cheap. I'd at least bring a bottle of water and save yourself £3 for a tiny bottle of drink, Royal Palace members get it slightly cheaper. I had a very enjoyable visit and whilst I'll never need to do it again, I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't been yet."
"February 2, 2020",Definitely Must-See!,"My wife and I started our experience with a 45 minute introductory tour by Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly, the Queen’s 409th “Beefeater”. He was extremely educational and entertaining and the whole tour group loved his performance.After that, we were able to explore the different sights at our own pace. We saw the Crown Jewels, visited the Chapel Royal, the White Tower, Battlements, Ravens and more! Great for anyone, especially history enthusiasts, and families. We were there on a Saturday in February and it was still quite busy. Would recommend getting there early to avoid long waits. "
"January 1, 2020",Huge Attraction,This was the only real attraction that I spent time in during my two days in London. I bought tickets beforehand and they accepted both electronic and printed tickets. I went a little before the Tower opened for the day so I was able to see mostly everything. The first thing I checked out were the Crown Jewels which are a must see. I think I spent around 2-3 hours here and that is a lot for me since I go through museums very quickly. What kept my interest here was how large this attraction was and that we get to go into various areas of the Tower to check out different rooms and what they were used for. I did wait for the Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) tour but it was a bit hard to hear the tour guide since there were many people on each tour so eventually I went to explore on my own.
"October 14, 2020",Time to go to the Tower,"Great afternoon out at Tower of London even with Covid restrictions. Still plenty to see in a safe environment. The grandchildren enjoyed meeting the ravens, talking to the Beefeaters, climbing the stairs and seeing the exhibits in the White Tower and finally visiting the crown jewels. Although there are areas which can not be accessed due to Covid, it is still worth visiting as there was no que to see the crown jewels which are spectacular.The small cafe on site has limited menu. If you have young children bring a picnic lunch until the main cafe re opens. Hot drinks and sandwiches can also be purchased as you leave the Tower. The gift shops are open, a little expensive but some unique items can be purchased."
"February 18, 2020","Really good, much better than expected ","DO the tour!, very informative & well presented/humorous. Takes one hour. Long queue for Crown Jewels, but worth it. Cafe Very expensive, you can take your own but we got cold & wet & needed hot drinks. Could have spent more time in White Tower, will have to return. Used 2:1 entry offer by going by train, saved £30. Very well organised. Great day"
"February 6, 2022",Day sight-seeing ,"This is brilliant, if you go by train, get the two for one offer, as it is expensiveDo the walk tour with the Beefeaters as it is brilliant. Then wander in and out and make a day of it to get full value for money. The cafe was nice enough, noisy with hard chairs and hard floorsThe food was quite tasty, all be it a bit extensive, but if you are there for the day it's got to be done"
"September 26, 2021",A MUST SEE!,"I have lived in and been a regular visitor to London but despite walking past the Tower of London hundreds of times I’d never been until today - I wish I’d come sooner! I spent 2.5 hours there and really enjoyed seeing almost 1,000 years of history up close. I did the self guided audio tour as well as the Yeoman tour which was superb - Scott Kelly was a fantastic guide and really brought the place to life. The Crown Jewels are spectacular. Even more so than I thought they would be up close."
"July 29, 2022",Look out for Beefeater Dave!,Haven’t visited for 25 years so was lovely to go back. Incredibly impressive and interesting. We precooked tickets and entry time and I would recommend going early in the day before the queues for exhibits like the Crown Jewels. We met Yeoman Warder Dave who was fantastic in providing information and historical insight mixed with some humour! 
"January 24, 2020",Amazing in every way!,"There are so many things I could say about The Tower of London! My husband, two teen daughters, and myslef were here for an entire day and it was still not enough time.  There is so much to see from the crown jewels to King Henry VIII's suit of armour, the zoo and the chapel where several notable people are buried.  I love it and will be going back!  Plan at the very least to spend 3-4 hours here!  "
"June 28, 2022",So Much History in the Heart of London,"The best part of our visit was the Yeoman Warder Tours which are free to all ticket holders. It was a 45 minute, well-spoken historical tour of the tower. I recommend seeing the crown jewels first upon arrival, then queuing for these tours next to avoid the crowds somewhat.  After the free tour, we knew enough to wander on our own throughout the grounds for a very enjoyable day."
"August 8, 2021",My Family Trip to Tower of London,"We had a lovely day at the Tower this summer holidays. We were took on a tour by the most amazing Yeoman Warder/ Beefeater, who provided a hilarious, informative and entertaining tour of the Tower. The place is packed with history and so many iconic sights. A family can easily spend the whole day there. Highly recommend for family outings. "
"July 7, 2021",A Must See in London,"Most people have heard about the infamous Tower of London and its royal prisoners, beheadings etc. and even if you have no interest in history itself you must visit this site as the genuine item. It is larger than you imagine and there are multiple towers to explore and steep spiral staircases so not suitable for everyone. All the crown jewels are on display and much more. During Covid this is definitely the time to visit as exceptionally quiet and you can spend as much time as you choose viewing all the exhibits. With no queuing and leisurely exploring we needed 3 hours to see everything. Note the early closing though. Our tickets purchased directly on line were a bargain at £24 each."
"April 10, 2022",Yeomen Warders tour...highlight that should not be missed.,"Visit to the Tower Of London - highly recommended.  We had a fabulous tour from Beefy409 who was entertaining, informative and engaging. Involved the crowd and my daughter (and her toy bunny Strawberry) was able to get involved and loved every minute of it! Do not miss the tour. Good few hours spent there and another highlight was viewing the Crown Jewels."
"January 26, 2020",A long time coming,"After many visits to London, we finally made the time to go to the Tower. With so much history to absorb, do yourself a favour & get the audio guide. Learning the long history of the Tower really makes you wonder how a building can stand for so long. Also having access to The Crown Jewels & hearing that the real ones are kept at the Tower is unbelievable. This was definitely worth the wait. "
"January 4, 2020","Crowded like mad, but beautiful","It's a gorgeous place, but the crowds make it very unpleasant. If you visit with a wheelchair, get ready for a bumpy ride over cobblestones. The Beefeaters go out of their way to help and accommodate wheelchairs, but the place really doesn't lend itself to them. The Crown Jewels are cool, but the real joy for me was the White Tower museum displays and the Ravens, which have no fear of humans whatsoever."
"July 30, 2023",Be prepared to queue!,"I had visited the Tower before, but I was very young, and don't really remember much, so I decided to have another visit. I decided to do the Crown Jewels first, but even then there was still quite a large queue, but still we (me and my Mum)  joined. No photography is allowed inside the Jewel House, for security purposes, and to protect the jewels themselves. I guess the recent Coronation of King Charles III has sparked extra interest. After viewing the Jewels we proceeded to explore the rest of the Tower, seeing most of what there is to see. There are queues to see some other parts. We noticed quite a large queue at the Torture in the Tower exhibit, but we didn't go in there. As the vast majority of The Tower is outside, good weather is needed in order to be able to explore properly. We looked at the weather forecast for the days we were in London, and picked the best day for the forecast, and we were fine. Before our entry time slot we had time for a sit down in front of the Tower beside the River Thames, taking in some of the sights of the river such as Tower Bridge, HMS Belfast and The Shard, so maybe allow a little time after your Tower visit for a nice relax on the river bank with a drink or an ice cream"
"July 6, 2021",Great day out. Bigger than you think,"Really enjoyed this day out. As English Heritage members it was nice to link the Tower with other local attractions.The area is a lot bigger than I imagined and I would say to allow more than 2 hours for your visit.Some areas would not be pushchair or wheelchair friendly as you can imagine...these buildings won't have lifts as I'm not sure they were invented in 1500s.Cafe very expensive as you cam imagine. Not only because its London but also because its an attraction in London. I paid £15 for 2 coffees and 2 cakes.  I mean the cakes were lovely! Staff in cafe very friendly.Only thing that put a dampner on it for me was getting a scolding in the crown jewels exhibit. I didnt see any signs saying no photographs and as I was taking a picture of the queen's jewels I heard a booming voice behind me trying to get my attention and finally yelling at me 'no'.I was embarrassed and actually had a moment when I left the building. I went round to check if there were signs and there was 1 small sign amongst other information saying no photographs.I was stood in a que watching the guards so didn't see this sign. There was someone on the door letting us in in dribs and drabs so maybe they could mention something in future.Had a really good day though and hope to revisit...where my camera would stay firmly in my.pocket, when I next visit her majesty's precious stones."
"July 11, 2022",Superbloom- Blooming Brilliant Idea,"Had booked  online to visit Superbloom on Monday 27th June. As Londoners we had visited the Tower with a foreign friend a few years ago. Went specially to see Superbloom as we thought it a brilliant and environmental friendly way to mark the Jubilee. I wasn't disappointed. It was a well planned sea of mixed wild & perennial flowers, full of colour and insects when the sun shone. Anyone who has an interest in gardening, flowers ,wildlife and the environment would enjoy this and understand the objective. It's a natural phenomenon,  not a park with bedding, and as such peak timing of wildflowers cannot be guaranteed. I suggest those who want manicured gardens visit Kew Gardens or some National  Trust properties (which I also love). I understand  this is intended as a permanent  feature and applaud the idea of greening our busy crowded city. My only criticisms are that you do need good dry weather  to visit it as little to no shelter is available.  Also disappointed at the lack of information  on the flowers. Volunteers  were pleasant  and helpful but one was asking me what a certain flower was, I did  know but there were others I didn't  Many visitors who were interested  were asking each other."
"August 6, 2020",Wonderful history ,I have been to the Tower of London before but it was years ago I had 2 children with me who have never been before . It’s lockdown so to our surprise it was lovely and quiet for July . We loved the Crown Jewels & armoury the beefeaters were lovely to chat to and made us so welcome . I would recommend this visit to everyone it should not be missed I learnt a lot . I found out about all the exotic animals given to the kings & queens could not live at tower so london zoo was made for them and is the oldest zoo in the world . Lucky they don’t have polar bears at london zoo anymore or any other big animals . It was lovely to see the ravens too . 
"July 4, 2021",An absolute must when in London,"We went on a Sunday morning, easy to get in no queues, the staff are all very helpful and knowledgable. We paid for the audio guide which was great as it took you round a route and had more information than just reading in each exhibit. Such an interesting trip especially the Crown Jewels."
"September 24, 2021",Went on a whim and loved it,"My wife and I went to the Tower on a whim and it turned out to be a great experience. The Crown Jewels are spectacular, the views from and of the architecture were incredible and the ravens fascinating. The Yeoman (beefeater) tour guide Darren Hardy was very knowledgeable and effortlessly entertaining. Not necessarily for kids but a great way to spent a few hours in London"
"February 2, 2020",One of the best attractions in London,A must when you in London. Amazing history of our country. Crown jewels out of this world and to think they belong to us. Give yourself plenty time as i rushed it a bit. I know everything is money these days but always pay that bit extra for the audio guides well worth it tells you a lot more than reading the guides. No good if you bad at walking or have a bad back etc. Loads of steps and hills to walk. Staff where great as when i bought my ticket online sometimes best way of course. My ticket had a problems but the guy sent me to ticket office they sorted it straight away within a minute.
"August 12, 2020","Fantastic place, enjoyed every minute.","Now is the best time to visit this amazing place, with no crowds and no queues.  Such an interesting and beautiful place. The Crown Jewels, Beefeaters, Ravens are unmissable.  They are even participating with ‘Eat out to help out’ so half price off food and soft drinks - unto end of August (but you have to tell the staff that you are dining in, to get the discount). Extremely safe with hand sanitisers everywhere and social distancing.  Top up water bottles before you go as all of the water fountains in London are turned off."
"July 30, 2021",Superb,"What a joy, the history of the Tower was brilliantly represented by the well-organised tour, exhibits and signposting. Despite some iffy weather our yeoman guide (Basher) was highly engaging, bringing history life for all ages. The contrast with the miserable representatives of Westminster Abbey we had just visited could not have been more stark.  No wonder the Tower is rated #1.  Ps hurry while there are no queues for the Crown Jewels!"
"June 1, 2022",Very busy and very expensive,We booked a trip to London and this was the first place we visited. A family ticket was over £80 for 4 of us which was really expensive but then it is London.We went during the May Jubilee week so this probably made it busier than usual. The queue was right around the tower back near the ticket office. The queue inside for the Crown Jewels was just as long inside. We did a couple more bits inside after that but we’d have been there all day if we’d tried to get into all of it. Too busy and too many people to appreciate the attraction. Attendance midweek in low season when kids are at school would be highly recommended to get the most of a visit here
"January 9, 2020",A great morning - the beefeater tour a must.,"My teen enjoyed the beefeater tour immensely - she described it as engaging & entertaining and admitted she learnt a lot!Our beefeater tour guide, Scott Kelly, was both entertaining and engaging as well as amusing and informative. He spoke clearly and loudly allowing everyone to hear and enjoy without straining.The 2nd highlight were the Crown Jewels, and being January there were no queues so we could take our time to enjoy and appreciate them."
"February 27, 2020",SO glad I rang up beforehand to ask which tour to do.... saved a lot of money and got to see it all!,"We were taking 2 American friends to the Tower so I wanted the best deal.. so many websites! so I rang the Tower directly.. told, book on line directly with Tower website, you save money, time (don't need to queue to change your ticket over before entering) and Beefeater tour is free any how!Due to very noticeable lack of tourists in London at the moment we walked straight in! the 'boys' had a long and very informative talk with 2 of the very friendly and knowledgable Beefeaters, we walked around the Crown Jewels display with only about a dozen or so others! so we just took our time looking at them all more than once.  Apart from one local school group in the White Tower, that was very easy to walk around and see everything in it.More people had arrived by 11.30am so we went and had a very tasty soup and bread snack lunch and one of the jam tarts with crown stencil in icing sugar on... we couldn't resist! not overly priced at all.   The loos were very clean as well!We then walked around the other areas at a very nice leisurely pace.  We enjoyed the Walter Raleigh moving projection in his cell.We were there over 3 hours and if we hadn't booked to go over Tower Bridge we'd have stayed longer.I'd not been for decades... it was a real treat to go back as a mature adult and see it all again.... fabulous place to visit.. so much history to impart and somewhere our American friends found fascinating and immensely enjoyable to go!"
"January 2, 2020",Enjoy the space and sights!,"One of the strange upsides to visiting during these ‘Covid’ times is the lack of fellow visitors. If you’ve ever wanted to enjoy the Tower and all it’s history now is that time. We visited today, 11am on Saturday 24th October and enjoyed unrivalled access to many of the towers, grounds and of course the Crown Jewels. To visit these normally requires extended queuing, crowds and bustle with no time to enjoy. Today we could spend as long we wanted admiring royal treasures dating from centuries long past. The ability to stop and chat with unhurried and friendly Yeoman Warders was well worth the effort, they’ve always got tales to tell!Go while you can and enjoy the limited visitors and leisurely pace and progress around the Palace!"
"October 24, 2020",More than what we expect,It was one of the attractions included in the London pass. We have no regret to visit it as it was more than what we expect. The historical site  is rather big and we spent an hours plus to just walked around. All the buildings were really well maintained and in its original shape. We actually just a small group of people where there was tour guide  explaining the history of the building. Very interesting. Worth the time we spent there.
"April 11, 2020",Just Wow,"First of all, just wow. This was a fantastic day out in London and was well worth the price. We got there early with little to no queue to get into the place which was ideal. You would definitely need the whole day to properly go and look at all the magnificent displays and buildings on offer here. Unfortunately, we decided not to have a yeoman warder tour, which was completely a wrong choice as I have heard their tours are outstanding, so I would recommend waiting for the tour guide and going round with them before venturing off and finding your way around. Once you step into the buildings, it takes you straight back through the past, they are surprisingly well kept and very well preserved. The crown jewels were an absolute marvel to look at, though the line was long it moved very quickly. Overall, a spectacular day and will be coming again to have a proper tour."
"July 9, 2023",To many visitors admitted,"Even though we pre-booked tickets, we had to queue for 30 minutes to get entry. To see the Crown Jewels would have required another 60 minutes queuing with no timed access. Overall they had admitted far too many people and all of the exhibits were overrun and difficult to see."
"December 30, 2022",Worth a visit,"Have been wanting to go for a number of years and was very happy that we went. Was made to feel very welcome and all the beefeaters were friendly and happy to chat. I felt that the to the staff this was not just a job but a passion and they wanted to be there, this was evident to how they served the guests with humour and a smile. The only things that could made quicker was the queue to the Crown Jewels and the restaurant only took cards cash not allowed, not made clear until you are at the till with trays full of food.I would like to thank all the staff for making everyone welcome please keep it up you are appreciated by us guests."
"August 28, 2021",The best thing to do in London,"Our Yeoman Tour guide was one of the best guys I’ve had anywhere ever. The tours, which are included in admission, start every 30 to 45 minutes. My group was lucky enough to get Shandy (or maybe it was Shady).   The tours last about 45 minutes and I ended up spending about six hours walking around the grounds. For me, it’s the best thing to do in London."
"October 23, 2022",Well worth a visit,"We only had a few hours, would highly recommend to anyone. If you visit? Make sure you go on a beefeater tour - ours was Barry Stringer, he was extremely knowledgeable, passionate about what he does and added humour along the tour. Also a mention to Louisa, who also had passion for what she does and the knowledge she has is brilliant. The only downside to this visit? Was the queues for a coffee, it needs better organisation, I felt sorry for the guy serving us under extreme pressure and people stood there tutting because they had to wait. Other than that? Great day out for all"
"August 15, 2021",A brilliant place but too much rain ,"The tower is possibly my most favourite place to visit and it still is but we didn’t have a great visit last time. This was not due to anyones fault but the weather was appalling. It was heavy, continuous torrential rain and there was no indoor seating available and the outdoor cafe was just doing takeaway drinks. Our shoes had to be thrown away after our visit. It was such a shame as we had booked our tickets so far in advance online. We will just have to go again when all of the restrictions are over "
"February 24, 2021",Interesting,"It’s always very busy whenever you go, usually heaving in fact. Nearly all the loos closed for maintenance which isn’t great planning. Cafe is hideous. My youngest (5) got shouted at by a guard for leaning over a fence. No signs saying do not touch or do not lean over, suspect it was for the theatre but he was very upset. He wears it like a badge of honour now though."
"March 1, 2020",Sight seeing ,Great place of history. Expect to climb a lot of stairs if you wish to see everything. Go early and see the jewels with very little wait. Any time if the year go early and there will be less people. Listen to a beefeater tour they have so much personality and are fun and knowledgeable. A must see if you have never been to London. 
"January 9, 2020",Historical Brilliance,If you’re interested in the history of this country and what came before then this is such a brilliant venue to visit.The staff are absolutely fantastic at painting a story of life in those times the crown Jules exhibition is absolutely fantastic and well worth queueing to see.We loved the ravens and the story behind them.We should be very proud of our country and our history and the progression that we have made forwards the royal family is a very important part of our history and our future.The Tower of London stories I’ve just fantastic and a very Walls is steeped in history.
"May 3, 2020",Beautiful castle ,"Who wouldn’t want to come here and explore the old prison and see the crown jewels? We came on Sunday afternoon what was but pity because we couldn’t enjoy their restaurant for too long as they close the castle quite early so we had to hurry to see everything. But as we have the membership card we will definitely come back. Inside you can see also the armours, prison, medieval dresses and have the audio guide who explain everything. "
"January 26, 2020",So much history!,"We only spent several hours at Tower of London as we had afternoon tickets to Westminster Abbey.  We could have easily spent a good part of the day at TOL. There is so much history and storytelling.  It was also raining the day we went so our Beefeater tour was held in the chapel but that was okay by me - I really wanted to see where Anne Boleyn is buried and she’s in there.  Definitely do a Beefeater tour - they are incredibly informative and entertaining.  The Crown Jewels are like nothing you’ll ever see in your life - go straight there if you have morning tickets to beat the crowds and you can view them a few times. Henry VIII’s armour is a sight to see, as well.  Buy your tickets online, get a bit of a discount and order the guidebook at the same time to also save a bit of money.  The only place you can’t take photos is in the Chapel.  Also, be careful of the steps inside the White Tower (especially the medieval punishment section) if you’ve been out in the rain. My husband slipped due to wet shoes.  We had an awesome time at the Tower and hope to spend a lot longer there next time.  "
"September 2, 2020",Amazing attraction - and so quiet,"Visited the Tower on Monday, first time for all but my wife. Thanks to COVID-19 (one tiny positive), it was very quiet with a maximum of 2,500 visitors that day vs the usual 14-15,000 in August. Amazing place and the Beefeaters/Yeomen Warders were so friendly and happy to tell us more about the exhibits, their experiences etc. It’s a shame to see London so quiet but, selfishly, made our visit extra special as no fighting with the crowds. Highly recommended."
"April 20, 2022",Long lines,I really feel like they sell too many tickets for this experience.  The amount of people and the amount of lines and just feeling like you're being herded like cattle make the experience not worth it.  We didn't even get to see the Crown Jewels because the line was so long.  I would not recommend this experience to anyone who wants a relaxed time - it's more stressful and crowded.The talk that the worker gave in the middle of the square was probably the best part of the whole experience.
"January 2, 2020",Great day out,"We had a lovely day out visiting and arrived early to avoid long queues for the Crown Jewels which we did. This advice was off the back of watching the TV series which my 11 year old thoroughly enjoyed. I recommend visiting for a wonderful day of so much history all in one place. The only negative is the extortionate food prices which is a shame, so would recommend bringing your own lunch."
"February 18, 2020",So much history in the center of London!,"We went first thing in the morning on a busy late July day and we were able to get in to see the crown jewels with no wait at all. This was quite an amazing exhibit to see. We then perused the grounds and grabbed a cup of coffee at the cafe. We then headed out to see a Beefeater tour. While I though our guide was funny, the stories they tell are quite gory and graphic, so much so, we skipped out after the initial speech. This tour is not for the weak-stomached or sensitive-minded. This was disappointing to me because I had heard so much about this tour. We diverted to take a self-guided tour of the White Tower and this was actually an amazing experience I almost skipped. I would say the White Tower is a must see. We only had a few hours here, but there's enough to fill a whole day here."
"April 13, 2020",Superb,"I did the ceremony of the keys in the tower of London, a ceremony where the tower is locked up in the traditional way. This has been taking place for the past 750 years or so and happens late in the evening. I would clearly recommend trying to get a ticket for this, definitely a unique experience."
"October 9, 2021",Simply amazing,"We knew the Tower of London was one of the top attractions here in London, however, the history and the crown jewels just blew us away.  The most important thing is to get the beefeater to give you a tour. Every hour on the hour there is one available just inside the main gate you will see a small crowd gathering around him. They are the most entertaining and funny lot . Facemasks were requested to be worn inside the buildings but not outside. The Crown  jewel area was the most crowded but everybody kept trying to adhere to the social distancing. The  jewels are very real - there are coronation crowns etc decorated with the most amazing precious stones among which are the largest diamond  and the second largest diamond in the world. Unfortunately no photography is allowed. Everywhere else you can take pictures. The Armory in the White tower is incredible  should not be skipped. When you’re done with the tower of London, take some time to walk along the wharf to admire the Tower Bridge that’s very nearby."
"January 8, 2020",Excellent Visit to Tower of London,"We visited the Tower of London in the late afternoon about 2 hours before closing.  We walked the grounds ourselves and enjoyed the scenery, information, and shops. We did not participate in the guided tour as we wanted to be certain to see the Crown Jewels before closing but stayed with it for a few stops and felt it would have been a good tour to continue if we had the time.  The exhibit that included the jewels was amazing as were all of the pieces of armor and armament on display.  Overall, well worth the price of admission even if though it was an abbreviated visit."
"February 16, 2020",Absolutely amazing ,If you love history The tower is a must.  We opted to wait for the guided Yeoman tour which was amazing. Our guide was very informative and hilarious. Unfortunately I don’t remember his name but he was brilliant. It is so impressive. The Crown Jewels exhibit is a highlight along with the white tower. You do need about 3 hours to see everything There is so much to see and it has a lovely cafe you can stop at for lunch or a snack. The food is good quality and reasonably priced. One of the highlights of our London trip 
"February 4, 2020",Call me old,"Call me old but my visit was less than perfect. At issue isn’t the contents of the castle (they’re extravagant and masterfully displayed). Remember, your looking at 1,000 years of history!My issue was the huge (literally)amount of uncontrollable elementary schoolers that ran rampant through the exhibition. Entire classes of students crammed everything. This was particularly true of the Crown Jewels & White Tower exhibitions. The noise and outright congestion and disruptions were too much. I’d would also suggest that the audio devises and user interface need simplified. I can’t believe how old I sound. But I’m not.......scary!"
"April 16, 2022",Pay a fortune to stand around in queues,Didn't actually get to see the crown jewels on this visit as queue was approx 2 hours long. Lengthy queues to enter most of the attractions on the day we visited including a lengthy queue to enter in the first place ( with a pre-booked ticket and time slot) At £79 for 2 adults and 1 child I feel this was an absolute waste of time and a total rip off. Do yourself a favour and visit one of the many free and wonderful museums such as the Natural history museum or Victoria and Albert instead of this money grab. Poor show.
"January 4, 2020",Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. 4th Jan 2020 10:00am tour,Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly led the 10am slot tour for a relatively large group. He immediately grabbed the attention of all attendees with his enthusiasm and detailed explanation of the history of the place. You can tell he really enjoys his job and because of that we also enjoyed the entire tour. Well done Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly! I thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Huzzah!😎
"February 21, 2020",Very interesting ,"I hadn’t been to the tower for over 40 years, so was looking forward to it.You should definitely take advantage of the free Beefeater tour which lasts around 45 minutes (you need to have paid the general admission price to access this) - it’s very informative & you get a real insight into their history. Obviously, a real hi light is the Crown Jewels, but I loved going up the towers & also seeing the armour and weapons, and reading about the prisoners and executions! You can really spend a good few hours exploring & the cake in the cafe is very good! A great experience, worth the money in my opinion."
"January 26, 2020",Long,"If you care about history, you will enjoy it. Definitely buy audio guide for 5$, without it, you won't even know where you are going. You will spend minimum 2h there, prepare for it, cofee shop and toilets are available so thats not a problem."
"February 18, 2020",Grisly Tales of the Tower,"A brilliant tour led by Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. He is a raconteur par excellence with a wealth of grisly historical knowledge about the tower. I did consider knocking a star off as I'm not sure his claim to be the best looking Yeoman Warder since their formation in 1485 can be historically verified. However, staying for photos with the children in the rain at the conclusion of the tour gets him a full 5 stars. "
"January 2, 2020",The Amazing Tower of London,"Just had a wonderful day at the Tower of London. I can’t speak highly enough of the Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters). They were amazing with my 4.5 year old daughter, taking both time and interest in answering her many questions and signing her Paddington book about the tower. She can’t stop talking about them and what a great day she had. Special mention to #398"
"December 28, 2022",Great tour as always,"Took the beefeater tour 10 years ago and loved it and did it with a friend again this time and it's still one of the most entertaining tours. We had Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly for our guide and he's great! He gave special attention to all the kids on the tour, which I'm sure made their day.Line for tickets across the way was very long and a bit confusing as there were ticket booths for other sights in the area as well. But once you have a ticket, there wasn't a line for entrance into the tower. Crown Jewels was also not super busy the day I went.All the yeomen and other people who work in here were really responsive to random questions about the place and history and were very knowledgeable with answers!"
"February 24, 2022",Significant history well maintained,"Pre-booked online, arrived at customer service desk to plan our visit (as signed outside) but they explained they were significantly reduced due to the pandemic. The entry queue was short and moving so no problem. Most areas were accessible, would have helped to have staff members inside some rooms for Q and A, the Crown Jewels were impressive and well labelled. We skipped the White Tower due to a lot of steps!"
"September 13, 2021",Tower tales,I have been wanting to visit for years and finally got the chance. Amazing place the only negative is the ticket price. We had a most amazing tour by Yeomen Scott-Kelly 409 who brought the tower to life with his great explanation and fun talk of the life in the tower over the decades. Highly recommended to listen to the tour guide tales as makes it more real and you can appreciate the history more.  Lots of areas to investigate and gain knowledge.
"January 30, 2020",Never tire of the Tower,"Every visit to see family includes the Tower (they aren't actually IN the tower).  I could probably do the tours myself after so many visits, but I never miss it.  Where to start?  Well, every day is busy there, so start early.  Just to sit and look at the wonderful history is enough, but seeing just how amazing each building is from the inside should not be missed.   The Crown Jewels lines are usually long, but move fast.  Take a walk around the front of the Tower along the river...with the magnificent Tower Bridge before you.After your visit, catch the Thames Clipper back to Westminster, or start your trip to the Tower from Westminster and enjoy the views."
"July 29, 2020",second great visit to the tower of london,we had a gret second visit here with our historical castles and palaces ticket. Each place we visited and each talk we had was fascinating. The beefeaters were humerous and facilitating and stimulated the imagination. the food was tasty the exhibits well presented and glorious and ravens present! much to be recommended.
"July 16, 2020",Not for children under school age ,"I have to say, despite best efforts, I was a little disappointed here. The castle grounds were immaculate and the staff wonderful, however the entire experience was just so dull! I am a big lover of history, but this place was stuffy and boring, it’s not curated well and brought nothing to life. Nothing interactive whatsoever. Most rooms/parts were closed due to Covid, which is understandable so we could have missed something. If so, my apologies. I thought there might be interactive displays or video clips detailing the history or something to give the castle more context. Instead there were just dull text panels which are aimed at adults really. It’s a shame. This was my first visit to the place and I’ve lived in London all my life. Brought my 4 year old as he’s obsessed with castles, knights at the moment. He enjoyed seeing the armour. Also a note to say the way they have organised things in response to Covid is admirable, they’ve done a great job! If you haven’t been and always wanted to visit do so now as there were hardly any people and no crowds/queues at all. "
"August 28, 2020",An absolute gem of a place.....,"Visited today, with a 10am pre-booked ticket. It was eerily quiet, but we obviously took advantage of the shorter queues and limited numbers.We've walked past the Tower of London numerous times, on numerous previous visits, but the crowds always put me off, so today was perfect.I absolutely loved the visit. Fascinating, quirky, and the Yeoman Warders were fabulous. The Crown Jewels were utterly stunning, and almost worth the admission fee alone. Loved reading about our amazing history, and interesting past. My teenage boys were interested too, and enjoyed the suits of armour in the White Tower. Well wirth a visit, especially with reduced numbers. We left at 1 and most places had queues to get in."
"February 4, 2020",Yeoman Warder Terry Briggs a complete star,"We managed to tag onto a Beefeater tour that had just started and were very lucky to have Terry Briggs as our guide.Fascinating facts about the Tower delivered with a great sense of humour.Top bloke and a credit to the Tower of London experience.The crown jewels are very impressive. One of the exhibits explains the diamond, history and how they cut it etc.Probably spent 3hrs at the Tower. (thought the food was a bit pricey)Arrived via Thames Clipper which is a great way to see London."
"October 29, 2022",History by the bucketload,"Despite being a busy half term Friday we enjoyed our Tower visit. It was well organised, in terms of queues and managing people and although very busy it did not feel uncontrolled or unmanageable  at any point. The sheer history of the Tower is outstanding. To realise you are standing amongst something which has played a part in history for more than 900 years is absolutely staggering.There are a lot of stairs which isn’t ideal for those with limited mobility however accessibility wasn’t a thing hundreds of years ago :)Without a doubt the star attraction is the Crown Jewels.  Made all the more relevant by an upcoming coronation and recent events. Do not miss them. I would happily line up again just to see the Cullinan diamond.The chapel shouldn’t be missed either - the list of those interred there is a “who’s who” of historical figures. All in all not to be missed. I had no expectations but it’s fair to say I was blown away by what I saw and would visit again in a heartbeat."
"June 23, 2022",A brilliant day,"We recently visited the Tower of London and had the most brilliant day. We got there early which was great as it wasn’t too crowded and we avoided some of the long queues we saw later. The Crown Jewels were spectacular and the history in the various exhibitions and museums was mind blowing. The highlight of the day for us though was the Beefeater tour. Our Beefeater tour guide was Mark and he was absolutely fab. He was funny, knowledgeable and brought all the History of the Tower to life. We have been watching the TV series on the Tower which we have really enjoyed and seeing and speaking to some of the characters from the series was excellent. It’s no wonder the Tower is one of  the best sightseeing experiences in London it is well worth a visit. "
"November 4, 2021",A fantastic historical attraction.,"We booked online and got our dates muddled and turned up a day early it was sorted easily with no fuss. We joined Gary for the Beefeater tour and he was fantastic, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and funny. The queues on the day were non existent and getting around every area of interest was easy and hassle free. We saw all the main exhibits, the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, the Bloody Tower and time to get photographs with the Ravens. Well worth the money."
"July 10, 2022",Wonderful,"Went to superbloom yesterday. It was fabulous! The flowers were stunning. It was really worth the money. Only drawback, which they do say on the ticket, is if it gets hot the slide will close. Staff let grandchildren on as for one go they were shutting it and they loved it.  But I would say it was a huge design flaw.. metal slide. After all the effort put into the beautiful walk and displays this was a basic mistake they should have solved  as they expected it to happen. Go early in morning in late in day to avoid disappointment of that being closed. But flower display was really beautiful"
"January 19, 2020",A trip through history,"What a great experience. We pre-booked the tickets on the Tower of London's website and arrived just before they opened. It was so interesting and immersive, the crown's jewels were gorgeous and the exhibition was quite impressive. We learned a lot of different facts and really enjoyed ourselves."
"April 7, 2023","Simply put, a must-do","Easily one of London's most popular attractions, a visit to the Tower of London (it effectively describes the entire stone fortress) can be at best a very entertaining half-day out but it can also be a trying experience depending on the weather and/or the crowd.  We visited in December, when the weather was brisk (the rain stayed away, thankfully) and crowds were minimal and queues were fairly short and moved quickly.  We also got in when the gates opened, so managed to move around easily.  We signed up for the yeoman warder's guided tour as it was the only way to visit the CHapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula - each tour is slightly different but all are highly informative and educational, albeit presented in an  entertaining manner (extra credits if you're selected to be 'insulted' for your nationality), and ours was no exception.  And while the Crown Jewels (no photography allowed) are high on most visitors' list of things to see, there were lots of other historical parts of the grounds worth visiting.  We also took some time to walk the fort's ramparts to enjoy views of the River Thames.  There was only one indoor cafe, and that was rather crowded around lunch time, but there was an outdoor one for snacks.  It's hard to estimate the amount of time needed to see the ToL - we were there for just over four hours which was adequate to see all the attractions."
"April 15, 2022",The Treasured Tower,"The Tower of London is one of my favourite London experiences; I never get tired of it. We brought our two daughters here in March during a school break, as previously, I'd only been twice - as a boy with family, then with my wife before kids. And it was truly a terrific experience for my 11 and 7 year old daughters.  They enjoyed the White Tower with all the cavalry and weaponry exhibits, and they enjoyed the coin-making exhibits which had a pleasant and unexpected surprise of the staff giving us a bit of a private history lesson!! Yes, there are some dark tales surrounding this place, that's what gives it its mystique.  Great views on the battlements, and in the centre of the courtyard with Tower Bridge in the backdrop, so plenty of photo ops to be had. And it goes without saying that the Crown Jewels are so breathtakingly beautiful, we even went on the conveyer belts twice since we went at a low tourist time (on a Weds. no less)."
"September 3, 2021","Much more than a ""Tower""","After touring the Tower of London, I would call it the 'Walled Town of London"".  Certainly there are towers within it, but it's so much more than that, with many buildings, fascinating exhibits, amazing architecture and offering great vistas of the city outside of it's walls.  This is definitely a ""don't miss"" on your trip to London, but you'll need at least half a day to see it.  You can take photos inside and out, so be sure to bring a good camera.  "
"October 2, 2020",Trip with the kids,"Brilliant, went for 11am on a Sunday, quiet to begin with, would recommend seeing the Crown Jewels first, there was no queue when we arrived but had to wait 10/15 mins to enter later on.  Could still see the Jewels without anyone in the way which was great.  There was a lot we didn't get to see so will go back.  Kids really enjoyed it, especially the scavenging Raven!"
"April 20, 2022",The Most enthusiastic tour I have ever had,"What a fantastic day! Was met at the start by Yeoman Scott Kelly #beefy409 and was immediately immersed in the experience with his great enthusiastic tour, engaging the group and getting the kids involved. My daughter was so attentive listening to him and loved every second of it. This place is steeped in history and is worth a visit, can easily spend the day there, take time talk to the Beefeaters, the staff, the entire team. Was welcomed and safe. Can not fault and already planning a return trip. Highlight was the Crown Jewels and the girls meeting #Beefy409 who over the Covid lockdowns provided online contact for them to learn from whilst at home. A great day out, worth the travel! Two tired girls at home in bed now."
"July 14, 2022",Fascinating place - well worth a visit,"Very much worth booking a ticket online and visiting this great place.  I would also recommend paying for the audio tour, makes for a much more emersive experience.Its interesting learning about the history of this castle but the highlight is definitely the UK crown jewels.  Long queue which moves pretty quickly but its worth it to see such a magnificent collection.Highly recommend visiting here."
"February 11, 2020",The Yeoman Warder tour is a MUST do! Makes the place come alive,"Yeoman Warder Lawrence was an AMAZING tour guide. One of the best tours Ive ever been on, so full of information, story telling finesse and witty humour! Without a tour, a lot of the history would be lost on you so i strongly recommend it. The armoury and crown jewels didn't take that long. Would have loved more information about the chapel, not that much signage. Exhibits were modern and kid friendly."
"February 16, 2020",Must-see for the history and the Crown Jewels,"Definite must-see if you’re in London! Arrive early, and see the Crown Jewels first before the lines get (very!) long. Stories about the history of the Tower are great—don’t miss the raven keeper! We participated in a (free) tour with actors dramatizing some of the history, which was well worth the time. The visit to the central tower, with exhibits on arms through the ages was also worthwhile. Plan to spend at least a half day here, more if you’re a history buff."
"January 18, 2020",Fascinating Historical Place,"Overall a very enjoyable tour. Lots to see and lots to do. Many galleries and art and war memorabilia/ artifacts from ages ago. Lots of history with all the different Kings and queens and beheadings with Ann Boleyn and Henry VIII - so much royal drama I can’t remember half of it but quite fascinating. There was a secret tunnel that goes under a moat out the other side back in the olden days. You can also see the London bridge from there Tower of London. It’s very bland and unsuspecting compared to the other bridges. The two tower bridge many people associate with the long bridge but in fact it’s not, the London bridge is off to the side and very unassuming.We had a nice tour guide and then a beef eater finish the tour. He was humorous and a bit crass and condescending towards America, but most Brits are and have no shame in it. Apparently to be a beef eater is incredibly prestigious and one of the highest honors in England. He gave a good tour overall and just the tower itself has so much history it’s just crazy. The tour wasn’t terribly expensive but it wasn’t cheap. Overall one of my more favorite places to visit and tour in London right behind Stonehenge and Salisbury Cathedral. Highly recommend you give it a try and definitely recommend the beef eater tour. "
"August 30, 2020",Fantastic,Definitely worth buying ticket on line to skip the queues. If you are visiting London I would thoroughly recommend a visit to the Tower of London. Founded. In 1066 this UNESCO world heritage site sits in the banks of the river Thames. The history surrounding it and played out within its walls cannot fail to interest adults and children alike. The Crown Jewels are also housed there - book ahead as there is always a queue. Great shop and lots of cafes in the area. It is a fantastic day out.
"April 2, 2020",Outstanding,"The Tower of London surpassed our expectations. We arrived around 10 and headed straight for the Crown Jewels, which are unbelievable. After that we joined a beefeater tour which was incredibly informative and funny. Take the time to see everything, and don't miss the altar, and if possible, leave the White Tower for last as it is filled with a vast array of items which will appeal to everyone. One of the best attractions I have visited anywhere in the world, a fairly cheap at around £25 in advance. This would be the main thing I would recommend to anybody visiting London."
"March 8, 2020",So much history in one place,Enjoyed a great half day at the Tower although I feel I should have planned on more time as there was so much to see. Great guided tour by Simon the Beefeater. He really brought history alive with his unique and humorous narratives. The Crown Jewels were breathtaking - so much gold! 
"August 4, 2021",Loved the Yeoman of the Guard tour,An absolute must for history lovers.  You can’t help but be impressed and fascinated by the history of this place.  I would highly recommend doing the free Yeoman of the Guard tours that start from just near the entrance every hour.  The guards really bring the history of the Tower of London to life.  I would head straight to the Crown Jewels room after the tour as the queue seems to build up after each your ends.  It’s amazing to see all those famous jewels up close.  It’s very straightforward to buy the tickets from the official palaces site and you can choose a time to visit.
"November 29, 2021",900 Years of History,"There are centuries of history here, dating back to William the Conqueror. Try to arrange a tour, led by one of the Yeoman Warders, if you can. The Ceremony of the Keys happens here, the single oldest continuous military ceremony in the world. It happens around 10 PM and only lasts 15-20 minutes."
"March 28, 2022",Awesome,Special visit to London for my wifes birthday and both being of a slightly mature age and having never visited out national treasure we were looking forward to ticking the Tower of our bucket list. Arrived early on a Wednesday morning and there were very few visitors so we were able to visit the crown jewels without queing. We brought a recorded tour so that we could wander at our leisure and not miss a thing. Beefeaters were resplendant and very approachable as expected and not forgetting the other staff in their splendid regalia who were also very knowledgable and friendly. Lunch was taken in the New Armouries Cafe which was reasonable priced apart from the cans of soft drinks at over £2.40 was a little extravagant. Spent a full day inside soaking up all the history and treading in the footprints of those famous occupants. Must visit place at least once in your lifetime.
"March 31, 2020",Beyond the expectation!,"It's highly suggested to visit the Tower early when people are not crowded. The tower itself is amazing with great history. The place is very well designed with one way direction, you will not miss the things. The highlight is the museum in which displays all the Monash priceless jewels, of course the photo is not allowed. Also, you will see the great view of London city, the Tower Bridge and so on when walking on the top of the tower."
"January 2, 2020",Best Family day out!,"I haven’t been to the Tower of London since I was young on a school trip back in the 80’s, it’s so much better now. 1st piece of advise I would give is pre-book online, you will get a discount and won’t have to queue to buy tickets. The tour by the Yeoman (beef eater) was utterly fantastic, a ton of humour and a bit of historical gore. My 6 year found it hilarious especially that she watches BBC “horrible histories” it’s no different, as I’ve noticed some of the negative comments about the level of gore used, that’s the history of the Tower, you can’t change or hide from it, just learn from it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. "
"January 4, 2020","Always interesting to visit, go early!","This was my third time to the Tower, always full of history and interesting. We did a tour with the beefeaters which I’d highly recommend, it’s a free tour and definitely worth it!I can’t stress enough that you need to go to this attraction right when it opens and head straight to the Crown Jewels. The lines become crazy about and hour or two after opening. We went on a Thursday morning and were able to walk right to the Jewels ( at 9:30 am), by 11am when we left the site the line was gigantic. Go early! "
"March 3, 2020",Always Worth It!,"This was probably my 10th visit to the Tower, but it’s always the first stop when I bring friends to London.  The Tower just never disappoints — 1000 years of history in one spot!  This time we met the Raven Master, which was a special treat.  The Crown Jewels are always brilliant, and I love the addition of animal sculptures that are in tribute to the old Menagerie.  The history of the Tower is so fascinating — I never run out of info to share with my friends.  Once again, an impressive first day in London!"
"October 30, 2021",Full Day of History ,"This was a fantastic day out on its own!  Tip: Start immediately at the Crown Jewels as the queues get massive later.The place is huge and there is so much to see, read and take in.  My husband and I arrived with our 6yr old in the October half term and used our Go City passes for entry which saved us a significant amount of money.The famous sights including the Ravens, the Bloody Tower and Crown Jewels were fantastic and we were amazed that people actually lived on site!  Highly recommended trip!"
"July 10, 2022",Waste of money!,"Tower of London and Superbloom 👎🏼 Don’t waste money paying for superbloom you can look at it from outside Tower,unless you absolutely love 4 wild flowers repeatedly planted.The Tower of London offers not much for the money. Lots and lots of stairs and exhibits were very poor. The Crown Jewels 💎 were rushed on an actual conveyor belt so you can’t look at them in detail. The queue for this was very long and exhibits as you walk through the building were boring.Wouldn’t waste your money!Boring for children."
"January 20, 2023",Family Visit to enjoy,"The Tower of London is truly unique, it’s such an amazing place to visit.  Built by William the Conquerer. So much history.  Loads of items to view. The Crown Jewels are a must.   My complaint is about the beefeater tour. I couldn’t hear what the guide was saying, he was making jokes during the tour which I found irritating because I was interested in hearing the history of the Tower. Because of the  cold outside we were given the talk inside the chapel where Ann Boleyn is buried,  When our guide finished his talk, he marched us out of the chapel immediately, we were not allowed even Five minutes to view where the wives were buried, or to view the plaques on the walls. I did ask if I could have a minute to absorb the whole atmosphere of the place and to enjoy being in such a historic place, but he demanded me to leave at once stating that another tour was ready to come into the chapel!! This was not true, because when we were outside I noticed the following tour was not even near the chapel. We could have been left to enjoy our historic location even for five minutes. I feel I paid a lot of money and Ann Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey are so famous wives of Henry 8th , it’s wonderful to think one is actually standing beside their graves . The graves are cordoned off but there is a nice piece written about all three if one was allowed to even read that!  It unfortunately spoiled my visit.  This Tower belongs to the people who pay good money to come and enjoy it. Therefore we should be allowed enjoy it."
"January 1, 2020",Last Tour of 2019,"We arrived at 2:15pm and the line for the Crown Jewels was over 2 hours long, so we decided to skip it due to the 4:30 pm closing time.  There was Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) tour starting, so we decided to go with that and were privileged enough to be on the last tour of 2019 with Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. The tour was amazing and YW Kelly was full of information, history, comedy, and of course, good looks. After the tour, we went into the White Tower at YW Kelly’s suggestion and it was amazing and definitely not to be missed!  When we finished at 4:25pm, there was no line at all for the Crown Jewels, so we were able to squeak in and see them in 5 minutes.  5-10 minutes is all that is really needed for this, but definitely no photos allowed in here. All in all, I highly recommend the Yeoman Warder tour and the White Tower. Get there early and allow more time as there was a lot more to see than we could squeeze into our 2 hours there. #beefy409"
"February 17, 2022",Great day at the Tower,"We arrived at the Tower just as Yeoman Scott Kelly was about to start the guided tour which I would thoroughly recommend. I’ve done the tour a few times over the years and it’s always informative, great for adults and children alike but most of all very funny. These Yeomen have been there and done it and they are full of personality and can tell a story. All that aside Scott said he got the job because he looks like Paul Hollywood Thanks for a great tour Scott 🧁 🍰 🎂"
"February 21, 2020",Ceremony of the Keys,"For years on my bucket list has been to see the Ceremony of the Keys - the ceremonial closing of the Tower of London each night. Once they put this online I was able to book (it was 20 months in advance!) and finally tick off my wish.Doors opened at 9.30pm and we were given a very witty and interesting pre-tour escort by one of the Yeoman warders. The ceremony and its history was explained in the atmospheric Tower confines. Standing by traitors gate on a cold and damp February evening, picturing back in time certainly gave me the shivers!The ceremony itself was everything the British do best - I recommend if you can being at the far right of traitors gate, facing Wakefield Tower, for the best views. You are standing for about 40 minutes so the old and infirm, or very young, might find this a bit hard work. I really recommend it, if you get the chance, it felt like a privilege to witness a ceremony unchanged in 700+ years."
"February 20, 2020",Incredible historic site!,"The amount of history that is preserved and shared with the public is incredible. The Crown Jewels, the armoury, the animals, the cells, there is so much to see. You can take your time and wonder around, you can do an audio tour as well. There is a commemorative book that you can purchase for 5 pounds"
"February 11, 2020","Definitely NOT value for money, sorry.","My friend  and I Visited the Tower today, but it wasn’t really anything like we expected. It’s just a glorified musuem. I paid £25 a ticket, it was supposed to include The Crown Jewels, but the queue was ridiculously long, at least a 2 hour wait, we are in our 60’s and would never be able to queue that long. there should have been set times to queue for the jewels, There were no Yeomen guided tours, assumedly because if the pandemic, so all we saw were a few exhibits, a few information plaques and not much else.We treated ourselves to a scone with cream and jam and a cappuchino each and it came to a whopping £14! And they even charge a fiver each for the audio guides! I know they have lost millions due to lockdown, but these prices are just extortionate!A waste of money in my opinion,"
"October 28, 2020",Really disappointing ,While we were expecting changes due to covid - one way systems and extra queing time we were not prepared for most of the attractions to be shut. The buildings inside were crammed with no social distancing and no staff presence to enforce sense and order and the route forces you to walk your children through two gift shops which adds insult to injury when already paying full price for half an experience.If you want to visit I would wait until things are back to normal  
"September 26, 2020",A must see and do when in London!,I visited the Tower for the fifth time in my life in November as its my favourite historical place in the UK. Anyone visiting London for the first time should make this place their first location to visit as its where London really all began in 1066. It encompasses the history of our country in one location with so many memorable events and so many tales to be told by the excellent Yeoman of the guard who conduct the excellent tours. Lastly a visit to the Crown Jewels is a must as they are breathtaking and displayed in a memorable exhibit. A great value day out for all the family especially good for children to provide them with a better illustrated understanding of English history.
"January 2, 2020",A must see on a London visit,We were fortunate to visit on a cold weekday in January. No crowds do our ability to see and enjoy exhibits unencumbered by long lines made the visit delightful. I highly recommend purchasing the audio guide. The Cafe was reasonably priced with good options for a snack or lunch. 
"January 7, 2020",Nice day out ,"We had a really good day out to the tower today. You have to book in advance and we booked the 10.30 slot, if you can definitely book early as it got busier in the afternoon. We waited 10 minutes to see the Crown Jewels and 20mins to access the white tower. Wait times were considerably longer by the afternoon. The staff are doing a great job managing access to ensure social distancing is maintained. Almost everywhere is now open with the exceptions of the church and the Beauchamp tower. Be aware the HRP cafe is closed and only a Gourmet Sausage outlet is open so queues are huge and the food was atrocious. £6.50 for a bratwurst in a role, very poor quality and definitely not worth it. If we had know. I’d have brought food in with us. This was the only part of the day to let us down. "
"August 26, 2020","Thousand Year Old Architectural Treasure Stands Invincible, on the Banks of the Thames","My most recent encounter with the Tower was on a surprisingly sunny afternoon in January. I was at a distance, actually, looking across the Thames from the south bank. I was walking along the embankment, indulging in a slow gaze sweep across the river to the north bank when my eyes spotted the Tower. This imposing many towered castle fortress stands on its own grounds and therefore is not swallowed by nearby London skyscrapers, but gleams white and solid with the river before it. What a sight it is, in theatre slang, a 'real show stopper'. From my vantage point, I didn't see the crowds that cluster and walk through the castle daily. I've been one of them a few times, though, and can vouch for the inside being as impressive as the outside. Go early, before the doors open, and get in the queue before it becomes a long line that stretches out onto the streets of busy London. Inside you will see the crown jewels of many past rulers of England as well as the present Queen Elizabeth. Also on view are the armor of Henry VIII and other important medieval artifacts, including instruments of torture used to extract confessions during the centuries when the Tower was used as a prison. You will learn the history of the Tower .as you walk from room to room (It was built by William the Conquerer shortly after he invaded England in 1066 as a fortress and monument to his power and governmental reign.).Don't forget the ravens. There are six of them kept on the grounds at all times in deference to an old belief that it is good luck for the Kingdom's present and future; conversely, the ruination of the Tower is certain if the ravens are absent, and the Kingdom will fall, according to the legend. If you are lucky you will see one or more of the large, black feathered, yellow beaked creatures.You will definitely spot the red uniformed, white ruffed Yeomen Warders, who are another of the Tower's iconic figures, a combination castle Royal guard, keeper of the Ravens and the grounds, and guides for visitors maintenance. These women and men are hospitable, full of information about the Tower and have full, humorous personalities, no shrinking violets in that group! Plan a half day if you want to take it all in and go as early as you can. Or book an advanced ticket on the Tower's website and get a timed entry plus a tour. Well worth it."
"January 28, 2020",Great piece of English History,"Yoeman tour was free and really good, entry ticket cost £24 when booked online. The displays and exhibits are very good. Would have liked to see more dungeon type stuff as the info on that was limited but overall a must see. Crown Jewels line was very long...,.,"
"September 20, 2020",Average day but very overpriced for what you get,Recently visited the tower Of London. Found the ticket collection and customer service to be great. The tower itself is split into several different sections which are very interesting to visit however nothing exceptional to what you would get in a museum elsewhere. Some areas of the tower were closed during our visit and the tours could have been more interactive. The pricing of food in the restaurant was poor and some hot food items were cold and had clearly been stood on the counter for a while. the overall quality of the food and drink served was disappointing for the price I paid. overall an average experience which I was hoping would be a lot better.
"March 17, 2022",Don't MakeTower of London A Priority Visit...,"Having learned much about the Tudor Era and some specifics surrounding the Tower's historical significance, my husband & I looked forward to this visit with anticipation.  Given we were in London for only 3 full days, we worked to prioritize our itinerary of activities to make the most of our time, and this visit made the list. Upon entering a little after opening time, we decided The Crown Jewels should be first to visit as the line was forming and getting longer quickly.  Our wait time was 20 minutes and we were inside.  After weaving through a darkened area with no real order (people just wandering in every direction), we made it through all the displays within 20 minutes.  Fully disappointed!  There was not one tiara on display and absolutely nothing on display from the current House of Windsor. Nothing worn by Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Princess Diana, King Charles, etc was there to be seen. My impression was ALL Crown Jewels resided here when not in use... and apparently, I manufactured that thought in my imagination because nothing was there.  The very best part of this visit (in our opinion) was walking the ramparts for the views inside & out, and witnessing the Ravens.  Even the torture things you hear so much about was just one room with 3 replica examples, and that was it. Bottom line = if you have a lot of time in London, by all means, make a visit. If you are short on time and need to narrow your choices... SKIP the Tower of London and choose something else in its place. "
"October 27, 2023","A real ""Jewel"" great slice of History. Arrive as early as possible. ","I have been here many times. I have visited during the day and the evening keys ceremony. It has a fascinating history, and this is best brought to life by taking the Beefeater (Yeoman warders) tour. They do this in rotation and each has a slightly different style. The content is interesting and delivered with dark dry humour, that sits well with people who have finished a military career. Don't miss out on it.Couple of tips. Of course the Crown jewels are incredibly popular, as is the Tower in general BUT if you arrive as they open then it can be surprisingly quiet until the groups arrive.Single tickets are expensive but there are always ways to save, buy joint passes or even memberships. It is still worth it and a must see.Even the Café isn't bad by major attraction standards.Expect to spend a few hours and a lot of tours don't allow enough time whilst not getting access to the free Beefeater tour.Must see.

"January 27, 2020",An excellent experience,"We visited for the ceremony of the keys where the tower is locked up for the night. This is after the tower is closed to the public and is a guided visit with in our case about 20 people.It was a fascinating experience which made me realise that royal ceremonies cary on whether any one is watching or not, in this ones case for each day for over 700 years.It was made special by the yeoman warden (acting as a guide) who was both informative and humorous.One thing to note is that the paths are cobbled so not the easiest to walk on.If afterwards you want to get a taxi you need to arrange a car to pick you up afterwards.There is a taxi rank opposite the entrance but no taxis and trying to flag a taxi down at that time of night is nigh on impossible."
"August 23, 2021",For history lovers,"As a history lover I just loved this place. There are a lot of things to see, one can spend 5 hours there or more..., the location is fabulous with views to the Thames river and the Tower Bridge.  It is a must see place for those who want to learn more about English history and to see the jewels of the monarchy. Recomendable to go first time in the morning and when you get in to go straight to the jewels tower because otherwise a long queue will be formed. "
"January 1, 2020",Well worth a visit,"Visited this early Saturday after pre  booking tickets and time slot , fairly quiet at the start so managed to see Crown Jewels and armouries at our leisure . Very informative and interesting, the best part was the yeoman tour lasting around half an hour but well worth doing as Yeoman Mat made it funny and interesting , even for our teenage son . The knowledge he had was amazing . Can’t recommend this place enough for all ages .🤩"
"July 31, 2021",Tower of London 1st visit,"Visited 4/1/19. Excellent visit would recommend the tours included with the ticket. Our Beefeater was funny & very engaging with the kids and provided a very animated tour. We spoke to a guide just in the entrance to the White tower (didn’t get his name) as my daughter wanted to know more about Ann Boleyn. He was very knowledgeable & was a credit to the Tower staff who obviously enjoyed his role & had a real passion for the history associated with the Tower.  My daughter was thrilled with the information. The Raven tour was funny & we didn’t realise that they weren’t trained but wild birds. Would definitely say worth a visit, history really brought to life."
"January 8, 2020",Best thing to do in London!,"The best thing to do in London! The Tower is amazing, for history lovers this place is filled with endless tales of intrigue over a thousand years. We visited first thing on Sunday morning and it was very quiet so probably a good time to go if you want to avoid any crowds or queues. Audio tours are available but the free tours from the lovely Yeoman Warders are highly recommended. We had Yeoman Warder Kelly and he was fantastic! Incredibly gifted story teller and very funny, spoke loudly enough for us to hear, kept the little ones entertained and got us all joining in at the appropriate moments with ""Oooh's"" and ""Aaahs"" and the occasional ""Huzzah!"". The Yeoman on a whole are what make this place so special, they are all absolutely wonderful, very friendly and happy to chat and take photos, it really made our trip just that little more special. The place itself is brilliantly accessible with great facilities - plenty of loos and baby changes, great cafeteria and lots of different gift shops. We had a pram and just had to take it in turns going into some of the attractions due to spiral staircases (which is understandable in a place this old!). Even if you aren't in one of the Towers, just being in the grounds and soaking up the atmosphere of the place is amazing. The Crown Jewels and the White Tower are the obvious places to see, however the Royal Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula is a particularly special place as the resting site of Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey (to name but a few), and the Beauchamp Tower where you view the hand carved graffiti in the stone walls from prisoners long ago. The medieval palace in St Thomas' Tower is also very interesting where you can view the Tudor renovations added in time for Anne Boleyn's coronation and also the supposed murder site of Henry VI. As an avid history fan I've visited the Tower many times, yet I still think it is the best tourist attraction in London, it never looses it's shine."
"January 16, 2023",A return visit.,"I’ve visited a couple of times before but wanted to bring my husband and step kids for the experience.The price for a family ticket was just over £80. It’s quite pricey but was a treat for us. We booked online and only had a short wait for our online tickets to be scanned at the entrance.I think we got on the best beefeater tour with Beefy409 giving an excellent and animated tour. I’m very much into my history but he gave enough information for the kids to get the gist of the tower’s history without them getting bored. The queue for the crown jewels was the only thing that kept us hanging around and we waited just over half an hour to see them. Once inside, you weren’t rushed and could go back on the conveyor belt to look again if you so wished.We went in each and every tower and climbed MANY steps. We had excellent weather so we were happy to spend the day there.There are plenty of places to get things to eat but prices are premium. That said, it’s a great experience that must be done."
"April 21, 2022",History everywhere. Love it.,I have to say the visit to the Tower of London didn't dissapoint. It's such a magical and historical place and getting to be there and visit everything it was a privilege. Even though it was winter and we got a rainy day we were able to visit almost everything inside and I would totally go back and explore more. You need at least 3-4 hours there to be able to experience everything. The Crown Jewels exhibition usually has a long wait time in the queue as it's very long so I would recommend you to go first thing in the morning to the Tower and go directly to that exhibition and then continue with the rest.We had lunch there and even though it was not cheap it was worth it.
"January 24, 2023",Very crowded but worth it,"Do not visit on a weekend or holiday. The best time is go there is when they first open on a week day.  By 11:00 am the line to see the Crown Jewels will be over an hour. By 1:00 pm it will be close to 2 hours. The white tower in the middle is a must see. The armor and weapons are amazing. The bloody tower has a nice, short video on the top floor explaining how it got its name. The walk around the wall can get crowded, so be prepared for that. There is not a restaurant inside, and you cannot renter once you leave, so plan accordingly. "
"January 5, 2020",Much too Busy!,Couldn’t believe how busy this place was. Queues everywhere. No chance to look properly at anything as people behind were just trying to move on all the time. At £21.50 concession to get in I felt I hadn’t seen enough in detail to get value for money. 
"January 8, 2020",Perhaps expensive but so worth it!,"It’s such a long time since I visited the Tower of London and at £67.50 for the two adults and a child you couldn’t call it cheap. However, it was SO worth it and I’d recommend it as a day out that is great value for money. Shame the Coronavirus has reduced numbers so much and also makes the cafe and refectory not worth opening, but it’s a small point. "
"June 20, 2020",Arrive early ,"One of the MUST dos in London at least once, this place was a joy to explore. We took about 4 hours to feel like we explored enough of the grounds about 85%.  We really enjoyed the crown jewels. Truly breathtaking. Tip, arrive before opening to get in line. If you have an e ticket purchased through trip advisor or Get your Guide for example, you'll still need to line up in a separate line to obtain a physical ticket.They don't inform you until you're at the gate so beware. We waited in 3 separate lines before we finally got in to the right one with the right form of ticket. More signage could really avoid this. No photos of the crown jewels allowed but you can stay as long as you like. Again another pro tip, go straight to the crown jewels upon entering as a separate line will form quickly for that building alone."
"March 21, 2023",Fun Day and the Tower,"What a wonderful day at the Tower of London! This was by far my favorite place to visit. It is filled with interesting history and fascinating stories. It is the prefect spot for the entire family or any group. They have interactive museum exhibits for the younger children to help engage in the content, along with plenty of video narration  for those who want to keep a brisk pace. I would definitely recommend purchasing the audio guide which will set you back about 5 pounds. Note- this  is a tower and so there are steps stairs everywhere."
"September 8, 2020",  A Magnificent Setting,"  Situated just behind the Thames river,  the tower  commands impresive views of Tower Bridge, and the more modern skyscrapers.  A mere ten minute walk from Tower Hill tube station, you just follow the signs around & down the side, to the entrance.  You enter across the moat, and work your way up to Traitors Gate.  You can stop off to get a free map / a reasonably priced guide book.  Both the entrance ticket and guide book, need to be booked in advance; for social diatancing numbers.  The smaller areas of the palace are cordoned off, but there is still a lot to see.  The medieval expense of the bedchamber and chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, show the different fabrics used by royalty.  This contrasts sharply with the small plain chapel, and leads sharply on to the executions area.     Most people (inculding myself), go onto the White Tower next; built by William the Conquer.   Here you see the brutality of the middle ages, with a marvellous armoury collection.  Later leading to mixed weapons, such as the mace gun; and then jewelled weapons (both donated and confiscated).  This leads to the Crown Jewels, with its own escalator to take you past the main collection. The slowest escalator in London!  Other interesting bits to see are the Grenadier Guards, with their bearskin hats.  The guards drill on the sound of the chimes, with another guard down the far end.  Be sure to keep your hands to yourself, as the one Grenadier shouted out 'off the trees.'  They used to keep animals under ground in cages, as well as people in the dungeons.    None of the water fountains are on, due to the pandemic;  but there is a icecream seller as you come out the Crown Jewels building.  There's also a cafè, and three gift shops, as well as giant ravens in and out of their cage.  It'll take over an hour and a half, to two hours to get around; with many winding steps.  It's great to see, and I would do it again.  If you want to go to other palaces, you can upgrade your ticket, to an annual membership.  This'll give you access to six palaces (not all in London), for a year.  You can do this upto two weeks after you buy a regular ticket."
"January 2, 2020",Thank goodness for Horrible Histories and the wonderful Tower of London!,"Family visiting from Norfolk and this included an eleven and eight year old.  Needed somewhere to keep them occupied for the day. I’d visited the Tower many times in the past but not recently.  It was so good to see it was as popular as ever and I’d warned family there will be a lot of people, so expect queues.   We didn’t join any of the beefeater tours as we had our guide books and we knew that the kids (fans of Horrible Histories) wanted to see the chopping block on the green, and the tower where prisoners were incarcerated (their words!) and of course Traitors’ Gate.  They were fascinated by the prison walls filled with prisoners’ names and comments, and the Crown Jewels, after quite a wait (time went quickly by spending with it with Q&As) were spectacular.No time limit so we spent most of the day there and weather was glorious  - we’d taken food and drinks so only needed to spend money on additional snacks and items from the gift shop.It’s such a shame that some reviewers have given this venue 1 star for reasons no related to it - one even had a run in with TfL staff and reviewed it on THIS site!"
"August 25, 2023",Always a good experience,"As a local, I’ve been to the Tower of London many times over the last 20 years and I always have a good experience. This time I took my children for the first time and it didn’t disappoint. I highly recommend the Yeoman Warder tour, which is included in the ticket price and starts every 30 mins, to help get your bearings and learn about some of the gruesome history of the Tower. The other “must see” is the Crown Jewels as well as the chapel.  The queue to see the jewels is always long but it moves fast so what looked like an hour wait actually took around 20 mins. This time we only spent 2 hours here due to kids’ attention span, but we have stayed longer in the past when in adult company. Ticket price is not cheap, but compared to other London attractions gives relatively good value. (The gift shops, on the other hand, are outrageously priced)This is definitely worth visiting if you are on a tight schedule and want to fit as much British culture into your itinerary as possible."
"February 22, 2020",Great piece of history,"The tours of the tower are great and delivered by Beefeaters who are passionate about history. It really helps bring the place to life. The crown jewels are a great place to visit, it's a piece of living history right before your eyes."
"February 2, 2020",A Must See!,"I work in the museum field in the US and I think this was the best tour guide I have ever had the pleasure of guiding me through history.  Our beefeater was simply amazing.  Funny, knowledgeable, personable, and did I mention hilarious?  Just a fantastic tour.  Keep up the amazing work you are doing to tell such incredible stories from history.  I highly recommend for anyone and everyone."
"July 4, 2021",Best part of London,"A treasure trove of history surrounded by the modern world, the tower was the best part of my London trip.I would recommend getting there for the opening of the the gates to see the royal guard and the beefeaters perform their ceremony, and on any trip there you need to go to the crown jewels as your first stop. I was lucky to get right in but the line does build up quickly.The Fusiliers museums and white tower were both splendid with armours from the past"
"August 26, 2020",Still inordinately long queues for the Crown Jewels,"This is the time to visit such attractions as the Tower of London they said. The prospect of much shorter queues than usual because of the current shortage of tourists both from overseas as well as home-grown. Perhaps too many heard such news because apart from little to no queuing to get in the main entrance the queues to access the Crown Jewels this afternoon wound several times in front of the building housing them before heading downhill for about half a mile. Fortunately the queue for the armour collection in the White Tower was shorter than usual but some upper floors were, I think, closed."
"August 14, 2023",A London Must See,"The Tower of London complex is a fascinating place and somewhere you must visit while in London. The place is quite sprawling, with multiple buildings and other structures worth exploring. The best way to attend is via an online ticket, which gets you into the complex and allows access to everything, including the Crown Jewels. Also included is an excellent audio guide, which is quite valuable in navigating the rather large space. Be sure and take advantage of the Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) tours. The Warders deliver an informative and entertaining history of the Tower. Note that these tours commence every half hour just inside the Tower entrance and are included in your entry ticket. Here are a few other notes. The Crown Jewels queue can be VERY long, up to a couple of hours, so try and go either early or late. They feature a nice cafe and a couple of gift shops. The Tower Bridge is a short walk away, so you can see the bridge right before or after your day at the Tower. I'd budget a minimum of 4 hours if you want to take in most of what the Tower site has to offer."
"May 23, 2021",Living History.. ,"As historic venues go, there's few to beat the Tower of London. With a date range of active service from its origins in 1080, through to its present day roles, there's a lot of history to explore.There's been a lot of improvements to the venue over the years and now, in the age of Covid, it's a wonderfully well managed place.Social Distancing is implemented, online bookings required and lots of sanitizing stations available.Masks are required in all indoor spaces.The displays are well organized, laid out and lots of information about each exhibit.The Tower remains an absorbing, intriguing attraction and continues to fascinate and entertain. "
"November 18, 2023",Crown and Coronation Tour,Crown and Coronation Tour duration for tour is 9days. I went on the first evening. Son has a Nimbus Access Card which indicates unable to queue but staff did not give a toss! There is one queue for all and that’s it! God help you if tickets did not download to one’s mobile for showing to enter staff try to help but if not downloaded as they expect then not really interested! Stood my ground and eventually allowed in as I had prebooked early Oct! On entry colourful illuminates accompanied by dismal appropriate music. Many walls different features of the Crown Jewels and coronation history. Staff and a sole Beefeater were extremely helpful within the grounds as were the ground staff! Doing this tour was good for seeing the Crown Jewels at one’s leisure as not as busy as in the day and was able to take in the views and go around several times and have a good look. Learnt that it’s a criminal offence to photograph the Crown Jewels as a woman got reprimanded! Glad I experienced this tour but should it be done again next year won’t bother as found it colourful but bloody boring!!
"March 29, 2020","Take a day if you want, or just go early and see the jewels","We visited the Tower of London twice because we didn't know it was part of a tour we were doing and we had purchased tickets for a different day already. It's a good thing we did. By the time we arrived with the tour, the line to see the Crown Jewels was more than 2 hours long. We spent that time going through the buildings. Beware: Sometimes there is no way out but to go on...and on and on and... However, when we went back the next time, we went early and got right in line for the jewel exhibit and only had a 30-minute wait. We don't have much interest in British royalty, but it was well worth it. Gorgeous!"
"April 22, 2022",Not suitable for young children. Horrible queues and nothing interactive.,Don't visit with young children and/or in the school holidays. There is nothing interactive and horribly long queues for everything which takes away from any enjoyment. May well be worth it if you have older children and pay for a tour but for us it was a waste of quite a lot of money.
"February 28, 2020",Kohinoor Diamond,"Entrance fee is GBP 30 per person but its worth the price. There is SO MUCH of history in this place, its really amazing. Started with the White Tower by William the Conqueror who invaded in 1066. You need atleast half a day to cover MOST of this place. The crown jewels were really awesome and you can see the magnificent Kohinoor diamond here. Don't miss it."
"June 22, 2021",Exciting,This was my absolute FAVORITE thing we did in London. Absolutely do not miss out on a tour here. A beefeater who lives within the Tower of London led our tour and made it an absolute blast. Everything he shared was fascinating and his fun sense of humor had everyone laughing throughout.The Crown Jewels are kept in the Tower of London and I could hardly believe that I was standing in front of all of them at one point. Don't skip the tour -- it added so much value and knowledge to the whole experience.
"May 2, 2023",This place is AMAZING!!!,"The Tower of London is so much more than just a tower.  It is a whole city behind walls with a rice and fascinating history!  Tickets give you access to a self-guided audio tour, which is an absolute must.  We could easily have spent all day here, and there is a cafe where you can eat lunch, but sadly, we needed to head out shortly after noon.  The audio tour is done wonderfully and allows you to find out as little or as much as you want to know, while moving at your own pace.  Enjoyed seeing the crown jewels, visiting the White Castle and seeing all the suites of armor on display, and so much more.  A must if you are visiting London!"
"March 1, 2020",So much to see!,Great palace tour for your London itinerary. Highly recommend the add-on audio tour to help guide you through the site. Activities and exhibits for both kids and adults. Plan to spend at least 3 hours to see it all - we went on a Sunday morning   and crowds were minimal.
"February 3, 2020",Amazing,"Easily my favourite attraction in London. I can't speak highly enough of it and could spend all day listing the seperate aspects and what I loved about them.Suffice to say, just go. If you've never been, just go."
"May 20, 2022",Beefy experience of the Tower of London,"We visited the Tower of London with our 10 year old granddaughter (Lisa) and decided to take advantage of the 45 minute tour provided by one of the Beefeaters. Beefy409 was our guide, and what a great break for us.  We was engaging and humorous, while providing great insight into the history of the Tower. He made sure that our granddaughter was involved and learned along the way. Great experience was had by all of us  thanks to Beefy409."
"August 23, 2021",Well worth the money,"You go to the Tower primarily to see the Crown Jewels. They are beautifully presented and it is amazing how close you can get to them. They are well-lit, which makes the jewels sparkle. We visited on a Sunday morning in August 21, so there weren't many international tourists so we walked straight in and spent a long time looking at the jewels without crowds; looking at the queuing system in place I think it must get quite busy.The rest of the grounds are good too- I was surprised at how much you get to look around.Many of the Warders are very friendly and helpful but I think some of them are a bit 'clever' and full of themselves. One of them scoffed at my daughter's request for directions as it appeared obvious, but when he realised he was in the wrong because of the Tower's Covid restrictions in place, he 'wound his neck in', to use a military expression."
"June 6, 2021",Brilliant visit but Covid brings mixed blessings,"I’m torn.We visited at 9.30am in half term. Had a brilliant visit in spite of the rain.  We pretty much had the place to ourselves but that was the excellent and sad at the same time. The lack of tourists means that we could walk round the Crown Jewels and other exhibits over and over with no pushing or jostling but the place generally felt a bit sad.  Also, the Yeoman warders couldn’t give their usual tours and that was a big loss.Hence, we went round pinching ourselves at how much space and time we had there but also with a tinge of sadness that it needs more people to visit."
"January 8, 2020",New Years Eve in the Tower,"Visited the Tower of London New Years Eve morning. The weather was cold, wet and windy. The venue was heaving, too many people, no trail to follow so crowds drifting from one part to another. The queue for the Crown Jewels was never less than one and a half hours long, mostly 2 hours plus so waiting in the rain ( and it was only drizzling!) was no fun so we didn't bother. Too many people at the attraction so were in queues most of the time. Needs some sort of organising so visitors have a route to follow."
"January 5, 2020",Tower of London,"Wow, amazing how much history is packed into one place. So glad it survived the London fires and WWII.  We hired a private tour guide which was a great addition for a family trip. He added additional commentary and our kids were able to ask additional questions which I think helped their enjoyment and understanding."
"May 20, 2021",Fabulous day,"Came here with a friend the day after it had opened from COVID and it was brilliant. Very clean, very quiet and very friendly.We used an audio guide and though we didn’t really need it as most of the info was written on boards around the museum it was still useful.We really loved looking at the Crown Jewels they were stunning and the atmosphere in there was very calming.Everyone we encountered were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We spent around 4 hours here and got all the information we needed. I particularly loved spotting all the yeomans houses and the keys pub that they have onsite. Big fan since watching the Tower of London documentary.This place is a must for anyone visiting London."
"February 4, 2020","Interesting, but....","We spent about 3 hours looking round and didn’t get bored. We had a 50 minute tour from one of the yeoman, and then wandered round by ourselves. Lots to see, but be warned some places have very narrow, winding staircases to climb up and down. My only criticism is that there is practically no interactive content in the Tower (just one bit were you can try on a hat and touch chain mail). In that sense it felt a bit dated as a tourist attraction.It’s easy to buy tickets at the booths just outside the entrance, but it is a bit cheaper if you buy online. "
"June 22, 2022",Superblooms at the tower,"Visited to see the wildflowers in the moat. It was beautiful- pinks, purples,blues,oranges,reds all colours just a carpet of changing hues. Then in to the tower itself. Could easily spend all day looking around. Just one small grumble- after finishing the walk through the flowers you then have to join the queue to enter the tower. "
"January 27, 2020",Worth visiting,It was a bit cold on the day I visited the site but it does worth it. See the building and history of london over a thousand years by going around the tower of london. I was able to come across a live drama of the king in the king's room. The crown jewel and the armor display are both cannot be missed. It is better to arrive earlier as I arrive around noon and not able to go through all the tours when it closed.
"March 11, 2020",Definitely a Must Visit,"I'm not sure if I didn't research it enough or wasn't setting my expectations correctly, but our visit to the Tower of London was beyond expectation. I went into it thinking it was just the central tower building with artifacts in it. But in reality it was the ability to tour alot if not most of the castle, including walls, gates, and multiple towers. The exhibit covered the many changes to the castle over the years, all its various roles, and figures who have been to or lived in the castle. Not to mention a variety of artifacts, including the Royal crowns and jewels, cannons and mortars, live guards, and so much more. Funny part is we didn't even make it to the part I thought was the Tower of London (I think called the white Tower), because we ran out of time everywhere else. Our young children enjoyed exploring all the many rooms making up the outer section. Be sure to stop by The Liberty Bounds just down the street for some great food too! "
"June 6, 2022",A great day out,"Here is a not to be missed attraction which is reasonably priced and can easily take up the whole day.Well laid out and managed, there are so many things to see of great historical interest.Don't miss out on following a Yeoman Warden round as he / she regales tales from the Tower. Informative and humorous.Great for children too.The cafe is reasonably priced and there are no nasty extra charges to go anywhere else. The only queue was to see the Crown Jewels but that is moving all the time and well worth the wait."
"July 25, 2021",Fantastic. Every part. ,"Writing a review as a recommendation if visiting. Me and my early bird 6 year old daughter got there for 9:30am. We walked around everything crowd free. It didn't get busy until half 11 so i recommend getting there early to avoid crowds. Everything is so fab and well laid out. The beefeaters who tour guild are nice and loud so you can hear well and are really funny as well as super knowledgeable, worth doing the guilded tour with them (free). Loads to see and do. Lots of walking though, up and down many steps. We did 13000 steps in 4 hours!"
"February 26, 2020",Amazing spectacle,"This is well worth a visit if you are in London.  It is very tourist friendly with lots of information about and the tube station Tower Hill is just adjacent.  You can get some lovely photos of the outside if you walk along the river but if you pay to go in there is lots to see and the history is fascinating, especially Traitor's Gate.  The Beefeaters are very friendly and knowledgeable and everything is clearly laid out and helpful."
"January 4, 2020",Homogenized History Along The Thames ,"This is my favorite tourist attraction in London - but it has been 20 years since my last visit. It's so crowded now and you need to get there early to beat the mobs of people. The Yeoman Warder tours are worth doing and they provide you with lots of historical facts with a bit of humor. The line to see the Crown Jewels was ridiculous (my husband didn't want to see them and I already have) so we headed to the White Tower - where they now snake you thru the building like you are in Disney - a bit disappointing. But the artifacts, ravens, architecture and views of the Thames are worth checking out. "
"February 20, 2020",A great place but without great display,"I came here with very high expectations. The first thing we did was seeing the Crown Jewels. These were stunning and the highlight of the visit. Then to the exhibition on the Royal Menagerie. This was interesting to read about and it had some funny stories in there, such as the polar bear in the Thames, but it was difficult to visualise. We moved onto the little Fusiliers museum on site, which had some amazing collections of medals on display. Then onto the White Tower where the armour is housed. Once again this was fantastic but lacked atmosphere, a crucial part of a historic site. After this, we visited the Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula. The graves of Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard are in here but not clearly visible. As good as seeing these graves was, the place, as with other locations, felt sterile. Beauchamp Tower showed clearly how, in my opinion, the atmosphere here was lost. There is a huge sign column in the middle of one of the important rooms, causing a build up of human traffic. I think it would be better to put signs on the walls to provide more space. Since we were on a time limit, the last room we visited was the Bloody Tower. Inside is a miniature cinema. This, as with Beauchamp Tower, took away the historic feel to the place. I also think having a dedicated shop for every major aspect of the Tower is not great either. My views may change if we spent more time here and did everything but overall, a fantastic historic site with a not so fantastic showing of the history."
"February 13, 2020",Part of History,We didn't have time to go through the tower to see the Jewel amongst other historical artefacts but looking at the building itself was quite impressive. The tower is quite large and located beside the iconic Tower Bridge so it is fairly easy to find. The masonry and stonework visible from the outside was enough to get me excited about going in. We were told you would need about 1.5-2 hours to go through the tower when booking tickets which was why we didn't end up going in since we would have only had an hour. It was nice that they weren't all about just selling tickets. We went to get tickets at the kiosk but think you were also able to do it online. It was disappointing we didn't get to go in but it is now on the list for the next visit.
"April 30, 2022",Crown jewels. ,My first visit with my wife to view the crown jewels and visit the Tower.Our Beefeater Andy gave a great presentation to our group about the Tower's history and its significance in the history of England. We enjoyed our day here and sampled the delights of the cafe and bought some very reasonably priced souvenirs. The staff here are very polite and courteous. They go the extra mile to make your visit a pleasant one. This is a premium attraction of London and should not be missed when visiting London.Thankyou all! 
"November 15, 2021",Fantastic,"Absolutely loved this visit. We booked tickets easily on line and admission as quick and smooth with friendly staff . Yeoman tour was so interesting and entertaining and pointed out all places of interest to look round after the tour.  Their knowledge is amazing , so many interesting and informative stories   Well organised and signposted . Very chilled as not too busy felt really comfortable . When I first booked I thought it seemed a bit expensive but was actually worth every penny . Good facilities available , toilets cafe etc ,"
"April 16, 2022",Badly organised with lengthy queues. Misleading website advice.,Spent almost £70 on tickets and followed their website’s advice of allowing around 3 hours for the visit. (Booked elsewhere afterwards based approximately on this timing. )Queued for around 1.5 hours in total whilst there - so basically paid £35 to stand in queues. Didn’t have enough time to visit most of the exhibits. Very disappointed at poor management. Pretty sure they knew what numbers were expected - why were better systems not in place to manage this?  And don’t get me started on the queue for the single ice cream truck.  Fully disappointed and annoyed at wasting my money.
"June 29, 2023","Good value,  amazing history and beautifully preserved","We got there half an hour after opening which wasn't busy but I recommend arriving 10 minutes before as you will beat the crowds and the many school groups.  We got a head set for the self tour but a private tour guide would have been more enriching. Go to see the crown jewels 1st as the queue gets quite big quickly. Lots of stairs so if mobility is a problem your access to many areas will be limited. Some areas are quite small and I feel they need better crowd control in those spots but overall it is a very big place so you mostly move freely. As expected,  the food and drinks inside are expensive (a latte made by an automatic coffee machine is £5)Good value 4 hours overall.  Absolutely amazing"
"June 26, 2020",So much to see and do here,"This was a great way to spend a portion of our day. Start with the Beefeater tour to get some information about the history of the area. They're funny and give a lot of details in a short amount of time. There's a little bit of everything to be found here, especially if you find the medieval era, monarchy, armor, jewels, architecture, swords, churches, palaces, ravens, and amazing views interesting. It is easy to spend hours wandering around to all the different buildings and displays. For those with disabilities, there are stairs in several buildings so getting around will present some challenges."
"June 6, 2021",Brilliant day out!,We came here with our two children and had a great time. It was fascinating to see the Towers close up and to see the Crown Jewels. My daughter particularly enjoyed this bit! The place is steeped in History and you find out so much as you're walking around. It was a glorious day too and the =ir weren't massive amounts of people there. My only disappointment was that we did not have enough time to really look around! This is not the Tower of London's fault though. The tube trains on the central and district line were closed so we had to walk about 50 minutes from our hotel. We then had to be at another attraction at 2! I would definitely recommend checking TFL for any train disruptions as this place really does need a good couple of hours to absorb it all in.
"September 15, 2022",A London must see!,"I originally thought the Tower of London was just a tower...actually one of the towers holding up the tower bridge.  I could not have been farther from the truth.  It is a fortress and  former royal residence that holds within it a concentrated dose of everything British.  It has history, tradition, jewels and very helpful Yeoman Warders to tell its story.  Our visit was just two days before the death of Queen Elizabeth II, so much of what we saw was poignant and moving."
"March 7, 2020",Behind the walls of history ,"So much history behind the walls of the London Tower. There are so many different areas that you can go in visit. The Crown Jewels were amazing to see in person. There are tickets booths all over the place for this place, if you’re a student remember your student card you get a discount!"
"June 8, 2023",Recommend getting in early,"We visited the Tower of London on a cold (cold by Australian definition) Monday morning during a school term. We arrived at 9.15am to line up for a 10am opening. Lucky we did because the line was right across the square by 9.30am. Tickets were scanned and maps handed out while we were waiting for the gates to open which made entry quite quick. We opted for an audio self guided tour which did add value and was worth it. We headed straight to the Crown Jewels upon entry. I don’t think my expectations were in check because I expected more from the Jewels. There wasn’t as much on display as I expected, which was more tiaras and jewellery. It took us a while to get through the Crown Jewels as there was lots of people and it was dark. By the time we got out the line to get in filled the stanchions. The actual Tower itself was interesting, particularly where prisoners were kept; the armoury was also quite interesting and there was much more on display than just armour; the towers with the Beefeater display which included insights into their training and background was worth a visit; and the talks around the place with the Beefeaters also looked quite engaging. Unfortunately we only had two hours here as we had another tour to get to. Would recommend at least 3-4 hours on a warm day."
"August 7, 2022",Enjoyed Superbloom,Enjoyed the superbloom wild flowers walk around the Tower.  We didn't pay to go in the tower but enjoyed listening to the guide giving tours of the tower as we entered the flower area and would think about doing that in future.  You can see the flowers for free from the road above the tower entrance but it was nice to walk in amongst the flowers.
"August 4, 2021",Tower of London Tri,"So much history to be part of. My granddaughter really enjoyed herself and so did I. I had watched the series on TV and just  had to visit. The Yeoman who gave us our tour experience was so funny and descriptive of the torture and murders that have been commited over time. The restaurant food was very satisfying and very clean, good service provided. The Ravens were very talkative as they flew around the Tower. A top Ten place to visit."
"January 11, 2020",A must see location,Visited on a midweek day in January and really enjoyed the experience. Really felt part of the atmosphere that has accumulated over the centuries. Appreciated that it wasn’t too crowded and managed to see everything. Arrived at 12:30 due to our off peak train times and wanting to use the 2 for 1 voucher and were still exploring when the wardens started locking up at 4:30. Cannot recommend it enough.
"January 25, 2020",Yeoman Warder Tour and Crown Jewels,"We spent about half a day at the Tower of London and could have easily spent more time if we hadn’t saved it for the second half of the day.  The Yeoman Warder tour was amazing: very informative and our YW had an excellent sense of humor (“ask me anything except about the Ravenmaster,” he told us, before taking a jab of conjured jealousy at his more famous colleague - he later doubled back on that and told us that there were such things as stupid questions, recalling a story of such a question a few years before).  The line for the Crown Jewels was surprisingly short and we were able to go straight in to see these valuable and beautiful symbols of British royalty.  We also very much enjoyed walking the walls and going inside towers that once held famous prisoners - you can even see messages those prisoners carved into the walls.  Absolutely amazing!"
"May 25, 2022",London Icon,A wonderful iconic site to visit in London.  They have regular guided tours by the Beefeaters relaying all the history of the Tower & its former occupants.  A glance of the crown jewels is a bonus.  We were there when they fired the cannons too.
"January 27, 2022",Go now whilst its quiet!,"We visited here whilst it was quiet (I'd walked past a few days previously and asked one of their guides how busy they were and they told me they were very quiet so we decided to take a day off and visit a few days later). The Yeoman Warder's tour was excellent (well done Beefy!) just the right mix of humour and fun alongside the historical facts. We also learned something new about the Crown Jewells from one of the guides which were brilliant. We ended up getting the season pass as we want to go back in the summer and we cant wait to visit Hampton Court, Kew, and Banquetting House. "
"January 5, 2020",Disappointed with the level of interpretation,"I hate to say it but I was disappointed. The building is of course awe inspiring but the interpretation within is dull. We went straight in with our Hisoric Royal Palaces and so did not see whether there was an audio tour available but once inside there was so much reading that you missed the feel of the place. Even in the prison area it was just reading, which with so many people was not easy to do as could not get near to the signs. The best bit of interpretation about prisoners was just seeing Walter Raleigh’s area and what it would have been furnished like.The White Tower was the biggest disappointment as, amazing though it is on the outside, inside is just the Armoury. I was hoping for at least a bit of a view of how the Kings and Queens would have lived.The best bit of our day was listening to Yeoman Warden 409 Scott ? On the Yeoman Warden Tour as without his stories and information we would have not have got a feel for the history of the place."
"April 22, 2022",Spent the whole day there,"An excellent trip to London for the family (kids 6 & 8) over Easter weekend. Arrived at 9:30 and stayed at the Tower the whole day till 5pm. Plenty to do all day, and makes the pricey tickets worthwhile. Highlight of the day was the Beefeater tour with 'Beefy409' which really brought the Tower stories to life and made us laugh. (We thought the jokes about 'bad men' were a bit off, but overall the tour was brilliant and made our day)."
"January 1, 2022",My favorite medieval attraction.,"Could easily spend 4 hours here.  Best photo op, too, with bridge in background.  Crown jewels, breastplate armor, an actual catapult, military guards on duty, etc.  Definitely go here."
"September 5, 2022",A Trip Back in Time,"I can never get enough of the Tower of London. It is steeped in so much history and blood! I know most of the stories of Anne Boleyn and others who died here by heart. It is awe inspiring  to walk the same grounds as those who lived and died here. Our trip this time was in June as we had to wait for our grandson (his first trip) to be free of school, so it was BUSY. I prefer a quieter time, but he loved London and the Tower. This was a visit for him, so we coped as best we could with the crowds. We didn’t not go to see the Crown Jewels since I had seen them before, grandson had no interest in them, and the line was long. The White Tower with its beautifully displayed armor and weaponry was another matter. We saw every inch of it and had to practically pry him  out. Did I mention he is a teenager?! We had a delightful talk with one of the wonderful Yeoman Warders about his job and the ravens who live there. I always like to visit the site where Anne Boleyn met her end. However, like the Yeoman Warder who was giving an entertaining presentation on the executions carried out in the Tower, I can’t say the rather modernistic marker of the site is an improvement.All in all, we had a great day in the amazing Tower of London!"
"February 7, 2023",Very beautiful place to visit,"The Tower of London is a must-visit historical site with rich history and tales of royalty, executions, and treasures. The Crown Jewels are displayed beautifully and the Yeoman Warders' stories bring the place to life. Don't miss the iconic Ravens and Beefeaters!"
"February 27, 2023",Great day out,"After 20+ years in London I finally made it to the Tower! I spent about 6 hours there. There is so much to see but there are plenty of places to sit and a couple of cafes as well as refreshment kiosks so I paced myself and it didn't feel overwhelming. Really fascinating. The only downside it that it is absolutely full of school parties, and especially in the smaller rooms in the White Tower they were very difficult to avoid and I did get very claustrophobic. Their entry was obviously staggered but that meant that as soon as one group of children left, you had approximately 20 seconds to have a quick look at an exhibit before another hoard of kids came in. My favourite thing was the display of 18th century wooden horses in the White Tower, but I was also fascinated by the more recent tales of prisoners and executions there as recently as the second world war. There wasn't a queue to get into the Crown Jewels but that was probably the least interesting section for me. The guide recommends spending an hour in there but I don't see how that's possible! It's only a couple of rooms and I was maybe in there 10 minutes."
"June 13, 2020",History of London,"This prison has long history. There are many museum exhibits and there are also coronation jewels in the collections. There is also a history of the Tudor. In the former prison cells there are various inscriptions on the walls, it make goosebumps. And from the walls is nice view to Thems river and Tower bridge. "
"February 20, 2022",A must visit when in London,"Visiting The great Tower of London is a must for anyone intrigued by history from a thousand years ago.Do wear sensible shoes and clothing if the weather is inclement.A lot of staircase climbing and walking from one tower to another will require heaps of energy but rest assured, cafe is not too far away.This historic castle on the bank of River Thames is easy to get to by Tower Hill tube station.Founded around year 1066 during the Norman Conquest.Set aside at least 3 hours of more if you want to stop and study all the historic relics on show.However, Royal Mint museum will captivate your mind. You'll discover how Royal mint came into existence and reach into your pockets to examine spare change you may be carrying.Most exhibits also a running informative video alongside so you do not miss any vital information.Check out the armory and   not forgetting The Crown Jewels.Allow around 20 minute wait here, but you will not be disappointed.Check out the Yeoman Warders in their pristine uniforms, giving gravitas to this jewel of a structure.A must visit when in London, the greatest city in the World."
"March 2, 2020",Interesting but not worth the expense,"I'd been to the Tower years ago traveling alone. I thought that bringing my kids would be a great way to introduce them to the city. For the cost of the tickets, it was a silly choice. The grounds are beautiful but for as much as there is to the place, there isn't much to see. Spend your money elsewhere or visit a free museum."
"January 4, 2020",Cracking day out,"It's a full days outing this one. Start with the included tour by the warders, who are all larger than life wannabe actors! Lots of history lots to see. Plenty of walking and steps. Wear sensible footwear. Prices inside very reasonable. Expect queues to see the baubles which are better in real life than any photo. Child friendly with a big cafe. Limited toilets so plan ahead when going round. Can get very busy so go early. "
"November 6, 2022",Priceless experience,"The Tower of London is a great place to spend a few hours learning about the history of London and the Royal family. Starting with a fantastic tour from Beefeater 409, who clearly has a passion for The Tower of London and the history it holds, to looking around the buildings that hold so much history. It was particularly special to see the Crown jewls so close. The staff clearly do an amazing job at taking care of the grounds and give the public a priceless experience! Recommend to all :)"
"January 29, 2020",Beefeaters and Royal Guards,"The whole experience of the Tower of London is worth the time taken. From the colorful & handsome uniforms of the Beefeaters along with their stories of Historical events taking place there to passing the remains of the ancient Roman wall that the site was built on. I was startled by the ""frozen"" Royal Guards outside of the Crown Jewels display when the clock chimed and there was a changing of the Guards. They hadn't moved a wink beforehand and one literally could barely see them breath. So much discipline! And the exquisite beauty and majesty of the Crown Jewels are impressive. Again, well worth the time spent."
"July 22, 2022",A wonderful experience.,"We visited in July so that we could also visit Superbloom. It was quite surreal to sit in the moat of the Tower surrounded by flowers. Loved seeing the history of the Tower. There was a queue to see the Crown Jewels, but didn't have to wait long at all. It was very well organised and we loved the escalators to keep everyone moving by the Crown Jewels. One small observation - even though it clearly staed no photographs, there were people taking photos - which was disrespectful. What an incredible experience. It's well worth a visit!."
"January 1, 2023","Good visit, but go early to avoid crowds during high travel seasons","We got tickets using Headout and made sure to select the first time slot available that day. It was a very very busy day and this was the best thing I could have done. Highly recommend trying to catch a tour with one of the Yeoman Warders if lossible, even if it's shortened due to the rain as ours was it is still a lovely experience"
"July 16, 2022",It’s a big tourist attraction for good reason,"This was a big tourist attraction- and was well worth it.  We booked tickets for 10 am, which was ideal.  We missed the morning rush on the Tube.  It got much busier after we arrived.  We started to wander from building to building but realized that the crowd was growing so we got into a relatively short line to see the Crown Jewels.  By the time we finished and came back outside, the line was growing, and after we went to one other building, the line to the jewels was massive.  So, tip would be to arrive at 10 and go to see the jewels first.  The beefeaters were all over the place and were very interesting and funny tour guides.  The super bloom for the jubilee is a big wildflower planting in the moat.  You can see it just fine without the extra ticket (which lets you walk in the paths near the flowers). We grabbed lunch from one of the food trucks (from Uzbekistan - really tasty) and ate at a picnic table overlooking the Thames.  After the Tower, we took the tube (then changed to DLR) to Island Gardens and then walked thru the tunnel under the Thames to Greenwich.  Very cool experience."
"March 8, 2020",Exploring history,"Having watched the tv show, I wanted to see the Tower for myself. We had a wonderful time seeing and experiencing centuries of history for ourselves. We had a tour with Tower Warden Clive (he said to say his name was Phil if we didn’t enjoy it 😂) and despite him struggling with a cough, not Corvid-19 as he was keen to assure us; was loud, entertaining and knowledgable. Get well soon sir, and thank you for this morning. Well worth a visit. "
"August 26, 2020",Just brilliant ,"We spent a hugely enjoyable day in the Tower of London today. The fact that the tickets are for timed entry means that the queues are not too long and it is not too crowded. The signage is great, many parts are open and empty, and the Crown Jewels simply wonderful. This is an attraction in London that is worth every penny. The Beefeaters are the icing on the cake - really friendly and knowledgable. If you want a Covid safe, fun, clean, efficiently  run and totally fascinating historical attraction in London then this is the one!"
"August 4, 2022",Over crowded and long queues even with timed tickets,Disappointed that even with timed tickets the attraction was far too crowded to be enjoyed. Queues for crown jewels and bloody tower were well over an hour long each. Fewer tickets should have been available to maintain the safety and enjoyment of visitors. It was far better when managed under English Heritage. Making money rather than providing a good customer experience seems to be the priority
"September 30, 2022",900 Years of History,"We spent several hours here as part of a guided tour. The Royal Jewels are the main attraction, but each of the various towers has its own story to tell. Displays trace the importance of this site from the time of William the Conquer to modern times, when it played a role in WWII.The grounds are beautiful, and the buildings historic."
"April 24, 2022",A must see while in London!!!,"I went here on Friday 22nd April with my wife and our 9 year old niece. We had a tour and our Yeoman Warder was Gary who was very funny from the outset but also very informative and interacting with everyone who was there. The queue was long to view the Crown Jewels but we’ll worth the wait We had some soup at the cafe before carrying on our day in London and I will say that this is a must see for old, young and any nationality.Do not miss this while you’re in London!!!"
"January 19, 2020",WHAT A SHOW,"Our second visit to the Tower of London and we had the last guided tour of the day.Our Yeoman guide was perfect in his knowledge, sense of humor, and acting the part.He made it very special and gave everyone a great insight in its history and being proud to be a Yeoman."
"June 2, 2021",So much history. So worth the visit,"OK I am a Brit who has taken years to visit the tower. Absolutely worth it. Surprisingly large site is packed with a thousand years of British and English history. The crown jewels are exactly as you would expect and the way the team blend the working nature of the Tow er, changing of the guard with the tourist curiosity is perfect. Walk the ramparts, see the Ravens, Beefeaters and historic graffiti.  Worth the trip. "
"October 27, 2023","Great day out, please visit ","Can't recommend a trip to the Tower of London too highly. It's a really great day out. At first the ticket price of £32 each appears very expensive, but trust me, it's real value for money. You get to see so much real history, touch the walls that have stood there for years, and see the well laid out exhibits from over the centuries. We went early and we beat the crowds, we walked straight in to see the crown jewels, no queue at all. They are amazing! The bloody tower, the white tower, Beefeaters, Ann Boleyn, Sir Walter Raleigh, changing of the guards, traitors gate, so much to see. The exhibits are easy to view and understand. Really impressed. We saw what we wanted to see and stayed for just over 3 hours, but could have done another hour easily. We finished our trip with a walk around the ramparts, where we had great views of London. Highly recommended 👍"
"July 26, 2023",For the serious history buffs only.,"We went later on in the afternoon, around 3pm and we struggled to find things to keep us amused for 2 hours. We saw the queue for the Crown Jewels and winced. There were so many people. We also found we had to queue to get into most of the different exhibits too. None of which were worth it. We queued for about half an hour to get into Wakefield Tower. I don't know why, there was one torture device and then out the other end. It was good to see the Ravens and they were going about the grounds. We found that the exhibitions just did not have as much information as expected and I didn't learn anything different that I didn't already know. As we had gone near the end of the day, we were lucky and only had a 5 minute wait to get in to see the Crown Jewels. I certainly wouldn't have waited all day in the queue we saw when we first got there. Also found there was not any of the modern day jewels either. Interesting enough but not worth the £34 paid for the entrance fee."
"October 30, 2020",A Fortress A Palace & A Prison,This building has seen it all. if you are in London spend half a day on this side take a 21 pound tkt wait for a free guide see the Kohinoor taken from India. see the armoury and as you exit walk towards tower bridge see tower bridge and cross the other side
"February 21, 2020",Family break, This was really good but weather let it down everyone was doing the inside things which  I can't blame them . But things weren't on due to weather I'm sure in the winter months they could be arranged to do more things in doors . Looking around did keep the kids amused. The dragon was amazing what it was made out of 
"April 23, 2022",A beautiful piece of history,"I was looking forward to visiting a castle in Ireland, and Killkenny was near where I was staying. I took the unguided tour solo and really did enjoy the architecture and design. I enjoyed reading about the history and watching the film first is a must to understand more of the history. I am so glad that it is being preserved! The great hall was absolutely amazing! Quite by accident I found a small area where a collection of new tapestry's we're being displayed. They are near the Tea Room and are a must see! They are gorgeous!I had hoped to see more rooms that were furnished to gain a better understanding of what they would have looked like, but the black and white photos posted throughout helped a bit. I unfortunately had a mother with three loud children that were very distracting during my walk through."
"April 15, 2023",Family day at the Tower of London,"Short queue to get in, Yeoman tour with the lovely Mark was a great way to kick off the day with his great humor and all the gory facts. Was the highlight of the visit for us.Some queues here and there esp for crown jewels and food but nothing more than 30mins and were kept moving.I would have preferred a bit more interactive torture area to bring that part to life, but the kids loved the ravens, the armour and playing on the battlements. Views of the bridge were stunning and overall we had a great day and filled over 5 hours there, so well worth the ticket price.Prepare for a 2nd mortgage for ice cream, (£10.50 for 3 small single scoops), but you can take your own food and drink in, so cheaper options ."
"October 20, 2021","A great day out for the family, just a shame it is so expensive that many won't get a chance to visit","A brilliant day out the beefeater tour is well worth it and as well as a great knowledge of history they have a great attitude to children asking relentless questions. We all had a brilliant time the only down side would be the price of admission which now means a typical family may not be able to visit, which I feel is a shame. But other than that a excellent day out you will not regret going. "
"October 28, 2020",Tower of London during Covid,"Really enjoyed the Tower of London and learning about the history, people and executions. We got in as part of a package deal so it worked out really well price wise. They make you wear a mask but that's to be expected with Covid-19 happening. Would recommend the Tower of London to anyone looking to learn more about British history or who wants to visit one of the best attractions in London."
"May 6, 2022",Fantastic day at the Tower of London,We rebooked this visit and arrived for its opening there was a massive queue for pre-booked but it went down very quickly. We spent all day in there around six hours. We did the first tour at 10:30 with the beefeaters these toes are every half an hour. Then went on to the Crown Jewels as that was popular. The tour was very informative and funny. The Crown Jewels on amazing. And we went round everywhere within the Tower of London. Lots of walking and stairs. We ate in the CAFE there which was busy and the food was nice with plenty of choice. We carried on walking round all of the towers. There are interactive things. And the staff are friendly and very knowledgeable. If you’ve never been I would recommend you spend a day there.
"May 4, 2022",Fantastic day out !,"We went to the Tower of London today with our 9 year old boy, to educate him (and us) with a bit of history. We all had a great time and we was lucky enough to have a tour with a beefeater called Scott Kelly #beefy409. He did a fantastic job of keeping everyone entertained and making us all laugh. Fountain of knowledge of information regarding the Tower and those who lived there and some gory details of those who died there. Thoroughly enjoyable day."
"June 18, 2021",A piece of history amongst buildings of the future,"First visit here, was very surprised that so many buildings fit into such a compact space. It was also weird how this historic building was surrounded with some of London's modern buildings. Security and Covid-19 restrictions were spot on, with plenty of hand sanitation dotted around. At first I thought the entry fee was a bit steep, but the place is basqued in history and loads to see. Food was definitely expensive, so bear this in mind. Staff are great, including the Beefeaters who were great at answering questions. If you are interested in the Towers past, this is the place to go."
"January 19, 2020",Great views,"Got the VIP walking tour.Francis, our guide, was so great with useful trivia and he was speaking most of the time from personal experience.We had first access to the crown Jewels, and his timing was perfect for the horse parades.It's a long walk, though from the embankment to the Buckingham Palace."
"May 18, 2023",An Unforgettable Visit to the Fascinating and Well-Preserved Tower of London,"It is filled with fascinating stories and secrets, making it a must-visit destination for any history enthusiast. From the iconic White Tower to the Bloody Tower, the Tower of London is steeped in history and provides a unique experience for visitors. The Crown Jewels, Yeoman Warders, and Tower Ravens are all highlights of the Tower that make it a truly unforgettable experience. With its rich history and well-preserved architecture, the Tower of London is a must-see for anyone looking to explore England's past."
"September 3, 2020",Bigger then you think,"Due to Corvid 19, the Tower was all a one way system which wired brilliantly. I hope they keep the same process going after Corvid. The Beefeaters are a pleasure to talk too with the Crown Jewels taking all the spoils. A great visit"
"April 17, 2023",Loved the Tower of London. The History!,"Better than I imagined after my research on London sites and history. If I come back to London I would likely tour the towers again as there is so much to see. Definitely plan on spending a few hours here. The Crown Jewels were spectacular and so many displays of other items pertaining to the Royal Family. Interesting to see many of the items that will be used for the upcoming coronation of King Charles III. We arrived early on a Sunday morning and glad we did as the crowds increased in the early afternoon. If I return I would take the Yeoman Wanderer tour guide tour. We opted not to but I would the next time. There is so much to see here. We spent about three hours at the towers and no way to see it all. I also enjoyed seeing all the armor, and the displays and artifacts. We also made sure we took a look at the Ravens. I would love to come back to London and if I do, I will return to see the Tower of London again."
"February 4, 2020",Informative and Enjoyable ,We went to the Tower of London last week on a trip to London. We had a very enjoyable and informative tour from Yeoman Warder Matt Pine who was also very witty! We then went to see the Crown Jewels and walked around the grounds. I would recommend it to anybody visiting London as it is one of the most important historical site in the UK.
"June 13, 2022",Thoroughly enjoyable ,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the castle. We visited the Superbloom in the Moat, beautiful flowers. We then visited inside the Tower, lots of walking, some on cobbles and if you visit the White Tower lots of stairs, up, then down and spiral staircases, comfortable footwear recommended."
"July 30, 2022",Nice visit!,"We had purchased the London Pass prior to the pandemic and had to wait over two years in order to come to London due to the restrictions. Anyhow, the Tower of London started with a timed reservation system but the London Pass was exempt. We just had to show up with the QR code on our smartphone and possibly wait for entrance due to restricted number of people. Fortunately that was not the case and  we were able to enter right away when we arrived. It was busy at the Tower of London but luckily the lines had not really formed around 10:45a.m. at the Crown Jewels so we were able to go in and see it within an half hour's time.  Pre-covid times, it was always a wait for around 30 min. to get in.  We were able to visit Fusiliers Museum, White Tower, Bloody Tower, the Green, and the Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula (limited hours of operation here) , see the ravens as well as walk the walls of the Tower of London within 3 1/2 hours.  Unfortunately at this time there are not much choices of food but luckily we were prepared.   Worth a visit for some Royal English history behind the walls of The Tower of London."
"August 29, 2020",Not the same after lockdown,"Visited the first day they opened after lockdown, but sadly a few places within the site were still closed due to covid which was a shame. However, I would recommend the Tower if it's your first time visiting. It was my second time and not as worthwhile. The place felt a bit hollow. Hopefully things will pick up again long after covid. "
"August 21, 2021",Interesting but quite pricey visit. ,"Spent an afternoon at The Tower of London. It was quieter than we expected, no queues to get in anywhere and we had seen everything within a couple of hours. Lots of history and interesting things to see. There are free walking tours with Beefeaters available, who provide interesting facts. It was great to see the Ravens.  Definitely well worth a visit. The only negative is the price, starting at £30 per person It makes it expensive for families with older children all classed as adults. "
"October 28, 2020",Fantastic Day Out,"What a great day out. We went on Sunday and weren’t disappointed. It was FAR quieter than you’d normally expect but this only enhanced our visit, as it gave us lots of time to see everything, even saw the Crown Jewels twice, and there were no crowds at all. We felt extremely safe going and would highly recommend it.The staff were all extremely friendly & super knowledgeable. It was such he a nice experience to be able to chat to staff & ask lots of questions, which they answered with ease and gave us lots of other information, too. Thank you Luis (white tower) and Barry who chatted with us for a while and we’re so friendly with our children.We left through the shop at around 4:45pm and the lady on the door (ensuring capacity wasn’t exceeded) and lady on the till, were also extremely friendly. The service from everyone was exceptional. We’ll be back again in the very near future for sure."
"May 5, 2022",Well worth visiting,"Super visit of Tower.  There were not too many tourists so we were able to view everything without queuing. Crown Jewels are amazing, and the guide  explained what happens when the Queen needs to wear her crown for work.The Beefeaters are super professional and friendly and really make the visit well worth it.We travelled there by Über boat from Westminster which meant we avoided the traffic/ tube and had great views also of the river."
"June 15, 2022",Brilliant ,"Visited the Tower of London for the Superbloom.  Adverse weather conditions have had an impact on some of the blooms but that is out of anyone's control. Why people couldnt enjoy the beautiful flowers that are blooming is beyond me. Im sure some people just go out to moan about things. The walk around the moat was pleasant and very enjoyable and the work and effort that people have put in is  amazing. The Tower itself is interesting, the Beefeaters informative,helpful and all have amazing sense of humours .I would highly recommend a visit to this wonderful piece of history. "
"August 9, 2021",Family visit,"Lovely family day out at the Tower of London! We all loved it. Lots to do and lots of staff on hand to answer questions and give you information about the tower. While we were there they had cries acting out scenes , really entertained the children. Facilities were very clean and organised. We'll definitely be back!"
"December 5, 2020",FIA Awards 2019,"Just to clarify before I start Trip Advisor will not let me tag last year only this year! I attended an awards event in a marquee on the grounds of the Tower of London. A great environment for a corporate awards event. The food was amazing, staff were great and it is super close to the tube for getting home afterwards. Great area for a stage set as well as a drinks reception out of the main room. For when the events industry can go back I would recommend a venue for something a little different. "
"August 27, 2023",Tower of London,"Visited 27th August 2023.AJ was our guide she was brilliant few little jokes along the way, really painted a picture & got the audience participating if we went again we would love AJ to do our tour again. Watched changing of the guards saw the Crown Jewels and the animals they once had. Incredible history and information. Definitely recommend it x"
"October 18, 2021",Best of British,"Fabulous trip with my husband and his parents. Fir someone who doesn't really 'do' history i thoroughly enjoyed our few hours here.Starting off with a tour by Yoemen Warder Andy M was a great bonus. I'd normally find these things drab but he made the 45 mins entertaining (think dad jokes and slightly un-PC, which we loved) and very informative.  He finished off telling us both about the guards outside of the Crown Jewels and then about how he became a Warder...by the end we were all brimming with the British Pride that oozed from him.After that a wander round the buildings and exhibits, plus a drink in the Armouries cafe (clean and spacious).A thoroughly enjoyable visit."
"January 28, 2020",A few hours of history / great visit,I took my kids ages 7 and 9 to the Tower of London. Booked tickets online and got in quite quickly. The audio guide is very helpful with an option for young children. Everything was very well preserved and presented. We all enjoyed walking around and learning about the history. There were a small cafe and an ice cream shop inside. 
"October 22, 2023",A must see,We visited on a Saturday at 11am and although lots of people about we did not have long waits for any of the exhibits and it did not feel too crowded. There is so much to see here and some fantastic views.  We covered everything in around 2.5 hours.  Everything is well planned out and easy to follow.   Nice coffee and cake from one of the kiosks too. 
"February 12, 2020",Awesome trip - a must have on the list!,"The 3.5 hour excercise was really impressive and also interesting. The environment offers so many different places (armory, prisoners stories, crown jeweleries). It is a real place to visit. Book your tickets online in advance - pre-information cascaded by the service is excellent - I received useful informations the day before we went there. "
"May 13, 2022",Beefeaters Tour - #BEEFY409,"My very first trip to London: this was a top priority. Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly conducted my tour. I popped in on two earlier ones; they were informative but by no means possessed the flair and engagement #BEEFY409 had on this tour. I would highly recommend this activity and if you can pick a guide, I would insist on his tour. Well done, Sir!"
"July 8, 2022",Incredibly Disappointing Superbloom,"This is a review of the Superbloom NOT the Tower of LondonThere are two types of tickets for this event, free ones which gain you access to the upper walkway, and purchased ones, which give you lower level access to the flowers. Both are timed, but when we arrived there was totally uncontrolled access to the upper walkway (so why issue timed tickets?)There has been a lot of nationwide publicity about the poor quality of the wild flowers and there are still massive bare patches. The suggested problem is weather, but wild flowers are exactly that, and it's not unreasonable to suggest the experts involved should have produced a mix of seeds to cope with the “English climate"" and flower at different times of the year and in different conditions.To summarise we felt that our visit was approaching a waste of time, if we had paid we simply would have been looking for a refund.If you're going to visit, DON'T pay (you get a better view from above in fact), but also make sure you have something else planned as well for your day in central London"
"May 11, 2022",Transported back through time !,Fabulous experience at the Tower of London. There was so much to explore and learn about. The Yeomen Warders/Beefeaters stole the show for us and really made the experience so memorable. Their depth of knowledge was excellent and the way they kept those on the tour engaged was an example to tour guides everywhere of how it should be done. This attraction is the gold standard in my opinion. We will definitely be back !
"January 15, 2023",Lovely couple of hours,Went on a Sat around 11am was very quiet but it is January.Very easy entry with scanning the ticket.Lots of friendly staff around to help when needed.Lots of information to read as you walk around which was helpful.Crown Jewels were fantastic to see and no que to enter on our visit.Toilet facilities were plentiful and very cleanWe didn’t eat or drink here.Definitely worth a visit
"August 22, 2021",Great historical day iut,"Brilliant day out really enjoyed it. Been on my to do list for years so glad it’s now been ticked off. Shame you can’t take pictures of Crown Jewels but I understand why.Yoemans talk really good and he’s was funny and very entertaining, sorry can’t remember his name."
"September 20, 2020","Informative visit, not crowded","I took my 13-year old nephew to explore this icon of British history. DeUe to the recent lockdown, there were only a few people visiting which made the trip somewhat special as we didn‘t have to put up with thousands of tourists.Very pleasant and relaxed tour. I didn‘t like the conveyer belt one has to use when seeing the crown jewels. "
"January 2, 2020",a must see when in London,"All I can say is that the Tower of London is a must see when in London.  If you decide to only see a portion of the Tower of London (due to time), it's understandable, but do make time to see it.  Also, if you purchase your tickets in advance, you can save time of standing in line."
"October 23, 2022",Must Visit!,"Entrance to the Tower of London is included with the London Pass.  If you are using your London Pass, you don't need to wait in the ticket line.  Go straight to the entrance and they will scan you through.Pictures don't do this place justice.  The tower you see in most pictures is just one of the buildings in the complex.  It was essentially a small city and you get access to several buildings as well as the entire exterior wall and towers.  It was so fun to walk around and read about the extensive history of this place.  We only had about an hour and a half to spend and I had to drag my husband out to make it to our next stop on time.  I wish we had planned for more time here, as we didn't have time to wait in line to see the Crown Jewels.As an added bonus, you also get a great view of the Tower Bridge!"
"August 28, 2023",Worthwhile tour. Rude staff managing the indoor audio booth; our first unpleasant London service experience.,"Interesting tour that will keep you occupied for 3-4 hours with an audio guide. If you are a history buff, it will be worthwhile.Worst experience is with the audio guide. We prepaid for this with our tickets online (we came from Canada). The lady in the audio booth is not professional and rude. We lined up, she refused to give us the audio guide, made us get in another line outside for prepaid vouchers only to find out that they had no more guides and had to get them from the original station we get them from.The devices are roughly handled, they drop them all over the phone. One of our stopped working half way through the tour but it was inconvenient for our family to stop the tour and  go back.We asked for a refund and none was provided. This was a turn off considering we planned our visit for several months and were flying in from North America."
"June 25, 2023",Very interesting!,So much to see here in addition to the Crown Jewels!  Really enjoyed walking around and learning more about the history.  Definitely get there early - we went to see the Crown Jewels first with a minimal line but by the time we came out of the exhibit the line was super-long!  We had lunch in the museum cafe - it was very crowded but the food was better than expected.
"August 27, 2023",A major London attraction not to be missed.,"After visiting London for decades, we eventually booked the Tower of London.Had such a fantastic day. Who wouldn't with all of the history, facts, stories and myths. Saw some of the 'stars' from the tv programme  especially the ravens! Plenty of toilets and cafes and I'd recommend the audio guide even though no one tells you it's full potential which makes it a bit footery and time wasting to begin with."
"October 8, 2020",Tower of London - overpriced ,"Overall there wasn’t much exciting to see except from the Crown Jewels whereby there was a massive queue just to see them for a space of 5 minutes. Extremely expensive and overpriced. I only spent half an hour if that there, and would say it is more suited to the older generation. "
"July 24, 2021",Great day for kids,Part of London’s heritage a great day out very affordable lots to see and lots for the kids to do  food services and fees are very affordable and a good standard. Lots of beefeaters to have snaps with the kids. Downside lots of stairs.  If you want gifts buy inside tower they are very good quality don’t but outside they are rip offs. Can of coke £2 ice lollies £3  enjoy a slice of English history you will enjoy it
"December 22, 2021",A great tour for someone who doesn't do history!,"I visited the Tower Of London with my 11 year old daughter. I'm not great at retaining knowledge of British history but the free guided tour, led by a Beefeater, was great and I listened with intent at the amazing history of this grand structure. The Crown jewels and armour were fascinating to see and facilities on site (toilets and cafe) were clean and cosy on a chilly winters day.I would recommend visiting."
"January 12, 2022",Brilliant,This was a last minute decision to go to the Tower of London and we are so glad we went.  We bought tickets and we got a discount by using my husbands Defence Service Discount so we were already onto a winner.  As we arrived a guided tour was just about to begin it was brilliant.  The yeoman warder whose name was Scott Kelly was so informative with his historical facts and hugely amusing that he made the tour a real treat.  We loved his humour it was very refreshing.  After the tour we wandered around the rest of the Tower and grounds and it was amazing.  There was no queue for the crown jewels we could wander at our leisure not sure what it would be like post covid and in the summer though.  Would definitely recommend everyone to go
"September 23, 2022","If you could only visit one location on your first trip to London, this is the place.","If you could only visit one location on your first trip to London, this is the place. One could literally spend two or three days here. I would certainly suggest at least 4-5 hours minimum. The Beefeater tour is free and fantastic from what I could tell (I am semi-handicapped, and would have never kept up with any tour). The architecture, the history, the art, even the dining room all make it a memorable experience."
"November 7, 2021",Wonderful day out,"We came for the first time and it was amazing, the walkways and different rooms are steeped in so much history. The Crown Jewels were gorgeous, absolutely incredible! I completely fell in love with the ravens too. All in all fantastic day! Will definitely return!!"
"April 5, 2022",Fantastic Day,Had a Fantastic visit with my 12 year old son.Very interesting we were there for almost 3 hours. The Yeoman beefy409 was fantastic with his tour he was very good with all the information he was giving and also with the kids he is so funny everyone seamed to love him.We will definitely be going back again.
"September 29, 2022",A super highlight!!,"For sure, one of the highlights of our trip. Have heard of the Tower of Landon and had to visit. Truly impressed with the history and artwork displayed, reflecting the many historic happenings over time. We did an audio tour, which was adequate."
"June 8, 2022","Tower of London great. DO NOT GO TO SUPERBLOOM, YET.","Tower of London was brilliant. Crown Jewels so impressive and the Beefeaters were on great form. However my reason for this review is the Superbloom experience. We bought Tower of London and Superbloom tickets as we were up for the jubilee celebrations. Sadly, due to poor weather the seeds have yet to take and there is nothing to see. We were supposed to have been emailed by See tickets prior to going offering us the chance to cancel or rebook. However we did not get any email. On the day we walked around the Tower to the Superbloom opening and could see nothing much had bloomed. When we got to the entrance the team on site told us there was not much to see but as we had made the effort to get there we could go in and walk around as we could get a refund or revisit anyway. We did walk around and as they said there was nothing to see. However when we tried to claim our refund we have now been told we cannot get a refund only a revisit as we had gone in. As we live a long way away a revisit is not cost effective. See tickets are refusing to accept this was their miscommunication and will not issue a refund. My advice therefore is DO NOT GO as there is nothing to see and no matter what the nice people on the gate say, See tickets will not refund you your ticket price. Why it is just not simply closed I do not understand. Very disappointing as the Tower of London was a great experience as was our whole jubilee few days, spoilt only by See tickets reneging on their offer."
"July 24, 2022",flowers around the Tower of London,Went yesterday to see the flowers around the moat at the Tower. We just walked along the walk way at the top which is free but I think it's £8 to actually walk around the moat paths near to the 'flowers' Don't bother - all the flowers are dead and what little has survived the heat looks nothing like the publicity photos. I really don't how they could charge in the circumstances
"January 29, 2020",Amazing place,"The Tower of London is a historical masterpiece. I highly recommend, once inside the facility, pausing for a few moments to join a guided tour by one of the Yeoman Warders. The Warders have been guardians of the Tower of London since 1485. Our guide was Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly. He was fun and an encyclopedia of knowledge of British history and events in the Tower. But he was also energetic, engaging, and very educational. His tour was one of the highlights of our London trip. "
"November 3, 2022",We thoroughly enjoyed it,"The Tower of London is a historic castle situated on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. You can see the Crown jewels, King Henry VIII's actual body armour and endless history going back almost 1,000 years. Fully recommended."
"August 5, 2020",Excellent,"My 10 yr old son has wanted to go for ages and he certainly wasn't disappointed. Restricted numbers allowed in due to Covid so not overcrowded. Not many people there, so able to take time to look around all the rooms, exhibits and crown jewels. The Beefeaters and the guides were fantastic, happy for you to chat with them and ready to answer all questions. Toilet open and also Raven cafe so we could get a drink. Highly recommended. "
"February 24, 2023",Really good place to visit,Fascinating venue! A very enjoyable short tour from a Yeoman of the Guard (‘Beefeater’) was included in the price. It you could spend all day here. Go early to avoid the queues at the Crown Jewels. 
"July 21, 2020",OK if you have never been before,"Loved the history and the architecture. Loved the armour and weaponry. Very disappointed in the lack of the torture section, I remember visiting here a long time ago and being amazed by all the equipment and the sheer scale of it all, I rambled on for ages telling my 14 year old son, who is mad on history, how amazing it was to be met by a few sheets of perspex and a couple of items.Won't be travelling here again for a while. Worth a visit if you like history."
"May 29, 2022",Fantastic throughout,"From the start to finish we enjoyed every part of this visit. I recommend that take the guided tour as many things are explained in great detail. Our guide JS Donald ( forgive me if I've got your name wrong ) Was FIRST CLASS, while being friendly and very factful . The guided tour lasted around 50 minutes but was more than enough to get me really interested in finding out everything I could regarding things I thought that I already knew. This is well worth the entry fee but please take the guided tour. Thinking back J.S.D really encouraged my visit which lasted for 4 + hours. 10/10"
"August 21, 2022","Enjoyable , worth a visit but long ques","What an amazing place, steeped in history and the crown jewels were fabulous. Unfortunately it was a busy day with a lot of ques. We spent most of the day there, but watching the beefeaters, wardens and actors were great. The staff were very friendly and the superbloom was lovely too. "
"January 2, 2020",Perfect family day out,"We visited The Tower of London on Thursday 2nd January, it was a cold afternoon but there were plenty of people there. We walked straight in, no queue.A beefeater tour was starting as soon as we got there. It was hilarious. Very informative but very funny. Would recommend."
"February 27, 2020","Obligated visit, fun and cultural value","The place by itself it is amazing and the guided tour is so fun and short so you can discover the rest of the places at your own pace. Now you HAVE TO SEE the crown jewels. You can not really imagine that until you see it. If you are visiting multiple places a great advise is to purchase the Historic Royal Family Annual Membership. We actually save 1.5 entrances entering the London Tower, Kensington palace and Hampton Court "
"November 13, 2022",London Tower,"Didn’t have the chance to visit the inside of the London Tower or fully walk the grounds. I arrived in the area at 7am for sunrise when most sites for tourism don’t open until 10am. From the outside it was a very nice structure to view, it’s very well maintained and compliments the Tower Bridge very well."
"April 26, 2022",Finally I managed to tour the Tower of London.,We had an amazing and very informative tour with Yeoman Scott Kelly . It was by chance we were there on  the Queen’s birthday so he had his special red tunic on . He was extremely amusing and his delivery was very clear . He was fantastic with the children stood around him. He really engaged with them.  We were so chuffed he was running our tour as I follow him on Beefy 409 after watching the “Inside the Tower of London “ series on TV. Thank you #Beefy409 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"January 31, 2020",Amazing ,"What an amazing place to visit. Definitely worth taking the tour with one of the Yeomen. There were so many historical facts I had no idea about. A visit to the Chapel where three of our Queens are laid to rest, and a personal place of worship of our current Queen. The Crown Jewels were a sight of absolute beauty.We booked online tickets which were £6 cheaper and booked on the same day. "
"September 18, 2022",History Lovers' Delight,"No matter your views on monarchy or the British Empire in general, this is a very interesting place to explore history. The crown jewels alone are worth the visit, but the tours provided by the Yeoman Warders will truly provide context around the evolution of Great Britain. The New Armouries Cafe is also a delightful place to have a scone and tea or a full lunch. Take your time and absorb the experience."
"April 8, 2022",Overpriced but very cool,"The exhibits within the Tower of London complex are all very interesting and well designed (Crown Jewels, Armory, Church, Museum, etc). However, with such a high price and the only truly unique thing inside being the crown jewels themselves, I'd evaluate if its truly worth it to you or would be better to just look at the outside. If you do go, definitely do the free guided tour - it was great!"
"May 3, 2023",Magnificent - but not during holiday week,The Tower of London was massive and impressive.  We did a self-guided tour which was good because we could move around at our own pace.  There were plenty of signs and items on display.  I would strongly urge not to visit during a holiday (we were there at Easter) or when school is otherwise out.  The Tower itself is a treasure.
"September 17, 2020",Mdg has terribl,"Mdg has terrible service, they wasted my time for several days and then they canceled my order after the funds for the down payment cleared successfully from my account because...  of a mistake they made. The account we originally had on file couldn't make ACH Transactions so we changed it to one that could and I was told everything was successful and I'd be receiving my order within 2 weeks. Not only did they cancel my order but they never reached out to me. I would highly recommend avoid doing business with mdg.read more"
"July 12, 2023",A Tower with History,"Wonderful place to visit, the history and stories related to the Tower of London is staggering.Like most popular attractions get there as early as possible. Especially if you want to see the Crown Jewels as line gets crazy quickly.Would highly recommend taking a guided tour to start with then explore at own leisure after that.Certainly the must see attraction in London."
"May 25, 2022",brilliant,"great full day out and too much to see in one day. get there early and wait for the tour by Scott Kelly  and scottish Beefeater /warden , he made a good tour great and the kids loved the theatrical tour and oratory. Well done Scott!"
"October 25, 2023",Nice for a quick visit.,"Went here on a whim on our visit to London, tickets were easy and quick to book online, with information about ticket types. Grounds were well kept and maintained. You could walk around the main outside of the building in one big circle, so that helped not being lost on where you were going and missing parts - quite obviously, there are small, winding stair cases at points, just something to be aware of. There were some Halloween aspects set up around the grounds, these were fab, and it's something I wish there was more of as the displays were nice. We didn't elect for the crown jewels tour, a) as the queue was too long which is to be expected, and b) we just weren't interested. Walking around the grounds took us about 2 hours, and with other things to do nearby this is great to pop in and do something for a short while.Wait staff in the café could have been a little friendlier - the lady that did serve us went to do something, came back and I didn't even know we were being seen to until she asked us if that was everything we wanted."
"October 18, 2023",It’s a UNESCO site for a reason,"I would put this on your definitely must see list. Couple of tips you really don’t need the audio guide added some value but not that much. Definitely do the beefeater tour. The second tour of the day has half the people as the first tour of the day they start at 10 and run every 30 minutes so it’s easy to take number two.We were told to go to the crown jewels first thing actually on a Wednesday in October. That’s the only time of the day there was a line so it doesn’t look very crowded. When you enter the park I might give it a few minutes to clear out also. Easy to take the underground right to the facility again, this is what I would call a definite do"
"January 24, 2023",Superbloom or not!,"Our expectations were not high when visiting Superbloom at the Tower of London.  We had seen the gardens from a distance and read the reports in the press so was not expecting much.We visited towards the end of Superbloom when there was no entrance charge. We had to use the stairs to enter the site (there is also a step free entrance) as the slide was closed (we did visit during the period of mourning for Queen Elizabeth 2 where, being a Royal Palace, fun activities were probably suspended).Well, what can I say other than we enjoyed our visit.  The gardens looked a lot better close up and whilst a lot of the flowers had died back there was still some left.  The piped background music gave some atmosphere and there was still plenty of staff around to answers questions.  Many benches throughout the garden provided ample opportunities to sit, relax and to enjoying the early autumn sunshine and the views.Even when in full bloom I think the entrance fee was probably a bit high and the souvenirs were very expensive  (at full price) but being end of season everything was on offer and we got some bargains.Being Historic Royal Palaces members we also visited the tower briefly – it is so good just to be able to pop in for a short while; see a part of the castle we have not visited for a while; have some refreshments then to use the facilities before heading off to see one of the many other attractions in the areas (e.g. Leadenhall Market, St Katherine Docks, Butlers Whalf, St Dunstan in the East Church Gardens."
"July 6, 2022",Fabulous Superbloom,"Absolutely wonderful experience walking through the moat to see all the wild flowers.  We even went on the long bumpy slides (and we are great-grandparents) - very scary but great fun. Thoroughly recommend it.  The visits are timed so, although busy, you did not feel too crowded or rushed in any way."
"June 1, 2022",Great day at the Tower,We had a brilliant day at the Tower. Thanks to the advice given on this site we chose to go and see the Crown Jewels first (at around 10.30) and were able to walk straight in... later in the day the queue was pretty huge! Would definitely recommend the free Yeoman Warder talk - very entertaining and informative for all the family. I was only expecting us to stay until early afternoon but we were still there at around 5pm - there really is lots to see and do so allow lots of time for your visit.
"October 9, 2021",Terrific Tower,Spent 6 hours here and could have done at least another 2. What an amazing place and they must have opened up more of the battlements and turrents since I last visited years ago. The Crown Jewels are still awesome and we were so lucky not to have to queue although i think the pre booking has improved the visit experience as it was far better without crowds of people and shuffling around. The Beefeater tour was entertaining and a must as they really do give you an insight into its history.  Loved the interactive part of the White Tower where we tried our hand at dressing the king and shooting a cannon. Views across the Thames were of course amazing. It was certainly well worth the admission price. It gives Goosebumps to think you are treading in the same place  as past king and queens - and very poignant moments in the chapel thinking of those executed. A must for everyone.
"May 24, 2021","See the Crown Jewels, the ravens","See the Crown Jewels, the ravens, Bloody Tower, Medieval Palace, battlements, the public outside areas of the Tower of London and magnificent armour displays in the White Tower, including Line of Kings. All other buildings remain closed. Meet our Yeoman Warders positioned along the one-way route and hear their captivating stories about the history of the Tower."
"October 26, 2023",Very cool history!,"This was one of my favorite visits on my trip! Coming from the US it's amazing to stand in buildings that were built more than a thousand years ago. We arrived in time for the beefeater tour. It was very crowded so sometimes it was hard to hear the guide, but he was very informative and funny. One of the ravens walked right up to me too! The queue for the Crown Jewels was quite long but once you get inside there is plenty of room to wander. They have other artifacts on display before you get to the main event, and you can take your time and ride the moving sidewalk as many times as you like. We also visited the chapel where Anne Boleyn is buried.My group left earlier than I would have liked, but it is a lot of walking on uneven paths. I recommend to arrive early and try to see as much as you can!"
"April 29, 2022",The Crown Jewels,"Had a great day at the Tower of London, what a rich history. The Yeoman’s were very knowledgeable and very friendly. Highlight for me was seeing the Crown Jewels up close, wow they are incredibleWould highly recommend but allow plenty of time for your visit"
"December 23, 2021",Superb,If there was one good thing about this dreadful Covid situation it's that London is so quiet at the moment so my family and I took the opportunity to finally visit  the Tower Of London. During our visit it was very quiet which meant we had a better chance to see all the wonderful things they have and loved walking around the battlements. All the staff we met and spoke to were wonderful and gave us great tips on less obvious things to look out for. Thank you for a memorable experience!
"July 9, 2022",Okay,"Superbloom and Tower of London.Fine, except that I was not able to buy my membership in any of the shops. One of the shops I went to said that the membership station wasn’t working and that I should go to the Tower of London Shop which is outside the ToL. I went there and was told that membership was not available to buy at that time.I came here today with every intention to buy a membership but it seems that you don’t actually need new members."
"February 24, 2020",An emotional but wonderful  experience,Came for the first time last year it had been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember and it’s all I expected and more I have a huge interested in the Tudor times and especially Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. The highlight of my visit had to be walking through the chapel where  Anne Boleyn is said to be buried it was so overwhelming and quite an emotional experience I feel something very close to Anne I don’t know why she’s just so interesting! I would’ve loved to of also seen the crown jewels but the queue was absolutely massive and I didn’t want to waste time stood in the queue and miss out on seeing everything else. Hopefully on my next visit I would actually love to do the tour where the yeoman warders tell you all the history of the tower and take you round the site.I will definitely be visiting her again sometime as I’m sure we missed out more than just the Crown Jewels.
"November 22, 2022",Brilliant,"We booked our tickets online (advisable) - went straight to the queue which had about 20 people in front of us 30 mins before they opened. Would advise going straight to the Crown jewel first, followed by the White Tower. We'd also pre-booked the audio tour which was good, the Yeoman Guards give tours every half hour and they get quite busy. We spent about 2.5 hours there and saw everything. The Yeomans were very helpful and friendly. Glad we went there."
"September 25, 2022",A tremendous amount of history plus the crown jewels,"There is a lot to see and do here!  It was very interesting to learn about the history of the tower, suggest getting the audio guides.  The crown jewels are a real treat to see, however no photo graphs are allowed of the crown jewels.  Go see the jewels first as the queue builds up quickly."
"November 5, 2022",Amazing place but visit disappointing,"Before I start this review, I would like to say as a history nerd and a mudlarker, the Tower is possibly my most favourite place to visit. I have been here a few times over the years but this last visit was a little disappointing. I admit half term isn't the best time to go but working in a school, unfortunately it had to be. The crowds were unbelievable, it was a constant shuffling along, not able to read any of the information because it was so packed. Didn't bother with the crown jewels as the queue was so long but that wasn't really an issue as I've seen them before. My main issue was even though the tickets are timed, it was still rammed....so the timed tickets seem pointless. Also I wanted to buy a beef eater xmas decoration but at £13.00 I thought again.....It seems a little greedy, particularly when it's nearly £30 per person to get in. I do want to reiterate, this is NOT a complaint about the Tower or its wonderful Beef eaters, I am still in awe of the place and its amazing history. I just would have liked a lot less people and maybe a little less expensive gift shop."
"May 31, 2022",Super Bare Lawn rather than Superbloom ,"The Tower of London is an amazing attraction however the wildflowers in the moat are a real let down at present. There is very little to see due to the cool weather and lack of rain. There are a number of signs giving information about the poor show and a great deal of effort has been expended trying to improve the situation but if you have booked tickets over the next week or two or more you are likely to be rather disappointed. The other thing to mention is the music which has been especially composed for the display. It is absolutely awful, being very depressing and completely unsuitable for what will eventually be (hopefully) an uplifting experience."
"September 19, 2021",Amazing,"The tour we had at the Tower of London was fantastic. The yeoman who guided us through was great, very knowledgable and engaging with lots of humour thrown into it too. Great views of Tower Bridge and the City of London are an added bonus. The information presented around the Tower of London is digestible and you learn a lot without it being overwhelming. A must-do if you’re in London for sure!"
"June 25, 2020",Tower of London,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Tower of London. Best to join a tour (Beefeaters give a free guided tour of the Tower every 30 minutes) or read up to understand its history, the symbolism, how it was used (fortress, palace, prison) and the stories of what happened in the various areas of the property. The Crown Jewels exhibit is particularly popular, so the queue is long."
"November 5, 2022","Loads of History Here - But, sadly, no pictures of the Crown Jewels","There are many areas of the Tower of London to explore.  You can see the dungeons, the areas where prisoners were held in the tower, as well as the Crown Jewels.  You'll need at least 3 hours to explore the Tower but you could easily be there for much longer.  Expect the line to see the Crown Jewels to be long but it moves quickly as there are only a few cases to be viewed -so, you won't get to dawdle while you look at them.  And, you can't take any pictures of them.  The history within the Tower of London is very interesting and some of the stories are pretty fascinating.  I'd recommend getting the audio guide or taking a tour with a personal guide."
"May 27, 2023",A window into the past,"Go early and prebook a ticket! We booked on the day (9am) and there was already quite a long queue to get in during May, so heaven knows what it would be like during high season! We queued to see the Crown Jewels for about 20 minutes - absolutely amazing particularly just after the Coronation. The Yeoman Warder tour had loads of people but was entertaining. We were there for about 5 hours, longer than expected, but there was lots to see. It was very busy but we didn't feel completely suffocated by the crowds and you really do feel a sense of history. Not sure I would want to go during high season, but definately worth a visit and glad we went."
"January 3, 2020",Daytrip,"We visited on our trip to London and this is a must.  We arrived and a Yeoman talk was just about to begin just through the entrance, think they're every half hour. Anyway Beefeater Dan was the man. Very funny and informative just what you want from a tour guide. Yes there is a dark side to the stories, but it's history and we've moved on.... Or have we. The history of the executions and gory details of our past is fascinating. I personally enjoyed the talk, where everyone was fair game especially the talker himself. So well done there. A 2 hour queue for the crown jewels...didn't make that but toured the rest and was thoroughly satisfied. We really enjoyed our trip and would recommended to all, except people without a sense of humour, don't do the talks, just in case you get easily offended. Get an audio guide and enjoy that tour instead. "
"November 16, 2023",The Early Entry Tour was the way to go.,"I got us the Early Entry Tour that included the Key Ceremony and the Tower Bridge Tour for my girlfriends birthday.  It was roughly a 3 hour experience and it was worth it.  There was nobody inside when we were there and almost nobody in the Crown Jewels are at all.  The Tower Bridge was an added bonus.The amount of history and the artifacts that are on display is amazing.  The French cannons from the battle of Waterloo are displayed.  There are torture devices, there are execution equipment, there are weapons and armor, and a massive amount of artifacts that have been involved with the history of the Tower.  The seemed to never discard anything that could have historic value.  It was a fascinating place to visit and definitely a Bucket List place for us.  Having a guide to explain much of what we were seeing around the grounds was excellent.  We are already talking about a return trip to London someday and if we do, we will visit the Tower again and really soak it in.  The only downside to a tour is that they will move you along to the next point of interest.  As someone that takes a lot of pictures, I could have spent half the day there."
"June 14, 2022",Great journey through 1000 years,"A really nice experience both if you are interested in history or not. Several different exhibitions, Crown Jewels, armory, military, monarchy and then the building itself. You can spend hours and hours if you like just walking around but we made it in two and were very satisfied. This is one of the highlights I would recommend Tia first visitor to london. The area just outside is filled with street food trucks and bars, nice to just sit by the river and relax after the trip in the castle."
"February 4, 2020",Wonderful Tour and a must for visitors ,I went here with no expectations or knowledge of what was in the Tower. I joined the tour that was included in the ticket and learnt so much about the history of London. The tour guide who’s name was Briggs was very entertaining and informative. I would highly recommend this as an attraction to see in London. 
"January 21, 2021",Such a beautiful place with a rich history,An interesting walk down the history lane. The guided tour was quite informative and provided a well rounded tour of the place. Lots of old artifacts are present in there which take you wayyy back in time. A good place to visit if you're visiting London for a few days.
"January 11, 2020",Beefeater tour guide ,Our guided tour was lead by a Mr Kelly. It was truely exceptional. Not only was the tour informative but filled with humour that had the whole group laughing and participating.We enjoyed ourselves al lot and will definately recommend a visit to the Tower of London.Scott Kelly = Top man....
"January 9, 2020",Interesting historical site,"Going in the middle of summer was HOT. Didn't get to see the Crown Jewels because the line was very long and I didn't want to stand for over an hour in 30°C heat.The Beefeater was great, very funny and extremely knowledgeable.Grounds and buildings looked to be in very good condition. "
"August 2, 2022",Show up early for no wait for Crown Jewels,We did not do the beefeater tour. We bought tickets for the opening time to see the tower and Crown Jewels. We arrived 30 minutes prior to opening and were one of the first people in line to see the crown jewels with no wait. The rest of the sites were informative and interesting. I would recommend this experience.
"November 28, 2021","History from Normans, Tudors to present day all under one roof",History from the Normans to Tudors to current day all under one roof. Moving history of the Queens of England who never left the Tower. Carvings in the walls were very thought provoking. Toilets very clean.
"March 3, 2020",Queer lives matter too!,I saw the special tour discussing LGBT lives at the tower was coinciding with my Trip to London and knew I just had to go. I took my sister with me (who had been living in London for sometime but had never gone into the Tower). It was fantastically well organised and a lot of fun. Plus it was a truly magical experience to see the tower at night in a more intimate setting. It was fascinating to hear about the sodomy laws and the effect these laws had on everyone from the crown down and the tribute at the end was touching!
"October 27, 2023",It’s good but could be better,We were really looking forward to the Tower but compared to other things we’ve done in London we all felt a bit flat by it. We started with a tour with a beefeater but because it was raining it everyone was shuffled into the church and it was done in there so it felt more like a lecture. Also the beefeater was not that entertaining so it was a bit dull. We spoke to another about the ravens though and he had my kids hooked so I suppose it depends who you get. The building and exhibits are amazing and I loved the armoury. The crown jewel exhibition was more interesting that the jewels themselves! Recommended but I’d go on a dry day.
"January 23, 2023",Better communication needed.,"I have teenage kids who are big into history and London was a big highlight to our trip from Australia.All my daughter wanted to see was the Crown Jewels so theTower was on our itinerary from the beginning. We got there early and pre-booked our tickets and entry was smooth and effortless.I have been to the tower many times before and knew enough that I could act as tour guide for the family. We did all the stuff on the outside and slowly worked our way in to the White Tower at the end. When we got to the Crown Jewels we were very surprised to find out that the Imperial State Crown (the highlight of the jewels display) was currently being prepared for the upcoming coronation in May. Now this is understandable and not entirely unreasonable given the upcoming ceremony, and I explained this to my very disappointed 11 year old who was wanting to see this crown in the flesh. My issue with this was there was absolutely nothing on the website nor any signs upon entry stating that this was happening. I would expect at least a slight discount on the entry ticket to compensate for the absence of one of the major highlight of the Tower. We had travelled a long way to see this and will not have the opportunity to return for perhaps many years and better communication about this fact would have been helpful. That way I could have told my daughter that it asn’t there, instead of saying to her “it must round the next corner”.I think you could have done better on this. Good news is all the staff were lovely and helpful and couldn’t say a better word about them. Alas, my 11 ear old will have to wait until the 6th of May to see the Crown on the tv."
"October 5, 2023",A must! So much history! ,"Impressive! History! Lots to see, lots of walking, up and down many stairs. Narrative is brief. Hard to see the menu on the screen, cost additional 5 pounds. Plenty of bathrooms on site. Nice souvenir shops, expensive! I recommend to go earlier than later in the day. I chose 10 am, by the time I was leaving around 11:30 am, I could see the sea of people and lines starting to form everywhere. "
"October 15, 2020",Absolutely Stunning!,"A friend and i visited the Tower today and left having had such a wonderful memorable day out. As a Tudor follower this has been on my to do list for some time, having already visited Hever and Hampton Court. Other than being in complete awe at the artifacts, facts and displays on show we were so impressed to see the level of social distancing being enforced and naturally adhered to by all the people we saw. We felt safe at all times while still enjoying examining displays etc, hand gel being provided throughout. Spotlessly clean, great signage, a wealth of information to be seen. The Beefeater's were so relaxed, informative and very friendly. Got to meet Beefy 409, Scott Kelly, who admirably started Vlogs on Facebook to keep children entertained during lockdown, and then amassed curious following worldwide with his fun facts and adventures with 'Cyril the flying squirrel'  There was so much to see here, and much of it was incredible to view (most especially the Armour and Crown Jewels)An absolute Must for visitors to London "
"August 30, 2020",An average experience.,"The Tower is certainly feeling the effects of Covid. You have to book online. No telephones are manned so no one to answer any questions. I, at first, had a problem downloading my tickets but there was no telephone line to report a problem. I eventually did download them. It was a good job I managed to do it because the email I sent about the issue was not answered until after the date of my visit. A number of the attractions are not open and there are no Beefeater tours, which is a shame because everyone likes them. I just wonder if, with a bit of organisation and determination, the tours could happen. Social distancing and limited numbers could easily be part of the arrangements. There aren't too many people visiting at the moment which is a good thing. We queued for about 35 minutes to see the Crown Jewels. I imagine it is much longer in normal times. The Tower is a wonderful group of buildings but, I feel there is something lacking.  The Beefeater tours need to be reestablished, The torture museum - always appealing to young boys - was a real disappointment. We don't expect it to be like the London Dungeon, but it definitely needs to be a little more graphic and with more detail. I first went about 40 years ago with my children, This time it was with my grandson. He wasn't hugely impressed so I think this will be my last visit."
"January 9, 2022",Beefeaters make the day! ,Wow what a fabulous tour we had at the Tower today. The beefeater tour which is part of the entry fee makes the visit. The tour itself is very engaging and educational for most of the family. It was fascinating to understand the famous history of the site as well as the role of the beefeaters. The site itself is extremely well looked after with stunning views. The artifacts including the jewels were spectacular to see. 
"June 4, 2020",Experience London history...,"A great place to learn about the history of London. There is a lot to check out! The best was the crown jewels, the white tower, etc. Be sure to be a bit early to beat the crowds if you want to check out the crown jewels. It might take a couple hours to check every things out, so allow yourself enough time. Also, the white tower has a lot of stairs, so beware. It's good exercise though, lol. The cafe was great to rest or grab a bite. The food was a little bit expensive but tasty. I would highly recommend this place if you are curious about the history of London."
"August 4, 2021",One of the best London attractions,"We visited as a family today and thought this was a fantastic attraction. We were lucky enough to catch a guided tour by one of the Yeomen Warders, which was absolutely brilliant. He was so knowledgeable, and all the history is just fascinating.There was a bit of a queue to see the Crown Jewels but it soon went down. This was something I’d always wanted to see and it didn’t disappoint.We easily spent a good three hours there with a 1 year old and 9 year old.I’d say this is probably one of the best attractions in London and the best historical landmark we’ve ever visited. I’d say this is an absolute must if you visit London."
"May 24, 2022",Worth it!,"Terrific day at this HRP site was so worth it! Was fortunate to get Yeoman Gary (with a beard, heard there are 2 Garys and this is how to distinguish them) for our welcome presentation (no extra fee, everyone can get this introduction if you time your entrance to when they are offered). Totally engaging and delightful and full of historical tidbits delivered in quite the style. Brilliant!"
"June 2, 2022",What a treat,"We went in half term using a 241 deal with our rail ticket . We used the £ saved to buy the audio guides but actually I felt the talks around the site are much much better so would seek that out next time. We were there from lunch till it closed ! There’s content in every room to interact with , a lot of thought has gone into making it as interesting as it is . We waited till end of the day & walked straight in to the Crown Jewels . We all really loved it & having been now see why it’s London’s most popular site."
"October 13, 2023",Great morning at The Tower of London,"Enjoyed our morning at The Tower of London. We were in at 10am and went straight to see the Crown Jewels display,  as heard later there would be a queue. Was good advice.Then did the free Beefeater tour - our guide was Shady , an interesting , humorous and informative 40 minute walk and talk on the history of the Tower. Then explored on our own. Would definitely recommend."
"October 21, 2023",A long time overdue visit,"Wifey, myself & friend visited here on the first day of half term and glad we booked our tickets online because, when we arrived, there was a 5 hour wait if you hadn’t !We took the Beefeater guide and, because of the really bad weather, storm Babette, we were taken into the chapel for a brief 25 minute chat which was really funny but enlightening and entertaining talk. We then left to explore the rest of the castle which the Crown Jewels exhibition, which I hadn’t seen since i was 8 0r 9, reduced me to tears in heir scope & beauty…The Ghosts walking around in celebration of Halloween were a great addition…My only criticism would be the 30 minute talk we decided to listen to in the chapel in the white tower which was very very dry…Overall, despite he weather we had a great day !!!"
"September 3, 2021",Excellent for sunflower families. Staff go above and beyond! ,"I have just returned from a day out at the tower and have never felt so compelled to write a review! I was with my two children, the youngest of whom has special needs, and my mum (who had an injured foot) I had chosen to come post covid as I knew it was slightly less busy and my son would cope better - however I really needn't have worried, as soon as we entered I got chatting to a Yeoman Warder, he showed me his sunflower wristband and told me about his family members similar to my son, made such a fuss of both of my kids and I felt so welcome straight away! This theme continued with all the staff, my con often touched people's legs, and got the rear end of another warder, I was mortified as usual, but he and another warder laughed it off and made us all laugh too, again making a fuss of both of my kids, as my elder child can often get a bit left out when her brother takes priority, this wasn't the case at the tower! When in the main, white tower the staff again went above and beyond, due to the steps we were all on foot and my son was tired, and lying on the floor, obviously although I try not to react to onlookers it makes you feel stressed, but the staff were able to approach us in such a relaxed manner, I didn't feel stressed or like we were a problem, only supported! One staff member magically got through to my son who has very limited communication and convinced him to walk to the dragon, once on that floor another staff member found his way to us and took both of my kids under his wing, showing them all the interactive games and helping them work them all in a fashion where they could both be involved! We were then offered the staff exit stairs so that it would be quieter, however we wanted to see the dungeon, so this guy held the crowd for a minute so that we could go down an otherwise very busy staircase a little more calmly! Throughout the day Yeoman Warders we had spoken to came over to chat and check we were okay, always including the kids, they also advised the best places for my mum to join in or sit out as she had injured her foot. I became a little overwhelmed with emotion near the end of the day when chatting to one warder because I have never quite experienced a whole venue that is so inclusive of autism and special needs, I would reccomend this venue to any and all families, I really felt like we might miss out not being able to have a guided tour (as my son wouldn't tolerate that) but I feel that we, and all visitors really, totally got the star treatment! I can't wait to come back, possibly on a girl's evening with my daughter and mum again to see the ceremony of the keys. We all had the BEST day! "
"October 15, 2023",Good visit,We really enjoyed our trip round the Tower of London. Lots of things to look at and the kids loved it. Need to sort the pricing out to make it affordable for the average family so more people can experience this great facility
"October 26, 2020",Safe but disappointing during covid,"After an enjoyable  visit prior to covid restrictions when we had an excellent guided tour by one of the Yeoman guards, I wanted my granddaughters to have the same experience.  This was not to be as the tours have been suspended due to Covid safety restrictions. I abandoned  the audio guide as although the facts were given, it was dry and boring for teenagers.  There are Beefeaters dotted around the Towers who will answer any questions, but if you don't know the questions to ask.......My recommendation would be to delay a visit until normal service is restored in order to have a 5* experience "
"February 3, 2020",Fantastic Day of being a tourist,"Americans, living in London, loving ""tourist days.""  This is a must.  Yeoman Warder tour is the best part of the day, retired UK military guys, devoted to maintaining traditions and sharing with others.  As a retired military myself, was proud of their professionalism and thoroughly loved their stories.  My wife and I love to read all the bits around the castle.  If you do too, plan 3-4 hours, nice cafe if you need a break."
"July 8, 2021",Just brilliant,"It's been a long time since my last visit to the Tower and it felt immensely special to be there when there were so few other tourists about, time to linger in the rooms and read all the information without being jostled or feeling like you were in the way. But any time its a fantastic place to visit and certainly a half-day or more activity - we were there from 1pm til closing and didn't see everything.A special thank you to the guide in the armoury who told even us history nerds thins we didn't know about jousting, destriers and the connection between Henry VIII and the moon landing."
"June 29, 2023",Very interesting but way too crowded,"Amazing place but I had to deduct 2 whole stars as the crowds had a big impact on my day. You are herded like cattle through all of the attractions and it’s really too busy to enjoy properly. The queue for the Crown Jewels was over an hour long (I went Monday morning) and you had to queue for the majority of other things for a while. At over £30pp they must be making a fortune! Would be good to see limits on amount guests per day. Otherwise staff were very nice, attractions were interesting and place looked great. Wild garden at the most was especially lovely (and nice and quiet!). I’d love to go back without the thousands of people there"
"February 24, 2020",Too much to see,"We arrived around 11 and bought our entry through the bus tour so got 20% off. The place is steeped in history and make sure you go on one of the tours, they are free, very interesting and highly amusing. My only piece if advise I would give is arrive early and expect to spend most of the day here. We were there for a good 5-6 hours and we didn't see everything. (Good excuse to go back!!!) I can also imagine if you went in peak times the queue for the crown jewels would be unbearable!! Definitely worth a visit."
"April 9, 2023",A walk through history with one of the Beefeaters!,We did ours via a London Pass in 1st week of April. The narrated tour with one of the beefeaters was great and very informative. The stories they tell and the history was very fascinating. Highly recommended!! We didn't get to see the jewels etc since the lines were too long and we were slightly pressed for time that day.
"July 30, 2022",Wonderful experience but where are the recycling bins??,Such a brilliant day out - plenty to keep everyone entertained for 4-6 hours or more. Highlights are the White Tower and Crown Jewels. Staff are friendly. You can take in your own food and drink which is a bonus if you’re a big family. My only negative was that we didn’t see any recycling bins on site - loads of litter bins but not a single recycling bin. It’s unforgivable in this day and age!
"May 1, 2022",THE CROWN JEWELS OF ATTRACTIONS,Visited on a chilly day which wasn't too busy. We managed to do half of the main attractions including the guided tour and the crown jewels and thoroughly enjoyed all of it. We spoke to several friendly and informative Beefeaters and members of staff. A return visit is required to complete everything there is to see. The only downside was the rather expensive lukewarm coffee we payed for in the café restaurant.
"January 6, 2020",Take a free tour with one of the Yeonan guides,I can definitely understand why this was the most recommended place in London. Try to be there until 14:30 when its the last tour.  But you should know that if you take the last tour you won’t have time to visit the towers/cathedral/castle. We had this amazing Yeonan guide who explained us the interesting part of the castle history in a funny way that we did not realise when 40 minutes passed. From the walls of the castle you will have a great view of the Tower Bridge. 
"April 27, 2022",Enjoyable Day Out,"Lived in London for over twenty years but never went to the Tower or the Crown Jewels until recently. Its worth a visit but I would advise going early in the day ( if in school holidays)  and going to the Crown Jewels first as the queues can get horrendous later. The guided tours from the Yeoman should not be missed. Quite pricey however, and worth considering a Historic Royal Palaces pass if you are likely to go more than once the year or visit other places like Hampton Court which are covered by the membership."
"July 10, 2022",Too comericalised ,"Becoming too commercialised nowadays, since the poppies display all those years ago the outer castle is losing its character too much trying to get extra revenue on these displays. You don't need to pay extra for the super bloom display just walk down the side near the ticket office and it's free unless you want to walk on a path way between flowers. Overall experience inside the walls was good well sign posted for though we went around 2pm and was very busy,Q for crown jewels was very long and some kind of shade would have been good as Q's are outside though always moving.Would we go back again No"
"August 8, 2021",The Tower of London is a must if you know about  King Henry’s history,This visit was pre-pandemic. We arrived there right when it opened without any tickets. Thankfully the line to get in and to buy tickets were moving so we jumped in line and was able to tour it quickly before hopping on an afternoon flight. I had watched a few history shows on King Henry so visiting this place really made those stories a lot more vivid. There are lots of signs to learn about this place but it would take a longer time to visit through. I was able to visit this place in about 2 hours and understand most of what I saw from the history documentaries. I recommend visiting this historic tower. It was easy to get by on public transportation to get here from my hotel which was over 10 miles away.
"November 4, 2021",Highly recommend a visit,This took me right back to childhood and visiting here with my dad.  I would recommend getting there early if you want to see the jewels as by lunchtime the queue was massive whereas a few hours earlier we were able to walk right in.Give yourself a few hours to visit everything as the place is seeped in history with lots to see and it would be a shame to miss anything.Some of the places to visit involve stairs and narrow spiral staircases so this is something to bear in mind if you don't like that kind of thing but you can walk all the way around the site if you walk up the walls.We also had lunch in one of the on site cafes and that was lovely good service and great foodDefinitely one of the highlight of our trip to London.
"August 28, 2022",Go Early to Avoid Crowds at the Tower of London,We purchased tickets ahead of time for the 9 a.m. opening of the Tower of London and arrived before opening. We avoided the crowds and did not experience any lines inside. We went without a guide but found that the workers inside the towers were very knowledgeable and were able to answer our questions.
"October 21, 2021",Great historical building (and no one lost their head),"What more could you ask for, Beefeaters, sentries wearing bear skins, Crown Jewels and so much moreIf your visiting and want historical England then a castle is a must on your trip.There will be queues and  bag searches but once through the gates you are transported back to yea olden times.Book a tour with a Beefeater or take the audio tour to make the most of your visitFrom torture chambers to Royal bedrooms there is so much to take inAllow at least 2 hours"
"November 20, 2022",Superbloom,"To celebrate the Queen's platinum jubilee, the moat surrounding the Tower of London was planted with flowers.  The event was called ""Superbloom"".  It was quite a sight to see the proliferation of beautiful flowers in what was once the moat.  Visitors received a flower guide so they could identify the flowers."
"October 15, 2020",Watch the TV series first ! ,"My wife and I were eagerly waiting for our visit to the Tower. We recently watched the Channel 5 series about the Tower and from this, really appreciated the stories the Tower has to offer which we would of missed. Such as some of the prisoners graffiti and their meanings, also the various different stories of the people we met such as the first ever lady Beefeater , the Raven Master and the Deputy Commander walking her delightful dogs. No queues for the Crown Jewels and was lovely to be here without all the crowds however feel for the people who work here that need the crowds to keep their jobs. Really is bittersweet. "
"September 4, 2023",A great location to experience,"This was my second time visiting The Tower of London but I hadn't been for at least 25 years!It is something that has to be experienced and is a wonderful place for families. While my friend and I didn't do a Yeoman (Beefeater) tour, we had the useful map to explore the areas and had a good day. I would probably recommend this however as everyone sounded to be having a wonderful time and the Yeomans are very informative and have a great sense of humour.The setup for the Crown Jewels is so much better than I remember from last time. It's very secure, well laid out, and is great to keep people moving so everyone can see everything clearly. There are refreshment areas dotted around and we were lucky to be there on a beautiful day. I noted that there are umpteen opportunities to buy something from a shop. Rather than being one, there is a main shop, a raven shop and a Yeoman shop! "
"October 27, 2021",Great visit!,"Family with 14 & 12 year olds. Thoroughly enjoyed by us all, the stand out was definitely the yeoman warder tour which we joined on arrival. Perfectly pitched and informative tour which engaged and entertained us all, thanks Beefy#409!As it was half term, long queues for everything, as you would expect (particularly the Crown Jewels exhibit which was almost an hour queue!)"
"September 3, 2020",Great,I haven't been to the Tower for about 50 years and my partner has never been so we decided to include it on this trip.Really well organised and socially distanced with limited numbers. masks worn in all interior areas. Worked really well.
"November 1, 2021",Overpriced disappointment,"Nearly £50 for one adult and one child. Admittedly, we went during the bank holiday, so our time was mostly spent in queues. The buildings are iconic, but once you get inside, the exhibits are of a poor quality and little effort to make history come alive. My advice would be to walk around the outside, and visit the Leeds Armouries, which is free to enter."
"September 28, 2022",Highlight of my trip,"I've read about the Tower of London all my life so to stand here was a dream come true.  So many historic moments took place here, more than I ever knew.  For anyone who loves British history, this is a must see.  The Crown Jewels are awe-inspiring to say the least.   From the time the building started, through WW2, this place has been the center of British history.  Unforgettable."
"February 7, 2020",Fantastic day out ,"Can’t recommend a visit to the Tower of London enough, it’s a fantastic day out. Our Yeoman Warder Matt gave a great tour, he’s really approachable and helpful so keep an eye out for him. The ravens are such characters, I could have watched them for hours! The armoury is jam packed and the Crown Jewels are stunning. Well worth a visit. "
"January 4, 2020",Amazing amount to take in,"We spent a whole morning here, but we could easily have spent the whole day here if we had the stamina to take everything in. Although I had been prepared for massive queues and crowds, we went late morning and managed to get in straight away. My personal highlight was the talk about the ravens, such lovely stories to hear about the mythology surrounding the ravens and how they are well looked after."
"January 1, 2023",Crown palace creates larger que atteraction,Tower of London is the most important and iconic place of London. Becoz of kohinoor crown that attractes world wide tourists. Larger people wants to see first crown. Very huge tower. Takes atleast 3/4/5 hours to see all sections. Gift shops are available. All section try to see. Their security guard called yoman and yowomen. They have particular dress with gives good get up. Can click lots of pictures but inside crown room it's not allowed. Full tower made from stone building.Must visit place of London.
"August 30, 2020",Expected more but worth a visit ,"Despite it being through lockdown, the place itself was quite interesting. Would not spend £25 on it again. There was quite poor management of social distancing, but not much that the staff could do as everyone was trying to get to the exhibit as soon as possible. There was a lot to see but sadly we didn’t have enough time for it. If you are looking to go, I would suggest to allow yourself 2/3 hours just in case of any queues that might happen. Best thing to see was the Crown Jewels as they are incredible! It doesn’t have much details on the history of the royal family, but it does have a lot interesting facts. "
"August 3, 2022",See the crown jewels!,Wee opted not to take a tour and just go on our own.  It was broiling hot outside but the interiors of the tower are reasonably cool.  You are provide with a map upon arrival and it is very easy to negotiate your way around depending on where your interests lie.  The crown jewels are a definite must-see but so many of the aspects of this amazing property are fascinating.  Enjoyed it very much.
"July 22, 2021",Yeoman Warder Tour with Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly hashtag Beefy409 ,"When in London come on down to the Tower of London. Come and explore the vast wealth of history that is buried within the inner and outer walls. A must do is a Yeoman Warder tour. I would highly recommend having a tour with none other that Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly hashtag Beefy409. If you want blood, sweat, shock horror and gore and I mean gore then he is your Yeoman to give you it all. Well worth it and then you can explore the rest of this Royal Hostorical Palace in your own leisure. You will get a glimpse of the Crown Jewels, see the Ravens and the guards. There is something for all ages. You can even have a photo with your favourite Yeoman Warder.."
"August 17, 2023",Suprisingly Good,We were slightly late that morning but we didn't miss out on the tour. We joined a Beefeater tour! The best tour we had on our trip. He gave all the gruesome details but balanced that with a great sense of humor. I overheard an American tourist tell her child that British people have a very different sense of humor based upon word play. I love that sense of humor - it is a very intelligent sense of humor. We also spent time in the cafe - the food was fantastic and all the food was labelled for allergens. My son also went and spent time with the ravens and was very impressed with that exhibit as well.
"July 21, 2023",Go somewhere else!,"10'oc in the morning and the place was well on its way to being jammed packed. Twice took audio back as it wasn't working , 3rd time gave up and just went with the flo of reading what was available on walls. Most rooms had nothing in them apart from written history on walls.. crown jewels was a nightmare with no control of crowds and pushing and shoving. Queued for about 25 mins...Can't tell you how many times I got attacked by a pushchair!. Got round the whole place in about 2 hrs and every beefeater we spoke to was so polite. Thank god for them ! but absolutely would not go back, total waste of money spoilt by no crowd control."
"November 12, 2021",Beautiful day overall but I do hold a grudge,"Absolutely beautiful place to visit with so much interesting information and history to learn, beefeaters  all very helpful and we really enjoyed our time there. Great value for money and the children loved every part of it, my only issue was with a rather large round person who seem to be called spike ( sure that’s not what his mother named him ) anyway very very rude and patronising who seemed to have a rather high opinion of himself and was rude and offensive to quite a number of people in the crowd that day. He really let himself down and the team around him because of his behaviour ! I’m thinking he is someone who thought he was way more important than he actually was.Because of how he made people feel I would not return  but other than that easy to get to and a lovely day out."
"April 3, 2022",Tour with friends,I visited here on Friday 1st April 2022 we had a very informative and humorous tour with Gary. Highly recommend for a good day out in London. We also got a good deal on days out 2for1 tickets
"November 15, 2021",Go see the changing of the guards!,"Definitely on the top 10 list of places to go in London. The changing of the guards is a must-see too. Funny how they say “who comes there” instead of “who goes there”…makes total sense, as they explained….we don’t care who is going, we want to know who is coming."
"February 3, 2020",The Dark Side of London's History,"Very informative. The Yeomen Warder (beefeater) guide was funny as hell! Dry British Humor at its best! Every brick and stone has a history worth hearing. Don't spend your time taking selfies, try to take in all what the beefeater is saying, it really is really interesting. Once the tour is done, then you can go about with the selfies, for instagram's sake. Great tour. Great Guide. All-around worth every cent (or pence)."
"August 21, 2023",Worth visiting,"Great experience, the collection of the crown jewels was magnificent and worth the wait in the long line.There is a cafe where you can order different types of food.I've spent a few hours at the place, but you can easily spend the whole day there if you go to all the exhibitions."
"January 2, 2020",Great place to bring history alive,"I went in half term in October with my 6 and 12 Yr old. My 12 Yr old was learning about William the conquer, so visiting the tower really helped bring the subject alive for him. As a family we love history, so the Wardens tour again helped bring the subject alive, especially when he used my 12 Yr old to demonstrate beheading, which both my kids thought was brilliant. Visiting the church and seeing the names of those killed at the tower was particularly thought provoking for us all. Didn't have to wait too long for the crown jewels, no longer than 30 mins. It's one of London must see buildings."
"June 2, 2022",Challenging,"We visited the tower on 30th May 2022. We were quite disappointed as the place is not very wheelchair friendly. There are to many cobbles and you can’t visit many things in there because they are all accessible by stairs. Whilst we got the carer ticket free which is good, it is still expensive if the only things you can see are outside."
"January 17, 2023",So Much History,We took this tour using our London Pass.  The tour guides are very unique...ex military with distinguished service records.  The guided tours give you a very good 45 minute high level history tour.  You can then self tour the grounds/building including seeing the Crowned Jewels.  Overall a very good tour.
"March 13, 2022",Well worth the admission,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and found the staff very helpful.The portholes for taking photos were really helpful and the views on a clear day were excellent. The glass floor was fascinating, if slightly unnerving but the younger generation seemed to be thrilled by the ceiling mirrors."
"August 13, 2022",All pomp & crown Jewels.,We pre - booked  for 10.30 ..but got in for 10.00 so a bonus for us as it meant we could go and beat the queues for the Crown Jewels.. was it worth it !!??? It was ok !? As for the rest of the tower again its not overwhelming but with the odd changing of the Guard and the obligatory Beefeaters walking around not much to get to excited about or you may  fancy a drink or a bite to eat in the overpriced cafe ....still its a must do when in London-and still worth a visit
"May 3, 2022",Tower of London.. Scott Kelly Beefeater ,"Absolutely amazing experience here today. Would highly recommend it, I came a few years ago but wanted to come back to listen to the Beefeaters tour. We had the Beefeater Scott Kelly who was fantastic. In fact can I just say how fabulous they all, are so informative and happy to chat with everyone."
"April 4, 2023",Great Experience,"Great place. Definitely reccomend a tour by Beefy409 he was amazing, really put his all into the tour and eveyone loved it.Lots to see and do, it was busy but everywhere is in London so not sure why people moan about this. Great place to visit."
"November 3, 2022",Tower of London,We spent several hours at the tower of london. So much history and the people there to assist you were great. The way it is set up it is easy to get around. We recommend the audio tour which was very interesting and told us about things in depth which was really nice. If you go plan on 3 hours to just see everything that is available to see. 
"July 14, 2020",Amazing ,"Very much enjoyed our trip to the Tower of London-our tour guide was very funny and had a lot of information to give us-he answered all our questions very well. Even though it was raining, it was a very enjoyable visit and lovely views over to the London Bridge. Great gift shop with a good range of stuff and a nice café to. Enjoyed the horse museum upstairs and also the walk around the walls."
"April 19, 2022","Family trip to the Tower of London, in the Easter Holidays.","A Family trip ( 2 adults 2 children) on a Wednesday morning, during the Easter Holidays.Prepaid and booked a family ticket, which was easy to collect no queue.Straight in through the front gates staff were friendly and welcoming, again no queue. Once inside we shot straight into see the Crown Jewels, glad we did because a little later the line to get in was enormous.Spent just over 3 hours there and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. You could easily spend a day in there but I would say 3-4 hours will cover the main attractions and general experience."
"May 7, 2022",Worth to visit,"One tourism „must-be“ in London. Good access by Underground next to Tower Bridge. We ordered tickets the same day morning over internet. There are also some special packages a la 2-3 places with more discount available but we did not see a point to have a kind of obligation to plan our Lonton-stay too much upfront. A great place to visit if you are interested in history, royal families and jewellery, arms, castles."
"April 14, 2023",A must! ,This review could go on and on. Definitely for us it was worth it. The history and the scenery and everything else was fantastic. We did a self-guided tour and spent about 3 hours there and could have spent more time but ran short.
"January 6, 2020",Definite Visit if in UK,"Plan for an entire day if it during a peak day, i.e. weekend or holiday time frame. Plan for long lines for each section that can last up to 1.5 hours inside. We went end of December and were able to get into only 2 sections."
"November 21, 2023",Beefy 409,Beefy 409 made our trip. I would thoroughly recommend attending a tour with a Beefeater (Yeoman of the Guard). He brought entertainment & many Stories of the history of the tower to life with his enthusiasm & passion.
"August 17, 2023",You gotta love lines,"Word of advice if you don't want to wait around all day GO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING!!!Our tickets were for early afternoon and by then the place is packed with people everywhere. The line for the crown jewels exceeded the designated area and went down the hill with an estimated wait time of 45 mins to an hour, according to the sign. It's a cool building but my favorite place was the moat. It had about a dozen people wandering around and was full of wild flowers."
"January 25, 2020",Tower of Terror,"This historic landmark was amazing. I recommend going first thing in the morning when they open and head straight to the Crown Jewels. No photos are allowed. We were able to get up close though and spend time admiring them. By the time we left the tower later that day, the crowds were crowds and I’m sure tough to see the jewels. Ask lots of questions. The staff is very informative. Great views of London Bridge from the Tower. Don’t forget to visit the birds. "
"February 26, 2022",Great day at the Tower of London.,"Brilliant, there are so many interesting areas to explore. Every area we visited had amazing informative dusplays.Buildings are amazing. I can't believe how old these buildings are. Lots of walking to be done with plenty of steps and walkways. If you have mobility difficulties, some areas will be hard to access. I think we arrived at the right time, as the day went on, many of the areas were packed with tourists, which is to be expected.The crown jewels are amazing you are not allowed to take pictures. The whole area is kept spotlessly clean, with plenty of seating areas to rest your feet.Loved the Yeoman Wardens, who I stopped to have a quick chat with. Very enjoyable and knowledgeable day. I'm looking forward to our next visit."
"September 18, 2021",Loved it!,"Came in the mid-week with my girlfriend. It wasn’t too busy which made it even better, plenty of time and space to see everything without feeling too cramped or hurried. A wonderful (£5 extra) audio guide really helped to enhance the experience and I learnt so much! We also learnt a lot from a Yeoman who was positioned near the Chapel of St Peter Ad Vincula - funny, friendly and very informative. So much amazing stuff to see from the etchings in the walls by prisoners, Henry VIII’s armour and of course the State Crown Jewels which were absolutely amazing. Well worth a trip, would definitely recommend looking at going when it’s not as busy!"
"March 14, 2022",Fantastic Tower,"Despite numerous trips to London, I had never been to the Tower of Lindon, so decided to rectify that!Online booking was very straightforward, but I didn't realise you need to go to the ticket office to get a carer's ticket (my daughter has a disability) and as such, the person at the entente was a bit grumpy with me.However once inside we had a fantastic day! We elected not to do a 'Beefeater' tour due to my daughter but took our time to walk around and take everything in. We were lucky enough to have a chat with Chris the Ravenmaster and also Emma, one of the lady Yeoman Warders.Absolute must see are the Crown Jewels. We were lucky at that it was relatively quiet on our visit, so we didn't have to queue and went through twice! You really won't believe they are all genuine.Lots more to see, such as the White Tower, exhibitions, the Chapel, the 'prison room' with it's fascinating graffiti and of course, the Ravens.Food - we got hotdogs at the Raven cafe not cheap,but expected Gift shops available.As I mentioned it was quiet on our visit and I'm glad about that.  All in all, we had a fabulous day and would definitely recommend."
"November 9, 2022",Must see,"Wonderful history in an overwhelmingly grand place. All staff were wonderful and a highlight was meeting one of the Tower ravens up close while it was casually perched on a bench! If you like old buildings, gory history, the Monarchy, Ravens, any history at all, architecture, pompous displays of wealth, great views of the Thames, or implements of torture, this is a must visit. Note on accessibility: staff are helpful and accommodating. Most of the towers and buildings are via stairs but they do have lifts in some areas. Lots of walking but also a fair bit of seating."
"October 29, 2022",Good but needs deeper William the Conqueror background.,"Great experience, but the history of William the Conqueror is only very lightly delved into, and it deserves more.  Before my second visit, I actually visited Bayeux, France whose tapestry museum explains him in much more detail.  With this information in hand, my second visit to the Tower was so much more complete.  Suggest you read about William before you go to appreciate the historical significance appropriately."
"October 27, 2023",My favorite attraction,We visited in September and the queue for the crown jewels was very small. You can easily spend the whole day in this place. There is a lot to see and explore. The lunch in their cafeteria was excellent. In between exhibits you can enjoy the park. It is simply amazing!
"February 26, 2020","Stunning day out so much more than just the crown jewels, the white tower alone is a magnificent attraction",This has to be the best value tourist attraction in London. We visited in February which is in the middle of the off season so no ques and yet we still took 4 hours to get round. Amazing historical venue that makes you appreciate architecture and craftsmanship from 1000 years ago. The jewels are incredible but the white tower and what it holds are simply incredible. Do visit his place
"January 18, 2020",Great historic palace,"This is a great attraction to see with so much to see and do. The crown jewels are a great part and they are so great. The yeoman warden tour is great, it is very entertaining and full of great history. The yeoman warder was very entertaining and i really enjoyed. This is a great attraction for all. Well worth a visit.  "
"January 18, 2022",Off with her head,Great day out. Worth every penny. Make sure you take a Beefeater tour.. very informative and entertaining.  Its a bit of a queue to see the crown jewels and they could prob use the queueing space once inside a bit better but the jewels are stunning and the ravens and people spotting kept the wait lively.  Food and drink as expected expensive and limited choice but adequate. Fun day had by all
"November 28, 2021",A brilliant day - could have spent longer!,"We had a great day at the Tower despite the chilly weather. Mark the Yeoman Warder gave a hilarious and educational tour that was definitely the highlight. The Crown Jewels were spectacular - as was the collection of armoury. We were disappointed to discover that - by buying tickets for the 12pm slot - we had just 3.5hours at the Tower, which really was not enough to do everything. Therefore if you are going I would recommend getting the 10am slot and spending all day there."
"December 25, 2022",Excellent!,"So much history. The Crown Jewels are kept here, so if there are many people visiting, go there first. We got an audio tour and were lucky to go into a church and one of the Beefeaters was speaking. He was amazing. We enjoy all the history he shared and what a prestigious branch of the service it is. Really interesting. The other thing we found amazing was the history of the ravens. What huge creature. I believe there are eight of them. They are kept there. So many parts to this tower, it was fascinating.From there we crossed the London Bridge and went to Burroughs Market."
"April 7, 2022",Walking through history,This is a can't miss during any visit to London. How often do you get a chance to walk through a building built in 1060? And such an interesting contrast to some of the ultra-modern buildings around it. And the Crown Jewels - must see. Just breathtaking 
"June 4, 2022",Packed with History,I would give yourself as much time as you can to tour around the Tower of London. The amount of history packed into this building is astonishing. I especially loved seeing the old carvings in the stone from prisoners of note. It was such a spectacular place to visit. The Crown Jewels are amazing! We had no line at all to see them. I would definitely give yourself all day to explore this amazing location!
"January 30, 2023",Lots to see,The tour is half personal guide and half self guided.  The beefeaters are interesting and lively with lots of details to share and a bit of personality to go with it.  Lots of history in these buildings and lots of mystery as well.
"December 21, 2021",Never Disappoints,"I'm not sure what I could say about the Tower that hasn't been said in its 1,000 year life, but every time I've been I've found something else to surprise me. The audio tour lets you pick and choose your path so you can see what you want in the time you have. My only issue with the audio was that it would tell you to click for more but ""more"" wasn't always available. And if you lost your place, it could be hard to find your way back. Overall though, it gave a good amount of information without being overwhelming."
"December 26, 2022",No time to see any exhibitions,"I had a very bad experience because they sell tickets for 15:30 and 16:00 and once you get in at those times, you get informed they are closing all the exhibitions. So all you can do is wander around the inner gardens. I am sure the exhibitions are amazing, but I wasted my money. Please, stop selling tickets at those times so people don't get disappointed."
"February 3, 2021",The mighty Tower of London,This place tells some stories which is why it's worth while waiting for the  guides which takes place through out the day.the Castle grounds are kept  immaculate as you would expect.This site must of been daunting for the visitors who entered the Traitors Gate from the River Thames.Don't miss the Crown Jewels as well as the other showrooms.This Castle and the nearby Tower Bridge look and go so well together.
"January 10, 2020",Excellent historical site to visit in London,"We loved our visit to the Tower of London.We arrived in time for the excellent Yeoman Warden's tour with Yeoman Warden Scott Kelly. He provided entertaining insight into the history of the site. We giggled and gasped our way around the various locations. Following that we visited the Crown Jewels, the battlements and the armoury. We were impressed with how beautiful and well maintained the site is. The exhibits are well presented and easy to get to, although stairs are involved in places like the battlements and the White Tower. We had lunch in the cafe. The food was excellent with hearty portion sizings. We did not have time to see everything so we would happily come again."
"July 10, 2022",Bigger than expected,"As you walk in you are welcomed by the Beefeaters. We made our way straight to the Crown Jewels exhibit as the line was long. Be prepared to wait. Whilst it was interesting and great to see the jewels, you weren’t actually able to view for long as people were streaming past. No photos either. You can walk around the top of perimeter wall, where we were surprised to see that people actually lived within the Tower grounds. The White Tower and the other exhibits were fascinating and informative. You could spend hours here. The grounds were huge, much bigger than I expected.We were also please to see the changing of the guards."
"February 29, 2020",Wow what a place,"Recently visited with a friend while in London. I have been before as a child but had limited memories so as a big history especially Tudor fan it was time to visit again. It's a massive place so wear comfortable clothes and footwear, so many steps! So much to see inside. The queue for the crown jewels was long but it did flow so didn't feel too bad, however once through the door don't believe your queue is over because it continues inside for longer. Staff / yeoman weren't too friendly and seemed stressed, not exactly the tourist friendly staff advertised which was a shame. Beautiful place."
"April 11, 2023",Disappointing,Don’t assume that when you have a time to enter that you won’t have to queue again once you are in the grounds. We attempted the Crown Jewels queue twice - a very long queue which was not fun in the wind & rain. There isn’t actually a lot to see and no interactive elements so quite boring  in parts especially with children. The Crown Jewels were good but overall  it wasn’t  worth the cost & queuing. We wouldn’t go again & wouldn’t recommend.
"March 19, 2022",Do the Yeoman Tour and explore the White Tower,"Wasn't really sure what to expect when we first got here. There was a tour being given by one of the Yeomans what was starting a few minutes after our arrival. Since we had the extra time to spend and it was free, we gave it a shot. What a fortuitous decision. It was awesome. Our guide was witty and charming, providing excellent detail that was a great supplement to what you get when visiting the rest of the parts of the grounds on your own. Crown Jewels were nice too, if you're into that sort of thing, but the White Tower is where it's at. You could spend a great chunk of time in this tower, which unfairly gets overshadowed by the more famous Bloody Tower."
"January 2, 2020",Tower of London,"Spent over 4 hours there and some of the time was for lining up, especially the Crown Jewels. The guided tour gave a very good introduction. The Crown Jewels well worth the wait, and we waited until late afternoon when the line was shorter, still over half an hour to get in."
"February 10, 2020",The bloody tower,"Important place in British history, fearsome history. Having lived in London for many years I finally went to visit. Look at your leaflet immediately to choose a free tour, they are worthwhile although in the beefeater tour we chose there was too much standing around for my back.The ravens don’t leave because their wings are clipped which shocked me. Allow a few hours to absorb the written information and see everything. Take snacks. Ask questions of the helpful, friendly staff."
"October 2, 2021",A very good day out,"A very good day out at the Tower of London.  We had a tour with Scott ( beefy 409 if we remember correctly) which was entertaining.  Getting the history of the Tower.Seeing the Crown Jewels, of which we heard people saying  ‘Are they real?’  We laughed, did they not notice the access doors to this section.It takes a full day to see everything, so be sure to have everything that you need."
"February 16, 2023",Yeoman Warder tour was super,"Excellent visit to the Tower of London with our teens. The Yeoman Warder tour with Mark was excellent. Just the right amount of humour and fact thrown in. He really entertained us all and the time flew. Didn’t go to Crown Jewels as Q was long and saw them previously but they are worth a visit. We got 2 for 1 entry using the deal through the national rail tickets so check that out as it really saved us a lot of money. The cafe is good, quite pricey so we just had a coffee but nice space to take a breather. Highly recommend a visit to the Tower of London."
"February 20, 2020",The tour,This is one of the few places you should absolutely not miss in London. The fact that the Tower of London was built a 100 years ago! It has so much history to it. Literally just going there will get you on top of the last 1000 years of british history. The crown jewels were also amazing!
"April 6, 2023",Awful,"Visited the Thursday before Good Friday. Although we had pre-booked, we queued for some time to get in. The Beefeater tour we were taken on was absolutely rubbish. It was spitting with rain, so instead of taking us around the site, we were ushered into the chapel and given a very long winded talk - and that was literally the tour! We then had to queue for 90 minutes just to see the Crown Jewels. Badly organised and far too crowded! I really would not advise any family with young children to visit during the school holidays, they will be bored to tears. Honestly (unless you love crowds and long queues) stay away during tourist season. For that price - MUST DO BETTER!"
"July 28, 2021",Family day out and definitely visit if going to London,Fantastic visit to the Tower of London. Great for all ages. We have a teenager and 7 year old. Definitely recommend waiting to have the tour with the beefeaters. When  you enter the site you will see a board for the next time. Definitely worth the money. We spent 3 hours at the site. Cafe on site or you could bring a picnic and have after you leave over looking the Thames. Lots of walking and stairs if you do have little ones or have mobility issues. If you are visiting the Tower not much close by in terms of other attractions apart from the Sky Garden which I highly recommend. You will need to book a slot for this too.
"May 7, 2023",A must-see for any visitor to London,"The Tower has a long and fascinating history, and it is truly amazing to explore the grounds and learn about its past. It is also incredibly beautiful, with its walls and towers standing proud against the skyline. The Tower is also home to the Crown Jewels, which are truly stunning and an absolute must-see. The Tower of London is a great place to explore and learn about the history of the city. It is well-preserved, beautiful, and truly iconic. It is an experience that you won't forget!"
"May 30, 2022",One to see but on a nice day,"I've done quite a few tourist activities in London and do feel this was entertaining however , I think it does have to be nice weather as a lot of the area is outside and if like on our visit, it rains, it does cut the activity down. I would however say it's a very iconic place to go and the history or the place truly is interesting.Ticket cost is mid range which is to be expected for a tourist attraction."
"February 17, 2022",Great experience for all of the family. Make sure you do a Beefeater’s tour,"Great experience … Scott the Yeoman was easily 11 out of 10… he really made today the best day of our half term…. Informative , gory, fun & had everyone’s attention with a perfect delivery of historical stories & facts. Thank you Scott… Thank you Tower of London team … what an awesome day…."
"May 13, 2022",THE best thing we did in London.,"If you have only one day in London, this is THE ONE PLACE TO VISIT.   So much history in this spot and so many things to see and stories to hear!  We did the audio guides and they were well worth it but they were not well planned out. But THE best thing at the Tower are the Beefeater tours. Our guide, John, so informative and SO FUNNY!  It was the best thing we’ve done in London.  Definitely go early when it opens and go directly to the Crown Jewel exhibit. When you pass all the stations that hold the queue for getting to see them you’ll be happy to go right to the jewels with no crowd."
"June 21, 2020",Interesting Historical Location,"This is an interesting and educational site to visit. There is something for adults and children. Recommend arriving early and purchasing tickets online. If you want to see the crown jewels, GO THERE FIRST! The lines tend to be long. It is worth taking the free large group tour of the site, then I suggest exploring on your own. I loved the ravens!!"
"July 15, 2022",Don’t Let Summer Crowds Deter You,"The Tower of London is a truly fascinating place of world history. The grounds are well-kept and wheelchair-accessible, which allowed me to snap wonderful photos of the grand exterior at all angles. I enjoyed the signposts along the paths that gave neat info about the building. My only regret was not entering the Tower itself—next visit, when I go during the off-season! The area is definitely packed during the summer, and since I was in London amid the Jubilee festivities, things were even tighter—and I believe some places in the Tower were even cordoned off. Check out the Tower of London and put it high on your London bucket list, but know when to go so you get the most out of your experience."
"June 17, 2021",London at its best,"Amazing visit.Weather was great which helped and very quiet so had time to enjoy everything without queues etc.However what impressed me most was the staff - from arriving to the gentleman who had lots of information about the Crown Jewels - friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming. Really made our day memorable. Many thanks to all.Highly recommend."
"February 17, 2020",Locking up of the keys Ceremony,"Planned  a whole year before for the Locking up of the Queens Keys ceremony at the Tower of London,  due to high demand of tickets and a select amount of attendees at each event. Fantastic tour thanks to our guide Kev ( if you enjoyed the tour ) or Fred ( if you didn't ) who was brilliant, great fun !  It felt good taking part in a 700 year old tradition. Our whole trip was planned around this event and it was very special. "
"October 21, 2020",Educational and an experience ,"You know when you go to a place and forget where you are? Well I love London quite a lot but when I stepped into this castle, I genuinely forgot I was somewhere that was constantly busy on the outside. There is a one way system around the tower and reminders for social distancing and sanitizing. Plenty of benches to sit on if you just want a rest, to take the castle in or watch the guards. Yeoman warders are everywhere and will fill you up with lots of information on the castle, their job and so much more. I loved this visit, I will definitely return at some point probably when COVID is a little more relaxed and other areas of the castle are open such as the prison area. The crown jewels were my favourite part, just beautiful. "
"September 15, 2022",Must See!,"We were lucky to have traveled during the Jubilee celebration in which they had the Crown Jewels  plus a special exhibition of Queen Elizabeth's historic jewel collections during her last coronations, etc.  Of course, the history of the UK comes alive while touring the different buildings.  Just for funnies, check out the view around the outer walls."
"April 21, 2022",Diamonds are a girls best friend,Fabulous guided tour given by JD (John) the Yeoman.  It was well worth the hour we spent listening to John whilst he told us a lot of the history surrounding the Tower. Great visit. The Crown Jewels are so worth the visit.
"April 12, 2020",""" unforgettable""",Its an unforgettable experience that stays with you for a long time.  As soon as you walk through the grand gates you are transported back in time. Its not until you see the bustling traffic circling the tower you remember you are in modern day london.  There is so much to see and learn about the tower and all its history.  A great day out for all ages. Very helpful staff with a lot of knowledge about the tower and always happy to answer any questions. Great value for money.
"October 27, 2023",Lots to see but prioritise if you’re going at a busy time,"The attraction is fascinating. Huge amounts to see and really lovely views over the Thames too. Only criticism is the ridiculous queues. I’m wondering why there’s no maximumCapacity or what the capacity is because we had to queue for EVERY SINGLE ROOM and it just took the joy out of it all for me. My recommendation would be to get a 9am entry if you’re going at a half term / peak time, and to plan which bits you want to see unless you have more than 3 hours."
"January 4, 2020",Loved every second!,"We went at opening and flew through the gates.Then straight into the Crown Jewels (which I didn't think I cared about but were totally worth it) and go to admire everything at our own pace. I also enjoyed finding all the animal sculptures and the ravens! The history, of course, speaks for itself, and made this our favorite place visited during our trip."
"April 23, 2022",Must see friendly free tour,"In my opinion this is a must see destination for London. The admission is reasonable, and you can easily purchase tickets the day of your visit.  The tour with a Beefeater is included in admission, and this place has something for everyone.  A castle, history, crown jewels, and armor and weapons displays for the guys. "
"October 31, 2023",A fabulous day out,"This is the second time visiting the Tower of London and still enjoyed it as much as the first.The ticket included the Beef Eater tour and Crown Jewels. We left the tour after the first 40 minutes after the chapel because it was difficult to hear what the tour guide was saying, so we made our own way round and took our time.Could easily stay a full day exploring it all.Well worth the visit and value for money."
"January 13, 2020",Very interesting,"Great place to visit, even if crowded (seems to be unavoidable in London). We arrived late in the day and only had 2.5 hours to explore, so our last 20 mins were quite rushed. Allow at least 3 hours."
"August 22, 2023","Yeoman Warders guide, Tower of London","Attended one of the Yeoman Warders guides. Excellent!!! Nev the Yeoman guide has only been in the role for a few months, his knowledge and enthusiasm was brilliant. Fully recommend this if you want to learn a bit of English history, and meet to interesting characters…. "
"August 2, 2023",Getting locked in the tower....BRILLIANT!!!!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Tower of London. We were lucky enough to experience the tower during the day and at night during the Ceremony of the Keys (a must do if you can get tickets!).The crown jewels were brilliant, especially so soon after the King's coronation. It helped to give context to each of the pieces we saw up close. There is a line to see the jewels but it moves quickly. A tour with a Yeoman Warder is an absolute must! Nev, our Yeoman Warder, was not only very entertaining but also a font of interesting facts about the tower. The passion Nev and his fellow Yeoman Warders have for their roles is fantastic! Loved the jokes as well!You will not be disappointed when visiting the Tower of London! If only they offered sleepovers!"
"September 27, 2020",Great few hours exploring,"I was first in the queue as the Tower opened at 10am. There is a ceremony you can see if you are at the front of the queue. Well worth exploring all the areas, although it is worth noting some areas are closed due to COVID."
"September 19, 2023","Very disappointed, not accessible","We get inside the grounds only to find it is totally inaccessible to wheelchairs!After commenting to 3 Beefeaters and none offering any advice, one lady volunteer overheard my conversation and took us to the front of a huge long line at the Crown Jewel building where the ""only"" ramp in the entire venue was. The place is so highly overrated and not worth the price of admission."
"February 3, 2020",Worth a visit!,Lived in London for a number of years and finally managed to visit. Definitely recommend a tour with the beef eaters specially “Shady” (don’t go on the name - he’s a gem of a person).London tour incomplete without this tour!
"October 22, 2022",Wonderful place to visit with a couple of young boys,It was a lovely summer day when we took our grandson and one of his friends to visit The Tower. We all enjoyed it and managed to see most of the attractions. Everything is well set out and there is plenty of explanation available to make it truly accessible.
"October 31, 2022",Mixed feelings ,"Unfortunately the place is very very busy, packed qith people. Maybe less people should be let in within time slots. The tour with one of the yeomans was great, however the meeting point and the hours are nowhere to be seen. Then I got easily bored and tired, going from one place to another in the crowd. There is so much history involved but the building itself is not very interesting. Unfortunately we had to give up to see Crown jewels, because the queue was unbelievable. I have never seen such a long queue in my live and I remember communist times when we queue for everything. "
"November 30, 2021",magnificent tower and fortress,"you can easily spend 1-2 hours here to visit the different areas of the Tower. Most of the areas are open for public and you can also join some of their guided tours if you catch the time well when you arrived.The tower is located near to the subway so it is easy to travel there. however, there are some places that you need to climb up the narrow spiral stairway which might be challenging for elderly"
"February 19, 2020",History Galore,"If you love history it’s a great place. Was there for a family trip enjoyed our selfs. Wandered around for a couple of hours. The signage was a little different but no issues. Did not use a tour had fun roaming on our own, but had engaging interactive experiences through out. "
"February 4, 2021",Fantastic tour during quiet conditions,"With Covid-19 restrictions in place, there was a timed entry restriction in place that allowed us to have such a comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable visit.The Tower of London is a stunning palace and fortress, full of history and tales.The breathtaking exhibits are just spectacular.Top this off with the fabulous Beefeaters, and this was a priceless visit."
"July 18, 2022",Get here early to avoid crowds!,"Definitely get here early, we had to wait in a huge line to see the crown jewels and all buildings were just crowded, making it hard to enjoy everything.That being said, loved the history here. Everything was well done, I would recommend everyone visit here at least once."
"August 20, 2021",Crown jewels and the beheaded heads who had them on.,"Not as crowded as I'd have thought. The best part was when 2 Royal Guardsman yelled at a 10 year old girl to ""let pass"" and probably scarred her for life. Other than that it's cool history. Henry VIIIth et al. Wow. So much history. You go past the Crown Jewels on a conveyor belt (very good idea)"
"February 21, 2023",So much history - very enjoyable,You must do the free Yeoman guard tour (45 mins) starting every 30 mins whilst we were there. I knew very little about the tower and really enjoyed the trip. Lots to see and learn
"April 25, 2020",Bucket list place,"The first journey to London have to consist of checking out the monuments from postcards and movies, tasting the original cousine and having a chat with locals. As for the monuments we also visited the iconic Tower. Pretty spectacular and definitely not to be missed (but afterwards you won't forget it! ;))"
"February 10, 2020",The Jewel House is fantastic,"Because of membership of the Royal Palaces we went on a marvellous evening tour of the Jewel House and the Crown Jewels. 30 or so of us with canapes and wine to start the evening and then allowed to go round the Crown Jewels in our own time, unhurried and meaning that we could really soak up the history. An excellent evening without all the crowds."
"January 15, 2020",Fascinating!,"If history means anything to you, this is your place to visit! You can't help but feel the past as soon as you step foot on the grounds.   Try to arrive early morning and preferably with a tour guide.  There is so much to see and guide will make sure you don't miss a thing!   If you chose to do it on your own, be sure to see the crown jewels first.  The later it gets, the longer the line!    You can't help but feel the past as soon as you step foot on the property"
"January 17, 2020",Magnifique ,Yoeman warder tour is highly recommended. It will take almost 1 jour to listen to most of the stories happened in the tower and history of tower itself. Visiting the jewels and crowns is an amazing experience.
"October 20, 2021",Well worth a visit,Great visit here with teen and a 10 year old. We all loved it and spent quite a few hours exploring and admiring the jewels. Don’t bother with the cafe - lukewarm and expensive! Didn’t detract from the rest of the exhibits thankfully. Well worth reading the walls some fascinating yet terrifying insights to the history of the tower there. We took the hop on hop off bus out to the tower which took forever but was enjoyable as well as giving the feet a rest!
"April 7, 2023",Informative guide,"It was very nice to be at the very center of London, in the Tower that has been so well preserved for so many centuries. The beefeter tour was informative and fun, with a lot of excellent british humor. At times however it was a tiny bit hard to hear what the warden said when situated farther, as the group was big.However, we should have gone to the crown jewels first, because when our tour was finished at about 11, the que was so long that we decided against waiting and just skipped them. "
"January 5, 2023",Fantastic yeoman mark tour,"My husband and I visited The Tower of London on the 29th of December . We did a tour with Mark the yeoman. He was amazing, so funny , engaging with all age groups. You will need a good few hours to spend here, we queued for an hour to see the Crown Jewels but all other areas there was no Queue . Definitely prebook before going ."
"September 8, 2020",One of the best days out,"My son has been learning about Henry VIII so we brought him here. The Beefeaters are always so friendly and eager to chat, but it was great visiting soon after it has reopened as there were no crowds. Although a couple of parts were still closed, there was still plenty to see and we didn’t feel we had missed out."
"January 4, 2020",Second time with family,"Top attraction for families with kids! When I came here the first time there were not so many queues for each ""attraction"". We all had fun, anyway! The interactive section and the crown jewels are the parts that most interested the children (and the adults!). You can spend here the entire day with a break for lunch.Do not miss it!"
"June 22, 2022",More than one tower,We went on the guided tour and learned a great deal of history by a jovial guide dressed in period costume. Many of the anecdotes gave a little black humor to some rather grisly events that occurred over the centuries. We also saw the changing of the guards. This was suitable for all ages.
"August 22, 2022",Not just prisoners and beheadings.,"I admit, my view of the Tower was exactly that-prisoners and beheadings. There's so much more to it than that. The beefeaters are happy to share their knowledge and information with you. While we were there, an enactment of some historical scene was happening. It's a great morning activity. "
"November 16, 2022",Beefeaters,Wife and I spent a lot of time here. This is the London I was looking for not all the ugly new buildings around. My opinion only. This was a Palace Fortress and a prison. Walking ramparts or diving into every room this place is a step back in time. You have guided and unguided tours we chose to explore on our own. Crown Jewels my god the money. Put this on your list. 
"September 5, 2020",Visit with our grandchildren,We came here today and I hadn’t been in about 25 years. My husband and I loved it but my grandchildren thought it was awesome. My granddaughter thought the Crown Jewels were her favourite as did my husband. My grandson like the artillery exhibition which had the armour and the horses. I loved the torture unit. This had some sinister items that were genuinely used as punishment from some time ago. This is probably one of the best days I have had in such a long time. 
"June 2, 2020",Best Part of My Trip,"I loved the history that fairly oozes from this place. Lots of things to see and experience, you really need a whole day to explore it all. Grab lunch at the Hung, Drawn and Quartered when you're done, and a quick visit to All Hallows at the Tower after will round off the perfect day."
"January 18, 2020",Must do ,"I loved my visit to the Tower of London, it is a place filled with history. The Ravenmasters who acts as tour guides are AMAZING, they gladly share their knowledge and are super fun. I normally like to visit the places on my own but I loved having the Ravenmasters in our group, it sure make the place even better. "
"February 17, 2023",Family visit,"First time at the Tower and will definitely go back.Easy to  get to.Good value.Beuatifully maintained.Incredibly historic building with an enormous amount of artefacts, especially armour.The queue for the crown jewels was one hour, although we didn't bother as only the replicas were on show."
"May 21, 2022",London Tower and Yeoman Warder tour,The Yeoman Warder tour was great. Warder Scott Kelly gave an enthusiastic retelling of many of the historic events that have taken place at the Tower since it was first built. The tour was free and was definitely worth the 15 minutes wait at the entrance. The armor collection inside the White Tower was impressive and the Crown Jewel exhibit in the building across the courtyard is incredible.Would absolutely recommend for anyone visiting London.
"February 16, 2022",History brought to life.,Tied in with the kids’ school curriculum at the moment and helped bring the history to life. Went to see the Crown Jewels having lived abroad for six years so this was a kind of cultural thing for us. There are plentiful bathrooms and refreshments. Things to improve on: the gift shops offer truly terrible and tacky merchandise and if you visit in the summer when it is busier and have to wait outside in the switchback area then you won’t have shade from rain or shine so be prepared.  Staff were great in all cases.
"June 18, 2021",Don't leave this off your London list,This is definitely a highlight of London and must-see.  There is so much history here and presented in a great way for families of all ages.  The Yeoman are wonderful and give great information.  Definitely go to the Crown Jewels first as queues do pick up later and the White Tower had a queue after we had been in as well.  A couple of places were sadly closed but the majority was open and my family had an enjoyable time.  Toilets were clean and the shop was full of nice trinkets.
"July 22, 2023",Fascinating history," Our party of 2 adults and 2 teenagers spent 5.5 hrs here exploring all buildings. The Yeoman’s talks were amusing and informative inspiring us to research English history in more detail. Id like to say the highlight  was the crown jewels but  I think for me, it is the history- Henry VIII, Richard III, Lady Jane Grey and the royal beasts."
"April 17, 2023",Amazing day…,"After visiting London all throughout my childhood, the only attraction I haven’t done is the Tower of London. My fiancé and I decided to do this as part of my birthday weekend away and it’s safe to say it didn’t disappoint! We had a fantastic day, spent around 4 hours round there, spending time reading all of the history about the Tower of London. The highlight of our trip was seeing the Crown Jewels. We had to queue for 45 mins but was so worth it. The only downside was not being able to take any photos in that area- would have loved to have done this as a keepsake.100% worth every penny!"
"August 13, 2022",Get there before 11 & Go to the Crown Jewels 1st before the queue starts,"I’ve been so many times to London and never been here but after watching the show I knew we had to go and we’re not disappointed. So easy to get too, get around and the amount to see is fantastic. So much history all in one place. We were there 5 hours and didn’t see it all. Mainly because it was the heatwave and we were all in need of a rest and shade but saw 90% of it. Definitely be back to see the rest. Go to the Crown Jewels 1st"
"January 26, 2020",Great fortress to see from in and out,"This well maintained fortress used to be a prison where were settled well known prisoners. Building itself is huge and amazing, worth to see in the evening as is highlighted. It is located just next to Tower Bridge. Worth to admire it from Tower Bgidge upper level where you can get for aprox. £10."
"October 25, 2022",Spent day queuing,"Really disappointing visit. Appreciate it was half term but the queues were so long for everything that we spent most of the day queuing. I can live with queuing for the Crown Jewels but for every other tower, exhibition and area it was just too much. The only thing we didn’t queue for was initial entry. When we did get into the different areas it was so packed you couldn’t appreciate the exhibits. So sad as what we did see was really interesting. The Crown Jewels were stunning to see in real life."
"January 2, 2020",Amazing! English history at its best,Been here a few times and it does not fail to amaze and excite me. There is so much history in these walls and they way that it’s exhibited is brilliant. The Yeoman Warders are fantastic and there is not a piece of knowledge that they don’t know and share. They also bring a good amount of entertainment with their humour. Can’t wait to go back again!!
"June 24, 2020",Lovely Historical Place In The City ,Went with my son and early January this year and we were very impressed with the architecture and the up-keeping of the tower plus the Royal jewellery that was in exhibition at the time. It was lovely to see the grounds are well managed m by the resident workers and was unchanged from when the Tower was occupied. We enjoyed meandering through the buildings and passage way. I’ve been here twice but still love it.
"November 4, 2021",Royal Prisoners ,Make sure you get a tour with a Beefeater they are very knowledgeable and know the history that touring the grounds on your own you would miss.Beautiful grounds so old with the modern city in the background. I would say 2 hours is enough time.A cafe on site.Visit the crown jewels.I would recommend and return!
"January 23, 2023",Full Day Out,"We visited on a sunny, but cold Sunday in January and had an amazing visit.   The Tower was very quiet which meant there were no queues for any of the exhibitions, and we were able to get close in for the Yeoman Warder tour (with TV star AJ!). We managed to easily fill a full 7 hours at the Tower, and didn't manage to get around all the detailed exhibitions - a return visit is already in the planning. "
"October 16, 2020",Full of History ,"We took the opportunity to visit during these troubled times as visitor numbers are so low. We were able to see everything without any queues and could take our time wandering and taking it all in. The Crown Jewels were just spectacular and as there were only a few people, we were able to go around a few times and ask the staff loads of questions.Take the chance now to go and visit, it is totally safe to walk around with little chance of crowds. You will never get the opportunity again once life returns to normality."
"July 23, 2022",Well worth the admission,"Spent the morning here, first time visited for 40 years and was well worth it. So much to see and the crown jewels were awesome, got there early so no queue but by all the zig zag lanes outside the entrance you obviously have to queue for sometime at times. Good views from the higher parts inside as well."
"February 26, 2023",Fabulous day out,Amazing tour by yeoman warder Scott Kelly. Really brought to life the incredible history of the site and gave some insight into the lives of the warders living at the tower. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone interested in English history.
"March 17, 2020",History at its finest,"I visited here in January and was very impressed with the location, the site, the staff. It's such an iconic part of the royal history of the UK that one should not go to London without at least one visit. We focused our visit on the Armoury and the Jewels; both these exhibits require time to review and think about. I will visit again some day and next time I will take the guided tour to get more information depth. One caution; the armoury requires a lot of walking and many stairs."
"August 13, 2021",Incredible,"We didn’t plan on coming here and booked tickets when we had a few hours to kill and it was incredible!! It was amazing to see and learn all about the tower and to hear about some of the stories that have come out of there. Our guide was incredible (didn’t catch his name, sorry!) but he was brilliant and absolutely made our trip. He was so knowledgeable and told us everything with such confidence- this is definitely a trip to take if you’re in London… I only wish we’d had more time to stay and explore more… but we will definitely be back!"
"March 9, 2020",Interestjng,The history and location of this attraction were the most fascinating aspects! You learn about the animals the castle used to house as well as the prisoners and raids the area experienced over time. It’s so cool to walk through this historical landmark while also seeing modern buildings such as the shard and gherkin. Highly recommend!
"August 11, 2021",Fantastic day out go early before the crowds get too busy,Amazing day out. Please do not change a thing here every bit of it was interesting and captivating. Children will love it and the Beefeaters were so interesting as were the rest of the staff. Shame the cafe/coffee shop had to close due to staff shortages but we found a restaurant close by
"February 25, 2022",Great time spent in an historic area.,"When we first walked into The Tower of London we were greeted by a Yeoman who explained if we waited for 5 minutes a tour was about to start. Clive was our Yeoman/Beefeater who took us around. He was incredibly insightful, and his jokes weren’t too bad hahaha. To be honest he made our trip in the Tower of London really enjoyable.I would recommend you do a tour (free)."
"October 31, 2020",Highly recommend ,"Excellent visit, a must see palace packed with incredible history. Very quiet today, 31th October with tourism still almost non-existent in London. No queue to see the royal jewels which were a real highlight. Also enjoyed the line of kings and the kids loved the bloody tower! "
"June 14, 2022",Amazing - take your time and get the audio tour,Amazing - take your time and get the audio tour - listen at your own pace. Avoid the mornings as much quieter in the afternoon. Crown jewels exibition is a must but expect 20-30 min queue.
"June 26, 2022",A great place to visit,"I brought my 15 year old grandson, and we had a great time visiting the Tower! We did both the audio tour and the guided one, and my grandson loved it. When we got back to CA, he was telling his mom some of the stories he had heard. We also liked the restaurant there."
"January 5, 2023",Great all round,The Tower of London is an educational place to take kids and adults alike. We did go during the holidays and it was extremely busy. There was ques of about an hour to see the Crown Jewels. We used the audio tour which was good. The food at the Tower restaurant was quite pricey. If on a budget. Suggest bringing your own food!
"May 28, 2021",Covid 19 does have some benefits after all! Quiet,Turns out covid does have some advantages after all! Great time to visit no hoards of foreign tourists at the moment. I was practically the only person in viewing the Crown jewels and went in several times with zero que....I've allways wanted to go and now is the time to visit those attractions you've allways been put off due to how busy they get....
"December 31, 2021",Amazing place full of rich history,Clearly one of the essentials to go to if you're visiting London. The audio guide was very well done. Everything about the place throughout it's close to 1000 year history was described in great detail. 
"September 9, 2021",Tower of London,A very organized event. Buying tickets online was easy and good value for money. The set-up of the visit was well organized and structured so that you could have as much time as you needed to see everything you wanted to see.
"September 4, 2023",An Absolute Must See!,"I honestly can not express how much I love this historic structure! Seriously, if you haven’t been here, then stop what you’re doing and just go! A fortress, a castle, a prison and a place that houses the crown jewels for the English monarchy. You won’t be disappointed. I’ve had the great fortune of visiting multiple times, throughout my life, and what a true pleasure it’s been!Here’s a few tips: Purchase advance tickets, arrive early and go straight to the Jewel House. You’ll get in straight a way. If you wait you’ll be standing in a que for a while and it will waste a good part of your day.If you have questions ask a Beefeater. They live on the property, have years of faithful military service and love their jobs. Talk to them, ask about their uniforms and snap a picture with them. Plan to visit M-Th. Crowds get rather large on the weekends, so unless you want to be pushed about by tourists, plan accordingly. Look for the Ravens! Be sure to go into the Chapel and light a candle. Remember, you will be walking in the same place where kings, queens and people of influence once stepped! "
"January 20, 2020",The towers history,This was a fantastic site to see.  So much history here and the use of the tower of london changed over time so it was really cool to walk through and see it all..  great for kids as well as adults.  Lots of walking and steps so be prepared.
"July 3, 2022",Brilliant with amazing toilets!,I actually wanted to point out to those visiting that Superbloom is amazing. You have plenty of free viewing areas.  Not sure it's worth paying to go to unless you want a photo with a beefeater! Lovely experience though. However  I really wanted to mention the toilets outside the experience.  Might seem strange but even with a queue it was quick  clean and the lady  inside was friendly and cleaned each toilet quickly before ushering you in. A thoroughly great toilet experience.   Not seen such a pleasant place. Well done to them!
"September 28, 2020",Definitely worth visiting.,"We were lucky to book this visit during the pandemic which meant the queues were minimal and we nearly had the place to ourselves. The Beefeaters were engaging, the battlements offered great views but I have to say the Crown Jewels topped off the whole visit. So much history to take onboard and I certainly learned so much. I cannot recommend this visit enough and look forward to the next time when I take my children."
"June 13, 2022",A must visit if your coming to London,"Fantastic place to visit, full of history, facts and historic items.We had tickets for 10am and would recommend getting there early and heading straight to see the crown jewels before the ques start! Everywhere else got busier as the day went on but the crown jewels seemed to be the only place that a large que formed.After we jumped on the the river boat from Tower Pier, which is just outside the Tower of London, back to Westminster. Much better way to travel back up the river than getting the underground."
"August 30, 2022",Top of List for London,"I can't imagine visiting London for the first time and not visiting the Tower! Plan on a couple of hours to meander around this ancient complex which still houses the residences of the guards (Yeoman Warders). Be sure to take the Warder tour (included) which takes you into the small chapel and includes interesting anecdotes. Tip: Pre-purchase tickets for the earliest entry possible. Once there, go straight to the Crown Jewels. Afterwards go to the Yeoman Warder tour. After that see the rest on your own. BYO snacks and drinks; options are very limited."
"August 25, 2023",Tower Of London Review,"This is a must tourist attraction! It’s great to see all this history packed into one place! Loads of information about the towers, but one thing that you have to see there is the Crown Jewels! You go round on a conveyor belt, and you can look at them from a distance, but can see them clearly. It’s so interesting, and I loved going around to see it all. You need to make sure you book this, as it’s a very popular attraction to visit, and so many people come every day for this attraction, so don’t turn up without a ticket! It’s a great one for people that love history, or are  interested in history. It’s a must if your coming to London for a holiday or just a tourist visit! First time visiting and would consider doing again!"
"December 13, 2022",Really worth a visit,"After being to London so many times and always avoiding the Tower of London (as I thought it is too touristy) I gave it a go this time. How wrong I was to wait for such a long time: it is so interesting, all the history these walls and the Yeoman warders can tell, just great. I was easily spending four hours in there.... Can highly recommend it."
"June 8, 2023",Yeoman Darren is the best!,"We did the 'basic entrance with Beefeater tour' (which I didn't see in the drop-down menu), and it was fantastic! Yeoman Darren (wish I knew his last name) was so entertaining and knowledgeable. We were there with our two kids (11 and 14) and they, too, were riveted by his deep knowledge of British history."
"October 29, 2023",History overload,"This is one of the can't-miss items on a list of things to do in London.  For Americans who have a casual familiarity with British history, there are a lot of aha moments as you recognize various stories and names of monarchs who a not as visible as Henry VIII.Everybody wants to see the Crown jewels, so the line to get in can be over an hour.  Luckily for us, it was not high season so we only waited about  5 minutes in line.  Unfortunately, anything worth looking at had people piled up 3 deep which made getting any appreciable look at something almost impossible.  They have tried to alleviate this problem with the best and most important of the crowns by putting in a moving walkway past them.  They should do this for the entire collection.For history buffs, the buildings have as much fascination as the jewels."
"May 21, 2022",Always wanted to visit here - loved it!,"Important piece of history not to be missed.   It was not very crowded during our visit, which was great because some of the steps in the castle area are narrow and we had to move slowly - my husband has poor sight.   The staff were very helpful and helped us up a couple of short cuts at the White Tower.   I went through the crown jewels twice since there was no line.  Apparently sometimes there is a very long wait, but we were lucky and had no waiting at all.    A must see if you visit London."
"March 14, 2023",Good history lession,An afternoon trip to the tower of london was good to be exposed to some English royal history.The line to the crown jewels was really really long so we had to skip it. Probably best to visit first thing in the morning rather than after lunch
"May 21, 2023",Great historical visit,This is a great place to visit on a first London trip.  The history is amazing and everything is very well presented and maintained.  The audio guide helps give lots of information to enhance your journey through the various areas of the Tower.  Great views and helps with the understanding of what things were like in their time.  Staff was great and very helpful.  
"April 7, 2023",Remarkable,"The Tower of London is an impressive and imposing fortress with remarkable architecture. It is a unique and must-see monument that has been standing for centuries. Its history and architecture make it a must-see for any traveler. The Tower's imposing walls and imposing architecture make it a truly remarkable site. From the White Tower to the Crown Jewels, the Tower of London is a unique and impressive experience."
"April 21, 2023",Great place to visit,"Hadn't been since we were children  (now both 70). Have watched the really interesting TV series and wanted to visit. It was great, definitely do the Yeoman Guards tour - it's free and great fun and informative."
"June 12, 2023",Huge Crowds,"The overwhelming amount of visitors detracts from the experience. We went directly to the Crown Jewels before a line had been formed, and it was certainly the most impressive part. The other stations and buildings not so great. Interesting but average. You spend a lot but expect crowds."
"October 26, 2022",Highlight of our trip,We had a great time with our guide Mark who made history come alive. He was informative and entertaining as he led us around the grounds pointing out the basic outlines of the history. After the tour we went around the battlements and got such a sense what life might have been like so long ago. Truly a worthwhile experience. Then we visited the ravens and stopped for a refreshing bite at the sandwich shop. That was a surprisingly nice moment of calm featuring great food at reasonable prices (for London). So glad we went.
"January 12, 2020",Amazing Historical Site,"The original London settlement this site is quite the history lesson. Be aware, lots of small stairs and very few lifts. Also, this is a Top 5 attraction so get there when the doors open or you won’t get to see the Crown Jewels. "
"October 17, 2022",Tower of London - Pleasurable Visit,I am so glad I visited when I did. The Crown Jewels were simply splendid. Amazing place of history as gruesome as some of it were. The architecture of the buildings are absolutely amazing. The Beefeaters were so knowledgeable and had brilliant ways of talking about the history of the place. Would definitely recommend a visit with children. Great place to spend the day and have a picnic in the ground as well. Plenty of shopping to do around the area.
"June 9, 2023",Terrific Tower,The tower was unlike anything I have seen before! I could spend all day simply walking around. The tour guide was comical but also gave very interesting information as well as providing background about the touchy subjects and events that occurred there. It took us around 3 hours or so and that was without waiting in the humongous line to see the crown jewels. There is definitely stuff I didn't see and would absolutely go back and spend the full day there!
"July 27, 2022",Lots to see and take in...history!,"We got the audio guide of the Tower and found it it be a really good way to move through the site each at our own pace. The Crown Jewels were fine, but it was the stories of all that took place on the site that was the real gem. Imaginging the fortress in days of old as anyone came up the river, it would have been an intimidating site."
"July 7, 2021",Somethings have got to be done in life,I lived in London for a decade and never visited and thing visiting an iconic building like the tower should be done in life - Its massive taking up 2- 4 hours of historical interest. Lots of steps i don't think those with accessibly issues would find it easy. I learnt so much didn't know it was the coin place and practically a zoo at one time. 
"March 17, 2023",Ceremony of the Keys,Very grateful . I'm training to be a blue badge guide and Simon was really helpful during the day and Daz was really entertaining for the ceremony.  Had the best day . All the yeoman warders & staff were exemplary in their professionalism & helpfulness . My Tower exam is tomorrow so I couldn't have had a better preparation
"October 15, 2023",Worth a visit,We went around without a guided tour but the tower of London is easy to navigate. It was really informative and there was plenty to see. Most things were accessible and there was enough information at each stage to make it informative and enjoyable.
"October 25, 2020",Fantastic ,"Booked tickets on the morning of visit very easy. Due to covid it was a lot quieter then I've been before but I felt it was better that way. Had time to visit all the aspects that are normally too busy, tho a couple of the attractions weren't open as not able to adhere to social distancing didn't spoil the day. "
"March 6, 2020",WOW!,"Pre purchased tickets that were at will call, no lines when we visited.Pros:  Get the guide tour head phones as it provides lots of insights. Make sure you circle back to view from both sides of the Crown Jewels."
"December 8, 2022",Worth the £ and time if you have both.,"Excellent history lessons in Central London steps away from Tower Bridge and the turbulent Thames. The Crown Jewels are housed inside. Plan the time of your visit to get a short, free, and fun guided tour by one of the Yeoman Warders. Plan way ahead to possibly get in to watch the daily closing ceremony for a minimal fee. The souvenir booklet is worth the £5 in my opinion. Prepare to spend a few hours, there is a LOT to see. Wear sturdy shoes as there are cobblestones everywhere inside and outside the walls. Food is available inside and outside. There is a water taxi/river cruise to Westminster just steps away also. Tower Hill Underground station is <5 minutes away."
"September 20, 2021",10/10 - a must see in London,Amazing! I’ve wanted to visit for ages and I wasn’t disappointed . There is so much to see and do that you really need at least 4 hours to do this beautiful palace justice. We joined Andy on the yeoman warder tour and it started our visit off perfectly. He was able to whet out appetites to learn more and really explore the site fully. Definitely on the to do list again next time we visit London!
"April 12, 2020",Bigger on the inside,"I had a TARDIS-like experience walking through the Tower of London.  This castle has a long history in London: a royal residence and palace, armoury, treasury, prison, and the home of the Crown Jewels.  Keep an eye out for the ravens, as they have a special place in the Tower, and the ghost of Anne Boleyn is said to haunt the Tower as well.  We spent an afternoon exploring everything here, and every time I turned, there was something else to explore here.  It could easily take an afternoon."
"August 6, 2021",Fabulous visit,"Fantastic place to visit. We went just before restrictions ended and were pleased we did. We booked online, arrival was quick and efficient. We toured round the castle on our own following a one way system and stayed about 4 hours. The history, exhibitions and Crown Jewels are amazing and brought it all to life for us. A great day out"
"March 14, 2022",Warden Kelly aka Beefy409,"Joined a brilliant tour with Warden Kelly (Beefy409) he was so knowledgeable both about his role, the Tower of London and the history. He was really funny too! There was a lot to do which we didn't get to see as it shut at 4pm. We saw the jewels which were beautiful too. Great day out. "
"October 2, 2021",Fantastic experience,"This was a great place to visit, started with a talk from a beefeater and then we could wander around. Even though it was school summer holidays it wasn’t packed and we could easily explore the history here. The Crown Jewels are amazing to see and the the history that comes with the tower"
"July 1, 2021",So much to learn,"This is such a place of historic interest,  it really needs 2-3 hours to see it properly.However as I am in a wheelchair it really was not a great visit for me, you need to bear in mind the age of the place and that it really is not a site suitable for wheelchairs, cobbled streets etc.  Trying to please my husband I went along for the ride but was left sitting outside for long periods on a rather cold and overcast June day."
"May 19, 2022",A must see-seriously,"Very impressive.  You need to get there early because the queue for the Crown Jewels can get long.  Very impressed with all the swords & regalia. Didn't know there are 4 different crowns depending on the event.  We visited the day before the first day of Parliament, so her crown was at Parliament-not on display,"
"October 24, 2023",One of the oldest sites in the City of London ,The Tower has so many historical references. Its view on foot is probably the best as well as doing the river trip. Not only one can appreciate the architecture and how it has endured the test of time but also one can find nearby many other attractions. It is best to go early when crowded or to go at the end of the day. 
"May 21, 2022",Great day,The Tower of London was awesome. Our yeoman guide (Andy I think was his name) was super fun and informative. We learned all about the complicated past of England and the tower itself. Highly recommend taking the yeoman tour and then going to explore on your own after!
"March 14, 2022",A really informative day out,"Great day out at the Tower. I had been before but this was the first time I had brought my Primary school aged child. She loved it.We were there early and saw the opening of the doors. We explored the Medieval rooms and then went on the tour with a Yeoman Warder. The tour was fun and informative. My daughter got a bit bored, but just the same as any young child really.We saw the crown jewels, all very beautiful and informative too. We had a nice lunch at the cafe. Would recommend d a stop off there as the food was decent and well enough priced.All told we had a good time. We didn't get round half the site, but that just means we ha e to return again. "
"August 17, 2023",A-Plus Attraction,"We missed this on our first trip to London in 2015 and I always regretted it. That’s why the Tower was my #1 priority to visit this time. Our first morning on this trip, we were there.The Tower of London is everything I hoped for and more. It overflows with history everywhere you turn. I’m a history educator of over twenty years experience and even I learned a ton. No matter how many books you read, being on-scene  somewhere like this provides invaluable depth and perspective to one’s understanding of historic events.Be sure to wait for one of the guided tours led by a wonderful Yeoman Warder. They meet near the entrance at the most, run every half hour, and are included in your ticket. They take you to various locations within the tower, as well. Our Warder was Nev. Let’s put it this way: Nev rocks. In every possible way there is to rock, Nev rocks. He is a gifted showman and knowledgeable.London Tower was so much fun. I loved every moment of it. There were many cool things to see and enjoy. We even saw the famous ravens, one of whom approached me for a handout. What a magical interaction."
"January 29, 2023",A must see London Treasure,"You must visit the tower when in London.  The history is beyond insane, the Yeoman Warders are an absolute delight, just take it all in.  Had an amazing experience as a VIP to the ceremony of the keys, what an experience.   We will be back in June and again in December. "
"April 21, 2022",Very entertaining warder tour,"We visited in the last week of the Easter holidays. I know that some areas had already gone back to school, which probably helped, as it was much quieter than when we visited in August. We purchased Historical Palaces Membership a few months ago, so had not long visited. However, our warder tour with Beefy409, Scott Kelly, really made the day worthwhile. He was very entertaining and informative. This time we also didn't have to queue at all to see the Crown Jewels, which was great. The Tower is an interesting place to visit, with so much fascinating history. Then you can walk along the riverfront and see lots more of London. Worth a day out. Historical Palaces Membership covers The Tower of London, Hampton Court Palace, Kensington Palace, Banqueting House and Hillsborough Castle I Gardens, so it's worth considering that annual membership if you like to visit those places."
"October 29, 2021",Excellent day out - a part of History,"Tower of London- I would suggest going as early as possible- we went when it opened and noticed it got busier as the day went on.I got and audio tour for my child and it made it so much more interesting - (ended up telling me facts) and engaging. As you don’t have to do it in a set order it was so pleasurable. Every member of staff we interacted , met were polite and had a smile. We spoke three members of staff asking them questions each one of them had fantastic knowledge of the  Tower of London. The cafe on site had a lovely selection of food for all. Highly recommend going to explore the Tower of London. It is definitely a day out ."
"June 16, 2022",A Must-Do in London,"If you are in London, head over to the tower. Your trip is not complete without it. Be sure to plan on spending a whole morning or afternoon here. Depending on how into it you are, you could spend 3-4 hours. We were there over 2 hours and could have stayed longer if we did not have other commitments. I loved the Crown Jewels room. The best part of it all."
"May 31, 2023",Excellent Tower of London Experience,"We visited the Tower of London on 27 April 2023. Our Yeoman Warder guide was A.J., the 2nd female Beefeater in history. She was informative and highly entertaining. If you want to tour the White Tower, just know there are MANY steps! Because we visited shortly before the Coronation, the Crown Jewels had left the building. But wandering through the various open buildings was very enjoyable.  If those walls could talk, what stories they’d tell."
"November 14, 2021",Great Attraction,"There is a lot to see at the ToL.We are very quick around most attractions and we were still there 2 hours.You must go to the Crown Jewels first thing (before 10.30) if you don’t want to queue for long. Otherwise, you’ll lose an hour before you even see anything.A great way to see old and new London."
"May 3, 2023",Majestic and grand piece of history,"With its many towers, fortified walls, and royal palace, the Tower of London is a must-see for any visitor to London. From the iconic White Tower to the Bloody Tower, there are so many stories to explore. The Crown Jewels are on display, and the Yeoman Warders provide an informative and entertaining tour. The Tower of London is also home to a variety of wildlife, including ravens, which are said to protect the Tower. Whether you're a history buff or just looking for an interesting day out, the Tower of London is sure to leave you with lasting memories."
"May 23, 2022",A super trip and visit on a rainy day,One of Londons gems. I was born within a stones throw of the tower but this was the first time I visited. I found the whole experience amazing. Also it was suitable for children. I strongly recommend one of the Beef Eater guided tours. They seem able to blend history with amusement.
"May 18, 2020",A haunted experience,"The Tower of London is full of ghosts and spooky feels.  A lot has happened there through the years and no matter how sensitive or not you are, it's impossible not to feel something.  If you want an extra spooky experience come dressed up in Renaissance clothes.  Everyone will think you're part of the place including the ghosts.  It's very interesting to walk in the steps of all the people who came to have their heads chopped off."
"September 4, 2021",Plenty to see and great views,Two of us went on a bank holiday Monday morning and although busy we somehow managed to avoid the crowds so walked straight into the crown jewels room and had plenty of time to look at the exhibits. My favourite part of the complex was the menagerie exhibition as I had no idea wild animals were kept in royal palaces and we got up close and personal to a raven. Really friendly staff.
"June 15, 2022",Superbloom at The Tower,I visited Superbloom in the Tower moat yesterday. The event is late flowering and we have been offered the opportunity to revisit when more of the flowers are in bloom. Quiet and with lots of volunteers around to provide visitors with additional information.  However copper bowls covering drain covers all dried up and requiring re- filling with water. And Slide into the moat closed due to weather conditions…. Very disappointing!! Overall quite disappointed……
"June 22, 2022",Plenty to keep you busy!,"We were quite rushed for time and only entered near closing so we only saw the Crown Jewels and had the Yeoman's Tour, both of which were very good. Yeoman Warder Tom O'Reilly was our guide and he was well versed in the history of the palace. We were impressed with his knowledge and we wish him well. :) We spent the remainder of our time there wandering the grounds and it was a lovely time. Will return for a longer stay and a good look around. We were bummed that we couldn't get there earlier in the day, but we made up for it in the gift shop!!"
"September 19, 2020","Historic gaol, fortress and Palace.","Always wanted to visit, I did the trip and did so now as without the crowds especially the large tour groups, you could take your time and we enjoyed the extra space and time.we had.The crown Jewels, The Armoury and the Architecture were all just really awesome, as were the knowledgeable Beefeaters who were very welcoming. If you get the tube to Tower Hill make sure you take in the Roman wall as you walk to the Tower. The Romans chose the spot due to its unique dominant location, as did the Towers builders.."
"October 27, 2020",Glad we visited,"I’d not been to the Tower of London for years so I’m glad we finally got around to doing this. Everything was efficient and well organised. Have to admit I was slightly underwhelmed by the Crown Jewels. Although the walkway moves slowly I didn’t feel there was time to fully take them in. Staff we met were all very engaging, informative and friendly."
"September 23, 2022",Crown jewels,Great spot.  Like a small village.  Display of the crown jewels should not be missed.  Follow by a walk across the Tower Bridge and on to the View at the Shard.  There you will get another view of the Tower of London complex from 70 stories.
"June 29, 2022",Super bloom and tower,Did Superbloom and Tower what a great day….three adults and a six year old had the best time….first was Superbloom in the moat then the Tower itself - self guided - did crown Jewell’s. Wonderful value for money can only recommend
"August 25, 2021",A London Must See,Fascinating tour around this historical palace/zoo/prison/museum. Spent approximately 3 hours exploring it and loved it. Spent a bit extra getting the headphones/audio guide which was well worth it.  A London must see!
"April 9, 2023",Awful. Staff a disgrace (Yeoman excluded),"Horrendously organised, all staff bar Yeoman disgraceful. They were rude, highly unprofessional and swearing a lot regardless of who was in earshot. Queue for the jewels so badly organised. For an iconic landmark it’s an embarrassment and a shambles. "
"August 12, 2021",Must do!,"Great day out. We arrived for 9am -queued for a few minutes to get in (ticket check) and walked straight to the Crown jewels as there was no queue at this time and not many people in at the time. Spent the rest of the time exploring the other areas.  Lots to see, lots of history, some great views and photo opportunities. Suitable for young and old."
"June 11, 2022","Awesome Visit, A Must See",Took the 45 guided yeoman tour and it was well worth it. It comes with the price of admission so take advantage. You get to learn about 900 years of history in the short 45 minute time.
"January 25, 2020",Very interesting historical place,"First time visit, not too busy in January, no queues. The beefeater tour is a must, so informative and brings it all to life. The displays in the armoury are magnificent and the Crown Jewels are beautiful. It’s a great area too, we took a 5 minute walk to St Katherine’s Dock where we had a drink in the Dickins Inn. Will definitely revisit the area. "
"April 7, 2022",A day at the tower ,"Overall I really enjoyed checking out the Tower of London. First of all the grounds are visually stunning, especially if you're into older architecture in. Once inside, it's really just a museum detailing the history of the tower. There are several things of interest there my favorite being the crown jewels exhibit. The only thing I would caution about is that there are a lot of stairs so one should be extra careful if you're older, or bringing young children. Well worth checking out. "
"April 8, 2022",Incredible journey through British history,WOW! A fantastic visit where the Beefeaters hooked us from the first moment. From 10-70yrs everyone was hanging off his every word. The Tower is an incredible building but it is the Beefeater guide who brings it to life. MUST DO experience for everyone in London.
"November 7, 2022",Great visit,"Very interesting visit. The Beefeater tour/talk was a highlight- funny yet very informative. We arrived 10am approx. headed to Beefeater first and then straight to Crown Jewels. We were glad we did, as the queue to the Jewels was enormous by the time we finished there. So much to see, we spent 6hours and still rushed parts of it. Several toilets available, and all very clean despite huge numbers using them. Definitely a top attraction.  "
"February 12, 2020",History and beautiful jewels!,So much history to learn in going to the Tower of London. Make sure to do the Yeoman  Warder walking tour-you will learn so much. The crown jewels are stunning to see along with learning their history. Grateful that we toured at a quieter time of year so we had a more leisurely view of everything.  Allow 2-3 hours to see everything. There are cafes which help in taking a break.
"October 5, 2023",Lots to see,"We visited years ago with our children but did not spend that much time there, so we decided to return to see what we missed.  We booked our timed entry ticket on-line.  When we arrived, the queue was long, but it moved quickly.  They were very efficient in getting people through quickly.  A map was provided when you enter so you don’t miss anything.  Some of the lines are longer than others, for example at the Crown Jewels.  Photos are allowed inside most of buildings.  I would plan to arrive early in the day before the huge crowds appear.  There are several restaurants to eat in this area, as well as souvenir shops inside the complex and out."
"June 14, 2022",Has some great sites but may be better with a guided tour,"This is actually several different buildings with different purposes. Audio guide was good but still felt lost at times. Expect a crowd, especially for the Crown Jewels. Loved the collection of medieval armor and weapons"
"February 20, 2023",Fun but fantastic when you use the Yeomen tour that is free,"This was second trip in ten years but last time did not jump onto a free Yoemen tour. What a mistake. We did this time and they are fantastic. They walk you thorugh the area, explain where to spend you time and give you all the history as you changed spots. it makes the place make sense. The jewels are fantastic but if the line is short, jump on it. also recommend going early. as day goes along the crowd gets massive. early is easy. "
"August 30, 2022",Fantastic,We spent almost a whole day at the Tower and were surprised by how much there was to see and do.   We ate at the Tower in the Cafe and food was very nice and reasonably priced.  We would not hesitate to recommend this as a day out to anyone and is completely worth the money.Our only tip - go early!
"December 1, 2021",Brilliant Day Out,We booked the 10 - 12 slot and was one of the first in. We ended up spending 3 and 1/2 hours here. The exhibits were brilliant and the information cards were detailed.We would recommend anyone interested in history making a visit to the Tower. 
"June 2, 2022",Beefeater tour,"We WISH we could have had Scott Kelly do our tour!  He did my tour with other American visitors a month ago and was fabulous. The tour guy this time was terrible. I don’t have his name. Sorry. But he was off focus, joked around the whole time. Gave us 15 minutes about the Tower bridge (hello!  We are NOT touring the Tower bridge). It was a huge waste of time. We stuck with him for 20 minutes then left in frustration.  I get it that their job is probably repetitive and boring but they need to remember that we are often visiting for the first and only time."
"October 17, 2023",Fantastic Yeoman Warder tour of Tower of London. ,"Great tour with Beefeater Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly #yeomanwarderbeefy409! We even got to watch the changing of the King's Guard. Yeoman Warder Kelly was so entertaining, especially for all the kids in our group! "
"January 12, 2020",Awesome,The Tower of London is far better than I or my parents expected. You definitely need to do one of the yeoman warder tours which is included in your ticket. They walk you through the grounds and tell you some great stories. The only negative was how busy it was. Forget about visiting the Crown Jewels - the line was ridiculous.
"November 19, 2023",Amazing history,"Fascinating history and very knowledgeable staff. We really enjoyed learning about the history of this place and hearing stories from the Yeoman Warder on the tour. Also really enjoyed the crown jewels display, and seeing the huge and friendly ravens hanging around in the yard."
"August 4, 2023",Get There EARLY if in summer,"Pro Tip: get the earliest time-entry ticket possible, and go directly to the crown jewels. We walked right in, and had a nice, leisurely stroll through the amazing collection. Some items were missing, but we saw them latter in Buckingham Palace, which had much of the coronation regalia. The collection is mind-boggling, especially considering that Oliver Cromwell destroyed the previous set (an interesting story on its own).Beyond the Crown Jewels, the castle (with multiple towers) has a fantastic and ancient history. We learned a great deal during our visit. The audio tour is quite good. As an aside (far aside), we saw the musical SIX a few days prior, and it was interesting to see the connections. "
"September 9, 2022",Iconic London Castle,My husband and I visited the Tower of London to see the Superbloom in the moat as part of the Queen's Jubilee celebrations - given her recent passing it seems even more poignant now. We've both been in the Tower and grounds a few times and been to the Cermony of the Keys but never in the moat. We really enjoyed seeing a bit more of the Tower of London - an absolute for places to visit.
"October 8, 2021",The Crown Jewels are a Must See!,"Do Not miss the Yeoman Warders guided tour of the Tower.  We were able to arrive early to see the Tower Key Ceremony as they unlocked the gates.  The Head Yeoman Warder and his escort walking to and from the gate.  Ravens, the real guard of the tower were everywhere!  The Crown Jewels of the Kingdom on display were breathtaking!  There were guides present that were able to answer all of our questions about every artifact on display!"
"January 23, 2020",Yeoman Warder tour of the tower,"Fantastic tour of the tower with Yeoman warder Scott Kelly. He was brilliant; informative, enthusiastic and enjoyably gruesome! (Also very impressive projection- excellent speaking voice!) The tours are every half hour and are no extra cost. I really recommend this!"
"December 31, 2022",Incredible amount of history,We were on our way to the Tower Bridge and explored the area around the London Tower before. There is a lot to see around the London Tower and I would give yourself plenty of time. The proximity to the Thames River made it an easy location to get to as well as explore. This attraction has gone through many renovations as leadership of England has changed over time.
"October 23, 2023",Outstanding,Yeoman Warden Wyatt was our guide. Lots of information given with good interaction with the children and adults. It was very entertaining and had good information on all the Towers' history.  We spent several wonderful hours exploring the Tower. The ghost characters for Halloween were excellent and an added bonus we were not expecting . It was such a fantastic day. 
"January 5, 2020",Fun half day trip,Really enjoyed going to the Tower of London. We didn’t have a guide so wandered around by ourselves. Was very easy to navigate and saw everything we wanted to. The Crown Jewels were as amazing as you’d think they’d be. Definitely recommend going if you’re in London for the weekend! 
"January 29, 2023",Tower of London,Great place. Good cafe and so much history to read about.  Go early in the day to avoid peak time crowds.  Norman dynasty fort on the banks of the Thames River.
"October 13, 2023","Awesome place to see, the Yeoman tour is a huge bonus","Get Beefy409 for your Yeoman tour, best guide I've ever had. Lots of interesting rooms with different themes to see. You could stay a lot longer than 3 hours if you wanted to read and see everything."
"July 7, 2022","Worth it, and bigger then expected","I was positively surprised about the visit to the Tower of London. The grounds, number of buildings, and also the exhibits are bigger and more as expected. We spent almost 4 hours there. We did not see the Crown Jewels, as the line was multiple-hours waiting long; our mistake, as when we arrived (early) there was no line, but we decided to visit the White Tower, when we came out, the line had formed, so when you see that the line is short, take it."
"February 7, 2022",So Interesting,My wife and I have visited the Tower many times but it is endlessly fascinating. We have still not seen all there is to see. As it was fairly quiet when we visited we spent a lot of time looking at the Crown Jewels. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Highly recommended.
"November 16, 2022",Great visit!,Visited the Tower of London on a weekend trip to the capital - really enjoyed it - especially the display of the Crown Jewels.  Quite expensive but we did get two for one tickets which made it reasonable.  Definitely worth a visit. 
"June 13, 2021",Highlight of London,"Definitely one of the best places to visit. My partner is a history buff so this place was perfect. We ended up spending a good few hours at the Tower, taking our time and visiting every single area we could. Overall an amazing experience learning about the history and what had been there in the past"
"June 5, 2022",A must see destination when visiting London,"This was a wonderful historical place to tour. The Crown Jewels were incredible, the White Tower was full of history, armamentsand a small, very nice chapel. The Beefeaters are impressive and the ravens are quite large and fun to watch. It’s a must do.  "
"May 17, 2020",Great tour - Great historical facts,I enjoyed my visit at the Tower very much! The tour I attended was very insightful and I enjoyed learning about this interesting site of history. I spent about 2.5 hours here and I think it was worth to visit and the entrance fee. I would probably come back at some point to visit again.
"August 14, 2020",So much history,Booked a timed entry which worked well.  The site has our marked out routes to get around while social distancing.  This is a good time to go as there was plenty of space to look round without any crowds at all.  The Tower is packed with history and has a fantastic atmosphere - you can feel the history coming from all sides.
"September 16, 2020",No crowds,We booked our tickets online and spent 3 hours looking round the tower. For us our trip was all the better for the lack of crowds and we enjoyed the extra space and time we had. It’s a great time to go and support this attraction. 
"January 5, 2020",Thank you YWS Kelly!,Had a fabulous day at the Tower on Saturday January 4 with two children aged 11 and 5. The tour by Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly was brilliant. He kept us engaged and entertained. The kids really enjoyed it too. After seeing the Change of the Guards and the Crown Jewels (5 min queue only!) we attended a Raven talk at 13:30.  Thank you for a great experience!
"August 21, 2023",Lack of customer care,I have 2 disabilities. Hearing and osteoporosis.I approached the Beefeater as he arrived for the 10.30 talk.I asked him he he was going to be our guide as I wanted to inform him of my disabilities.He was obviously offended that I called him a guide and brushed me aside and walked on.Consequently I had trouble hearing all and keeping up when he moved on. He had no Interest if everybody had reached his next point.Later in the day I approached him and told him how disappointed I had been. He admitted he did not like being called a guide.I also asked him about The White Tower lift. He told me it only went down. What did I expect in such an old building.! I later discovered there were over 100 steps up.!I would suggest that The Tower of London give better customer service training to these gentlemen.I only hope that something hit home when I confronted this arrogant man.
"July 7, 2021",Tower of London - fantastic,"Excellent morning spent in the Tower and grounds made so much better because of the wonderful staff. Gareth, in particular gave us so much of his time to explain about the Crown Jewels and their providence. I cannot recommend this enough."
"July 24, 2023",Great day out,Lots to see and do. Ticket great value as everything included.Yeoman of the guard tour a must do! Our guide was informative and very entertaining. Worth queuing to see Crown Jewels and other treasures.  Plenty to see in White Tower (mostly armoury). Info around the place is bite size and informative. I believe there’s an audio tour (which we didn’t do).Cafe good: extensive selection of hot and cold food plus good (homemade?) scones and cakes. Good day out (we were there several hours).
"January 23, 2020",Great day out,"I have visited the Tower on previous occasions as I live locally. Today I went with my family and joined the Yoeman guided tour for the first time. The tour and stories told by Yoeman Scott Kelly were fantastic and brought the Tower to life. There is a lot to see, we spent a good part of the afternoon there and shall be returning very soon. Thank you!"
"August 11, 2022",Grubby toilets,"I needed to use the toilets while visiting the area near the Tower. I was pointed in the direction to go only to find that it was wrong and was then given the correct directions. However when I reached the toilets I found there was a fee of 50p to pay. I paid and thought that the facilities would be clean, new and well maintained. Wrong. they were grubby, and could have done with some mointenance. A rip off."
"September 20, 2021",Overpriced and not that interesting,"A larger area than I expected. We did not have any guided tours available when we went, so meandered around. I personally did not find it interesting. Lots of empty rooms, some info in some rooms, the crown jewels were fascinating.Apparently, if you manage to find a guided tour, its much more immersive and interesting. A pity then, we could not find one.Would I go again? Not at the admission price for the experience we had."
"November 4, 2022",The Tower of London is filled with delightful and grisly information,"We went on a Tower of London tour and I'm so glad we did. Our tour guide was hilarious and well-informed. The stories he told add to the magnificence of the place. Pretty gruesome! The space was larger than I thought, with so many buildings, all with their own stories. And the Crown Jewels are spectacular. My favorite part was the armor worn by  horses. I have horses myself and I can't imagine hucking that heavy metal equipment on their backs. Tower of London is a must see."
"August 29, 2023",Great historical day out,Tower of London was a great day out. We had booked for 11am but wished we had booked earlier..there was so much to see! The tour was great and our guard was very entertaining. Kids (9 and 13) found everything really interesting and really enjoyed themselves. Food is pricey as expected (£17 for 3 slices of cake!). Top tips-would be wear comfy shoes…we did so much walking backwards and forwards and there are lots of steps. - wait till later in the afternoon for Crown Jewels..the queue was pretty much non existent mid afternoon onwards
"October 8, 2021",Magnificent eloquently description from past to present.,"Great history of London from the start, haw it has evolved to become the present. So much to see and learn. Advise to first take a guided narrative tour a must! Go about on your own or narrated headphone tour. Expect to spend around 4hrs average, could be more if you stop and enjoy every little detail. Cheers!"
"August 19, 2022",Incredibly majestic and beautiful,One of the highlights when one travels in London!  It is a must see. A sight with great character and a lot of tourism around.  It is very close to Chad Thames and all the River Thames nearby attractions. Very easy to go on foot from anywhere and it has wonderful places to sit as well as live attractions (specially during the summer time).  Check it out!
"May 10, 2020",Interesting for history buffs! ,"We took note of all the advice to get in early and make straight for the jewels, then we spent some time doing things at our leisure, glad for the advice, as the lines just kept getting longer. Great tour and awesome history. Definitely recommend."
"June 25, 2022",Needed more time but worth the visit still,"I knew I didn't have enough time as I got there a bit later than planned.  Still, I got in to see the Crown Jewels, the Armory in the White Tower (more interesting than usual displays due to the horses part of that exhibit), and enjoyed a Yeoman's Tour.  However, that tour is just on the outside of the buildings so leave enough time to enjoy that and go into the buildings. "
"November 26, 2021",Yeoman Kelly brought the Tower to life!,"My second time visiting and I recommended to our guests that we should take the Beefeater tour- wow, we were not let down. Yeoman Kelly brought the Tower to life and engaged impressively with the audience. Thank you sir for making it so enjoyable for the young child in our group, as well as a second timer. Huzzah!"
"January 15, 2020",One of the best places in London!,"The castle is huge, and has it all, we even caught a guard change that we weren't lucky to see at the Buckingham palace.You can roam the Tower for hours and still not have enough. And also they have these tours available there - just join one. Really A MUST place to visit while in London!"
"September 22, 2023",A must-see but make sure you have enough time,The Tower of London is incredible. So much history behind those walls! Each exhibit did an amazing job explaining everything. Of course the Crown Jewels were beautiful. You can also get some great views of the city! My biggest advice is to set aside enough time to see everything. We arrived 2 hours before closing and it was not enough time. You at least need half a day. We will definitely be returning when we're back in London next year! 
"July 29, 2023",Above my expectations,"The first time I came to London I thought it was more than enough to just see the Tower from afar. This time I actually went in and it was a lot more interesting than I expected. My 7-years-old son decided we had to see everything  on the map. I would have skept some parts, but he insisted. We spent there nearly four hours, including bathroom brakes, lunch and souvenir shopping. If you have an hour or two, it should be enough to see the highlights: the Crown jewels, the White tower and the ravens."
"January 11, 2020",One if most iconic place in London,Fantastic visit! The venue is incredible! It was an immersive experience. It suitable for family and kids. Visitor service assistants are very attentive. The security very professional. We were lucky to attend a performance of two actors! Brilliant!Recommend it!
"February 2, 2020",Wow,The only review I have given 5 stars! You must do the Yeoman tour which is included in the price funny and informative. Loads to see and the history is amazing. Of course you have to see the Crown Jewels. Well worth the ticket price and do allow 3 hours for the whole thing
"March 29, 2022",Plenty of History,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Tower. We decided against a guided tour so we could explore at our own pace. We never realised there was so much history behind the castle walls. Each tower had its own piece of history. Some of it very surprising. The guide book and information throughout were excellent. Never realised the Ravens were so big. Watched changing of the guards and viewed the Crown Jewels. Popped to the cafe to refuel before going over Tower Bridge. Definitely recommend.
"June 19, 2022",Excellent Superbloom,Visited Superbloom. Stunning flowers. Lovely leisurely walk round the moat filled to the brim with colour. Hilarious slide filled with adults which loads of laughter. Good value for a London attraction.
"March 25, 2023",Well worth the time and money,We learned so much and our tour with Yeoman Darren Hardy was the highlight. Informative and funny bringing the often gruesome history to life. So make sure to take the tour which is included in the entrance price. Taking the time to see the Crown Jewels is also a must.
"September 11, 2021",Great history,Came alone on this trip. So glad i went as i nearly didn’t go. Ordered tickets inline beforehand £28.80. Happened to be a lovely day as well as was plenty of places to sit down to rest or chill out for a bit. Listened to the beefeater doing the info tour which was worth doing just for interesting facts etc. Then left to go off exploring. Luckily was not too busy so plenty of time to look at exhibits and read all the info. Plenty of walking done and steps to climb so if a little less able maybe this trip is not for you. Had a great day and i thoroughly enjoyed it.
"July 16, 2022",A Complete Education on British and Royal History in one stop,"The Tower of London is a top place to see in London. 1000 years of history with royal intrigue, the Crown Jewels, architectural evolution and views of the city and Tower Bridge. The Yeoman Warder your is a highlight and a must. We had Spike Abbott, Yeoman Warder #402 as our guide. He was terrific - informative and funny. This is great for guests of all ages."
"August 2, 2023",Take time to listen to the Yeomen of the Guard guided walk,"Our Yeomen of the Guard guided walk was really rewarding. And it was quite a show she put on. Easy five stars!There is really a lot to see at the Tower of London. We had booked an afternoon entrance, and that was far too late to see more that the Crown jewels, the white tower and the church.The day we visited the lie to the crown jewels was around 30 minutes. But had we left the crown jewels for last, then there would have been no queue at all."
"February 15, 2022",Should be on everyones bucket list!,"The place just oozes history as you can propbaly imagine. The tour guides are excellent and keep everyone enthralled. When you make plans to come, expect to be there for the day. There is so much to see and do. There is good food available and the staff are top knotch. Priviliged to be able to see the crown jewels of course! Thoroughly enjoyable trip for all the family!"
"August 26, 2021",A good day out!,"Pre booked tickets & arrived within the allocated time slot. Quick entry & straight onto a free Beefeater tour, which was excellent! Lots to see & do. I would recommend visiting the Crown Jewels early as long queues later. We were there for over 3 1/2 hours & didn’t see it all. Will visit again in a few years time. I expect to see everything in detail is around 5hrs."
"February 6, 2020",Magnificent,Definitely Must visit places in London..Choose the day wisely to brave the crowds..Avoid weekends..This is a Historic Castle reminiscent of the era gone by...It was used as prison as well..Quite a magnificent building this is ... It houses the Crown jewels as well..So much History to learn.. you can see some ravens as well in the gardens.. The tower has witnesses a whole lot of killings and tortures ..
"July 20, 2022",First time in London,Great and interesting experience.  Not expensive to get inside as we easily spent 5 hours in there.  Lots of information in each area for anyone interested in the history.  Cafe food was nice but nothing labelled for anyone with intolerances.  Would be helpful as staff couldnt answer and had to bring out a file to search through what was in the food.    
"March 15, 2020",Fantastic walking through history,"Great day. John our beefeater tour guide was fab and informative. We spent 6 hours seeing everything. Fantastic buildings, history and displays. Film remembering the poppy installation was great. Cafe great. Brilliant to have water fountains on site to full water bottles, very handy! A*"
"March 24, 2022",What an Amazing and Historical Area,"OK, we got to see the crown jewels the day we visited with a very short line. That alone made this visit worth five stars. Getting to view these jewels and finding out how they are still currently used was one of the highlights of our trip. We started with a tour and our guide was not only knowledgeable but funny as well. What an entertaining tour. There is so much history within the Tower of London that I could have spent an entire day just walking the grounds and soaking it all in."
"March 15, 2020",A must see attraction ,"We spent many hours here and quite a lot of time spent in the White Tower with all its armoury.  The Crown Jewels were dazzling and no photography allowed here.  We saw torture implements, graffiti from those locked up in the towers, the ravens and Yeomen.  A great experience and a UNESCO site too."
"January 29, 2020",Fun way to spend the day,Book online for cheaper rates and beat the line. The Tower of London is vast and you could spent the better part of the day here. I enjoyed the crown jewels and the tower of the missing princes. History lovers will be very happy. 
"August 5, 2021",Tower of London tour with the amazing Beefy409,"We had an amazing day with @beefy409 on the Tower of London tour.What an amazing interesting Beefeater.Very Funny, personable and my son was so interested in him. Very informative, interesting and a great tour overall. Would highly recommend on getting Beefy409 as your tour guide.The other Beafeaters we met were all just so friendly. Thank you for making our visit so Fantastic 💜"
"September 2, 2023",Wonderful ,Absolutely amazing day out my kids have loved it since watching it on the tv and were ecstatic that the raven master was the one who did our tour . Would defo recommend doing a tour to find out more info . We spent hours there great value for money 
"March 9, 2022",Always a must when i'm in London,"3rd time visiting and every time I have joined a beefeater tour. They are fabulous, in particular Barney. Educational, professional yet delivers the tour with a great sense of humour and also pride. I also feel really moved after a tour. Crown jewels a must see."
"July 14, 2022",Outstanding Colour,"Super Bloom :-The display is magnificent- even with the dry dry summer we are having.Do take your time, you will need an hour to an hour and a half, do sit too to admire the colour.Do take a camera !!! It is my pastime so did have a ' macro lens ' A great experience, one of the best in London at the moment."
"September 1, 2021",Great last day in london,Great attraction enhanced by the audio tour.We arrived at 1pm and stayed until 5.30 pm as we had a resavation for dinner.When feel we should have had longer and we will go earlier when we go again.Great day out and the perfect way to end our trip.
"December 30, 2022","Awful queues, unable to see the Crown Jewels",We were really disappointed in queues. I knew it woud be busy but the ticket was misinforming. We queued up for the Beefeater tour which wasn't part of the Crown Jewel tour. My mom came specifically for this reason. It was freezing cold and the queue snaked around for over an hour.
"July 11, 2022","If you want to see crown jewels, get early tickets","We went on a Saturday, which is never my favorite day at popular sites. Luckily had 9:00 am tickets and we went to Crown Jewels first. When we left at 11:00, line was, I would estimate, 3-4 hours long. Special exhibit due to Platinum Jubilee, and it is amazing, but plan accordingly."
"March 14, 2020",Tower of London - Crown Jewels...cool - the Yeoman Warder Tour... AWESOME!,"Took family to see the Tower Of London. Went for the Crown Jewels but enjoyed touring the grounds and learning about the history even more. The entire family enjoyed the Yeoman Warder Tour the most though. If you visit the Tower, you absolutely have to do the Yeoman tour - you won't regret it! Also ate on the grounds at the restaurant and food was good and reasonably priced."
"August 2, 2020",Amazing visit,"Booked tickets and slots online.The Tower has just this week opened ,due to covid 19.It is great to get out and about,and the weather was on our side.The staff at the tower are very helpful,loads of hand sanitizer available around tower.Everything was available to see with social distancing.Only part closed was the Fuselier Museum.And main cafe.A great visit you won’t be disappointed,and it’s as safe as can be."
"August 19, 2021",Oozing with British History and charm,"Weirdly never visited before despite living in London in my twenties and countless tourist visits. However had been most places and this was top of my list for this visit with family. Crown Jewels inspiring to see, white tower with its history and collection plus history of Duke of Wellington, military deployments and torture. "
"February 17, 2023",Fascinating trip,Visited the Tower on a Saturday afternoon. Expected queues to be longer but got in very quickly and collected our audio guides. Audio guide was excellent: Very informative and interesting and clearly spoken. We particularly liked the Crown Jewels and the White Tower. 
"May 24, 2022",Yeoman guided tour is a must at this amazing historical place!,"The Yeoman guided was a great way to start our Tower of London visit, Yeoman 409 was funny yet full of interesting facts! We were caught in a downpour and thank goodness for Yeoman's tour, it made us forget about the miserable weather. There is so much to see there and we spend nearly whole day there. No doubt we'll be back! Thank you to all who work to take care of this amazing place."
"September 2, 2021",Iconic & brilliant,Quick one & a good tip. Go early. Head straight to the Crown Jewels. ( You will avoid the large group with the Beef Eater). Then rejoin another tour from the start. Much easier to see the Crown Jewels.
"February 16, 2020",A great day out. ,Went here on a rainy Sunday morning.   It was mostly good as fewer tourist early.   I very much enjoyed the visit.    Would have been better if the tours were on but I guess you can’t have everything.    It’s 50 years since I last went.  Great place to bring kids.     
"August 23, 2022",How can you not visit?,"This is one of the most important sites in London, and we were glad for the experience.  We were fortunate to have the Chris, the Yeoman Warder who serves as the ravenmaster, as our guide. He was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and also funny.   We're so glad we made time for this fantastic historical experience."
"February 3, 2020",A superb piece of London History,We thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit to The Tower of London. It is the most atmospheric and fascinating Historical place in London. History unfolds around every corner. There are numerous special places within the Tower including the Crown Jewels and the White Tower. It remains a 'must visit' place and everyone should visit. We had the privilege of a conversation with the Raven Master Yeoman Warder. Absolutely fascinating.
"July 15, 2020",Great place to visit,Its nice to have the Tower of London open again for the public. Its nice to be able to speak to the Yeomans once again. All the staff were great when asking questions about certain displays. It has a huge amount of history. The White Tower survived the Blitz of London of 1940.Will visit again before the Summer Holidays happen next month. Thank you.
"January 19, 2022",Amazing day out,"The most amazing, atmospheric place to visit. The buildings are stunning and visiting in January meant there were no queues and you feel like you have the place to yourself! So much history, bought to life in all its bloodthirsty glory by Beefy409 on the guided tour but delivered with a twinkly smile and such a genuine passion for the place and his job. Thank you Beefy, we hope to see you and the ravens soon."
"June 17, 2021",The One and Only,Elizabeth I waltzed her way around here. Menageries were kept here. Men and women were beheaded here. Ghosts have become comfortable here. The walls seeth with history. The great big crows still live here and they are a hoot. You have to see it.
"February 29, 2020",A very informative tour,This was one of the highlights to our trip to London.  Got some bucket list picks with the Tower Bridge in the background.  I recommend getting the $5 audio tour.  I learned alot from it.  The Crown Jewels are amazing.  The White Tower chapel was probably my favorite room. 
"January 27, 2020",Winter is a great time,"So much history in one location. No lines, no waiting. We were able to buy tickets and walk right in. Large complex lots to see. Take the 45 guided tour, well worth it!"
"June 9, 2022",A must in london,"If you have time for one thing in London, this should be it. You will be overwhelmed by the history and the whole tower experience. I cannot sell this enough.  I was lucky to see the ceremony of the keys. 700 years of pomp ceremony. English are good at pomp."
"September 2, 2021",Brilliant ,Great day out and great attraction.  Well planned out - try and opt for audio guide if you can and go at your own pace. Head for the Crown Jewels as soon as possible. We managed to get to see them with no queue however by the time we got out it was well busy. 
"February 3, 2020",Much better than we expected,There was so much to do here. It really is a DAY out. It was like being in a village. Lots of different buildings and stories to experience. We only left because we had other stuff to do but we’re here for 4 hours and still hadn’t seen it all at this point. One section was closed but this didn’t effect our visit. The food was also very nice and fairly priced which we were not expecting. The only issue I could see for other people would be disabled or pushchair access to some areas with lots of narrow stairs. Which is understandable with it being such an old set of buildings. Well worth a visit.
"July 10, 2020",A great attraction but much of it is closed.,This is a world class tourist attraction but due to Coronavirus many interesting parts of it are closed. You can still see the Crown Jewels and 2 floors of the White Tower. If you haven't been before or are not a member I wouldn't come at the moment.
"August 31, 2021",Fabulous,"Haven't been here for over 50 years but still enthralling and fascinating.  Visited the White Tower, the Bloody Tower, the battlements, the Armoury and even got to see the guards at the Crown Jewels exhibition change.  Plenty of people there, but easy to move around and see things."
"February 22, 2020",Avoid in school holidays,Stupidly booked this attraction and hadn’t realised schools were on holiday.  Gave up after about an hour attraction heaving With young children and pushchairs.  Queues too long at Crown Jewels guess we’ll try again outside of the school holidays.  Entirely our fault and will go back again at a quieter time.
"April 7, 2023",Fascinating historical site!,"I didn't expect it to be so large or have so many different things to see.  You could easily spend over half a day walking around and seeing everything.  The history of the buildings is varied and interesting and if you have good weather, it's a very pleasant place to wander around the grounds."
"January 1, 2020",Amazing ,Every aspect of this attraction is amazing.   The staff/“Beefeaters” were great and really enhanced the visit.  The grounds were extremely well kept and each exhibit was perfectly interpreted.  We were there on a very popular day and they handled the crowds flawlessly.  This is a must see when in London.   
"October 31, 2021",Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts is a star,Used our london passes and went straight in. We arrived just as the yeoman tour was about to start. Our guide was Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts. He was excellent and very informative and also very funny. I live this place 
"October 30, 2022",The invisible tour,"Rchd the site at 3 pm. No meeting point specified on the app. Called on the number provided , no help. Asked the staff of Tower of London for Historic Royal Palace whereabouts ; no clue. No sign of any guide. Eventually we went inside, bought an audio guide and did the tour on our own. The worst experience ever. Requested a refund. No response yet."
"July 19, 2020",The post-Covid visit ,"I have been here many times before,  but decided to come back yesterday for a post-lockdown day out. You can still get into the White Tower to see the suits of armour (Henry 8th’s codpiece is a thing to behold), and the Crown Jewels, but a lot of internal buildings are still closed off due to the virus. They aren’t doing beefeater tours either, but they are stationed about the courtyard to answer questions and take photos. My highlight was the ravens - they were quite vocal, which was a pleasant surprise! "
"March 27, 2022",Great afternoon out,"We had a great afternoon at The Tower, allow at least 4 hours to fully enjoy everything to see. We had a very amusing, entertaining and informative tour with one of the Beefeaters. Was great to see the Crown Jewels and learn the history of this incredible piece of our heritage. Well worth a visit, if a little pricey!"
"April 24, 2023",Beefeater Tour is so cool,Beefeater Mark Anderson was amazing! He was so funny and engaging with the group even though it was quite large. We had an absolute blast and the crown jewels were shiny and very cool. The ravens are awesome don’t miss them. Definitely do the tour with the beefeaters.
"July 7, 2022",Rude staff and an underwhelming not so ‘Super’ bloom,"I’d pre-booked Super Bloom tickets. Overall it was good. I’d didn’t exceed my expectations and underwhelmed me a little. I was expecting a full meadow that you could walk through… in actuality there were planted areas with gravel paths guiding you around the moat. It was pretty. The slide into the meadow was ok… but not the immersive slides (plural) into the meadow I was expecting. It was ok. A couple of the staff checking tickets and bags were extremely rude, unnecessarily so."
"December 2, 2022",Must see!,You must schedule time to see this attraction. We were in the first group of the day entering and it was great.  We didn't have to wait in any lines.  Crown Jewels are worth seeing alone.  Lots of great history here.
"January 13, 2023",CROWN OF JEWELS,I read reviews of long queues to get into this exhibit but luckily I walked right in. Just a cautionary tale that you cannot take pictures inside. However you can take pictures everywhere else in the Tower of London.  Make sure to visit the royal ravens and learn about their history. 
"January 9, 2023",Crown Jewels,"I purchased our tickets on Trip Advisor the evening prior.  The earliest time slot was 10:00.  Upon entering we bypassed the audio & went straight to the Crown Jewels. Thankfully I read in a review to go straight to the jewels, we only waited 10 minutes.  An hour later the line was unbelievable long (see photo) .  I forgot people mentioned to take a Beefeater tour.  I’m not quite sure what that entails or where to purchase, but if we visit again I will research into that tour."
"February 6, 2020",Simply Amazing,"We visited here on January 24, 2020.  There is so much history here, so plan to be here for awhile.  We were able to get in quite easily using the London Pass with no wait time.  We arrived just in time for a free guided tour by a Yeoman Warder.  He was informative and quite humerous.  Be advised that the history of the tower is quite gruesome and they don't shy away from it.  There also is quite a bit of walking.  The highlight is seeing the Crown Jewels.  The are amazing and spectacular.  Words don't do them justice. This place sould be a must stop for anyone touring London.  Just an amazing site."
"November 15, 2021",Worth the visit,"Whilst in London we decided to visit the Tower of London. It was a good experience to see the tower, the museums and the Crown Jewels. So much to see.     We also decided to have a guided tour with a knowledgeable and entertaining guide. He made everyone laugh, whilst telling us the history of the tower. Definitely worth taking up the tour."
"August 18, 2021",British History at its finest. ,"We were here on the 9th August 2021.Not crowded, probably a Covid19 aftermath.....Beefeaters are fantastic, knowledge is unsurpassed and very friendly.  The ravens are inquisitive and massive hahaThe whole site is spotless2 cafes from what I could see, although £6 for a hot dog? Visit the church of St Peter Ad Vincula.....its where Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard are buried.The tower is a fascinating place, packed with historic events , ghostly tales and of course the Crown Jewels. "
"August 1, 2023",Bringing History to Life.,"Pre-booked our tickets and decided to visit early on in the day to avoid the queues. The whole place is enchanting and steeped in history. You can have a Beefeater tour, and their knowledge is second to none. You do have to be fairly fit to be able to explore many parts of the site, and there are a lot of steps, but it was a truly fascinating place to explore, with the crown jewels being centre stage. There are a couple of places to regenerate the batteries, and a coffee cost £3.20. Well worth a visit and there a few hands on activities for children too. "
"May 19, 2022",Don’t miss this!,"Apparently the Tower lost its 1st place tourist destination to the London Eye some time ago. Having done both, this is the one I would go back to see again. The Eye is great but the Tower is in a league of its own. It’s easy to navigate if you don’t have mobility issues and is just chock full of amazing artifacts and history."
"July 12, 2022",What a walk through History,"The tower of London is always a must see! You can easily spend the day here and you wouldn't regret it. Between the crown jewels and the tower itself as well as the rest of the castle, there is so much.What a wonderful place. "
"February 20, 2020","Tower of London, must see",Visited this attraction after getting off the river cruise.  Pretty cool as I love old architecture and this place does not disappoint.  Highly recommend seeing the Tower when in London. It is old and cool and full of history.  Great for all ages..
"January 15, 2020",Fascinating history,"Our family (with young adult daughters) thoroughly enjoyed the Beefeater's (Yeoman Warder) tour as well as viewing the crown jewels. Though we are not history buffs, the Yeoman Warder made it very interesting. What I also found interesting was learning about the qualifications to become a Yeoman Warder. Seeing the crown jewels exhibit and the history behind them was also great. We had no problems with lines. Also, watching the changing of the guard for the crown jewels was like seeing it at Buckingham Palace. Completely worth the online price to see!"
"September 2, 2021",Tower and Jewels,"Worth the money. Went with family and brought our own sandwiches to save money. Saw the crown jewels, the White tower which was fantastic and the Bloody Tower. Took us about 2.5-3 hrs so didn't finish it all. Bought one audio guide and one book. Definitely worth it. Plenty of facilities, and gift shops"
"September 12, 2021",An attraction on our London attraction itinerary,Just fantastic. Booked on line to ensure entrance. Probably the best day we had of the whole week. Spotlessly clean everywhere. Well organised entry and then left to do your own thing. Beefeaters on hand for questions and also to provide information.
"June 3, 2022",Excellent,Iconic location and for good reason.  One minute to get in and just a few minutes to wait for the Crown Jewels.  There is loads to see and great photo opportunities of Tower Bridge and the City.It's a definite must see
"April 9, 2021",History is Living and Breathing Here!,"A tourist destination for sure. But, if you at all enjoy or have read or studied English history. It is a MUST. I was honestly in awe that I was even walking the same ground that so many had walked before and all of the historical events that changed the shape of history. Take your time, really walk around. Talk to some of the ravens (beware, they love Pringles....lol). I would suggest you read before you go a recent book released by the Ravenmaster at the Tower. "
"July 16, 2022",So much history...,"We spent almost five hours going through the Tower of London. There is so much history in one place. We were lucky enough to get there first thing in the morning, and got in to see the crown jewels right away. When we came out there was a daunting line that went on and on and on. I was grateful NOT to be in it. Be sure to get the audio tour, as it is worth it to hear the stories behind the history of what you are seeing."
"March 12, 2021",Lovely.,I was bored in my flat one day and decided to visit the tower in which I hadn't been since it as a child. The rain was really coming down but the beauty of this place made it one of my best days ever. All the nostalgia of seeing it when I was young came back and for me this is the best place on the city.
"March 16, 2023",Beefeater tour gives great insights,"Incredible to think the White Tower has been standing for over 1,000 years. We had an early tour with a Beefeater. Our Yeoman was Shady Lane with just the right amount of humour and lots of knowledge.An important aspect of London history, not to be missed."
"October 13, 2023",Good Historical Site,"It will rate a 5-Star if you know some English history before you visit.  Otherwise, you will not be able to piece it all together.  Still, it has some interesting exhibits and supplies some info, with headphones.You should be able to navigate stairs.  Lots of them."
"March 30, 2022",Fantastic Yeomans tour,Our second visit but this time we joined a Yeomans tour and we were so glad we did. Really informative and great fun. Crown Jewels are amazing. Lots of things to see. We took our own food and sat on a bench in the sunshine. A fantastic day out. We used bogof voucher on daysout website with our train ticket.
"January 4, 2020",Must visit,"This is a must see. Crown Jewels, robes and other Royal artifacts are incredible.  The  prison and other historic events that even if you aren’t a history buff, is fascinating. US has nothing like this  This represents London as much as Buckingham palace does"
"January 18, 2020",Tower of London,We saw the Tower of London on the left when we walked across the Tower Bridge. We saw the Tower where the Crown Jewels are kept but didn’t go in as it was closed. There was a ice rink at the other end of Tower but we walked towards Tower Hill Underground to get back. 
"July 25, 2023",Tower of London Jewel of the crown, So I have tried 4 times in my lifetime to visit and in particularly the Jewels.  Managed it today after the typical British queue system  . Liked the travelator  in crown room  could be done elsewhere too.  Ideally needs more seating along queue  routes .    Need more than one day to see it all.    History at its best. Sad to see Ravens are caged . But can understand why. 
"February 18, 2020",Awesome!,The Tower of London was an awesome trip. Our tour guide was funny and made the area actually fun. It was nice to see the Crown Jewels as well. It was a very long line but it went quickly. The jewels were beautiful. 
"July 8, 2022",Superblooms on display,"Pre booked free tickets to Superblooms , the flower display in the ditch/moat. Not fully in bloom due to late season but still excellent. Have been to the Tower before but you see and learn something new each time. A slice of history and would recommend it to anyone. Can spend a day here."
"August 15, 2021","Educational, Scenic & Entertaining - So Pleased We Made the Effort","Such a lovely day out! Educational and entertaining, we really enjoyed our visit. So much trouble had been taken to ensure it was Covid-friendly.  Beautiful surrounds - very atmospheric and grand. So much space, so even when it was busy we felt we had lots of room. Friendly and attentive staff. Kicking myself it took a pandemic to visit. Funny how we don't support UK tourism until going abroad is not an option. My husband and I got as much out of it as our children did. Learnt a few new historical facts! Would highly recommend "
"July 19, 2020", See the jewels,This is a cool and obviously very historically significant structure. The Highlight for me was seeing the crown jewels because they are so dang impressive. Also enjoy the great view of Tower Bridge on your way out. Make sure to have someone with you who can explain all the historical significance.
"January 15, 2020",Yeoman Warden Lawrence is the best,"We had such an interesting day out at the Tower of London. Such a significant historical place not to be missed. Highlight was an informative and highly entertaining tour by Yeoman Warden Lawrence, he was fantastic, a brilliant start to the day. We spent a little over 3 hours there and had lunch at the Cafe."
"September 25, 2020",Brillant,"Fantastic day out, plenty of space no crowds. Time to visit without tourist no queues, no rushing. Crown Jewels brilliant. The tower need us to visit so book tickets and enjoy."
"July 4, 2022",Historical masterpiece,"Well worth a visit, we didn't have a guide but instead made our own way round.  Takes about 2 hours to do the whole thing.  Intrigued by the history, amazed at the 400 year old etchings in the rooms, mesmerised by the changing of the guard, fascinated by the craftsmanship of the crown jewels.  Had a great chat about the war medals with an attendant.  Overall not disappointed and highly recommended.  Immaculately kept."
"May 19, 2022",Excellent day at the Tower.,Excellent day at the Tower. Well worth every Penny. I was Scott Kelly tour. Very amusing fellow.  He kept the kids entertained as well. His descriptions of the bloody side of the tower were awesome. Very gruesome!   Great seeing the Ravens. The Gurkha s in action.  Very dedicated to their job. Patrolling and guarding g the Crown Jewels.
"March 22, 2023",Gave it a 'Very Good' Because I Felt Giving an Iconic Place Less Than That!,"Expensive.  I think it was like 29 pounds to walk around and see the jewels.  Obviously lots of history there.  But a long queue for the jewels.  Strangely for me and my wife the ravens were pretty interesting!  Glad we went, but still an expensive afternoon there."
"January 12, 2020",Best part of my euro trip!,Love love love the Tower of London! We spent over 5 hours here and could have spent more time. I did except it to be more torture-focused but turns out it wasn't haha. The Crown Jewels were amazing - do this first!!! We walked straight in and had plenty of time up close to the jewels. By noon the line was huge!
"October 28, 2021",Good,"Nice, very busy during half term there was quite a que.There is some confusion over the towers and would be good to hire out an audio for the tour which didn't come to mind when we booked. Need more than just a couple hours here as it could take most of your day seeing the history behind Tower of London. Great day out. "
"July 1, 2022",Full of history,"We enjoyed our time here, it was well worth a visit, albeit quite expensive. Great to see traditional British sights such as the Beefeaters and ravens. The Crown Jewels are well worth seeing."
"August 5, 2022",wonderful family day,great way to spend the day. the tour by the guards was fantastic and entertained my children ( ages 10 nd 16). excellent mix of fun and education. start with the crown jewels before the line gets long. the armory was pretty amazing
"November 27, 2022",Amazing Piece of History,If these walls could talk it would be amazing to hear all the things that happened here. We opted to wander around on our own rather than take a tour with one of the beefeaters. There are many amazing things to see. Be sure to check out the Crown Jewels as they are exceptional.
"August 25, 2023",Educational history,The Tower of London is a must see attraction. The Crown Jewels being the main attraction.  All crowns etc have an explanation as to what they entail however it’s quite dark & they can be hard to read. The legends of the Ravens is interesting. Extremely interesting history of what took place in the early days. Worth reading up on before doing the tour as it helps. The outside gardens looked very unkempt not what we were expecting. Tickets are expensive & so are the items in the shop.
"January 2, 2020",Don't miss it.,You could easily spend an entire day here exploring.  Get there early and take a tour with the Yoemen Warder.  They are funny and full of information.  The tours are free with your ticket and leave every half an hour just inside the gate.  
"January 25, 2020",AMAZING!! ,"Of course I rate this a 5, because it was a dream come true to visit! The history was fascinating and you get to walk the whole area. Be sure to wear tennis shoes because you do nothing but walk. There are areas to sit, but they are limited. Come prepared to get your steps in!"
"May 4, 2022",An amazing day,"Visited the Tower on Saturday and had an amazing time!Full of history and a great place to go for all the family.Great value for money, spent the whole day there.Worth waiting to have a free tour with the Beefeaters.We had Shady,  a few cheesey jokes here and there, but knew his stuff and made the day all that more enjoyable.I could attach any photos as there is an error."
"April 23, 2022",Great place to visit a must,Our visit was easy and just as expected. Book online to save time and make sure you take in one of the Yeoman tours and watch out for Scot Kelly #409 he is a hoot. Great tours.
"January 30, 2023",Tour of London tower,"Guide was awesome.  Chatty, detailed explanations & very funny. Our Guide, a Beefeater,  was Andy.. or Shady!  He really made our tour worth every step.Fabulous tour, incite, and humor really was great."
"June 4, 2022","Historical, interesting","Really interesting, full of history place. Might not be push chair/wheel chair friendly if you want to see displays in the towers. Beefeaters everywhere and keen to pose for pictures. Allow good 3 hours to see everything and read all the displays . Kids started to be a bit bored, but ice creams half they though the visit kept them going"
"January 19, 2020",Tower of London,"Excellent trip to tower of London yeoman guide was excellent, great fun but also gave great information.When paying for ticket lady was rude asking us were we from northern Ireland or the other one. We are indeed from the Republic of Ireland ."
"March 10, 2020",Great place to go for history ,"Great visit enjoyed the history, fantastic especially for foreign visitors to learn about London. Cafes and shops on site, toilets clearly signed. Can get great photos in front of the guards outside where the Crown Jewels are. "
"June 14, 2022",London History galore,"If you want to see some history of London, then this is a great place to visit. There are a lot of towers to visit which will provide some background on various historical figures and events. Arguably, the crown jewels are the best part so definitely make a stop there. It can get quite crowded so prepare for a wait to see them. But it is worth it."
"July 15, 2022",Great Historic Experience,Visited the Tower of London later in the day and the crowds weren’t bad. Caught the last Yeoman Warden Tour with Andy and it was fantastic.  Andy schools you on what his position is all about and the history of the historic Tower.  All with a great sense of humor despite the dark history.  Very informative and entertaining.  Highly recommend the experience.  The facility has a lot going on so plan to spend some time.
"February 25, 2020",One of most famous and interesting place in London,One of the most famous place of interest in London! I was dreaming about visiting it and I wasn’t disappointed!! It takes about 2-3 to walk around there. I would suggest coming early so you won’t stay in line to see the crown jewels. The night view of the Tower of London is fascinating!
"September 4, 2020",Definitely worth visiting,Great day out at the Tower. Quite a lot open and no queues for anything so we were able to relax and take our time. The exhibitions in the buildings were good and the Yeoman Warders and other staff were happy to answer any questions. The Crown Jewels are really spectacular and we had them almost to ourselves. Social distancing etc well managed without feeling intrusive. Definitely recommended to visit.
"June 23, 2023",Oozing history,My suggestion is go early to avoid the lines. It's fun and informative specially chatting to people working there. Beefeater AJ was a delight and Warden Luis was just so knowledgeable. They really make the history come alive.
"June 7, 2022",A Must Stop for a First Timer,The Tower of London is a must stop for a first time visitor. I recommend getting there on opening and starting at the back of the complex and working you way up. Pro tip to escape the crowd going from the front to the back. The crown jewels are a sight to be held. We intended on spending an hour or so here but ended up spending 3! We really enjoyed it and highly recommend.
"August 15, 2021",Something for everyone.,We had a great day out.  Spent 2+ hours wandering. We did visit the Crown Jewels first thing and I’mGlad we did as he queue for those grew large.  Reasonable priced cafe on site with great coffee and cakes.  Lots to see and it engaged our 9 year old and our 67 year old too. Enjoyed our trip.  Thanks
"March 14, 2020",Wonderful history!,Loved the beefeater tour.  Watched changing of guard in the tower which was interesting.  Lots of armor.  Could walk around the top of the tower which offered lovely views of the inside and outside.  
"September 30, 2023",Super cool!,"We loved our visit at the Tower of London! We didn’t do audio guides (bc of other reviews) , nor did we do a tour. There are plenty of information placards to read on your own… and whenever I had a question, the staff was very knowledgeable and happy to answer. The crown jewels line looks worse than it is, it moved very fast (thank god they don’t allow photos or else it would be MUCH slower) . We had a great tune and learned so much ! Highly recommend if you haven’t done it "
"December 22, 2021",First time in a long while !!!,"Visited the Tower for the first time in many years. Spent over 3 hours wandering around and getting to see all the exhibits.Joined a tour by one of the Yeoman, ""Basher"", ex Royal Navy. A great guide, knew his stuff, with lots of funny comments and stories."
"September 1, 2021",Really interesting. A good few hours killed,"Very interesting and a lot to see.Really busy though as school holidays - a long queue to see the Crown Jewels. Kids loved spotting the ravens that roam around the tower. Had lunch in the cafe which was very good, but again extremely busy with quite a long wait.Worth a visit, but probably best for those with slightly older kids"
"August 9, 2022",The place to visit in London,"Bought the tickets online and went to the Tower as it was opening up. That made for a pleasant visit, being among the first to see the Crown Jewels and other parts of the place.  The place got very crowded quickly, yet there was plenty a space. There was a nice wild flower field around parts of the walls (they charge a separate ticket to walk through it). However one can get some nice pictures you exit the Tower tube station."
"July 24, 2020",Morning visit,Visited tower of london once it reopened (before most of thrn other attractions).It was very quiet and so very easy to wander around at our leisure the beefeaters were all very friendly and loved to chat.Would have given 5* but the one way only system meant certain parts aren't open currently to the public.
"October 17, 2022",Excellent and steeped in history.,We loved the Tower of London. Tip- purchase tickets online to save a trip through the ticket queue. Getting in after that was quick. The place is just steeped in history. Beautiful! Our favorite part was the raven who befriended us because I accidentally dropped a cookie bit. Haha
"February 16, 2020",Great Experience,Really enjoyed this visit it was amazing and I learnt so much. Cannot believe you can get so close to the crown jewels.  Interactive session at the end if the white tower section was the kids highlight.
"September 2, 2021",Amazing place ,Absolutely fantastic place. Full day required if possible to really appreciate and take everything in. Much larger than I expected. Incredible to be walking on the ground that so much history has taken place. A truly special place that needs to not be hurried. 
"June 8, 2022",Fabulous experience,Booked ahead. Close to tube station so easy to get there. Well sign posted throughout the experience. Friendly courteous and obliging staff. Good facilities eg. Toilets / eating/ drinking.. free map of site available. Allow several hours to fully appreciate the experience. Not to be missed.
"April 14, 2023",Get 9 am tickets,"This is a must-do for London. We luckily had 9 am tickets and arrived to the entrance around 8:30. There was already a line, but we were one of the first people to see the jewels. By the time we left, the line to see the jewels would have taken over an hour. Lots of interesting history in the towers, and you meet the Beefeaters! Absolutely recommend."
"February 6, 2023",MUST SEE,"The history alone is a reason to go. Go early, the lines get longespecially for the crown jewels! A lot of walking and narrow stairs and cobblestones. Plan on a good couple of hours here. "
"March 6, 2020",Fantastic,The tower of London is fascinating and a fantastic way to spend a few hours. The history of the place is awesome. The Crown jewels are amazing and are a must see for any sightseer. Some of the history is sad and some is good. Well worth a look.
"February 6, 2020",Great craic and a really good tour,Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly was amazing. Brilliant sense of humour and a very knowledgeable tour guide. He knew how to interact with us and made the tour a very enjoyable experience. Oh and the Irish name helps too 😏
"October 11, 2023",Fantastic historical site!,"This has been on my bucket list for years. What a great experience! The only thing that was hard was following the audio guide with where we were on the tour. Honestly, I’m sure it was user error. ;)We learned so much and a lot we had never known! Highly recommend!"
"May 3, 2022",Fantastic,"Get there early, it gets busy.  Reserve in advance.  When you enter the grounds look for the Beefeater.  He or she, will give you some interesting, entertaining information. Don't skip this part, it made the rest of the tour (on your own) make a lot more sense. "
"December 4, 2021",Beefeater Dave!,"We had the pleasure of going around with Beefeater Dave.  The man is full of knowledge and so dedicated to his service.  There is an incredible amount of history in this one location and when you need to rest your feet, there are some incredible pubs across the way decorated for the holidays.  We went to Traitor's Gate and talked about how great Beefeater Dave was over a pint.  Cheers!"
"May 23, 2022",Beautiful place,"So much to see, could have spent many more hours here. Beautiful place with so much history. A little pricey for a family to visit, but worth the money. Cafe prices were very reasonable. Just be warned LOTS of steps throughout."
"June 27, 2021",An amazing day out,"Wow what an amazing place, Covid safe, masks are worn inside. To walk where previous kings and queens have walked was amazing the place is dripping with history. The exhibit in the white tower of the horses was amazing as was everything else. Going to see the Crown Jewels was the highlight of the visit and I found it a emotional experience, seeing those beautiful jewels and learning about them was amazing. I would say that this is definitely an all day visit and there’s a lot of walking and stairs. But if you like history or the royals then this is the place for you,"
"February 12, 2023",exceeded expectations!,"thought for sure it was going to be a regretted, tourist trap 101 experience and was pleasantly surprised.  even without the benefit of a guided tour (which a friend who lives in london says are excellent) , learned a great deal about the history and many uses of the tower.  very well laid out with informative panels and artifacts throughout.  "
"April 21, 2022",Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly,"Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly (@beefy409 - yes, that’s his FB profile) is amazing.  Admittedly, this was my third tour of Tower, but the first ever with my daughter.  Mr. Kelly made it special and memorable.  Enthusiastic, knowledgeable and downright funny.  He’s an amazing representative of The Tower of London, as well as Her Majesty’s service.  If you can arrange your visit when he’s your lead “Beefeater,” I encourage you to do so."
"May 31, 2022",Finally here!,A must for all. Full of history and super interesting. Go early and head straight to the crown jewels before the line gets too long! You can easily spend all day here but give yourself at least 3 hours !
"August 24, 2020",Wow!,"This is the first time we had visited the Tower of London and it is exceptional.  The crown jewels were like nothing we had ever seem, so very beautiful.  Lovely staff and lovely gardens and the route through the grounds makes sure that you capture everything that there is to see."
"January 14, 2020",Great View from Tower of London,The Tower of London is surrounded by beautiful historical architectures and it also offers a great view of London. Just being around the tower makes you feel part of history and you feel like you royalty.  I would definitely recommend making this part of your tour when visiting London.
"January 23, 2022",Ceremony of the Keys - an experience we will always remember!,"Ceremony of the Keys - what a wonderful experience. Scott Kelly was our tour guide and he did a fabulous job. He was informative, funny, and very entertaining. Thank you for allowing us to be part of this long standing tradition - it was an experience we will remember for years."
"January 3, 2020",CROWN JEWELS,Tower of London was one of the places everyone in our group wanted to see.The tower did not disappoint. The crown jewels are amazing. There is so much history there. The only negative was the guides outside that seemed to rather talk among themselves then answer a child’s question.
"March 1, 2020",Fab as always,"Love visiting here, so well organised and cultural. I felt not many jewels on display, I'm sure I've seen more on previous visit. Restaurant good. Nice choices. Very expensive admission, overpriced. It's a full day out. "
"October 27, 2021",Great morning exploring history,"Legendary place. Had a fun few hours exploring. Even though it was half term, they are at about a third normal for fall, sad for them, but it meant by arriving at 9am we didn’t have to queue for a thing. Hope it picks up again when the world starts to get out more."
"August 7, 2023",Full of amazing history ,Very busy place in summer but so worth it. I do wish we had paid the money to be part of a tour. You do need min a couple of hours to see around. Full of such amazing history and the Crown Jewels are a site. 
"February 18, 2023",Took the grndchildren at holiday time,"Fantastic place to spend a few hours , also taking ina cruise along the Thames form Westminster and back. Fairly crowded and long queues for some things.Best , if not with children to go in term time. Or persuade the teacher to let them go in term time asa superb educational day !"
"March 11, 2023",Very interesting,"Fascinating. Only wished I could have stayed longer than the 2 hours I had allowed.  I used the audio tour, but personally found it better without the headphones, as there is enough information everywhere and I felt I could soak up the atmosphere better."
"July 7, 2022",Beautiful,"The Tower of London was fantastic. You marvel at the history that happened here and the overall historical significance. The grounds were terrific, with many buildings and exhibits to explore. Make sure you arrive early and head to the Crown Jewels first, a must, as lines get extremely long. Make sure you chat with the friendly Beefeaters and/or hit one of their tours up."
"September 24, 2022",Excellent visit,The Tower is a very interesting place to visit. There is such a lot to see. Go early and get straight in to see the Crown Jewels which had just been returned after Her late Majesty's   funeral when we visited. Amazing!! Really good cafe as well. Allow at least three hours to see most of the place
"March 11, 2020",Birthday visit ,"The Tower Of London is always a pleasure to visit, and we always find something new that we've never seen before. It's quite a trek in some places, especially the White Tower which has over 200 steps, so if you have problems in that department it's going to be quite a struggle. Other than that it's a perfect place to discover England's troubled past monarchy, with help along the way from the trusty beefeaters. Well recommended. "
"October 30, 2022",A beautiful piece of history,"Loved visiting the Tower.  Truly excellent, should have done it years ago.  We entered on a 10 am slot and left just after 1.  Not long enough!  You need five hours minimum really to see everything.Worth a visit."
"March 28, 2023",Interesting,We went into The Tower of London not having a lot of knowledge. It was a huge place. I wish we would’ve had more time to spend there. I feel that we didn’t get to see everything. It has a fascinating history.  If we come back to London I’d like to go back and spend more time there.
"August 20, 2020",Brilliant  !! ....really worth a visit ,"Getting to the end of the long Summer holidays with kids trying to think of something different to do. This really was a great  day out for us all.The staff were delightful , very helpful and. informative . Seeing the crown Jewels was definitely the high light of the day. It wasn't  busy so we went round a few times to look  at it all again."
"December 31, 2022",Long queues,"Came here on the weekend of the queens jubilee for a walk around. The area was packed, the tower looked impressive. The grass verges round the outside could’ve done with a tidy up, didn’t go inside due to queues"
"January 8, 2020",Tower of London,"Lots to see on this great visit. We were lucky that there weren't big crowds, didn't have to queue for anything. The Crown Jewels were amazing. Simple things like the Ravens were great to see, and the place where Anne Boleyn was executed. Highly recommended."
"April 2, 2022","So much to see, great place to visit.","We can thoroughly  recommend a visit to the Tower of London. It was  very interesting and especially the guided tour was very entertaining and funny.  We experienced all staff as very friendly and eager to help, To see the Crown Jewels was for me the highlight of the day. It was mind-blowing. But so much more to see , we took hours to take it all in. 5 stars well deserved."
"May 9, 2022",Suits of Armor were impressive,"Glad we toured here.  You see stories and movies about knight's and castles and suits of armor and jousting, but here's the proof that they aren't just stories.  It really happened!  This is where writers/producers/designers get inspired for movies, TV, etc.  Large display of weaponry, very impressive."
"August 13, 2021",Great Tower of London,A brilliant day out with history round every corner and so much to see and take in.  Views of tower bridge are fantastic and it’s just got to be one of the visits you do when in London . We got there at one and left at about 5 - with some cheesy chips to help us home!
"July 23, 2021",Wonderful,"Lived in London most of my life and ashamed to say first time I’ve visited. Had a guided tour by AJ, most informative and amusing. Not really busy so had the chance to see everything and no queues. Loved every minute of it"
"January 23, 2020",Fantastic yeoman beefeater tour with Scott Kelly,We took the after lunch tour and it was fantastic. Informative and entertaining. Totally the best thing we did in London this trip. Cannot recommend more. Scott was outstanding. So glad we did the tour with him. Do not miss. Well done!!!
"September 1, 2020",Not what I expected,"Only took about an hour to get round, Not really much to see even if everything was open which it wasn’t.Queues for white tower and Crown Jewels were never ending.Best bit was walking along with a raven as he didn’t seem at all bothered by humans."
"January 26, 2020",A London Must-See,"Plan to spend at least a half day.  Highlights include the Crown Jewels and the armor display in the White Tower.  The chapel is also interesting as are the various displays on incarceration and torture in the tower. Make time to do a tour with a beefeater.  They are very informative and humorous. Beware, pavement is not always smooth and the armor tour has a lot of stairs. "
"May 10, 2023",Really worth a visit - free carer ticket,"My boyfriend and I visited here as part of our trip to London and it was so educational. The guards did a tour about the background of the tower, and how it came about. There are museums in the tower, as well as The Crown Jewels, which is the only place where you are not allowed to take pictures. Everything is beautifully set out. "
"August 19, 2022",Must Return,"The Tower of London has history all around it, literally. While enjoying a walk along the riverside, you can also enjoy stopping at the many plaques that line The Tower. You get to learn a lot of history and fun facts of select areas of The Tower. Unfortunately when we arrived, it was just before closing, so we were unable to access The Tower. There are a ton of food vendors along the riverside to sit, enjoy something to eat, and overlook the massive impact The Tower has."
"July 18, 2021",Could be better.,"We visited today and had an okay time exploring this historically amazing place. We did feel more could be done to bring the tower to life, lots of huge rooms that are almost empty. This place has so much history, yet what’s on show and portrayed barely scratches the surface.The staff weren’t particularly helpful, the team on the gate weren’t friendly and the guy serving ice creams by the white tower was a miserable so and so. He made it clear he hated his job.Would I visit again, probably not."
"November 20, 2023",I could have spent all day here!,"So much to see, allow plenty of time.   We were very lucky and didn’t have to queue for long at any point.  The cafe has plenty of seating and is reasonably priced.  We had so much fun walking around, joining a tour is a must (even if only for a small part of your day, lots of information delivered in a captivating way."
"August 4, 2021",Very interesting,Really enjoyed our time here. My 7 year old loved walking up all the little staircases and across the bridges. Lovely grounds. We were a bit pressed for time so skipped the Crown Jewels as the queue was quite long. Will return though.
"August 12, 2021",Amazing day out,What can we say? We loved it.  The kids loved it. We spent 5 hours here and still didn’t see it all.  We’ll just have to come back!  So much history and so many stories and legends.  And of course the Crown Jewels to top it all off. Amazing.
"July 14, 2023",Absolutely Awesome!,"We went to the Tower of London with a group of teenagers, had a great time.  We ate at the cafe, excellent food as well.  The highlight was the Ceremony of the Keys, fantastic experience one we will never forget!"
"November 18, 2022",Awesome,This is an amazing place. With all the history involved.  Queens being beheaded.  The Crown Jewels. And it’s in great shape.  The inner white tower is so so old.  When you think of the changes in the world since it was built it’s really amazing.
"April 9, 2023",Average experience with very long queue for the Crown Juwels,"Nice location, but very long queue for the Crown Juwels. Typical medieval castle, not much to see here. If you come from a country with long history and rich culture (many castles and cultural sites) a little underwhelming."
"June 16, 2022",Super Bloom-at the Tower,"We visited the super bloom flower attraction in the moat at the Tower of London today.Have to say we were very under whelmed indeed.It lacked the wow factor, along with missed opportunities.Height was needed and this could have been achieved with the use of trees, scented flowers would have been nice.  The inclusion of eco environmental sculptures   More dense planting and less expensive.  It took us precisely 15 minutes to walk around."
"December 2, 2022",Must See in London,"We took an all day Golden Tour that included the Tower.  There is so much history there: the Crown Jewels, the armory, where they chopped of Anne Boleyn's head, etc. There are the ravens, the Beef Eater guards.  It is well worth the trip to see.  Be sure to allow enough time to be able to see it all."
"July 5, 2022",Loved the Superbloom display,"Visited to see Superbloom in the moat. Stunning display of wild flowers. Hope they will keep this going as its much nicer than viewing bare grass. Also went inside to see the Crown Jewels ( bit of a wait, but worth doing) and walked the wall. Lots of interesting items on display in the various towers."
"May 30, 2022",Brilliant Beefeaters,"The Crown Jewels were amazing, well worth seeing as they are works of art.The Beefeaters were friendly, approachable, and extremely helpful - they went out of their way to make your experience memorable. A perfect example of how really good customer service should be delivered."
"November 1, 2021",Amazing day out,We've visited the Tower of London a couple of times before and always have a great day. There is so much to see and the information is very well put together. A great day for adults and children alike
"May 16, 2023",The one MUST do in London.,"We only had one day in London, so we decided to hit this site. We were very impressed with the grounds, the castle, the tower, Crown Jewels, armoury, chapel, and interesting guides on site. Well worth the time and cost of the tickets."
"July 12, 2022",Stunning castle and experience,"This is the London tour. Steeped in history and so much to see and do. The Crown Jewels are stunning. The Yeoman’s are fantastic and their tour is a must. Lots of fun and interesting facts.  Special thanks to Simon who made my mother-in-laws day, weekend, year! Simon, take a bow and thank you."
"February 23, 2023",Great time at the Tower!,"Would highly recommend visiting! The staff is friendly, energetic  and willing to answer any questions. Be sure to see the Crown Jewels~definitely worth the long wait! The line does move quickly and there is so much to take in around you."
"February 11, 2020",Very funny Beefeater tourguide!,"My family and I went to the Tower of London and our tourguide was Shady. Now I am currently struggeling at school with History because my teacher makes the lessons so boring, but then I went to the Tower of London and experienced a great tour thanks to Shady. I enjoyed it a lot because it was so much fun to listen to. I can still remeber everything he said. I wish all teachers at school would be like Shady because it would actually be fun to learn then. Thank you again for the wonderful tour. I definetly recommened visiting the Tower of London!"
"May 7, 2020",Tower of London with kids,It was great to see the ravens and the crown jewels.  There was a long queue to get in to see the jewels but no more than I would expect.  A nice variety of things to do on the grounds.  Fair range of food and drink but it's typical London sightseeing prices.
"March 3, 2023",Historic and Inspirig,"So much history- but take the Beafeater Tour to see sights. Crown Jewels, Ravens, and even the moat. Nad then just wander along the River bank and view Towewr Bridge"
"October 27, 2023",Go As Early As Possible To Avoid The Lines,We arrived early to the Tower Of London after reading other people's reviews on trip advisor and we are so glad we did. We arrived right when it opened and there were no lines. We went straight to the Crown Jewels and walked right in. The display is fantastic. We then had a wonderful tour of the grounds by the entertaining beefeaters. It was a great tour that entertains people of all ages  and was one of the highlights of our trip to London.
"January 2, 2020",How to see some of the best parts of the Tower without spending a penny,Sadly the Tower of London was closed when we visited on New Years Day. But I was surprised and gladdened by ho much of the thousand year old castle could beset from the outside.There are clearly written interpretation boards around the periphery of the the Tower of London - the one at the Traitors Gate was my highlight.And you might even be able to grab a cheeky selfie with one of the iconic beefeaters.
"January 6, 2020",Excelkebt- arrive early beat the masses,Excellent value. Arrived at 8.30 for our 9 entry and were able to see opening ceremony. Also very quiet to see crown jewels. Fascinating seeing graffiti left behind by prisoners. Friendly staff 
"May 18, 2023",Great fun,Tower of London was great! We enjoyed Opening ceremony and key ceremony.Our guide was interesting and knowledgeable.so much history here.AmaxZing still standing after a 1000 plus years.
"May 14, 2022",Fabulous place to visit,"It’s fabulous, beautiful and clean and lovely food available and gift shops are excellent. The history of the place is incredible, so some research before you go to get the most out of your visit. There’s a lot to see so 3-4 hours at least . The Crown Jewels are my favourite part . The anointing spoon , wow . Best place in London to visit as suitable for everyone."
"October 5, 2023",Great day out,Spent a good 5 hours walking around and still could of stayed longer. Made sure we did the guided tour. Our guide was both funny and informative. Much bigger than it looks from the riverside. 
"February 7, 2020",Must see historic place,Love this site. The Crown Jewels were very interesting. Make sure to look for the ravens too. The Beefeaters were very nice about you taking their pictures. Leave at least 2hr at the least to look around.
"March 28, 2020",Tower of London tour,"Had the absolute pleasure yesterday (11th March) to join the tour lead by Beey409. What a star! Brilliantly funny, informative and exceptional people skills. He made our day at the tower.  Thank you for a marvellous experience."
"March 12, 2023",Loose yourself in History,Spent five hours enjoying the Awesome History of this incredible castle. Wonderful experience. The only downside was that the Beefeaters were not carrying out their usual tours due to Covid restrictions. Do have the Audio Tour as this gives you so much information. great day out.
"June 28, 2021",Great time had by all,Got there at 10am and went straight to the Crown Jewels as advised and there was no queue. Went another couple of hours wandering around the sight. Very informative. Spoke to a guide who was very knowledgeable. Great morning out. Even the teens enjoyed it.
"August 13, 2021",Second visit,"Our daughter’s a true historian so was desperate to return to this place. Loads to see on a hot sunny day, with a welcome AC break inside the buildings. Not a lot to occupy younger visitors (unless they’re great readers) but otherwise very enjoyable."
"July 14, 2022",Don't lose your head,"Spent a whole afternoon exploring the Tower and all it's nooks and crannies, a great experience.Got to see the range of crown jewels and learn about the history of the items, many in use since the 1600's!Loved the way the crown jewels exhibition operates using a slowly moving level travellator......... meaning everyone gets to see the artifacts without having to push and shove :-)Check out the Railways 2 for 1 admission offerAn excellent visit topped off with a stroll across Tower Bridge."
"May 20, 2022",All round crowed pleaser,The guided tour by a beef eater is a must do. Just had a tour with warden Scott Kelly. Great for kids but not too focused at kids that it's annoying for other tourists. So informative and interesting. A must do expierence in London. Definitely the highlight  of my tripThanks for a great visit.
"February 15, 2020",A full day of living in by gone days,"Firstly before you look at anything join one of the guided tours. Informative, humorous and scary at times it’s something every visitor has to do. The Beefeaters who lead the tours are all exceptional, very knowledgable and really friendly - but don’t mess with them!!!Lots of things to do - I think you need at least half a day, if not more, to visit it all. The best part is obviously the Crown Jewels themselves but that’s simply one part. There are lots of steps though- not too sure how well an elderly or less abled person may cope. If you can manage steps though do visit. Another wonderful attraction right in the heart of London"
"August 29, 2022",Definitely recommend,"Myself and my family thoroughly enjoyed this experience. Very clean surroundings and facilities, Lots of detailed information and things to look at. It was a nice look into the history of London and a few new discoveries as well. Gift shops and cafe available too."
"September 18, 2022",A must see!,We enjoyed our tour of the Tower of London! Definitely go early and head straight to the crown jewels before the lines get long. The Yeoman's tour was fantastic! They clearly love their jobs and we learned a lot of facts about the history of the Tower. A highlight of our trip!
"February 6, 2023",Amazing experience,Absolutely amazing. I was worried that this would feel like a tourist trap but it isn’t. It was a very enriching experience that made history feel not so distant. I wish we had done a tour with Beefy409. We walked past his tour group and he did an amazing job.
"April 6, 2022",Not to Be Missed,Amazing history spread out through many buildings here at Tower of London. The history is also well told if you do their free tour. This is not my first visit to London but first time going into Tower if London. Worth every pound. It’s big so there is many things to see. It is very well preserved.
"December 30, 2022",Fantastic Place,We had a fantastic day here. A must visitor attraction. Staff and service great. Lots to see. I was amazed at all the history and the displays were good. We left feeling that we had learnt a great deal. 
"May 3, 2023",Great day out with the family,"Great family trip, filled with  lots of history and astonishing buildings. Had some good entertainment for adults as well as children and learned a lot about British History. Much more entertaining for my children than through  a book!"
"April 13, 2023",Fantastic!,"Fantastic 3 hours spent exploring, worth the price. So much to see, visitor sightseeing areas all very well laid out and very little waiting times for Crown jewels exhibits. Well worth a visit!"
"February 16, 2020",Good day ,Good day out. We were there nearly 3 hours. Plenty to look at. It was raining when we went. Staff friendly. Though I am English and go to London a lot this is the first time we had been. Would be great for kids
"October 23, 2022",Great. Take your own food!,Great. Lots to see and do. Really well done. Staff great. Only crap bit was the cafe. Food was rubbish and really expensive.  Suggest take your own sarnies and you will have a great day here.
"October 25, 2023",Terrific Tower of London,"The Tower of London was very exciting, especially during the Halloween season when ghosts were walking around the tower. I especially liked the Crown Jewels because it was amazing and fascinating. I adored the Yeoman Water tour! I would recommend going and I hope to be going again soon!!!"
"July 4, 2021",Amazing. Don’t miss it.,Incredible. Walking around it’s hard to take in all of the history. Everyone around the site was helpful and really friendly. We were given some great little history lessons for lots of the guides in the rooms. Really excellent staff and wonderful place
"May 14, 2023",Got lost in the maze of corridors and stairs.,"I had a great time visiting the Tower of London last week. It was amazing to see the Crown Jewels, the Yeoman Warders and the ravens. I also learned a lot about the history of the Tower, from its origins as a Norman fortress to its role as a palace, prison and mint. The Tower is a must-see attraction for anyone who loves history and culture."
"November 15, 2023",Lovely day out before getting the train,We had a lovely day out here on our last day in London visiting our son.The beefeater tour was amazing. He was very funny and knowledgeable and was an excellent tour guide. It was wonderful to see the crown jewels up close.
"August 26, 2021",Crown Jewels Amazing,Highlight for us was the Crown Jewels.  Amazing how close you can get.  Bit disappointed with the dungeons etc - was expecting a bit more if you have been to Warwick Castle I think you will be disappointed.  Cafe expensive e.g. £2.30 for a can but it is London. 45 min tour free which was ok but expected more of a tour than being talked at.  Kids free with their blue Peter badges.
"April 25, 2022",Do Not Miss!,This is a must do attraction whist visiting London.  It will take you a half day to tour completely.  Difficult if you have a wheelchair and some parts are not wheelchair accessible but still worth seeing.  Beefeater tour/commentary are fun and informative and free!  Crown jewels are not to be missed.  So much history within these walls!
"July 28, 2021",Family visit,"Excellent day well laid out, we were able to visit all attractions without queuing. Lots of interesting places to visit. We saw some filing taking place. Staff were friendly and helpful and we look forward to visiting again"
"September 25, 2023",Visit whilst on London,Visited whilst on a trip to London. Only had 2 hours but managed to see most things. Very interesting historically. Beefeaters need training in customer service ( which is ultimately what their job is) bit impatient  and miserable. Most looks a bit overgrown and scruffy 
"November 5, 2023",Not the best today,"Plus points: Historic site and lots of different things to see including the Crown Jewels. Downside: staff rude and unfriendly (not the Beefeaters), not very mobility friendly (expected to not be flat/escalators etc, but asking for the easiest route should have not led to such sarcasm), gluten free cookie so hard we couldn't eat it and was just told ""I'll tell the chef"" . £4.95 wasted. Only there 1.5 hour as went early so no queues which great but meant a quick visit. "
"October 7, 2023",Excellent experience,Yeoman tour a must. So informative and entertaining. The history is mind boggling. The buildings and artifacts immaculately maintained. Great to see how other people lived and learn about our heritage. Wonderful to see the Crown Jewels.
"March 6, 2016",A good day out.,"If you love history, this is a must.  It is worth it just to see the Crown Jewels and the Ceremony of the Keys is interesting.The Beefeaters are excellent and seem happy in their work. A very informative visit – you won’t be disappointed!"
"May 4, 2006",Fascinating...and CROWDED,"The Tower of London was great--but be prepared for HUGE crowds.  I did not heed the advice of other reviewers to arrive early, a big mistake.  It was very challenging to try to soak in the history of the place with so many people snapping photos and bumping into us.  I was also a bit disappointed in the Beefeater tour, which I found short on history, long on stock jokes.  Now that I sound like a big grump, I'll add that the experience of seeing the grafitti carved by prisoners and standing before the final resting place of so many Tudor era victims more than made up for the annoyance of the crowds and predictable jokes. The armor displays were surprisingly good, and once we made it through a packed entrance room and stairway, it was actually possible to see the exhibits.   The line for the crowned jewels looked short at the end of the day, but beware--it snakes around endlessly inside the building (kind of like Space Mountain).  By the time you get to the jewels, you are on a conveyer belt so you can't really examine something that interests you.  The best  part of the Tower for me was attending the Ceremony of the Keys at night.  Write for tickets well in advance (address is on the Tower of London website), and you will be admitted after closing time to watch the ceremony with about 100 other people.   It's eerie to be in the Tower after dark.  We lagged behind the group as we left and at last I had a little time and space to soak it in.  I suspect that morning visitors might have the same opportunity.  The Tower is beautifully lit at night, so even if you don't have tickets to the ceremony, it would be worth it to walk the outer perimeter at night.If you go with children, ask for one of the children's guide books.  It will send you around the grounds and keep the kids interested.When we went, I was able to use a London 2for1 coupon with my single day travelpass to get one free entrance--an amazing deal!.  Check on the London 2 for 1 website to see if a similar deal is in effect when you travel (you need to print out the coupon before you go)"
"May 17, 2020",Historic Fortress of the Tower of London,We joined a tour group led by a guide who injected many humorous remarks along with his version of historical facts. Educational and fun.
"November 10, 2019",Very very nice,There is a lot to see at this location included the Crown jewels. The lines can be really long but they are worth. It is a really interesting place you must visit if you are in London.
"November 4, 2005",Great Experience,"We spent about 3.5 hours at the Tower of London, well worth the price of admission.  If you have am AMA membership there is a 50% discount on the second ticket.  We did not take the Beefeater tour, but took the self guiding audio tour instead.  Really enjoyed it, the audio tour was very informative and it allowed us to go at our own pace.  Followed the advise of all the guide books and headed straight to the crown jewels.  They really are incredible, went around the circuit several times to get the full effect.  The White tower is not included on the audio tour, but is well worth checking out.  Take the time to explore this building.  There are lots and lots of stairs at the tower and it is all built out of stone including the sidewalks so wear good solid shoes.  No heals, and nothing fancy, wear shoes with good support and some cushioning.This is a great sight for all travellers and all ages.  Highly recommend it."
"September 21, 2004",Tower of London Key Ceremony - well worth the trouble,"The Ceremony of the Keys is the short ceremonial lock-up of the Tower, which is done every night with a limited attendance- you get to get into the Tower at night, without crowds, witness centuries-old pomp, with enjoyable commentary by one of the ""warders."" You need to send to the Tower for tickets - directions are on the Tower's website; the visit is well worth the little bit of trouble."
"April 9, 2019","Good, but pricey ","This was an amazing experience for our little ones, learning about the history of kings and queens. The crown jewel sections were really fascinating! However it was massively overpriced for what it was. It took us 2 hours to go round it all. It’s open gardens and buildings for you to stroll around as you please. It’s easier if you go in order but it’s not necessary. Had to pay extra for the audio guide or any books or leaflets associated with it. Was £30 a ticket! Booking online makes it cheaper"
"June 25, 2018",Expedia - Bit of a con,I bought the tickets through Expedia only to find the Crown Jewels and the Beefeater Tour are free.  There was no speedy entrance as we all went in through the same entrance.So just go and buy them on the gate.However - the place and tour and jewels are really great to see and was great to walk about and see the place at our own leisure.  
"October 10, 2007",Fantastic! Be prepared and you'll love it!,"I absolutely love the Tower of London, something about all the history and so much happening between those walls really intrigues me, and obviously a lot of other people too if its popularity is anything to go by. To get maximum enjoyment out of your day there I suggest you read up on the history of it and the people it involves before you go, it makes the stories you're told on the tour all the more fascinating and greatly increases your enjoyment of the entire Tower. I bought a book from the gift shop and carried it through with me and read about the individual buildings as I was standing there, the impact is bigger than if you buy it later and read it when you've left.The Tower has so much to see and is usually pretty packed, so you'll need a full day at least. Try and get in the queue for the Crown Jewels early so you don't have to wait as long and don't miss the guided tours, they're brilliant.Over all it's one of Londons highlights and it's one attraction you definitely don't want to miss!"
"July 23, 2019",A Must See in London,"Allow at least 3 to 4 hours to properly explore the various towers and learn more about the rich history behind them. It can get very busy, especially on weekends, so try to get a ticket online. I booked through Klook and got an eticket which had to be redeemed at the group tours window before entering. Bear in mind that there is a queue at this window (although it's shorter than the ticket queues), and you will have to wait in another queue for the security check afterwards, before entering the tower. It's advisable to join a Beefeater tour, which is free and starts from 10am every half an hour. The Beefeaters are all very knowledgeable and have the craziest stories to share. Rather wait for the later tours as the first one is always packed. It's also a good idea to view the Crown Jewels exhibition first, as the queue gets ridiculously long during the day, and you really only get about a 20 second viewing period on a platform that moves past the jewels on display."
"June 13, 2019",Tower of London,"Amazing fortress full of history. Prepare to spend at least half a day, so much to see. Very well organized, there were lots of tourists but everything went smoothly. If you are interested in history of Britain, this is a place for you. "
"September 28, 2004",Tower of London - wear athletic shoes!,"Every traveller knows to wear comfortable shoes, but, when visiting the Tower of London, wear athletic shoes, or the thickest, most cushioned pair of shoes you own.  The pavement of the Tower ranges from asphalt to cobblestone, all unforgiving and rife with potential ankle-twisters.  In addition, be prepared to do a substantial amount of going up and down steps.  I wore a pair of rubber-soled SAS loafers, normally very comfortable, but after two hours, I was in serious discomfort.  By the time we left, I was sure I would be crippled!  So, wear those thick-soled sneakers with pride and comfort and enjoy every step."
"January 21, 2006",A must see,"If you have one day in London you must see the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey.The Tower is stepped in history.  A fragment of Roman ruins, the White Tower, the various captives - Elizabeth I, Saints Moore and Fisher, Walter Raliegh, the Princes in the Tower, Kings and nobles of Wales, Scotland and France, the chopping block, the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula and St John the Evangelist (this is in the White Tower), the Crown Jewels, the Fusiliers Museum, the Guards (check out the Ceremony of the Keys), theRavens and of course the Yeomen of the Guards and their entertaining tours.  I rather liked the mock up of how they think the Medieval Palace would be during the reign of Edward I.  Easily a 1/2 day if not the whole day."
"March 20, 2019",Extremely Disappointed,"I had scheduled this tour 3 months in advance. 2 months before our actual tour, we had a change in our schedule that prevented us from taking this your, so I tried to reschedule to a different day. I know it says no refunds, no schedule changes, but I would have thought that given 2 months to make a change, they would accommodate this request to lets us RESCHEDULE to a different day. Instead they refused !!! Only saying there would be no refund, no ability to even communicate with anyone but the person on the phone. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WILL NEVER BOOK with VIATOR AGAIN."
"January 18, 2019",Amazing to see ,"Really interesting, great couple hrs and a good history lesson. The jewels are amazing. It was a walk from start tonfi ishikawa but nothing heavy"
"May 8, 2008",Take a tour with the beefeaters!,"The Tower of London was a fun stop on our trip. Take a free, guided tour with one of the Beefeaters - the crowds are pretty big in the afternoon, so try to go in the morning on if you can. Our guide was hilarious and informative."
"October 7, 2006",Worth the visit,"A definite must see if visiting London to enhance the London feel.  The history here is what makes it great - even if it is a little pricey:  15 GBP/adult, 12 GBP/senior.  We took the advice of other posters and got there at the opening.  Since we purchased our ticket in advance from the Big Bus Tour people (located at all Big Bus Tour stops), we did not have to buy it at the Tower (although at the time we arrived - Friday at 9am, there were no line ups anyway).  You can buy tickets in advance at your hotel concierge, or any info booth at the train stations as well as at the Tower.   You can also buy them online if you prefer.  Anyway, once you get there, go immediately to the Jewels and get that out of the way.  There were only 2 other people in the room (and 2 Tower employees) when we got there and therefore we made a couple of trips around the room (there is an automated walkway that takes you along the jewels, but when you get off, you can just walk back to the beginning and do it again.  We had to ask where the Koh-i-noor diamond was - as we were looking at the top of the crown, not on the front of it - so keep your eyes open or ask questions.  After we did the Jewel Tower, we went back to the entrance gate and picked up a Warder tour - a definite must do as you'll get much more out of the visit.  They have quite a dry sense of humor and oh - don't forget to ask them first if you can have your picture taken with them, as I saw one poor woman harrassed by the Warder when she just stood beside him to have her picture taken!!!  They are very agreeable if you ask.  After the Warder tour, you may want to walk through the White Tower and have your own look around.  To get the most out of your day, you may want to also include a trip up to Tower Bridge 5.5 GBP/adjust, 4.5 GBP/senior (a must do for the views alone), and you could stop for a pub lunch or a pint at the Dicken's Inn on St. Katherine's Docks.  Oh - be prepared to pay anywhere from 2 GBP to 3.3 GBP for a pint (it seems to vary all over London).  If you look at the US dollar as equivalent to the British Pound you won't flinch too much at the prices.  Everything is about double what it is here!!!  Sorry I'm getting long winded on this post, but if you have ventured to the Tower, and you want to get a ride on an original Routemaster bus (the type you get on from the back), you can do so at Tower Hill bus stop in front of the tower, and take it back to Trafalgar Square - bus #15.  The Routemaster will be gone for good in 2010 since it is not handicap accessible.  The busroute is known as the Heritage route.  There are 2 routes left with these buses #9 and #15.  The #15 Heritage route goes from Trafalgar Square to Tower Hill (both directions).  If you are there for a week - get a 7 day TravelCard which includes tubes/buses and gives you a discount on Thames River cruises."
"April 28, 2006",Tower of London great!,"My family visited over Christmas 2003 and it was our first time to London except for my dad.  I thought this place was the most interesting thing we saw in that city.  I am not a history buff by any means but this really captivated me.  The place was awsome, and when you are aware of the history of the Tower, it makes it sooooo interesting.  My favorite places were the crown jewels and the display where the battle armor was.  Even the horse's armor was on display and that was very amazing.  We did not take a tour, just strolled around on our own.  I would recommend a tour and next year when I go again, I would go and do one of the Beefeeter escorted tours.  The waiting in line was rough.  It was super cold that day and their computers broke down.  We probably waited 2hrs in line to get in.  Next time I will by tickets prior so there is no wait.  You just jump the line and go on in.  We didn't know that then, but it really is a time saver!  You can buy tickets on line and my friend told me about ----.  Check it out."
"February 19, 2006",Get there early!,"It is quite a few years since I last visited the Tower of London and I must say it has changed a lot - only for the better!  The Jewel House is extremely well-laid-out and all the displays in the White Tower are well organised and signed.  Staff were very friendly and willing to explain and answer our questions.The new restaurant does good food at reasonable prices too !I would certainly say you havent visited London if you havent been to the Tower, but get there early to avoid the coach parties and the queues. Its worth every penny!!"
"March 24, 2005",A great history lesson and a must for Brits,"I personally am not bothered by the Royal family, but this tells you your own country's history that they don't bother to teach you in schools. I learnt more about it here than I ever did in school! It really is informative and educational and you get to go around practically the whole thing. It really should be made a compulsory school trip for kids in this country. The best part of it was the crown jewels for me.Just a shame it was ruined by a group of school age tourists that had asbsoultely no respect for others and where they were."
"February 6, 2005",JEWELS,"Extensive museums showing weaponry gets a bit tediuos if you're not into that sort of thing, but the part you can't miss is the Crown Jewels.  Breathtaking.  Very easy to loop back into line to see them again if you want as long as it's not a hugely busy day.  Be sure to walk across Tower Bridge and perhaps visit The HMS Belfast for some great WWII naval history and just enjoy the few from the other side of the Thames."
"November 25, 2021",Gorgeous,Stunning buildings and the crown jewels are gorgeous. I really liked to see the ravens. The exhibitions are well-made and interesting.
"June 30, 2018",Great attraction - very crowded!,"We loved the Tower and the history. However, knowing how crowed it can get ( visited 3 years ago) we got to the location extra early and were among the first people to arrive and bought our tickets in advance on line.  We wanted to be given a tour by one of the Yeoman warders and told to wait until 10 o clock in a designated area. Well by 10 there were over 300 people waiting for the tour to begin. We tried to follow him, but with the large crowd could not hear his presentation. Realize you cannot do anything about the crowds, but would hope the first to arrive would be rewarded by fewer people. "
"April 4, 2017",An amazing attraction steeped in history.,"We had another enjoyable visit to the Tower of London.There is so much history and my favourite part was seeing the Crown Jewels, they are so beautiful and well displayed so you get a good look at them.The ‘Beefeater’ tour was brilliant and the Yeoman Wardens are so friendly, knowledgeable and witty.  They can certainly keep you entertained with their interesting stories.We learned that the Duke of Wellington was Constable of the Tower of London from 1826-1852 and in 1832; he moved the troublesome wild animals out of the Tower of London to Regents Park to join the others in the newly formed Zoological Society of London.  I never knew they kept wild animals in the Tower of London!This attraction is a ‘must see’ when visiting London."
"January 14, 2020",Amazing -Top 10 attractions in the world ! ," Where in the world can you go and see so much history in one place ....nowhere.  Whether you are fans if the royals or not there is so much to see here ... just the buildings themselves blow me away.  Yes there are crowds - you can't complain about that but there are crowds everywhere when it comes to worldwide attractions. Top Tip - Purchase and PRINT off your tickets at home. Then get there early ....I was there for 9.30 and one of the first in so it's not super early. The stand out is the Crown Jewels , its great these are on display for the public to see. Also if you can jump on a Beefeater tour these are well worth it. The armoury has to be one of my favourite areas to see. Also the original chapel has some wonderful history.  There is no real options for food and drinks so I take my own and there's no issues with that.  Awesome thing to do in London and top of the list in my guide .⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  "
"July 12, 2005",The Ceremony of keys,"We just returned from London and we went to the Tower to see the Ceremony of Keys.  You have to write ahead of time to get tickets but they are free and well worth it.  You can find the address on their web-site and it is really easy to do.  This was just the most amazing event we went to.  When they tell you the history and you get to see the pomp that goes on it is breath taking.  It is weird to see the soilders with the AK-47's, a bit unnerving.The only thing is that when they say that there are no bathrooms, there are no bathrooms.  When you leave go right to the tube because there are no cabs and you will have to walk a bit if you go anywhere else."
"May 11, 2005",A Wonderful piece of History,"We throroughly enjoyed the Tower of London. Luckily, there were no queues for tickets, or for the crown jewels (which were really cool). We explored all the areas, took a free beefeater tour which was very worthwhile. We especially liked the White Tower with Henry VIII's armor and many other interesting things. Didn't realize how large it really is. We had 3.5 hours there but could have used 4. Highly recommend this to anyone going to London."
"November 19, 2003",Book well ahead for Ceremony of the Keys,"A ceremony marking the nightly locking-up of her Majestys Tower that's been performed nightly for over 700 years, it's worth the effort to get tickets. Write to Ceremony of the Keys, Waterloo Block, HM Tower of London EC3N4AB. Include two international reply coupons (available at your post office). Indicate the names and ages and addresses of you and each member of your party, desired date and alternate dates and include a large, self-addressed envelope. Allow four to six weeks for a reply.You are requested to arrive no later than 9:30pm, the ceremony actually begins at 9:55 and is finished by 10:05. No photography is permitted. Kids and adults all love it. If you have one, bring a flashlight, but you can do without it. Its historical, its enjoyably creepy because its nighttime, its safe, and its short."
"October 19, 2006",Awsome!,"We went to the tower of London this October.  It's a little pricey, at 15 pounds per person, but completely worth it.  A tip is to go to the 2for1 london site and print off the 2for1 tickets, they have them for just about all the attractions in london except the London eye.  You are supposed to have a valid train ticket for that day to use them but they didn't check that when we were there, and I've heard that at the Tower of London they pretty much never do.  When you get 2 tickets for 15 pounds it makes the price much more reasonable!  Also, if you don't feel like risking them asking you to see a rail ticket when you don't have one, you can use any train ticket, so you can purchase extremely short distance tickets for less than two pounds.  Anyway, we got to the Tower of London right aroud 10 when it opened, the lines weren't too bad and we got in quite quickly.  We spent about 3 hours actually inside, there was tons to see.  The tour by one of the Yeoman is a must, it is free and they began every half hour.  The guide we had and from what I could tell most of the guides do an amazing tour, and tell lots of interesting stories that easily keep your interest.  We went to see the crown jewels straight away when we got there as we heard that area can get quite busy.  There were basically no one else in there when we saw them, and then we went back to the front where we began our tour,  and then after spent quite a bit of time wandering around by ourselves.  We all had a great times, and it was one of the highlights of our trip to London."
"May 3, 2006",Absolutely Unmissable,"I'll start by saying - if you visit London, visit the Tower of London at ALL COSTS!!We booked in advance over the Internet, this way you avoid having to queue at the ticket machines etc, you can just walk straight in. The tours start from just past the entrance, and are done by a Yeoman guard (Beefeater). They are free - and timed, and are WELL worth doing - the Beefeaters reveal lots of facts and are really amusing, making jokes about various things. You also get to go into the Chapel - which you cannot do otherwise.Other things to see in the Tower are the Crown Jewels of course, Traiters Gate, Bloody Tower, and the most famous of all - the White Tower (which you can explore, it holds many things like guns, suits of armour etc).Make sure your camera has a massive memory card!"
"April 24, 2005",Bring your walking shoes!,"The Tower of London is an absolute ""must see"" for anyone visiting London.  The exhibit of the Crown jewels is breathtaking.  And don't miss the armor in the White Tower- it is outstanding. It was a relief to realize that they have toilets inside the tour area.  But bring your favorite pair of comfy shoes- the lines were long, and the walking up the stairs, and down the stairs will set your feet on fire if you're not careful.  Hint- if you are using the London Tour busses to get around, be sure to buy your Tower tickets from them.  The price is the same, and you avoid the queue at the Tower ticket line."
"March 30, 2005",Great place to spend a few hours,"My daughter and I spent several hours at the Tower of London.  There is a lot to see. and it's all very interesting.  Be prepared for lots of walking - particularly up and down narrow stairs and circular staircases.  If you have young children, you may want to skip the Bloody Tower - they show how several forms of torture were performed.  Even I found it disturbing."
"February 9, 2005",Loved seeing crown jewels. but the Beefeaters are wonderful,Very interesting.  Beefeaters stories are wonderful.  Must Must wear comfy thick sole shoes..cobblestone and stairs are hard on the feet.  I would love to see all the sites there again.  Fabulous. The chapel and story is intriguing. 
"July 11, 2003","""Whose keys?""  ""Queen Elizabeth's keys!""","Security makes for ceremony at the Tower of London. Every night for 700 years, the Ceremony of the Keys has been performed inside the walls of the Tower. Of the thousands who visit the Tower each week, only a handful of visitors glimpse this after-hours pagentry. We'll give a quick overview of the ceremony and tell you how to arrange tickets to this special London event.While the Tower of London has evolved from palace and prison to tourist attraction, the ritual locking of the Tower's gates has changed very little. The Tower's gate is locked, the keys are accompanied uniformed escort, and the Chief Yeoman Warder and Tower's military guards recite a precise challenge-and-pass routine:""Halt, who comes there?"" demands the guard.""The Keys!"" replies the Chief Yeoman Warder.""Whose Keys?"" counters the guard.""Queen Elizabeth's Keys"" is the Chief Yeoman's response.""Pass Queen Elizabeth's Keys"" replies the sentry, ""and all's well""An assembled guard salutes, the Chief Yeoman shouts ""God preserve Queen Elizabeth"", a bugler sounds, and the ceremony ends. Only ten minutes has passed, but those who see the Ceremony of the Keys seem to have stepped back through 700 years of history.How can you attend the ceremony? Send for a ticket as far in advance as possible (six months ahead is not too soon). Write to:The Ceremony of the Keys Waterloo Block, HM Tower of London London, UK EC3N 4ABIn your letter include the date you want to attend (give a few alternate dates), the number of people in your party (maximum is 7 6 from April through October and 15 during other months), and the names and addresses of everyone who will attend. Send the letter along with a self-addressed envelope and an two international postal reply coupons (available at US post offices) to cover the return postage."

"June 24, 2006","Tower of London- pretty much required, but....","The Tower of London is fine: you get to see the crown jewels, lots of weapons, some prison cells, a nice view of the Thames.  If you're coming to London for the first time, it is pretty much a required stop on the standard tourist trail.However, I would not be nearly as sanguine if you could only visit during prime visiting hours, i.e. if you have to fight massive crowds of tourists and visiting schoolkids.  Frankly, I'd skip it if I had to wade through the masses.I strongly suggest: buy your ticket in advance (in the underground station at tower hill, or at your hotel).  Tickets are 15 pounds for an adult.  Take the tube and arrive at the Tower Hill station at 9:30.  You'll be in the T of L by 9:40.  Go straight to the Jewels (since that's where the crowds tend to congregate quickly) and enter.  You'll pretty much have the place to yourself, like we did.  Then go to the White Tower and get through that.If you're inclined, go back to the traitors gate (near the entrance) and hook up with a tour led by the Yeoman Warders.  If you like to go at your own pace, skip the YW tour, spend 3 pounds, and take yourself on a self-guided audio tour.We spent about two hours total.  I guess you might be able to stretch it into 3 if you want, especially if you buy lunch but by then the crowds will be unpleasantly enormous."
"June 21, 2006",Want to walk around bored out of your mind? Visit the Tower of London,"Despite the many glowing reviews, we were disappointed with the Tower of London. It is not that big or interesting, and how many old weapons do you really want to see? It is so touristy that it has a Disney world feel.  I did not feel close to history at all.The crown jewels did not interest me; I doubt they would be of interest to most men. Women might enjoy seeing them. I found them gaudy and garish and not worth the wait.Here's a tip: if you must go, go later in the afternoon.  It's still crowded, but not nearly as busy as earlier in the day. Avoid the overpriced gift shops selling items made outside of England. I would never go here again nor would I take first timers to London here. Point it out from a distance; save your money."
"October 29, 2005",Lots of History,"We really enjoyed the Tower of London.  Wait for the free guided tour by the beefeaters, even if it means you are part of a big crowd.  They are entertaining and point out things to look for inside.  The jewels were fabulous, though clearly there can sometimes be a long wait for them, and I don't know if they would have been fabulous if I had had to wait through all the queues they had.  We were pretty much able to walk right to them and stay as long as we liked.  They were pretty unbelievable.  Outside of that, there were lots of rooms to explore and displays to see, a lot of history to be had.  An overall very interesting experience."
"June 24, 2005",The Tower in 2 hours,"The Tower is a must see for anyone who has interest in English History.  That being said, I strongly recommend reading up a little on your English History before touring the Tower.  This will provide you a much greater appreciation of what you are viewing.  There is a lot here to behold, take your time and begin your tour in the early morning, if possible. When my family recently toured here, we had already had a long day of touring Westminster and Whitehall, so our feet were tired and, after having seen the glory of the previous 2 sites, we were left a little unimpressed by these older, less ornate buildings."
"September 16, 2019",Steeped in History,"My wife and I visited the Tower of London recently and were extremely pleased we did so. We spent the best part of six hours walking around a fascinating piece of history. The Yeomen of the guard conduct amazing tours that both educate and entertain, and are more than happy to have their photo taken with you. The spectacular buildings with the walls are a testament to the genius of the builders of the past."
"October 2, 2018",Sad to see it comply with the present day.,"The last time I visited the Tower of London It was probably twenty plus years ago and it was such an interesting place. I visited it again a few weeks ago and was so shocked by what I saw. Gift shops all over the place with coffee shops and kitschy looking people walking around in period costumes. I have to say that all the atmosphere has all gone behind sterile half inch thick glass and audio things dished out to tourists. The one place I remember was the building housing all the armour and arms. Its now got a monstrous dragon made out of guns, armour, and swords to greet you! It now reminds me of Ikea. Once you enter a single tower you have to just follow a stream of tourists going at one speed and one way only until you have completed part way to yet another gift shop or gift shop! I bought a season ticket and decided to probably go mid winter when it's less busy. The stream of people for the crown jewels was like a snake that never ended in it's twists and turns until about two hours later you would make it to the door!Unfortunately this wonderful place of our heritage has fallen foul of the tourist trap. Even at the top of one of the most famous parts of the tower was subjected to interactive games for children! sadly I couldn't wait to find an exit. Very sad. "
"January 25, 2006",My favorite place in London!!,"This was my 2nd visit to both London and the Tower.I started with a brief look at the Crown Jewels 1st thing in the morning.  Then I took the Yeoman Warders tour.  This is an excellant starting point for history of the Tower.  Also, ont he tour you get to go into St Peter's Chapel, which is closed to everyone else.I could have spent all day here and still not see everything.  I took 3 rolls of film this trip.One night I attended the Ceremony of the Keys.  It was quite eerie to be in the Tower at night. I felt like I was all alone - a little spooky.  The Ceremony has been happening nightly for over 700 years, so i really felt like a part of history.  It is nice to see the traditions continue.  The Ceremony lasts for 7 minutes, but you get a history lesson first.  You also need to write to the Tower in advance for tickets becasue the number of attendees is limited each night.I felt that the Tower is a must do place to visit! I will visit again on my next trip too."
"November 5, 2004",Great visit and (oddly) great food,We went to the Tower of London October 2004.  The Beefeater's Tour was great.  We spent a full day there.  The lunch we had was the best meal in 2 weeks touring the UK (and we ate at a lot of pretty expensive places!)  Try the icebox cake!
"September 11, 2019","This is a 1-star review of TripAdvisor’s advance tickets, NOT the Tower tour. The Tower of London is a Great attraction worth your visit. HOWEVER, if you get advance tickets, be advised ... the information printed on your ticket voucher is misleading and INCORRECT. To exchange your voucher for tickets, simply go to the Tower ticket windows, Group Tickets. It’s easy! But the voucher gives you a redemption address that Goggle Maps nor 6-8 locals could locate. What a waste of 45 minutes and a lot of worthless walking!  TripAdvisor ... get your info worthwhile!",One of the amazing ancient heritage sites
"June 7, 2019","One of the magnificent towers of London, this tower is one of the ancient heritage sites. At the same time, tourists come from distant places to see the beauty of the Tower Bridge built on the river Thames. Standing above the bridge, watching the city of London is just another fun.",Must visit..Kohinoor diamond
"December 17, 2015",A must visit tourist place..stone throw away distance from Tower Bridge..It house the Kohinoor Diamond from India and another 510 carat diamond from Africa..you can see the black and red colour dressed security..has a moving platform to keep people moving inside the Tower..,Don't miss it!
"July 9, 2006","We took the advice of other posters and arrived just after the doors opened at 9. We had purchased our tickets the day before from a shop near the London Eye.  There are many places in town that sell them, not just tube stations.  Again, following advice from other posters, we saw the Jewels first.  They were beautiful, but the best part came after we'd seen them.  We sat down on a bench just outside the exit from the Jewels, and watched a Yeoman Warder approach a family with a young boy, aged about 4 years old I'd say.  They were asked if the little boy would like to go back in and try on a real crown - no pictures allowed.  When they came back out, the little guy appeared to have been transformed by the experience. It was hilarious and adorable.  Then we took a Yeoman Warder tour, and ours was excellent.  They vary tremendously in what they say and how they say it, so if you don't find one appealing, wander around a bit until the next one gets started.  I was thrilled to walk on the old wall and  mused on what it must have been like for one of my ancestors who was confined there for nearly 2 years during the 1600's.  When the crowds increased, we decided to move on to the Museum of London, a short bus ride away.  Someday we'll go back to  the Tower and see some of the things we missed on the first trip.  Having lasted a thousand years, it's likely to be there a year or two more!","must see, very informative and interesting"
"January 21, 2006",The Tower of London is definitely a must see in London. It's full of history and is fascinating. I'd recommend taking the free tour with a Yeoman Warden aka a Beefeater. They are funny and explain some stuff you wouldn't know otherwise. Check out the crown jewels.,A must-see
"July 11, 2005",We visited July/05.  Go early to avoid the lineup to see the Crown jewels.  A lot of history here.  Many different towers to visit.,the mighty tower of london
"January 13, 2005","I think the tower of london is interesting. I went there with a tour group back in 2002. It was definately interesting. I liked the stories of the people kept imprisoned, the ghosts, and the story of the discovery of two dead little boys, which are thought to be princes. The crown jewels are interesting too. It is nice to see what royalty once wore. I didnt hav time last time i went to London with my father-he didnt get to see it and i regret it most of all.  When you arrive a man in a costume of a guard, i believe, tells you storys of the place. In the very beginning the tower of london, was truly that, just a tower. The rest was added on later, and now it is really a fortress.Go see it",Tower of London poppies
"August 6, 2014","I had already visited the tower and the crown jewels which was brilliant. But today I went to see the commemorative world war one poppies. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!! and its not even finished. They are so vibrant and beautiful, very cleverly done. I have already bought 3 online for when they are removed in November this year. MUST BE SEEN and its FREE!",Great London Experience
"February 2, 2006","The Tower of London was one of the most entertaining places in London that I visited. The free guided tour from one of the beefeaters is a must. You'll hear interesting stories about the history of the Tower, with a healthy dose of humor mixed in. The crown jewels are worth seeing provided the line isn't too long. Luckily on the day I went it wasn't too crowded and I was able to walk right through most of the queuing area. If that actually fills up on busy days you might be in for quite a wait. Some people might find the jewels a bit of a let down compared to the rest of the tower. Half the fun is exploring the different buildings and reading the events that happened in each. There are also plenty of exhibits of armor, weapons, etc. Definitely worth a visit.",Trip with severely disabled brother spoilt by a rude yeoman.
"September 23, 2013","We went to the tower yesterday. I live locally and my autistic physical and learning disabled brother came with me to spend a day enjoying the sights. The trip started really well and we very much enjoyed the tour given by Moira, the female beefeater which was fun and informative. My brother and i got a concession ticket and as his carer I was allowed in to accompany him for free. My brother, is partially sighted with curvature of the spine and finds it difficult to walk quickly or fast up stairs where it is dark. Because of this he took his time around the towers and in some instances tourists started to get annoyed with him for being slow but on the whole we were OK. Anyway after several hours of walking and being on Moira's tour, we went into the white tower and saw a disabled lift that went down into the gun armory room. Taking the opportunity to not go up and down flights of stairs very slowly and annoy more tourists we went inside the lift. When the lifts opened a bearded yeoman was waiting with a smug expression on his face to tell us we weren't allowed to use the lift as I wasn't disabled, pointing at my brother (who clearly is) I said he has, his response was the lift was only for disabled people in wheelchairs. My brother at this point started to get really upset and I started to get very embarrassed. I said to the yeoman you can follow us around and see him walk if you like if it convinces you that he is disabled, he also has his disabled id with him. It was only when my brother looked like he was about to cry (a grown autistic man) the Yeoman started to back down. Rather than apologise, he said it was the fault of other yeoman not telling him for health and safety reasons that we were in the lift. We don't care about what his process is or isnt, we were made to feel humiliated and it soured our entire trip. I then looked on my return home last night to check the website and apparently there are zoned areas to show where access is bad for the disabled. It also said that the tower is keen to hear of any comments. I will definitely relay what happened to us to them. Having ignorant, rude people on standby outside a disabled lift with zero understanding of disability and the belief that you are only disabled if you are in a wheelchair is not what I expect of a world class heritage site and tourist destination. As a Londoner I was ashamed to think that this was the case. My brother unfortunately has to put up with this sort of prejudice and ignorance daily. It is just a shame this time we had to pay for the priviledge.",Closes too early!
"January 19, 2013","Sadly the Tower closes very early on the weekends.  We had a short stay and barely missed being able to take the tour of the Tower.  The building itself is still fantastic, and nice to walk around.Next time we'll take the tour and view the crown jewels!",Liked the Crown Jewels
"July 29, 2008","I went to the Tower of London and did enjoy my time there. It was a little expensive to get in and since the tower the closing soon, I only had an hour inside. I went into the Bloody Tower and thought it was cool inside. Make sure you go up in at least one tower while you are there. I found the crown jewels amazing. There was a short line to get in. You can't take pictures of the jewels and you are on a conveyer belt when you go by them. They were very pretty anyways. If you want more information on them, buy a book in the gift shop, that's what I did. The Tower of London is a beautiful structure and a piece of history, so I suggest you visit it. Just be sure to give yourself a lot of time so you don't miss anything and beware of what time the tower closes!",Not to be missed
"November 5, 2007","Really interesting! Be sure to go on the Beefeater tour- we were honored to meet the first female Beefeater in their 700 year history. The grounds are beautiful, the crown jewels are impressive and the history is fascinating. The exhibits are well done. Kids really seemed to enjoy this sight as well as adults. Give yourself a couple hours to explore. You can then walk across Tower Bridge which is a couple minute walk away.",Get there early to avoid the summer crowds!
"August 24, 2007","Got advance tickets from our concierge and got there about 10:30 a.m. on the tube.Had heard we should see the jewels first, before the crowds arrived, so we hustled over there.  We all loved seeing them, and there were very few people, so we were able to keep circling back and spending as much time as we liked to really enjoy the experience.  Even the teenage boys thought it was tremendous.  A highlight of our trip.Then the crowds began to get large, even though it was a rainy day.Tried to get on the recommended beefeater tours, but didn't think we could manage or hear in the crowd of over 100 people.Watched the actors simulating a medieval scene and fighting (fair).Toured the bloody tower (OK) and the torture exhibit (fair, but quick).Tried to enjoy the White tower with the exhibits of weapons but by then the crowds were overwhelming.  We felt liike we were salmon swimming upstream to spawn, and got out as soon as possible.Lunch was excellent.Recommendations:1) Arrive early, as soon as it opens.2) Take the first early beefeater tour3) See the jewels4) Then White tower5) Then do as you like",Passing along a tip
"February 27, 2007","Some fellow travellers offered us this tip over breakfast at our hotel. Get to the Tower early and make a beeline for the jewel room. They said it fills up after 10 or so, and they weren't kidding. We did just what they suggested, head for the farthest corner of the Tower immediately after entry, and skip the video presentations. At 10:15 AM, there were all of 4 of us riding the conveyors back and forth past the crown jewels. We could take our time. Then we went back to see the rest of the tower, which was overrun with schoolchildren on field trips by then.",See the Beefeaters at the Tower of London
"October 13, 2004","A London attraction you can't miss.This historic site is well worth spending a half day site-seeing. The Beefeaters make the one and a half hour introduction tour so interesting that the time is up before you know it. These purveyors of entertainment make the history of the Tower a joy to learn. Too bad we couldn't of learned history like this in high school. The Crown Jewels and other artifacts were sensational. The armory is impressive in its content of armour, swords, guns and other early period armaments.All in all, I highly recommend taking in the Tower of London.",Have to visit
"February 3, 2004","The Tower of London is rightly known as one of the must see sights of London. I have been there a few times, most recently in March 2003. It is a good idea to get to the Tower as early as possible (not sure what time it actually opens though) and head straight for the Jewel House. It is quiet at this time of day and gives you an oppurtunity to get in and see the Crown Jewels without a crowd around you 'oohing' and 'aahing' After that you can set your own pace and explore the walls and the various buildings. I have never joined one of the Beefeater tours as I have a great love of history and therefore know a lot about events and people who inhabited the Tower. However the tour is the only way you can get into the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula and having never managed to do that before I tagged on to a tour just before they got to the chapel and was able to get inside. The restaurant inside the Tower is quite good but I did see all the school parties tucking into their packed lunches so that is also an option. Bottom line - it's expensive but well worth the visit.",Top historic spot in London
"March 1, 2003","I missed the Tower on my first visit to London, and made it my first stop this time round. It's a wonderful experience, especially given the fact that the admission fee includes a fabulous guided tour with a Beefeater. You can skip the tour and walk around on your own, but I highly recommend it. Each fellow has his own style; our tour was with Mick, a very theatrical and funny man who brought the scenes to life (and recited a stirring passage from Shakespeare's ""Richard III""). The crown jewels are here, as well as armor and various other displays. I was less interested in that stuff than the awe-inspiring surroundings of this town within a town. Not to mention the resident ravens. History really comes to life here.",Amazing & Stunning
"November 23, 2019",My first visit to this part of London especially to check out the Tower of London & Tower Bridge.Both are breathtaking beautiful and a great part of history.,Beefy 409
"October 19, 2019","Visited the Tower of London a number of times but this was the first time we chose to do the warden tour! We were taken around by beefeater Scott Kelly, he clearly loves his job and his interaction with the crowd was brilliant. If you visit please wait for one of the tours, every 30 minutes I think, and if your lucky you’ll get Scott Kelly, beefy #409! ",Not Quite What Advertised
"June 22, 2019","The ""skip the line"" concept was misleading. You don't have to stand in line to purchase tickets but you still have to stand in the group ticket line to redeem your voucher for actual entry tickets. The group ticket line doesn't open until the same time as the tower so you then have to take your entry tickets and get in line to actually enter the Tower. This was the extremely long line and we didn't get to skip it. If we had known this I would have had a member of our party get in the group line while the rest of us waited in the long line for entry. The good news was the Tower staff moves things along quickly and we weren't delayed to much. The tower itself was great but very crowded.  The Yeomans were very informative and we really enjoyed it.",A MUST if you visit London
"October 20, 2018","We had a week to visit London's many historic attractions [I am a historian] and two places stand out: the Tower of London and the British Museum.  If you can - save a day for each !  The tower's various sections are truly a delight and show you what life was like without electricity and modern plumbing.    The displays of armor and weaponry are awesome, as are the Crown Jewels.   Leave time to walk and see the surrounding grounds, including the canons, outdoor stage under the huge tree, the crows [smart birds !], and the masonry.  ",Very poor customer service
"March 30, 2018",Whilst appreciating the actual venue and it's historical importance we found the overall experience very disappointing due to the rude staff. They all seemed completely disinterested and absolutely no idea of customer service. Poor service on every level - would not recommend because of that - spoiled the whole visit. ,Very disappointing. Health and safety gone mad!
"November 23, 2017","My nephew and I were really looking forward to a guided tour of the Tower of London. Having paid a lot of money to get in we joined huge crowds waiting for the tour. It was raining lightly. I had no umbrella and it wasn't needed.When the Yeoman warder arrived he said ""There will not be any tours today because of the rain."" The reason he gave was that ""People tend to poke each other in the eye with umbrellas so it's not safe""The Yeoman warder then gave us a brief intro to the tower in which he spoke very quickly and quietly. I'm a local and even still I couldn't understand what he was saying. He was quite derogatory against certain national groups and made smart comments about under 30 year olds using their phones"".He then dismissed us and we were left to wander around aimlessly.Such a waste of money. This place is filled with the most amazing history. We just wanted someone to talk us through the highlights but they couldn't be bothered, so we really missed out despite paying the full entry price. This was a great disappointment. ",Definitely Something To Lose Your Head Over
"March 8, 2016","This is a MUST when visiting London as no trip is complete without a visit to the notorious Tower of London.Situated on the banks of the Thames, the world's most infamous fortress has throughout history has been the home of royalty, a prison, the setting for foul murder and execution and now home to the nation's Crown Jewels, magnificently presented in their own Jewel House.Once upon a time The Tower was the  home to lions, no tigers and bears (Oh My) and enemies of the Crown, but today it’s home to the entertaining and colourful Beefeaters and the famous ravens.It is recommended to allow a minimum of three hours in order to see everything but there is so much to see.  Visit the impressive collection of historic armour, stand in amazement at the Bloody Tower where the Princes are believed to have been murdered.  Stand at the site of Traitors' Gate through which many famous prisoners have passed.  (Can I recommend you watch the six episodes of Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson before visiting as she portrays Elizabeth I - her passage through Traitors' Gate is immense, and this will really get you in the mood).It doesn't end there, stand silently on the site where Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey met their bloody end, and then sit in reflection in the Church where their remains rest in peace.  The perfect finish comes with a visit to the Beauchamp Tower to read the incredible inscriptions carved intricately by the those incarcerated within its walls.",Moving image of the poppies in the moat
"October 26, 2014","Just go to see the incredible sight of nearly 900,000 ceramic poppies in the moat around the Tower. There is no charge just to see this dramatic installation. ",Good place to visit
"August 2, 2012","I was always interested in the Tower Of London, as coming from India, I was curious to see the famous Koh-i-noor diamond.This is a sombre castle made into a museum these days. The tickets can be bought from vending machines and there is usually a queue while getting in. Situated near the famous Tower Bridge of London. Inside it is all history and loads of information. I did actually see the Koh-i-noor but for a brief period of time,as there is a moving portion on the floor,just like an escalator,whcih refrains you from standing in front of the exhibit for prolonged period. One should be aware of the timings of visit though,otherwise it will be a miss.Overall a good experience and a must see icon of London.",A Must-See
"July 19, 2012","I made a solo visit to the Tower last Saturday and how glad I am I did. It was a dreary, drizzly day and keeping out of the way of everyone's umbrellas was a bit of a challenge.  Be advised that if the weather is inclement, the Beefeaters will NOT provide tours.  With the rain on-and-off all day, it was much easier to just say ""sod the tour"" and go off by one's self with a guidebook.  There is a LOT to see here and I spent about two-and-a-half-hours poking happily around. As the other posters have said, the Crown Jewels are not to be missed--I think I rode the little moving walkway four times just to get my fill.  If you're visiting London and only have time for one attraction, I'd advise a visit here.",Don't buy the Audioguide
"March 27, 2012","Recommend arriving for the first Yeoman Warder Tour to kick off your tour. It is good to give you an overview of the significance of the Tower area/history. We bought tickets for the whole thing and saw the Crown Jewels and the White Tower. (several floors of stairs to climb fyi). We bought tickets at the Underground station at Saint Pancras as the website wasn't working. I would definitely purchase tickets in advance. Fairly crowded on a late March morning (tour groups of kids). The audio guide is a waste of money as it didn't include the White Tower and we not all of the sites are covered on the audioguide. We spent 2 1/2 hours just doing those things, so you can spend a lot of time here. The Kitchen at the Tower (between Tower and All Hallows Church) is a good place to eat lunch. Good menu, wifi and not crowded.",The best London Landmark
"April 10, 2013","Allpy for tickets for the ceremony of the keys, its free at around 9pm ever night for the lock up a 10 sharp, I think you have to write in or look up 'ceremony of the keys' on line.",The Tower of London
"January 28, 2010","Walking through the Tower/buildings was like walking back into time. The wind whipping through the breezeway and the chill in the rooms added to the atmosphere of being thrown back into time. After having read so much about the tower, it was such an unreal experience to actually walk the grounds, touch the walls, peep out of the windows, and imagine what it must have been like to live there, to rule from there, to be imprisoned there, to defend the place or know that it was your last stop, your gaze out upon the river the last sight you'd ever behold!Many people view the tower as a prison, forgetting it was also a palace and a residence, a fortress, a treasury, a mint, and much more! During my visit there was an exhibit ""Henry VIII: Dressed to Kill"" , a display of weapons and armor that was truly amazing! The Crown Jewels are absolutely spectacular, and luckily it took mere minutes for us to get to them, as the crowd was very small.  There are plenty of exhibits, plaques and such, little touches here and there to give one a quick note of history.Maps are provided and it's wise to allow 2-3 hours to see everything. You'll want to linger and not rush through, paying attention to the smallest of details. If you're in the mood, you can stroll along the river after you tour the tower.There are gift shops offering typical souvenir fare as well as some truly unique gifts.To enrich  your tour, guidebooks and audio guides are available.Restroom facilities are conveniently located on the grounds and cafes and coffee shops are convenient as well.Get there early to beat the crowds! Being there even during low tourist season got a bit claustrophobic at times when walking some of the narrow staircases or trying to view exhibits at leisure. Even with the gathering crowds it was still a great experience, allowing me to put more of a face to history.Tips: Wear comfortable shoes; dress weather appropriate and take into account that you will be near water where it tends to be coolerA personal tip -- Really pay attention to what you see!  The fun is in the details, so enjoy your time and try not to rush through it like some tourist attraction in a long line of things one must do. You're visiting a part of history! Really take it in and have loads of fun.  :=)Enjoy!",Highlight of our London experience
"January 8, 2008","We loved The Tower of London. What made it great was the tour given by a Yeoman Warder (Beefeater). I can't believe we almost skipped this and did the audio tour instead. The Beefeater who gave us the tour was marvelous. He was a real character- just hilarious. And I'm not one who laughs at everything. I'm a pretty tough customer in this regard (my idea of hell would be having to watch the insipid and totally predictable humor of Friends for back to back episodes, to give you an idea). During this tour I laughed so hard my eyes teared up. The guide poked a lot of fun at Americans.  Australians and Germans, among others, got teased too- so no one was spared.We had tea in the restaurant and it was the best tea of our trip to Britain, incredibly. The pastries were heavenly. The scones and cream were yummy. Better and cheaper than tea at The Orangery at Kensington Palace, that all the guide books recommend. Although the orange cake at KP was matchless. I would love to get my hands on the recipe. The restaurant was crowded but the tables were kept cleaned and we found a table with no problem. The best advice I could give you would be to save your money by skipping the audio guide. The information given is practically the  same as the information provided for free at the various plaques posted about the place.Warning: The ticket lines are pretty long and it gets quite hectic. Sadly, a Japanese man tried to cut in line. It was so blatant that at first I thought he must be joining the party in front of us. After a couple of minutes it became obvious that he was on his own. When I asked him if he was with the party in front of us, he immediately stepped behind us without responding. He knew he had been called out. Then I heard the people behind us exclaim in British accents ""Hey, where'd he come from?"" The guy played dumb and,being in a foreign country, we didn't want to make a scene or we would have responded that the guy had tried to jump queue and should be asked to step to the BACK of the line. So be aware of your surroundings and make a note of who is in front of you when you first enter the queue. The lines are very long and you might have some unscrupulous characters who will be tempted to cheat.",Taken by the Tower
"August 19, 2004","Just returned from 8 days in London - 2 adults and 2 teenagers on what might be the ""last family vacation.""  Everyone loved the Tower, in part because we waited for an escorted tour with a Beefeater. He was marvelous.

"April 1, 2019","RE: Visit on Thurs 3/28/19.  I took an uber 45 minutes to the ToL as I can’t drive in a Tudor gown/headdress. I checked the website and no clothing restrictions are posted; only general security items, no guns, knives, etc.I purchased a 30£ visitor ticket at the window. Staff there were all saying ”what a lovely gown. It’s a gorgeous day; you should get some great snaps in there!”  I was so excited to get some pictures here with my new gown I’ve only had since Oct 2018.I approached the entry line, ticket out and ready. Here comes a Beefeater ready to attack although not sure why. “Come with me madam.” What? “Where are we going?” No explanation, just huffing. He hastily walked me back up towards the ticket stalls, grabbing the ticket out of my hand. “Where did you purchase this? We’ll be issuing you a refund. We can only have Tower employees in costume.” What? “I’m here from LA, just wanted to get 3-4 pictures in costume. You can accompany me if you’d like and then I’ll be gone.” “No, madam, we don’t allow. Someone was in here recently and even charging people for pictures.” (What?! Hmmmm. I thought you didn’t allow costumed folks in?)“I assure you I don’t charge. It’s for my own pics, and if a tourist wants a pic, of course, it’s free. Who would charge?! It’s for fun and to add to the atmosphere - unlike his attitude!” I was all but manhandled. He was quite curt, said “this front area (& motioned to the greater ticket booth area with his hands) is palace property and instructed me that I’m not allowed there.” He then posed for a requested photo - & even smiled, amazingly!  (The badge with his name is key!)Ok, I’m taking a pic with the castle in the background and heading away. I wandered down a city street to the water front on the other side of the ticket area near the bubble seat restaurant - not on Tower property, but couldn’t get a good bridge shot. I then went back around and asked a security guard how to get to the walkway by the river towards Tower Bridge without being where I was told not to in that front ticket plaza area. He pointed me to the path down to the water. I took a few personal pics while walking along towards the bridge; 2-3 people asked for photos. Here comes Mr Beefeater again: “madam I told you you’re not allowed here. You’re walking through here like you’re Queen of the castle.” What?!!  Rude, condescending, and what, should I look sullen and slouch?! “Is this not a public sidewalk along the river, as it’s not a ticketed area and not where you showed me was off limits!” I could barely get a word in and he escorted me to the end street. I tried to tell him I even asked a guard and was told where it was ok to go to get to the river walk, but couldn't get a word in edge-wise.  Absolutely treated like a criminal!  Completely unnecessary.Staff and Beefeaters need to get on the same page!  A security manager who happened to be along the water front near Traitor's Gate, accompanying him on his second approach, said to me ""it's a shame they don't allow Tudor costumes, as it adds to the ambiance, but the Beefeater's make the rules.  As I was walking towards the street, chatting with this security person, the Beefeater continued to follow us.  There was even a young couple who asked for a photo as they were heading towards us and I had to say no, as he was glaring at us all.  What a great way for him to welcome tourists!  NOT!Mind you, my gown is 22 pounds of fabric and 4 layers that take quite awhile lacing into...not a cheap Halloween costume!  I was able to get a couple pics with the castle in the background, and some tourists asked for photos up on the public sidewalk near the bus stop.  I am thankful there are castles and other properties where Tudor gowned queen's are welcomed with open arms, appreciated for our factual costumes, and ability to interact in character if questioned by tourists.  I portray Katherine Parr, and can recite her history probably better than the ToL paid actors!I'm glad I have been to ToL several times prior (in normal clothes) and with my children), as after this interaction I am in no hurry to return.  What a rude individual that Beefeater was, and thankfully I got his name.I will be following up this week regarding legal grounds on the topic of discrimination.  Harassment in a public place, minding my own business getting photos of my new gown, in an establishment where I had purchased a ticket, and solely based on attire (which as a Tudor gown was not revealing, etc) is not permitted.",great but not what I thought it would be

"September 16, 2005","Even though the admission is a little pricey, it's worth paying to see the jewels.  I don't think the Tower is one of the best forts I've seen in Europe.  Having said that,  the chance to view the crown jewels really is spectacular.  The Beefeaters are very friendly and are more than happy to pose for photo's with the tourists.  The armor room is incredible.  The display is very well done; easy to see all sides of each piece.  Wear comfortable shoes as there are lots of stairs.",A must see!
"July 10, 2004","My husband and I visited the Tower in March 2004, and had a wonderful time.  We had already done Hampton Court Palace (our absolute favorite!), so we were prepared to be less impressed.  However, our trip was wonderful and we spent many hours wandering around the Tower and environs.  To most who have never visited, it's difficult to imagine that this is more of a palace/tower complex than a single building.  The White Tower was the first building on the property, and now lies in the middle of the complex.  My husband didn't want to ""waste time"" by listening to the Beefeater spiel (it was also fairly chilly and windy making standing in one spot for extended periods uncomfortable)...however, I convinced him to listen it....and we're both glad he did.  The information these guides provide is incredible, and provided in a highly entertaining manner.  The complex has a very small bit of Tudor architecture...rare since the Great Fire in 1666 destroyed most of it in the city.  There are also stunning views of the Tower Bridge (saved from destruction in WWII only because the Luftwaffe used it as a navigation aid!).  As noted in previous reviews, the complex does contain many hills and narrow, winding staircases, so those with difficulty in navigating these should probably abstain...for all others, however, it is a wonderful way to spend half a day (or more).",Ceremony of the Keys

Then, I even joined another one- it was so so much fun and educational and informative.  I loved being where so many historical events had been.The line for the Crown Jewels after 10am was not long and moved quickly.  There are many rooms and many historical displays of the crowns and jewels of historical British monarchy, going back many hundreds of years.  Finally- finally, one comes to the end- the crown and cape worn by King Charles III at his recent coronation that very month.I viewed an impromptu staged animated active recreation of historical events from several hundred years ago that took place exactly where we were standing.  It was tremendous and entertaining and funny- see my numerous attached photos of the actors!!I also toured the White Tower and the Salt Tower- the exhibits of incredibly massive amounts of medieval knights' armor and regalia were stunning, along with the metal covers of the horses.  I descended at least four flights from one of the turrets- I tried to video and take photos- it was dizzying.I then walked along the turrets and ramparts and observed and photographed modern London.In summary- a fantastic visit and almost a full day affair.WAS IT WORTH THE PRICE?it is expensive, but it was worth it and I don't regret paying  the (reduced senior citizen) cost.WOULD I VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN?Sure, but not for 26+ GBPADVICES*  For sure you must go- buy tickets on line and get there early when it opens*  Be sure to go on (at least one) yeoman warder tour*  See the Crown Jewels display as early as you can*  Visit the White Tower and salt Tower and see the stunning exhibits*  Walk along the ramparts",Highlight is free Beefeater tour

"June 26, 2019","A few things about this tour.  First, I was lead to believe that purchasing tickets through this site was going to get us ""Priority Entrance"" AND the ""Crown Jewels"" entrance.  There is no such perk as ""priority entrance"" as explained to us by the ticketing counter at the castle.  The entrance into the facility automatically comes with access to the ""crown jewels"", this is not a separate charge.  You are not getting a bundled package here, just a plan admittance ticket.  You still have to wait in a line to get a facility ticket, the printed paper copy is not good as the admittance ticket.  Besides the disinformation by this TripAdvisor offering, going to the facility was really crowded and felt like we were at a Disneyland attraction. They have turned this space into a bit of a theater act.  Advise, just for the pure purpose of seeing such a historic location, go towards the end of the day.  The crowds will be diminishing and you don't have to wait hours on end to walk the crown jewel exhibition.",More to see than we thought

Suffice to say, the best way I can put it is go and see for yourself, you will not be disappointed.",Very unfriendly response to children needs
"July 31, 2015","The Tower is an amazing place to visit and this time I brought .my daughter and grandchildren down from Yorkshire to have a great day. Readers will probably imagine we are very permissive parents and grandparents complaining, but that is not the case. Having brought 4 children aged between 6 and 14 as well as a 10month old baby....spending over £100 entrance plus ice creams etc.etc. we suddenly heard the Yeoman announce it was 5.30 and it was closing time. We immediately moved to exit and asked if we could take the children to the toilet as we left. The reaction of the Yeoman could not have been any different if I had asked him to allow me to leave with the Crown Jewels. I do not exaggerate. After turning a corner we asked a female Yeoman the same question and had a similar if less aggressive response. Why? It was so unnecessary. So uncaring. Such poor service. A very poor example of English service and hospitality. The whole impression suggested an arrogance that should have embarrassed the guilty staff. Earlier we had all visited the London Eye. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the staff and service was of a much higher standard for families than at the Tower. As I left the Tower, I politely asked how I could register a complaint. I was directed to the visitor centre. We were passing anyway (trying to find a toilet) so I called in. Send an email was the response!. I thought I would tell Trip Advisor users, instead.",History made alive...
"December 14, 2018","I absolutely LOVED visiting the Tower of  London.  Spent an entire day there. Had the fast track ticket - and were there very early- otherwise prepare yourself for hours in the ticket queue and way too large tours.  Loved the Beefeater tours and were very surprised to learn that they were actually high ranking soldiers in the army and went through rigorous selection to become Beefeaters.  Many of them apparently from the same bloodlines as the original Yeoman Warders. I loved the actors playing out the history - and even had to vote to ""spare the life"" of one of Anne Boleyn's lovers!  The Crown Jewels... well, if there wasn't a ""conveyor belt"" in front of the crowns - I may have stood there in awe for way too long.  It is a very clever idea to have a conveyor belt - otherwise the crowds would most certainly not have been able to move.  The blood tower was an eerie place with a tragic history. If you listen well -  the prison still rings with the cries of tortured souls - and the walls speak of last thoughts and the knowledge of impending death often by the cruellest manners.  The Tower of London has a bloody history and the earth beneath her is soaked with the blood of many a soul - more often the blood of the innocent.  Ah, the Ravens!  Love the tradition of keeping the crows + one, for in case the tower falls (although I never enjoy animals/birds kept in cages). Wild beasts were - and still are kept at the whim and for the entertainment of powerful people - and the Tower sure had it's share.  The lonely polar bear living it's life chained... in stone... an unspeakable tragedy.  Cannot even imagine a beast so free living this horrible imprisoned life...  Visiting The Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vindula is a privilege and the lecture inside - surrounded by the graves - a look into the yesterday of many souls... long, long ago. The Fusillier Museum was interesting - but being a South African and knowing the history of my country - and the Anglo-Boer war where 26,000.00 woman and children starved to death, were raped by the English soldiers, and died of illness and exposure to sub-zero temperatures were not even mentioned. Nor were the fact that a ""scorched earth"" policy meant that every Farm was burnt to the ground and all animals killed, and crops burnt - as they could not beat the ""Boer"" commandos with their Guerrilla warfare. Old men, little boys, in fact all males were soldiers - and the woman were left to look after the farms. When this proved a thorn in the side of the English - as they were bleeding money and more and more soldiers had to be shipped to South Africa - because they could not win in the conventional manner - they employed the hideous way of Nazi concentration camps to break the spirit of the young nation.  Men were sent to islands like Ceylon in exile... and the aftermath of this war, made for a lot of bad blood between our nation and the Brits. The old people - many now dead - still spoke of the horrors of the camps and many had lost up to 13 children in the camps... The fact that the Boer war is actually just mentioned - almost in passing... is not - to my mind fair play.  But, with that said - I still loved the Tower!",Good if the tours were better managed
"September 3, 2018","Lovely visit, we went early to avoid the crowds and literally had to wait 5 mins to see the Crown Jewels at 10.45 am.  I would have liked to have gone on a beefeater tour but every tour we looked at between 10.30 am and 12.30 midday was absolutely heaving and looked quite unbearable due to the crowds.  I think they need to look at this and perhaps offer tours every 15 mins/booking system or more guides.  It is expensive to enter so disappointed that we couldn't take up on the tours especially as you can't go in the chapel without being on a tour.  Tip, when you come out of the Tower turn left and walk for approx. 250 yds along the river and you come to St Katherine's Docks where Glorianna (Queens Golden Jubilee) boat is moored - nice to see.",Lovely attraction but lots of stairs
"September 3, 2018","We visited the Tower last week, Obviously a fabulous building, was great to look round the fast track tickets got us straight in so no need to queue and the staff were helpful on the way in. Once in there are plenty of signposts but there are also a lot of stairs, we could not find any lifts or anyone nearby to ask. The queue was long for the crown jewels so as I cant stand for that long we didn't go in the jewel tower. So anyone with physical impairments just be warned. Other than that its well worth a visit.","Yeomen Warders/""Beefeaters"" Misogynist and Ableist A-Holes"
"July 29, 2018","I took my disabled father to the Tower of London, a place he had always wanted to visit. The staff at the entrance couldn't have been more kind or accommodating, giving us a map of accessible entrances and paths. When we entered the tower, however, we had a number of terrible encounters with the Yeomen/""Beefeaters"" who were intentionally rude to both me and my father who was in a wheelchair. At one point, I was confused about how to enable my father's entry into the chapel and attempted to walk down an open path to investigate whether or not there was a ramp. At this point, a Yeoman Warder physically came up and shoved me asking me ""where do you think you're going?"" Shocked (and rattled at having my personal space so suddenly and violently invaded), I explained the situation and he was incredibly rude in response telling me that no one was allowed into the chapel. A few moments later, he gestured to a horde of people to enter but wouldn't let us. My father and I both felt humiliated. From what I can gather, Yeomen are bullies who enjoy dressing up and abusing their modicum of artificial power in whatever small ways they can get away with. Disgusting.",Rude beefeater ruined our visit
"July 23, 2018","We visited Tower of London together with guests from overseas. In our group there were 3 adults and 3 teenagers. We speak good English and live in UK for long, guests speak some English.We were in need of the toilet, actually one of our guest was. After waiting in the queue to attraction, checking in and passing bag search we landed in a crowded place.My husband asked one of beefeaters that was standing just next to us 'Excuse me, where the nearest toilet is, please?'. THE BEEFEATER didn't hear him. There was a crowd around us, it was very loud. So my husband asked louder again. No reaction. After few times, THE BEEFEATER turned to us and said or rather shouted to my husband that this place is his home and my husband has no manners, that my husband has to say 'excuse me and please' and that in THIS COUNTRY you need manners! We were in shock. Crowd around us stopped and looked at the 'scene' too. THE BEEFEATER asked my husband if he wants to leave right now or is he going to behave better. He even stopped one staff member for help, maybe to have a witness? What a ridiculous incidents.I tried to calm down THE BEEFEATER asking what we can do to calm the situation down. My husband wasn't going to apologise - he did not do anything wrong. We just entered 'the tourist attraction'... Maybe this is the hot weather in London and thick clothing that make poor BEEFEATERS tired of guests? Anyway this one person ruined our experience for the rest of time in Tower of London. Our guest plus teenagers couldn't just believe in what happened. It doesn't matter now the history which is exposed in Tower of London. For me THE CULTURE of this one person was everything I experienced in Tower of London. My second thought was that THE BEEFEATER felt offended by answering a question about the toilet location. Sorry, there was no instructions on Tower entrance of what you can speak to BEEFEATER about.",Essential to Visit (of course)
"July 8, 2018","We spent 5 hours touring the Tower, and did not even get to the Crown Jewels tour -- it was fascinating.  The staff is knowledgeable and very interested in helping visitors by providing historical context -- but they are not intrusive, and offer information only when asked.  Our teenage son never tired of the experience, but I would advise against bringing young children, who might quickly become weary of the time spent there.  To avoid long lines (and they form rapidly!) buy your tickets in advance (online) and arrive at 9:30am for the first entry at 10 o'clock.","Overcrowded in summer, best time in winter !"
"July 28, 2016","I visted London and Great Britain the first time in the 1970ies when I was a youngstudent at a school in Germany. I enjoyed to vist many interesting places in London, and I recommend you to vist the Tower of London! It is really worth to  visit it.I enjoyed to travel all over London and all over GB. That was not my first and only visit, but I have travelled several times to London and to U.K. in the last 40 years!I'm a fan of this phantastic city of London!",Overcrowded and overrated
"October 27, 2014","Given it's widespread fame, history and World Heritage status the tower of london usually falls generically on many tourists' london 'to do lists', myself included. I visited with my partner on Monday the 27th of October 2014. Given largely positive reviews through word of mouth and tripadvisor (which places it as number 47 of 1033 things to do in london) we had high expectations of the day but were grossly disappointed with this probably being the worst thing we have done in our 4 weeks in England.The most dominant issue is that the tower was far too overcrowded and highly unregulated. This is a combination of it's long term status as a tourist hotspot but I would also speculate that there may be a spike in local tourism numbers due to the 888 thousand odd red poppies which are currently being placed around the tower to commemorate the deaths of British and colonial troops in WW1.  In addition and unknowingly to me this week is autumn school holidays. The result? Madness! Getting to the tower at opening representing a scene similar to a stadium post football match with thousands gathering around just to photograph the poppies. Once we waded through there was a 35 minute wait for tickets, followed by a 25minute wait to get into the entrance. Booking online can secure you fast-tracked entry and 1 pounds off pricing but unless you physically have the tickets you have to line up at another register to get them, which had a queue just as long. Once inside the lines continued with a 25 minute wait for the white tower and a 30 minute wait for the torture tower. Overall we spent 5 hours here of which 2 hours was spent in queues. We didn't end up seeing the crown jewels as the queue spanned easily around 250m (snaked around the castle) and would've taken 2 hours as it moved very slowly. Despite the increasingly busy crowds there is limited representative of staff who don't regulate the often perplexing queue lines which snaked around in a disorganized fashion. As a result numerous frustrated/rude tourists make their best efforts to exploit polite English manner and skipped in successfully which further fueled my frustration.The attractions internally seem a little underwhelming to my eyes, although this may be reflective of my previous visits to other England castles such as Leeds Castle, Arundel and Bodiam which all far and away were much nicer and better presented, not to mention had 10% the number of tourists. The displays present weren't able to be fully appreciated as crowds poured through unregulated in number (except in white tower), often with children jumping on the exhibits. They also seemed to be more targeted towards children which is probably in fitting with the theme park environment that appeared to have been created.The price for adults was 22 pounds at the door or 21 pounds online, although this includes a 'donation' which you can easily opt out of, which brings the price down to 20 pounds or 19 pounds respectively. Children are half this price and seniors/full time student/disabled get a small reduction in price. Is it expensive? Yes, but hey that's England.Overall, I found this whole day to be exceptionally frustrating. This was largely a reflection of the crowds and resultant queues and inability to appreciate the castle and it's displays but reading through TA it seems like this is a recent exacerbation of long term pre-existing overcrowding. Would I recommend it to others? Not off today's experience. My only hope is that this is largely because of the crowds. If you did choose to come I would definitely recommend booking online in advance and arriving just as the castle opens. Once it opens I would go to the crown jewels to avoid inevitable queues, followed by the torture tower and white tower before viewing the rest of the attraction. Personally, I wouldn't be back and I won't be recommending it to others.",very interesting - go for a guided tour!
"April 28, 2011","we went to Tower of London on Easter Friday - appearently the busiest day of the year but it wasn't as crowded as we'd expected.The yeoman (beefeater) guide had a great sense of humor and told a lot of fascinating tales of the Tower of London - not only dry facts - so I really recommend the 1 hour guided tour both to kids and adults.We followed the guided tour at 10 o'clock which was the first of the day and I think that was wise as the place just got more and more busy. We went straight for the crown jewels after that and didn't even stand in line for 5 minutes before we were let in - however 1 hour later it was very busy (so I recommend that you go there as early in the day as possible).You can buy food and drink on the premises but there are also several cafees + KFC just outside the entrance where you can buy take-away for the little park across the street or the path along the river Thames. TIP: you can also cross Tower bridge, turn right and find a great pub just 5-10 minutes along the Thames: they serve both drinks and meals and have inside + outside seating.When you visit Tower of London you are just steps away from Tower Bridge. It's also fascinating and worth a stroll (if your legs aren't too tired)...",Really disappointed!
"January 4, 2009","I was really disappointed with my trip to the Tower of London. I brough my australian relatives along and told them it would be worth the money. As we arrived we took our photograph with a beefeater and a giant teddy bear at the gift shop. We queued up for the 'bloody tower' for an hour and when we entered, saw plastic versions of how they used to punish people in the tower. We went down one staircase to see this, and then back up and we were straight back outside. What a waste of time! We even went back to see if there was anything else because it was just impossible! But, we thought, at least there are still the crown jewels. The queue was 2 and a half hours long, and we didn't have time, so we couldn't go there (that's obviously not the tower's fault, just a shame!) Then we went in some other tower (not sure on the name) and we kept going round and round the staircases until we were quite high up and saw some plastic horses, a suit of armor and a couple of axes and then we had to go down and down and round and round the same staircases. We wandered around for ages after this looking for something interesting to see. We saw some little water gate thing, the ravens and that was about it. Then it shut and we had to leave! I don't know if it is just that we missed the main attractions when we wandering around or what. But it certainly wasn't worth spending my money on!",Great place to visit
"October 24, 2007","In my opinion, one of the best places in London to visit. The outside is photo-worthy with areas to sit and just relax if you want. The inside is broken up into a couple of different areas that you can go to. There are tours that you can take (free) on set intervals starting from the bridge at the entrance and they last for maybe 45 minutes. The tour is ok, but it skips over some of the larger buildings such as the White Tower. There is a lot of walking and a lot of stairs, so be prepared.If you wanted to look at everything it could probably last 3-4 hours so budget accordingly. Saying that, a fair bit of it is old weapons and war related material that you may not be too interested in. However, the guys can look at the guns and the girls can look at the crown jewels, win/win situation! You can also take pictures here, unlike many other London places where they prohibit it.If you want to avoid the line-ups remember that you can buy tickets in advance on line.",Over priced and not informative
"May 31, 2007","I visited the Tower on Bank Holiday with my partner and a friend.  We paid £16 each and seemed to get very little for this.  There was very little information anywhere because they want you to pay even more for a guide book or audio tour.  You can join a tour if you have time but there were huge crowds for this and long queues for the Bloody Tower.  We were conveyor belted past a series of crowns with just the name next to them '1937 Imperial State Crown' but no other information.  The same was true of St.Pauls, Westminster Abbey and other sights.  They are all such amazing buildings which are part of all of our heritage and yet they seem to be run purely as a money making enterprise.  I cannot see how a family can spend an entire day here ( I am a History teacher and 2 hours was enough for me) yet the high price is justified because it is a 'day out'.",A Must See in London!!
"December 12, 2006","I love the Tower. There's just so much to see! A lot of history and you can tell/feel that in there with all the Kings' heads, traitor's gate and all that. Admission is £15 and it's all worth it. Don't forget to take the Beafeater tour (included in the admission).",It was a lot more interesting than I expected
"June 27, 2006","...especially since i really hate museums, galleries and the like. I decided to visit the tower of london after reading some good reviews on this site - and i'm glad i did. it was very interesting. it can easily take up a whole day. too bad i only had a short time to spend there so i missed a lot of narrated stories by the beefeaters, I would definitely reccomend for you to go there if you have never been.",Great Tour!
"September 27, 2023","We really enjoyed this tour!   The Tower is large, so plan on spending a few hours here.   It took us about 4 hours total.  We opted for the Beefeater tour first followed by the self guided audio tour.  It would have taken longer had we read everything there was to read, as there was so much information to take in!  The Beefeater was funny and entertaining with his stories.   We did have a hard time hearing him a few times as we weren’t close enough but I would still recommend doing that part of the tour prior to the rest of the Tower.   I was surprised they charged an additional fee for the headsets/audio tour but it was helpful.  Highly recommend!",Beware of booking on TripAdvisor
"December 28, 2019","I give this a terrible rating due to my experience with Tripadvisor.  TA sold me tickets for Tower of London for Christmas Eve 2019. I was told that it was opened on x-mas eve when I booked it the month+ before.  Lo and behold, when I got there with my family, THE EXHIBIT WAS CLOSED!. I am disappointed with TA and I am feeling crossed. I expect them to have known this exhibit would be closed on x-mas eve since they were the ticketing agent, and at the very least told me before my trip so I could I would have made other plans.  But instead, I had to find out that it was closed as I was reading the sign in front of the Tower regarding the x-mas eve closure.  I would have loved to review this exhibit if I was able to see it. Thanks TA for the screw up.  I will try to get a refund and make another report on the experience.  TA will probably not post this review.",The line ride!
"January 12, 2012","Okay, I know full well I'm in the tiny, tiny minority because I didn't love my time in the Tower.I'd like to apologize up front. Honestly, I believe that my sub-par experience is probably my fault: I went during the middle of the day, and if I'd been more dedicated I would've gone right when the Tower opened, or perhaps late in the day as the crowds began to head home. I fully admit my culpability in this.That being said...With the crowds found at mid-day during a holiday week, the Tower became un-visitable. Yes, it was open. Sure, we could get tickets and enter -- but we shouldn't have.Instead of exploring and seeing the various (presumably) fascinating displays, objects, and rooms, you found yourself part of a human conga line. If you stepped out of the line you might never find your way back in -- and since every indoors attraction in the Tower is one-way-only, the only way out is to stay in your line, shuffling along like Oliver Twist waiting for his gruel.Not fun. Seriously.The White Tower was the least crowded, but the most egregious, of these attractions. It's an astonishing collection. More armor than you can shake a stick at. But there came a point (after, I think, the eighth or ninth room filled with armor displays) when I suddenly hit some tipping point, and began to wonder -- ""When do we reach the amazing egress?""Turns out, not for a while. Once you decide you're kind of tired of a particular theme, you're in *big* trouble at the Tower. Short of someone starting a fire so you can use the emergency exits, you've got no choice but to muddle on through. Because the only way out is forward. Look, I realize how amazing and unique and incalculably valuable are the objects on display in the Tower. It's just... Well... Perhaps those objects might benefit from a road trip? I found I was hitting armor fatigue, among other things, and would've welcomed a more varied collection. Surely some museums out there might work out a lend-lease deal? Lend-lease, after all, has worked for the British in the past...With fewer folks, I'm sure things would've been a lot more fun. What's more, with fewer folks, I'm sure the Tower could've been designed more free-form. I don't know the solution, but I'd be happy to pay more if it meant I could slow down, enjoy things more, and not think I was holding up a line as long as any I've ever stood in.Sadly, I can't comment on the Beefeater tour -- our seven-year-old was too short for it. All he could see was the butts of various adults surrounding him, so he quickly begged us to ditch the tour. I could see where he was coming from, and went along with it, even though I was thoroughly enjoying the Beefeater's presentation.",Write them in Advance for Free Extra-Special Tickets!!
"September 17, 2011","If you write to the Tower (the address is on their website) asking for special tickets for the Ceremony of the Keys, they will send you free tickets for up to six people. These allow you to be admitted after-hours for this somber & ancient ceremony that has been going on EVERY night for 800 years. We wrote three months in advance and still got tickets for peak season. They needed all of our names, I imagine so MI5 could run background checks on us. (Well, that's what I told the kids, anyway)!There were only about two dozen of us allowed in at about 9 pm when the grounds were deserted. One of the Beefeaters escorted us back to the White Tower and told some wonderful tales, which are even more impressive at that time of night.At a few minutes before 10 pm. the ceremony begins, a ceremony that was only late once- during a WW II bombing of London. The keys are brought out and given to the night guard at the stroke of 10. The ceremony is quite elaborate, and at the end we all got to answer the night guard with ""God Save the Queen.""  We felt like we were a part of history. Absolutely fantastic for the kids. Also, it's not for show- the guns are all loaded. After all, this is the safehouse for royalty and the crown jewels as well as other priceless objects are here. You will still want daytime visit tickets. We bought ours online and went there late in the day and picked them up. They're good for a few days so we just came back the next day, thus avoiding the massive lines at the ticket window.",Don't bother!
"April 22, 2011","Really really disappointed by the Tower of London.  We took our 2 children aged 10 and 7 during the Easter holidays and they were bored to death!  The queue for the crown jewels was massive and didn't get any shorter during the time we were there, so we gave it a miss.  ""Torture at the Tower"" consisted of a room displaying 2 instruments of torture and some information boards which took less than 2 minutes to read - not worth the half an hour we queued.  Some interesting things on display in the white tower, but apart from that nothing to justify the entrance fee.  Disappointed that there was nothing going on for the children to get involved in.",Great day out at Tower of London
"February 1, 2009","We arrived at 9am so went straight to the Crown Jewels. We had the room to ourselves, virtually, which was great because we could view the jewels as many times as we liked on the conveyor belt. We then waited for a Yeoman Warder tour which was highly entertaining. Dave was our guide and was fantastic- informative, funny, happy to pose for photos, just brilliant! We got to see inside the chapel, too, which I believe doesn't happen all the time.I recommend going early and allowing about 4 hours to see everything. When we arrived there were only 4-6 other people there. when we left there were queues.Loved every minute!",Best day out in London
"October 10, 2008","My wife and I pre-booked our tickets to the Tower of London with 365tickets.com, which saved us a few quid on the price offered by buying direct.  We printed off as much info as we could on the official website which was very useful, especially the map and the suggested tour.  We did the Beefeater tour first which is a great way to start (every half hour), our guide Kevin was excellent and made a great day out even better!  We then saw the crown jewels and the ravens, then did the white tower tour (see the info online for all the tour times), then wondered around the magnificent towers taking loads of photos.  Paid my usual visit to the coffee shop which was good too.  There are suggested tours on their web page depending on the time you have, we did roughly the 3 hour tour and a bit more, and spent an excellent 5 hours in total.  Deserves to be rated the best day trip in London, as it is certainly the best one I have ever done.",Greatest attraction in the city
"August 23, 2008","As many have stated here, the Tower of London is the city’s greatest attraction. Almost a thousand years of history (much of it bloody) from William the Conqueror to Nazi Rudolf Hess is here on display in the many buildings that make up this complex. Its various incarnations as a royal palace, observatory, fortress, prison, armory, execution site and home of the Crown Jewels means that this is no ordinary historical tour. The Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) who lead the tours live on the grounds of the Tower with their families and as you can imagine are incredibly knowledgeable about the people and events that shaped the Tower. They stage many special events here as well. When we last visited, a jousting tournament was held just outside the gates which was spectacular. If you have the time, write in advance for tickets to see the Ceremony of the Keys, where the Yeoman Warders lock up the Crown Jewels at night. It is a tradition that goes back centuries and is viewed each night by only a select few.",A Must See When In London
"May 23, 2008","Where to start? The Tower of London contains nearly 1,000 years of history within it's foreboding structure. This location is one of the most popular tourist attractions in England. It is also, alledgedly, the most haunted location in the world, according to various paranormal experts. My wife and I while on honeymoon here, experienced some rather odd events, that I will describe in some detail shortly.    The Tower of London encompesses a vast land mass that dates back to the start of Londinum, as originaly named by the invading Roman army. This particular location has been the site of many tragedies, ranging from famous behidings to the murders of two royal family teenage boys. The last executions beign from the early 1940s of WWII German-Nazi spies. Many American during our Revolutionary War were held captive here. The history here is not only verbal and read, but experienced by the average tourist on a daily basis. I personaly have experienced this.   Wear comfy walking shoes or sneakers, and allow at least three to four hours at minimum to tour this tower.  Yes, it is pricey, particuarly if you are a fellow American, but again, this is a must see location. The weaponary, located in the armory was worth the price of admission alone for me. Viewing the actualy suits of armor that the various kings of England worse centuries ago, was mind blowing. Of course, the crown jewles collection is enticing, but as I understand it, these jewles are replicas of the actualy jewles, which are held offsite. There is an aditional one pound admission fee to enter the crown jewles exhibit. I thought that it would make more sense to simply add the one pound into the overall admission fee. There are many steps to climb if you desire to see the upper levels of the various tower's buildigns and perimiter.    There are plenty of restrooms and a few areas to have a bit of lunch, etc. The beefeater (these are the tower's guards), tours last on average 55 minutes, and are included in the general price of admission. There was some construction occurign when we were there last May of 2007, that may have since been removed now. I gathered that with the age of this location, perpetualy preservation construction will occur. There is a tube stop located next to this location. Adjacent to the tower is the famous ""London""bridge, which is actualy not the actualy London bridge, but the famous ornate bridge we American's view in photos and beileve to be the bridge! Are you confused yet?! Traitor's gate is a forebodign spot within the walls of the tower-the location were many an unfortunate prisoner saw the last of the City of London and the Thames River.    Now, for my paranormal experience here. A disclaimer, I have never seen a ghost, heard a ghost, spoke to a ghost, etc. However, what occured to both my wife and I was rather odd, and of interest to some. Just prior to crossing the ""London""Bridge to enter the grounds of the T.O.L.-my new digital camera suddenly ceased working. The battery was fully charged, so I entered another charged battery...it started working again, then ceased when we entered the T.O.L.grounds. Finally, and suddenly, it started working again. As soon as we arrived at the tower, clouds gathered above, on what was a very sunny day, untilt hat point. Granted, this is not uncommon in London, the weather can change drasticaly at times. Next, the spiked fence, located around the far exterior of the tower both tore my wife and I'd left arms clothing open. This occured within a few minutes of one another's experience, as walked towards the admission ticket building. Both of us without explanation felt pushed into the fence. I am not fabricating this, it occured to both of us.     Finally, before purchasing our tickets, we entered the two-storied merchandise building, where I began to cough and choke, for the better part of 15 minutes to 20 minutes...it occured without warning, I was not sick, nor eating or drinking anything at that time. The experience ceased, as quickly as it initaly occured. What was even more bizzarre was while inside the tower, while my wife was reading a book on the London black plague, she informed that those with the plaque would choke to death on their mucas! A similar experience, albeit not tot he point of fatality, that I had just experienced! That gave me the chills, after hearing my wife telling me this. We did not experiece anythign else remotley as strange as this prior or since. A true believe it or not experience.    Do not miss the Tower of London while visiting London; particuarly on your first visit to this world class city. Also, beware of the ravens, nevermore........",Do not do the audio guided tour
"June 2, 2007","Tower of London was one of the sites I was especially looking forward to visiting.  Unfortunately, we didn't give ourselves enough time to comfortably see this historic site, so we felt rushed.  I wish I had done some studying prior to our visit, so at least I could have felt oriented.  There is a lot to see within the walls, so we purchased the audio guided tour.  It was a huge disappointment.  The tiny map they give you to follow the audio tour did NOT correspond to the larger/clearer/colored map you get at the entrance.  We had to go back and forth between the two maps.  Also, the audio tour did NOT follow a logical path around the site, and it had us turning in circles, trying to figure out what we were supposed to be looking at. We gave up on it after about 25 minutes.We rushed through the Medieval Palace.  Except for a fake looking bedroom chamber, it was mostly bare.  But the history and age of the place was still impressive!  We spent some time in the White Tower.  It's mostly a display of armor and weapons. It also contains a nice chapel.  Then we saw the crown jewels.  Not really my thing, but we were happy we saw them. Then the small Beauchamp Tower -- the most fascinating part for me.  There was a queue at the Bloody Tower, so we skipped that.Closing times were supposed to be 17:30 for internal buildings and 18:00 for the grounds, but they were kicking us out of the buildings by 17:00 and literally corralling us off the grounds at 17:30.  One of the warders was very rude to my mom when, at 17:25, she asked nicely if she could take his photo.I would say it is worth seeing the Tower of London, but (1) give yourself at least 3 hours, (2) do some studying beforehand if you are interested in the history and want to get the most out of your visit, (3) do NOT purchase the audio guided tour.Our experience was 3 stars, but since part of that was our fault, I'm giving it 4 stars.",A Terrific Place!
"April 29, 2006","We were so thrilled with the Tower of London.  Not only was the whole place filled with wonderful history but the guide added so much to the tour - knowledgable, funny and incredably charismatic.....A++ for him as well!  We spent a good four hours and had an excellent Yorkshire Pudding in the cafe......super!",A must see while in London
"July 1, 2004","I visited the Tower of London in Feb 2004 and on 6/21/04. The first time I did not go in because there was major construction on the gorunds and there were lots of barriers that made it difficult to move around the outside areas.  When I returned in June, the barriers were mostly gone and it was much easier to walk around the Tower's outside area.  I took the tube to the Tower Hill station and the Tower of London was across the street; easy to get to.  The adult admission ticket was 13.50 pounds but it is worth it.  I got there around 930am to avoid the crowds and there were moderate size crowds at that time but by the time I left at around 1pm, the place was swarming with people. There are regular guided tours that are given by the beefeaters.  I ended up jumping in and out of these tour groups throughout the grounds. There are CD players/headsets for rent that permit a self guided tour.  There is a great deal of history behind the walls of the Tower of London.       I easily spent 3hrs walking around the place and could have stayed longer had the weather not turned sour (rain/heavy winds).  My favorite attractions were the White Tower, St Peter Chapel, Bloody Tower and Wakefield Tower.  When I was climbing the Bloody Tower stairs, an elderly couple ahead of me had trouble on the stairs.  The stairs in some of the towers are very steep, winding and narrow so kiddies and the elderly may have some trouble climbing these.  Photography is generally permitted except in the chapel and parts of the White Tower and not permitted in the Crown Jewels house. The tours are worth the admission- the Beefeaters and staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable.",So good i cried!
"March 23, 2004","I can't even begin to explain this place, so I am not going to except to say that you MUST visit The Tower Of London. We took some of the tours offered for free and we cried (I am 22 and my friend is 23) we just could not believe the history in this place. The ""beef-eaters"" are amazingly friendly, and that goes for the whole staff. The only dissapointing thing was the food, but who cares about that! You will be really moved by this place and it is the best attraction in the world!",Exceeded Our Expectations!
"September 25, 2023","Tower of London greatly exceeded our expectations!  There were so many interesting things to see and learn about.  We started our experience with the Yeoman Warder tour which was incredible, the level of history we learned and the pride of our Yeoman Warder guide was incredible.  The Crown Jewels were beautiful to see and we went on a Thursday morning so there was no wait.  The on-site chapel and the White Tower had some very impressive pieces.  The history of the place was so breathtaking.  We would highly recommend it!",Full of history and worth a visit
"April 24, 2023","A place full of history. You can explore the castle on your own or take guided tour with a Yeoman Warden which is included in your ticket take place every 30 Mins. We opted for the Yeoman Warden option and glad we did. Our warden was Lawrence Watts.  Fabulously entertaining, funny and full of facts about the history of the Tower. After the guided tour you are free to wander. There are a lot of stairs so know your limits. Toilets onsite, as well as gift shops. Recommend to others.",Must see
"December 30, 2019","Spent 6hrs walking around this famous landmark and would highly recommend it.There is queuing for the world famous Crown Jewels don’t be put of by the length of the queue it go pretty quickly even if it seem like hours.We took the option of a yeoman guide to get an understanding of the history of the castle this last for approx 45 mins to 1 hour.After this you spend your own time walking around the different towers,armoury,royal mint,prison,torture tower,chapel and of course the Crown Jewels.There is a cafe and restaurant reasonably priced inside the tower area and toilets.",Beautiful

"July 27, 2018","Absolutely worth visiting. So much to see, including a live Presentation of the Beheading of Anne Boleyn.The Crown Jewels were unbelieveable, so much Gold, so opulent.Allow at least 3-4 hours for a leisurely visit. We went in JULY 2018, their Summer, it was a record heat of 30-32 degrees. ",Wow; just wow...
"May 15, 2018","Spike was our Beefeater guide in this place of incredible history, and he was amazing. I've visited the Tower of London before, without a guide, and missed out on the key details of this amazing place. The incredible violence and intrigue that went on here rivals any spot in the world, and getting the history live as you walk through is an unparalleled experience. Make sure you also check out Mint Street and the coin exhibit, and of course, the Crown Jewels (check out the punch bowl and ladle) and a trip up the Tower. Not to be missed. ",Good - not great
"August 17, 2017","The Tower of London is worth a visit, but don't expect to be blown away.  It is good; not great.  Plan accordingly.",Bizarre experience -- very unfriendly staff
"June 12, 2017","I am an American tourist and artist.  Visited the Tower today and had a bizarre experience with a very unfriendly staffer. I was standing in the little park area near the river painting a view of the Tower when a woman named Dipa Bhatt came out and told me that artists are not allowed in the vicinity of the Tower. At first she said I was blocking the road (which I wasn't), but when I asked if there was a better place she said no, artists are not allowed anywhere in the vicinity. I've called around London and there are no specific ordinances or laws against painting outdoors so have no idea what this was about. I've visited London often and never had a bad experience or encountered anyone at the attractions who were unfriendly.",Way more than I expected
"August 15, 2014","This is certainly a place worth your visit. It's a collection of dozens of buildings and towers, each with historical exhibitions inside. We easily spent 3 hours here. Plus, you get great views of Tower Bridge while you're walking around the Wall Walk.Here are my suggestions for a pleasant visit: 1) Purchase tickets online ahead of time and have them mailed to you, so you can skip the entire ticket line and walk right in. There was a small processing fee added to the pre-order, but it was absolutely worth it. 2) Go on a weekday (if possible). 3) Get there right at opening time. I mean, get there 5 minutes before it opens. 4) Walk directly to the Crown Jewels building and visit there first. 5) Then, go to the White Tower and see the floors and floors of exhibitions inside there. 6) After that, do whatever strikes your fancy (Beefeater tour, exploring the other towers, having lunch, walking the wall walk).We did exactly what I suggested above and didn't wait at all, nor were we herded through any of the major buildings. There was a bit of a line (not even 10 minutes) to get through some of the smaller towers, but by this point it was almost noon so there were a lot more people in the complex.","Must-See, But ..."
"January 3, 2014","... Disappointing.  That's the best way I can describe the Tower of London.  This is one of those sites that you must see while visiting London.  It is so much a part of the London experience that if you sidestep this attraction you'll leave feeling you've missed something.  That said, the Tower of London left me feeling disappointed.The Tower is a self-guided experience.  There are numerous and informative placards throughout the buildings and the grounds.  You can linger in areas of interest, and move quickly through areas that fail to hold your attention.The highlghts of the Tower experience are the crown jewels, the torture chamber and the armory.  All are interesting and help tell the story of England's history.My disappointment came from the commercial feel of the Tower grounds.  Clearly there has been a lot of work done to restore the castle, and understandably so.  However, it takes away from the historical feel of the Tower, especially if when compared to other historical sites that remain true to their historical roots.  The experience reminded me of the Renaissance Festival ... Medieval times as seen through the eyes of 21st century reenactors.  It just has a false and commerical feel to it.",London tower with london pass
"November 5, 2013","Just recently visited the london tower using the london pass. The tower itself was ok, and yes worth the visit. The lines for the Crown Jewels was long and ok.. I saw them and were impressive. I happened to be there on a Holiday week for Europeans along with children out of school. Not a good time to tour, but my only window of time for travelling London.Still,London was worth the effort...What a amazing city of sights and attractions to fill ones days of never ending things to see or do. A great city full of never ending energy.My main reason for writing this review is to like others who have suggested is to question the purchasing of the London Pass and London dining Pass. In which I did and afterwards, did not have too...and over paid for attractions now seen after the trip it seems. I could have just paid seperately for each entry and would have paid less! Why? Unless, you are the type of person who can run from one entry to another in their book antractions at least cover 6 attractions within the book within 3 days of their Pass Book...really not worth it! You will also be within an attraction for some length of time, walking, taking pictures, and taking in the free entry attractions as well. The ""British Museum"" which is free and a wonder in itself could be used for one day entirely for it alone! Unbelievable Museum full of world wide artifacts of ancient times! I have been to the Lourve in Paris..and many other museums in Europe...this museum takes second next to the Lourve in my opinion. So? add it all up...costs for the London Pass Card and time for all other attractions...unless you can run! in and out of all the listed wonders...you will see like myself...Pass for two? I overpaid! I used it for 4 attractions only..And? the Dining Card? Forget it! First you have to find the places to eat. When I did find one ...I was told it did not work for this mid week day? Then, when I did eat at a place in the book "" Mela""...Was told I had to order two starters? and then two main dishes...and then?..cost me more to eat there than purchasing dinners on my own! Yes, dinning in London is and can be expensive ...like all of London. I ate at two pubs that had ok food with a great British local feeling atmosphere, and paid less than using the card with its' added rules. "" The Bag of Nails "" near Victoria Underground had a fun atmosphere and good food. Also, "" The Museum Pub"" across from the British Museum was good.I hope that I helped some travellers who are considering the London Pass or Dinning card? If I return to London, I would not purchase either...and would consider other un costly options. Just get a tube pass and go! Lots to see and do in London..Yes, a great city to see in ones Lifetime...but, a costly one also. The British Pound will pound you! but, worth it...smilesTravelling Rig..Usa..CaliforniaPs? Please excuse quick review with non editing...spelling, etc...I hope tripadvisor does? My first time review..On the run here...travelling",Only visit if you truly interested in English history
"April 29, 2012","If you have read my previous reviews, i normally give tips and advice to travellers. Therefore I am going to give you top tips for visiting Tower of London.Tip 1: As per title of my review, only visit this site if you are truly interested in history of Britain. Tip 2: Admission fee is £21.50 (including £1 donation fee) therefore please make sure you tell the cashier whether you want to make the donation or not. We didnt make a donation.Tip 3: Food like hot sandwiches and coffees are quite expensive in the Tower so make sure you eat before you visit the Tower.Tip 4: There is a free tour walk done by the beefeater (not sure if they were?) every 30 minutes and i highly recommend you to take the tour because its very informative. Tip 5: Make sure when you enter the Tower, go straight to the Crown Jewel museum because it always get very busy when the free tour walk finishes.Tip 6: If you want to save a bit of money and grab something cheap to eat, there is a Subway store outside of the Tower.If you think my reviews are awesome and helpful, click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?'

"September 9, 2010","The Tower is one of the ""must see"" places in London, hence very crowded. The best way to avoid queues is to visit in the morning or use a London Pass which entitles to a free entry from the group entrance. After getting in you can have a free map in different languages, but it is really worth to catch a guided tour which starts every hour near the main entrance. The guide is one of Yeoman warders who walks the group around the place telling a lot of funny and interesting stories related to the history of the Tower. After the tour is over it is possible to see indoor exhibits, however some of them like the Crown Jewels House requires a lot of waiting to get in. In case of limited time, take a walk over the walls where one of the towers exhibits copies of some of the crown jewels.",One of London's must visit attractions
"March 27, 2010","The Tower of London was made for a really enjoyable afternoon out. After reading other reviews we had heard about the Yeoman tour, so decided to start our visit with this tour and we were not disappointed; it was absolutely brilliant. The Yeoman warder tour guide was funny, informative and answered all of our questions - and really made the first 50-60 minutes of our visit enjoyable. The tour included a visit to the Tower of London Chapel - which seemed to only be closed off unless you were with a guide. The Tower itself is a national icon; full of history and culture with each of its many rooms and buildings telling its own story. The audio tour was good and worth doing, as it keeps you occupied and interested for around 2 hours.If you go to London, make sure you go to the Tower!",Had a few unfortunate circumstances...
"October 13, 2009","To be sure, a visitor to London can't miss the Tower. I'd recommend it to everybody. With that said, my own trip to the Tower was marked by a few disappointments. On the day that we went, it was pouring rain. This being London, we decided to not let the rain stop us, and went ahead regardless. The rain does, however, stop the Beefeaters, apparently. Ours took us only to the Chapel, and gave us a brief and nearly inaudible historic summary. Left without a guided tour, we turned to the audio guides, which were great, but lengthy. I knew this attraction would be extensive, but I didn't realize it would take 5 hours! Be sure to leave yourself time so you don't feel rushed. Also, since the day was so wet, we couldn't sit down. Almost all the seating in the complex is outdoors, and these were soaked. My 60-something parents were really hurting by the middle of our stay. While we were visiting, the White Tour housed the Henry VIII: Dressed to Kill exhibit in honor of his 500th birthday. It was a really well-done exhibit, though the thoroughly modern displays detracted a bit from the historic feeling of this oldest part of the tower complex. Plus, it was packed. Be prepared for LOTS of people in that tower, all going up and down narrow stairways together. We did do well to follow previous reviewers' advice and go straight to the Crown Jewels first thing. By doing that section first, we had the jewels almost all to ourselves, which was a great experience. All in all, the Tower is certainly a world-class sight. You may, however, want to check your weather forecast and try to pick a drier day than we did.",Pricey but worth it!
"April 4, 2009","Last weekend I went to the tower with my family including 7 year old grandson.  These tips from previous posters were helpful:1.  Go as EARLY as you can get your family moving2.  Definitely start with the Yeoman Warder [Beefeater] tour, even if the group is large they speak loudly and ours [Bob] invited all the kids up front.  It's included in the ticket price and gives you a good orientation to the history and the various buildings inside the complex.3.  Get your tickets ahead of time from 365tickets.com, you'll save a little money and also pick up from the group line which is much shorter.4. Eat a Wagamama, a Japanese noodle chain right outside the complex.Yes, it's expensive but you learn about the history of London going back 1000 years, and you are also right there on the Thames river with a good view of Tower Bridge and the HMS Belfast.",A London Must See...But Pricey
"March 6, 2009","Our Hotel (The Tower) was right next door, so it was a easy to walk to 'Must See'.Firstly costs - Our first reaction was £32 for 2 adult tickets was a tad expensive, especially as a guide book was another £4.95, and an audio tour was another £4.00 per person, but on the plus side we easily spend 4 hours there, and it is incredibly interesting.We had lunch in the Restaurant which again was relatively costly, although the food was nice. They seemed a little under pressure and had no Forks or Spoons, and started handing out plastic ones, and they weren't that busy.We didn't take any of the Tours available, preferring to wander with the map and take our time. There is plenty of information printed on all the sights around the Tower to provide a good basic story of the Tower and its History. Nice shop too, but very few of the items for sale were Specific to the Tower.",An amazing building and a must visit!
"January 20, 2009","This attraction cost about 17 pounds for an adult. I bought an additional audio guide for only 4 pounds. I found the audio guides to be a bit slow moving for me. I would also rather they not include ""first-hand"" accounts.The tower fort is quite impressive even entering the first gate. I caught up with a Yeoman Warder tour when I first entered. It was good but did not last too long. I was told these tours usually last 60 minutes. I'm not sure if it was because of the season or something else. He really only talked about the moat, traitors gate (water lane/water gate), white tower, tower green and the Chapel Royal. It was a good informative and funny tour but shorter than I expected. That was when I decided to purchase the audio guide.I ran out of time at the Tower. You really need 2-3 hours to discover it all. The crowing jewel of this location was, well, the crown jewels. Thankfully, because it was January there were fewer tourists. I was able to not wait in line at all to see them. They have it set up like a disney ride. The queue is long and winding (or could be if crowded) but there are plaques for each royal in one room and 3 seperate rooms with videos that pertain to the jewels. One is Queen Elizabeth II's procession to become the queen. Another describes the jewels that are in the collection, including the names and stories of some of the famous jewels. After that, it is into the vault to see them. They truly are amazing. My favorite was the gold punch bowl. It was huge.Definitely a must see when you visit London!",Top 5 place to see in London
"June 22, 2018","Fantastic tour (do the Beefeater led tour once you are inside....no extra cost & totally worth it)!  Crown jewels, huge ravens that live in the courtyard, awesome facts & info given by the Beefeater.....this place is a MUST see.","Great trip with a fun, engaging guide"

"March 19, 2015","There is no question that this is an iconic attraction in London, and if you have dreamed all your life of seeing it, then you should.But, so that your expectations are tempered:1. Very expensive - 25 pounds for an adult. Much farther walk from the Tube than it looks. Much colder and windier than most of London.2. At all times of year, the crowds and queues are horrendous.3. The Yeoman Warder Tour is not worth joining. It consists of a stand-up comic in costume, making cheap jokes about a variety of subjects, including ridiculing members of his audience. It is a total waste of one hour's time. Instead, go out on your own.4. The grounds consist of many essentially separate structures, and it is very hard to decide where to go. Aside from the Two Murdered Princes, all you will get (history-wise) from any of them is obscure facts and anecdotes about people you never heard of. William the Conqueror built the Tower around 1066-1090 AD after winning the Battle of Hastings, and since then, almost nothing of interest has happened here, except for the incarceration of enemies of assorted monarchs. The management should set up a Suggested Short Tour with numbered stops, and an In-Depth Historical Fanatic Tour, also numbered. Instead they leave you to your own devices.5. If you are interested in seeing the Crown Jewels, know that everyone else is, too. Though of course you have to see them now that you've paid this much to get in, you will get a number of videos first, then about one minute on a moving conveyor sweeping you by lots of crowns. You have about 5 seconds per crown. If you want to see the Kohinoor Diamond, take the closer conveyor, and it will be visible on the last crown. Washington's Smithsonian has a display of famous jewels, too, and it seems to me I got to take my time there.6. If in a group of more than 3, you might as well each go your own way, and agree exactly where and when you will meet up later. Otherwise you will just waste each other's time waiting for one of you to finish a structure.Whoever is in charge of the Tower, they need to bring in some theme-park and crowd-management expertise, so they can deliver more value to different kinds of visitor.",Give This 'Monument' A Miss
"November 4, 2014","I'd like to give this No Stars but I have to give it one to get the review published.  What a waste of £22.  The last time I visited the Tower of London, at the beginning of the 90s it was a really good experience.  We thoroughly enjoyed a guided visit with the Yeoman of the Guard, who gave us little tit bit stories at each stop; near a locked gate, a brick wall, the moat.  He managed to bring the whole visit alive.  However, this time, 8th October 2014, what a waste of time and money.  For a start, on queuing up for your expensive ticket you have to listen to the poor cashier having to repeat the same sentence again and again with, obviously, no interest in our answer 'would you like a guide with that', over a microphone so that we can hear it for the next 15 minutes.  I felt sorry for her first and then us as our experience started to tumble to a drone like feeling.  We got in to the Tower and waited at the appropriate place for the Yeoman to take us on the tour, an hour as is promised on the internet.  He arrived and due to the rain (hardly any, and he was wearing his shower proof cape anyway) he told us that the talk would be in the chapel and would only be for 30 minutes as due to the bad weather.  Ok.  We all dutifully followed in our drone like state, we arrived at the chapel and he addressed us with the news that the talk would now be for 25 minutes.  mmmmmmm!  We all piled in to the chapel and he then told us that he would speak for 20 minutes.  Whilst telling us the piddly stories of dead people under the chapel he continually looked at his watch.  Really uninteresting and a total swindle on the part of the Tower of London.  We then went to see the Crown Jewels.  What a larf!  We were led down dark corridors with lots of pictures of coronations projected on to the walls and trumpety music wafting all around us.  After a long time of shuffling along we finally got into the room with the Crown Jewels.  Unbelievably we were now transported on the moving floor so that we couldn't linger in front of each crown.  There was no history to read of, just a lot of bling.  You felt that there really is 2 worlds of the haves and have nots and how the haves have absolutely no taste or subtlety.  Unfortunately, whoever is in charge of brining this stage show in to town, went the nationalistic route and just made a mockery of any sort of seriousness as to how were the jewels are put together, who made them, what is the history of the larger jewels, how many people died in the obtaining of them - just simple things to make it a bit more profound.  On leaving you couldn't help but notice the collection box at the side.  We looked around the tacky shops and then didn't bother to look at anything else as we were completely disenchanted.  This building looks great from a distance, you do not have to pay a fortune to go inside as there is nothing of intelligence to see.  The poppies, however, were really interesting and for those that are interested, you don't have to pay to see them.  Give this 'monument' a miss!",Unjustified Money Making
"October 30, 2014","My family and me visited the Tower on 29/10/14 having pre-booked a family ticket. On arrival at about 1130, I thought the excessive queues in Tower Hill tube station were due to visitors for the poppy exhibition but the queues of people waiting to pay for admission to the Tower itself were staggering and although we had pre-booked we joined a queue that took almost 30 mins to get access. As soon as we entered the Tower we realised this was going to be a shambles. Everywhere you looked there were queues. We waited 20 mins for a Beefeater tour (which was very good) but due to the crowd this was condensed into a visit to the chapel. After that we queued for about 40 mins to enter the Torture In The Tower which turned out to be a 1 minute walk through of a tower displaying 3 poor replicas of torture instruments. The bigger torture was the queuing to get there !After that we thought we' d head for the White Tower and didn't appreciate that the crowd that wouldn't embarrass Old Trafford at full time was in fact a queue to get in. As rain was now falling and we were told the estimated wait time for entry was 90 mins we decided to explore the walls only to find that the confined space (understand that) coupled with the congestion meant moving between towers was worse than the M25 on a bad day.We dipped out and thought we'd try the Crown Jewels. You've guessed it ......1 hour minimum queue. By this time the rain was more steady so we thought we'd cut our losses and left. It was now about 1430 and as we left the ticket booths were still selling tickets which brings me to my point.The queue management outside the Tower was appalling, no-one giving directions, people queue jumping but the administrators must have been aware of the unacceptable queues for all the Tower attractions at the time we arrived but were still selling tickets to people who, before the place closed, would just spend their money queuing. An attraction such as this should serve its paying public much better than this. We saw disabled persons and infants in queues stretching right across the paved areas, unsupervised and without any regards for their needs.MONEY GRABBING IN THE NAME OF HISTORY.I'll never return",Remarkable place - fascinating history

"June 15, 2019","While the Tower of London is a must on the list of any person with an interest in English history, and while the site as such is impressing and worth a visit, just as the displays are well made, something is lacking: character. An example: One of the more interesting parts of the history of the Tower is that of the Royal Mint. The exhibit does not reflect that: it is small, and uninspiring, which means it is too small and cursory to satisfy anyone already interested in the topic, and not tempting anyone who isn't already read on the topic to learn more.A recreation of the mint works during, say, sir Isaac Newton's tenure would had been one way to make it better.The same could be said about the White Tower. Displays of armour is all well but a recreation of the interior from one or two of the more interesting periods had better tickled my fantasy.It was worth visiting, but I'm not expecting to return.",definitely worth a day or two visit
"June 12, 2019",never went because thought it was just a tourist trap - which it is - but it's also something that you have to see to believe - you can read about all the history of it but untill you see where it happened you can't really get it.  total wow!,Don’t do it
"June 5, 2019","In the 1980’s, I visited as a pre-teen when I became obsessed with British history and culture, largely based on what I had learned at the Tower.  I visited again in 1999 after college, and once again had a wonderful visit that was so informative and interesting.  This time was 100% pure chaos.  I took my teenaged niece, and intended to join a yeoman tour.  Ugh—the one starting up when we arrived had about 100 people in it!  So, we got the audio guides.  The audio guides are a complete waste of money.  Nothing is marked on the audio guide to match the building, so we never knew what button to push.  We never heard about Henry, etc. other than about his armor.The line to see the Crown Jewels had hundreds of people in it, so we bailed.My niece learned nothing beyond what I, a non-Brit, told her about Henry VIII, his wives, Lady Jane Grey, etc.  She was bored to death.  We wasted an entire London morning and plenty of GBP on this dreadful experience.There were about a million screaming children everywhere running around uncontrolled.  We visited on our last day in London, which also happened to be a bank holiday, and it really threw a pall over what had been an amazing trip up to that point.With so many other incredible places to visit in London, buy a book on British history, and skip the Tower.",April half term break
"June 3, 2019",i loved this place.  we did the official Yeoman tour which was free rather than wander around on our own and i was so glad we did.  it was so informative and the guy leading the tour was hilarious.  we booked our tickets on line prior to the visit which proved to be advantageous as the queues at the ticket office were really long.  we also saved money booking it this way.  my 8 year old really didnt want to do this but as soon as the tour started she enjoyed it.  definitely worth a visit,Scott Kelly Beefeater is awesome
"June 3, 2019","Dramatic presentation, good humor and he brings history to life! Wish the tour was longer. So many beheadings, so many queens wronged. So many outspoken people tortured. ",National embarrassment
"May 30, 2019","Today we experienced a very underwhelming visit to the Tower.  This should be an iconic landmark. The Tower is very significant in British history and let's face it, not many museums have world-famous crown jewels to work with. Because we visited with someone who has life membership of English Heritage, we did not have to pay. Fortunately. If I had wasted the amount of time on queues to buy tickets, get onto the site, get in to the crown jewels, follow the crowds to see the jewels etc etc. and then paid more than £70 for the privilege, (two adults and a child), I'd struggle to be polite!  There are lots of characters in costume, but frankly, most add little except cost.  There is an absence of engaging displays for children (Beasts of the Tower looks very tired and limited), and little guidance is provided to parents on which parts of the Tower experience might suit different age groups. The whole site feels tremendously inefficient, lacks investment in meaningful visitor experience and fails miserably at bringing history or the significance of the jewels alive (there are so many ways this could be done especially given the money collected!).  This could be an experience which really entices international visitors to visit more and explore more of the history of England.   Instead, I'm amazed that more visitors don't complain about time and money that could have been better spent!",I cancelled and was given no refund
"May 30, 2019",When you search online it has the heading Tower Of London Tickets | Cancel 24H Prior & Full Refund    but if you read the fine print it says no refund is given.   This is false advertising     horrible customer experience.   shame on trip advisor.,"Fascinating, a must see"
"May 9, 2019","Don't be scared off by the  idea of a long que. The Tower and the Crown Jewels are absolutely a must see in London. Purchase a ticket voucher online in advance, then you just go to the group ticket window and redeem the voucher for your tickets. Very quick. Do go early in the day and see the Crown Jewels first. The que gets longer as the day progresses. The Crown Jewels are amazing, and someone had the brilliant idea of a moving floor that carries people past them so the line keeps moving. But not to worry, you can go back and pass by them again, or you can move up to the overlooking stationary platform and look longer. The history of the tower is amazing. Don't miss the tiny, tiny staircase up to the ""Bloody Tower"" where the little princes were imprisoned. You can spend 2 hours, or and entire morning. It is fabulous.",Beefeater Tour 
"February 26, 2019","Seeing the Tower of London with a Beefeater Tour was an excellent way to view this historic property. This requires pre-booking which I did online prior to coming to England. It was pretty thrilling to see the Crown Jewels, unsettling to view the execution place of Anne Boleyn and then the chapel where she was buried. Walking up the winding tower stairs to where various prisoners were kept - some who never made it out alive - was eerie as many had carved their names into the stone walls. Definitely an important place to see and experience while in London!",DISABLED - DON'T GO to Tower of London . DISGRACEFUL accessibility !
"January 28, 2019","As a Londoner I am ashamed that London's most historically significant building is mainly restricted to the able-bodied ! I came here with my 6 year old son who is in a wheelchair. We paid a whopping £14 child ticket only to find out that only 10% of the buildings can be accessed by a wheelchair. Guess they don't want to spend the money !. Lots of excuses about no lifts in a historic buildings etc. Red herring - decent ramps are simple and easy to install. Come on Historic Royal Palaces, do the right thing and create a building that doesn't DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE DISABLED !",Best thing in London
"October 2, 2008","The Tower of London is definitely the most worthwhile thing to see whilst in London. There is so much history and it is so fascinating to see such a landmark in person.

Experience England's illustrious (and infamous?) history and see upclose the crown jewels.Join the free Yeoman Warder Tour and find out how many English heads are beheaded in and around the Tower of London. The guide is informative and very entertaining with their sense of humour. You will learn a lot more about the towers and the tales behind them in the tower by following this one-hour tour. Well worth the time.Also, look out for the ravens in the grounds of the tower. They are a ""permanent"" feature there for centuries!",Well worth it
"July 18, 2008","We went in January, when the tourist crowds were not very big - and this was well worth the money and five hours spent there.  What a cool place!  Eat at the Wagamama's right nearby!  The Beefeater tour is a must!",The Tower is Tops!
"February 5, 2008","Visited the Tower of London with my family(wife and I and two teenagers, 17 and 15) in late December.  We got there when it first opened, and immediately went to see the Crown Jewels, which we had practically to ourselves; no crowds, had plenty of time to appreciate their splendor, and also time to watch the interesting video display.We also took a Warder's tour-an absolute must-and then spent the next several hours on our own.  It's an absolutely fabulous place and everyone in my family agreed it was the highlight of our visit to London.Being the end of December, it was quite chilly; also by the time we left-about Noon-it was also packed, so full of people it was tough to navigate.  I'd strongly suggest that if you travel at a high-tourist time, go first thing in the morning.But you have to visit-it's a great historic wonder.",BEST attraction in London; a must-see!!!
"February 6, 2007","The Tower of London was at the top of my list of things to see before my January 07 excursion. It did not disappoint. While it may seem pricey, I guarantee that you will find yourself immersed in it's history/culture/drama. If you take the Tube to the Tower, you are hit with it's stark, medieval architecture upon exiting the underground...a menacing view to be sure, but much better than entering through ""Traitor's Gate""as they did centuries ago. Beefeater tours generally begin near the front entrance; you can choose to skip it (the tour is included with the price of admission) but I highly recommend joining as you will be made privvy to factoids of history (as gory as they may be) that you may not hear elsewhere. Such as: Anne Boleyn's lips were still uttering a prayer after her head had been chopped off. After the Beefeater tour, you are free to explore the Tower at your leisure. You can peruse the various towers/chambers, view the armory of Kings, or bask in awe at the Crown Jewels. The latter is the only part of the day that I found to be tedious...perhaps it was because of the pushy tourists or the fact that it just didn't really interest me. Or maybe it was envy. All in all, if you do one thing whilst in London - be sure it is a trip to the Tower.",A gymn visit before you come here
"June 24, 2022",This is a very fit person's tour. The walk and steps that you walk up and down sees that you need a visit to gymn before you come here.,Go early - and other key tips
"December 27, 2019","The Tower of London is an icon with incredible historical value. Tips to make the most of your visit:* Go early. It is a key tourist attraction and the nature of the tower means a lot of the things to see are in narrow winding corners so to avoid excessive queues do this first thing* As soon as you enter, go to the queue for the Crown Jewels. You will be waiting 30 minutes whilst seeing paintings and some artefacts before actually seeing the Crown Jewels. If you don’t go first then you will be potentially waiting 90 minutes. The most important crown, the one used for state occasions is actually at the end after the moving walkway and doesn’t seem to get as much attention.* Next go to the Torture room - this is very small and also tends to get queues. You see a few items only and it isn’t gruesome at all* Definitely get a guidebook, audio guide or download information beforehand to appreciate the true historic nature of the tower. Many people think it was a prison but in reality it was so much more - part safety deposit box, part storage of records, part royal mint, part royal home in times of trouble, and part tourist attraction/zoo as well as a prison. A must visit.",Book direct and save money
"December 16, 2019",The tour offered dosnt give over 60 discount and is more expensive than booking online direct or via ebookers  - Just paid £38.80 for 2 tickets -with free cancellation  some one is making a BIG profit!,Historical site 
"October 30, 2019",We joined the beef eater tour.  It was great to walk where history was orchestrated and being told the stories associated with it.   I also enjoyed visiting the Crown Jewels.  We didn’t get to see it all because it poured rain which dampened our enthusiasm but enjoyed what we did experience,Fascinating historical site
"September 14, 2019",Take the Beefeater tour when you go in.  It's included in your fare and worth the time. Not only are they knowledgeable but they are a part of the history and are assigned there. They aren't the usual tour guides because that isn't actually their job.  Just go and you'll understand. The crown jewels are nice to see and the history behind them as well as all the buildings was fascinating. Well worth the visit,Amazing visit
"January 16, 2019","Must see when in London. As i remember entrance was about 30 Us Dollars(and it worth every penny). and it will take you like 3 hours to finish this tour.. consider visiting the tours bridge, belfast (the ship, and u can finish eating at the borough market.  ",Wear comfortable shoes because your legs are going to be sore!
"September 13, 2019","You’ll be pounding the cobblestone paths for hours at the Tower of London but the inevitable sore legs are a small price to pay.  This place is phenomenal. We arrived at opening time having pre- bought tickets. This allowed us to queue for even less time but in all honesty, there weren’t long lines. Not sure if this is normal for the shoulder season but as per TA advice, we headed straight for the Crown Jewels which didn’t disappoint. No photography allowed in this exhibit but do get the recorded commentary as you hear a lot about it this way. We then joined the second Yeoman Warder tour of the day. I think they go every half hour and the 10am one had too many people on it for my liking - roughly 150 so I opted for the second. Our Yeoman Warder’s name was Clive and even though we had a big group, Clive had a fantastic voice that carried beautifully and we missed nothing. He really brought the venue to life for us and told the best stories. The experience wouldn’t have been near as good without Clive. After this, our sore feet were demanding a rest so we took an early lunch in the cafe. We then tackled some more of the exhibits such as the White Tower. In all, the grounds are beautiful, the history is compelling and I would rate this experience right up there with the top things I’ve done in this European trip. ",must visit for all Indians
"August 25, 2019","I believe that if an Indian wishes to see how much the British exploited Indians and how much money they took from our land to eradicate their hunger and poverty, then the tower of London is the place to be. SEE the diamonds the rubies and all precious items they stole from India to satisfy their impoverished needs.","""Skip the Lines"" - NOT!!!"
"July 31, 2019","Want to pay MORE and then be told to get in line with everyone else who paid less? Then, THIS is the tour for you!What a rip off! I should have just gone up to the ticket window and bought my tickets outright. It would have saved me money, and I still would have had to wait in all the normal lines.",Very beautiful Place
"July 21, 2019","The Tower of London is a must see, but if you come in the touristy season, plan to be there as soon as it opens to avoid massive crowds. We came around 10:20 and the crowds weren’t bad at all, but when we were done the crowds were big. It’s a very beautiful place with lots of history. I’m glad we got to see it.","Go early esp if it’s summer. Kids 10, 13 and 15"
"July 12, 2019","This is a must see. Of all the sites we crammed into our short 2 night stay in London this topped the list.London Tower is not only picturesque (Palace, on the Thames, with prisons, next to Tower Bridge) but fascinating (Jane Grey imprisoned and executed here, you can see her graffiti on the wall) historical (more monarchs lived here in this palace than any other), and the Beefeater experience only adds to it. Crown Jewels at a must do and kids rode the moving walkway twice to get a view of jewels from either side. Go early. Ticket line is short but entry line long. We arrived at 10am first entry with online tix bought, but the entry line already snaked along two sides of the Palace. Line moved quickly and we were in under 30 min. Go immediately to Crown Jewels line skipping beefeater tour and all other sites. The Crown Jewels line only gets longer throughout the day.  Our wait at 10:35 was 5 minutes to get in. When we exited 30 minutes later the line was 10x longer. ",Overcrowded and misleading info 
"July 2, 2019",I came here 25 years ago and it was the highlight of my trip... I was a bit disappointed this go round. I was led to believe this was a fast pass or skip the line which it is not. The beefeater tour had over 100 people swarming the beefeater so it was quite disappointing. The line for the crown jewels was so long we didn’t go because we had already lined up forever to get in to the place. ,Majestic Tower of London - One of the best things to do in London
"June 28, 2019","Tower of London is one of the most recognisable icons of London often shown in the same image as the adjacent Tower Bridge.It offers a magnificent view from across the river Thames, from Tower Bridge and a sense of well preserved history as you get closer even before you explore it from the inside.Wonderful visual treat for visitors and locals.",GREAT!
"June 20, 2019","We went on a weekday around 11 am, and there was no line! Make sure to meet up with a Beefeater (guy/lady in red uniform) to the left of the entrance for a free tour! It was super informative and entertaining! Give yourself a few hours for sure to see all the Tower has to offer, including the ravens. We just watched them for at least 30 minutes. So much history! The Crown Jewels line looked lengthy, but moved very quickly, so don't let the line deter you. These are THE crown jewels, so YES, wait in the line. :) Also, the view of Tower Bridge is great. Even if you only have a short time in London, make SURE to include The Tower of London.","Be sure to use the Yeoman Warder ""Beefeater"" Tour available at no extra cost"
"June 17, 2019","While I generally enjoy taking guided/walking tours, after ten very dry ones in Britain, I was burned out.  Glad I opted to take the “Beefeater Tour"" on my visit to the Tower of London; my final tourist stop.   Yeoman warder, Scott Kelly, the 409th yeoman warder of all time, was our entertaining guide.  The current 37 yeoman warders all live and work in the Tower of London.  It’s a ""massive honor"" to become one. You need to have completed at least 22 years of military service, earned a Good Conduct Medal,  and attained a rank of warrant officer.  Scott's humor kept our attention.  I'm very hard of hearing and although our group was large, I was always able to position myself where I could hear Scott.  It helped he had a voice that carried and was mindful to speak loudly so all could hear.  Good tour.  Fun.",Vacation! 
"June 16, 2019","I have been wanting to see the Tower for ages, and I was not disappointed! Once you are on the grounds, make sure to take the guided tour with the Yeoman Warder.  Our guide was Jim, and he was incredible.  I would strongly recommend giving yourself lots of time, as there is so much to see.  The Crown Jewels and the ravens were my favourite! ",Our guide Laurence was fantastic 
"January 15, 2019","Myself and my partner decided to go to the Tower of London because we were doing a bus tour of the city and felt it was something we should do. It was a bitterly cold , miserable day but our guide Laurence was just brilliant so we barely noticed that we were frozen solid ! He had a wonderful way of telling the history  to us & as horrific as the stories were he made them enjoyable constantly interacting with the crowd and especially involving the kids , I would think there was around 200 people in our group but his booming voice and wonderful attitude meant that nobody missed out on what he was saying .",sound and light show commemorating WW1
"November 12, 2018","During the week of Nov.3-10, 2018 the Tower of London was the site for an amazing event commemorating WW1. The combination of light, fog (technical and real), sound, voice and movement was brilliantly presented. The weather with its torrents of rain set a scene of trenches and misery. 45,000+ people watched for about 45 minutes, all in silence. One heart remembering the horror and sacrifice. We will always be thankful for those who served and fought for freedom. May we never forget and always work to find solutions other than war.",Wonderful visit
"November 10, 2018","The Tower if London is fascinating. It is amazing that it is still active. We could not get to see the the Crown Jewels on Saturday, the lines were just too long. Since we had a London Pass, we went back on Monday and walked right in! They are beautiful and with the second trip.",Incredible history
"September 8, 2018","The Tower of London has an incredibly long and interesting history, but the bonus is in the way it is maintained and presented - don't miss the Beefeater Tour, we had the first female Beefeater as our guide. She was informative, entertaining and with a wicked sense of humour, which made our visit a memorable one. A credit to herself, and the Cameron Clan. Thoroughly recommend that anyone visiting London make this a must see experience ",The crown jewels are amazing
"September 7, 2018","Make sure to select the ticket option that includes the crown jeweles. Also, recommend you walk around at your own pace. We had a great time.",Definitely a tourist must

"July 21, 2018","There are lots to see in this castle, especially for lovers of medieval history. The Crown Jewels are one of the highlights of our visit. Taking photos of the Crown Jewels is prohibited. We were warned that it is best to go early in the day and try to see the Crown Jewels as early as possible. Our queue wait time was about 15 minutes, but by the time we left, it was likely more than a 30-minute wait. We took the Yeoman Warders guided tour. He was dressed in some type of majestic costume. It was very entertaining as he brought humour into his presentation with facial gestures and stories/comments on history, people put into prison, torture, how people were beheaded with dull axes, ruthless kings, how some royal family members were mysteriously killed, the tower grounds, and more. Why do they call it the “Tower of London,” when it is a castle, palace, and fortress, not a tower (albeit, it has 21 towers, including its central “White Tower”)? This castle, with its 15-foot thick stone walls, is the property of the British Crown. It was originally built in the latter part of the 11th century by William the Conqueror. Similar to him, it had an infamous reputation as a brutal prison, place of cruel torture, and associated with being a place of death, although many of those executed were taken out of the castle to Tower Hill, for greater public viewing of the punishment for alledged wrongdoings against the crown. It is often referred to as the Bloody Tower of London. Over the past centuries, it has become one of London’s top ten tourist attractions.",Many towers make a tower in London.
"June 18, 2018",There are several towers and buildings is this complex. The Crown Jewels are a huge draw of visitors. Quite interesting and I recommend the jewels highly. But many other features are worth your time as well.,Gave up with queues!
"October 30, 2014","Have to start by saying the poppies are amazing and worth the trip.... But if your thinking like we did to book to go into the tower whilst visiting frankly don't bother as:1. The poppies are best viewed from outside the tower2. The overcrowding inside is an absolute disgrace. It appears that the tower management just want to keep selling tickets and are not worried about the experience their guests actually receive. We abandoned our visit after an hour and half, the two our wait to see the Crown Jewels and queues everywhere just proved too much and we wrote off the £100+ entry!! Talked to some staff and they are so embarrassed by the situation that apparently the beefeaters have petitioned for some controls. This needs to happen as until it does my advice to anybody would be to avoid which is a real shame for a national treasure that should be so enjoyable if better managed.",Queue Gardens?
"October 28, 2014","I understand that this is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the UK. I also realise that I went during half term.BUT, they need a major shake up of how they do things. It took us about an hour waiting in one of the many sales kiosks to get our tickets. Not cheap either.My major complaint here is, if they know that you have no chance of seeing everything in a day, they should reduce the price.The line for the Crown Jewels exhibition was about 1 hour 30 minutes of waiting. There were queues for everything, with people asking ""excuse me, what is this queue for?"" There was no Alton Towers style zigzagging, just random snaking lines everywhere.No thought has been put in here, They just open the flood gates. They should either limit the numbers, sell online only or better still, give you a time slot when you can see the different exhibitions.Actually, the shops didn't have much of a queue, however, I didn't fancy spending £25 for a mug and £4.95 for a sandwich.Seriously taking the p**s all round.","""A field of Poppies"""
"October 26, 2014","We wanted to see the London Poppies but had already been to the tower this year and did not want to pay another 22 pounds each. To be honest we went at the wrong time(1 Pm on Sunday afternoon). The crowds were vast with people pushing, shoving and spilling on to the busy road.Having said that the poppies were amazing, thousands upon thousands adorn the grass moat floor. The sight of the tide of red colour is very powerful. Overall this is well worth a view from the path, but please wait for a quiet time to enjoy your visit.",Poppies are a must see - but hurry they won't be there for much longer
"October 18, 2014",Went to view the poppies and they were a spectacular sight.  This Tower of London is a great historical site and the crown jewels are definitely worth seeing.  You can see the poppies without paying the entrance fee.,"""Blood swept lands and seas of red"""
"October 4, 2014","Even if you do not have time to visit the spectacular and historic interiors of the Tower of London, please please please make sure you make the time to see the spectacular art installation which is being constructed in the former moat of the Tower.  888,642 hand-made ceramic poppies (created in a studio in Pride Park in Derbyshire) are being progressively placed; each poppy represents one of the 888, 246 British and Colonial military fatalities of World War 1. The last poppy will be placed at 11:00 on 11/11/2014. The installation is titled 'Blood swept lands and seas of red!.  It is seriously beautiful, poignant, and deeply moving.  It's free, and you can't miss it when you get to  the Tower - you certainly don't have to enter the Tower to see it.  And it makes the likes of the Turner Prize, with its usual controversy of the rubbish the experts call art, a joke!  This is art!  This is memorable!  This is what London is really all about.  Do not miss it!",Historical Castle and Prison
"August 6, 2014","Interesting place, the prices are a bit steep!  I bet a LOT of people visiting on Aug. 5 didn't realize Duke & Dutchess William & Kate as well as Prince Harry were there!Awesome Tips:If you don't have online, pre-bought tickets, don't bother waiting in the insane lineups. Instead, plan ahead. We had a day travel card on the underground and stopped at Liverpool station where we exited to find the London Tourist Office (check their hours online before you go). It's located across platforms 5 & 6. Here, an adult ticket is 18.50 and virtually NO lineup. Grab the tickets and check back into the underground using your travel card (or oyster card if that's what you're using) and get off at London Tower station (very close by). Once you exit the London Tower station, mind the signs for 'TICKET HOLDERS' -- you will keep left and essentially walk around the entire Tower of London complex on the river Thames side which is the pre-purchased ticket entrance. Also once inside, skip the audio tours. It's a money grab! Wait for a Yeoman tour (they take large groups of people every half hour or so from either entrances). Another tip: they don't post times of the next tour. Don't worry, just loiter around the signed area for the next tour. It's included in your ticket price, it lasts an hour, and is worth it. Another tip is don't head straight for the Crown Jewels or even the Tower itself. Watch the crowds a after your Yeoman tour. If they dwindle, queue up.",Historically important but very pricey attraction
"July 30, 2014","The Tower of London is probably the most important historical building standing in England today.  Located and the north bank of the River Thames, this castle was the English seat of power for many centuries.  Founded by William as part of the Norman conquest of English in 1066, the Tower of London has rich history which extends almost a thousand years into the past  Today, you can visit the Tower of London and see quite a bit of the castle grounds including the White Tower, Medieval Palace and now you can see the Royal Crown Jewels, which are display at the Tower of London.  You can visit and see the highlights at the Tower of London in an hour or less but this makes the visit very pricy (entrance £22 for adults, £11 for children). To ensure better value for money, it is worth trying to see as much as you can at the Tower of London.  Visit their website to see recommended ways of spending 2 or 3 hours at this attraction, there is good description of everything everything available to do and see online.  For those who enjoy leisurely visits, its possible to spend up to a 1/2 a day at the Towers of London.  For those not as keen on castle visits, you can also simply walk around the Tower of London, enjoying its presence on the north side of the Thames River.  It rests beside what is probably the most famous bridge in the world, Tower Bridge, which you can also consider visiting when spending time in this part of London.  In the end, we find the Tower of London quite pricy compared to other important attractions in London and similar castle/palace visits in other European capitals.  You might even argue that beyond the Crown Jewels, the attraction is a bit underwhelming compared to many European counterparts. However, it can be a fun place to visit and a nice place for families with children to spend time during their holiday.",Far Too Crowded
"July 10, 2014","First of all we got there early - right when they opened and paid a small fortune even taking into account the 2 for 1 deal to get in.  We went to the crown jewels first just as you all here on TA had told me too.  I'm glad we did otherwise we wouldn't have been able to see them.  Even still it took an hour to see them.  The staff stood back and let people cut in line - and in some cases encouraged it! By the time we got to some of the cases people pushed us out of the way. In all cases the staff stood back and watched looking bored.  Afterward we went through the white tower and a few of the exhibits and in all cases it was so over crowded that we couldn't get close enough to read the signs or really take into consideration what we were seeing.  And we aren't the sort of people who take 6 hours in a museum.  Some of the weapons were cool and it was fun to be inside the Tower of London - something I think we all learned about as kids - but there simply has to be a better way to organize things.  Either put a cap on the number of people allowed or simply make them wait in a line.  I know that it would require paying out more of the outrageous admission costs to get people who will do more than stand around, look bored, and be rude but it would have made something that a lot of people look forward to - including me - into a much better experience. You honestly could not pay me to go back!",History ... History .... History. Must Do in London
"June 11, 2014","When in London, please do spend half a day at the Tower of London. Tickets for adults is £ 22 and child is ~ £ 11 if booked on the spot. Try to get it online then it is ~ 25% cheaper or try to get into a group and do a group booking then it is even cheaper. Get off at the Tower Station in the London Underground and walk to the entrance. Tower of London, is a historic castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury, a treasury, a menagerie, the home of the Royal Mint, a public records office, and the home of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. From the early 14th century until the reign of Charles II, a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century the castle was the prison of the Princes in the Tower. Under the Tudors, the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.Once inside wait for the ‘Yeoman’ Tour. It is usually held every one hour. If you have to wait for sometime then go to the ‘moat’. The ‘moat’ is now a Grassy Field where they usually show old swords, bow and arrow etc. The ‘Yeoman’ would introduce to the tour and the history of the Tower. There could be a huge crowd built up so try to get in front of him & try to record his speech. He would point out to a place outside the Tower where public hangings would take place. Then he would take you inside , stopping at various stops to give a quick speech on the history. The tour would end at the ‘Chapel’ and then you are free to roam the Tower at your leisure.  Apart from the Yeoman, the other attractions are :--	Crown Jewels - Crown Jewels denotes the regalia and vestments worn by the sovereign of the United Kingdom during the coronation ceremony and at other state functions. The term refers to the following objects: the crowns, sceptres (with either the cross or the dove), orbs, swords, rings, spurs, colobium sindonis, dalmatic, armills, and the royal robe or pall, as well as several other objects connected with the ceremony itself. The tradition of housing the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London probably dates from the reign of Henry III. The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia, including jewels, plate, and symbols of royalty such as the crown, sceptre, and sword. When money needed to be raised, the treasure could be pawned by the monarch. -	Do not miss the Koh-i-Noor diamond in the middle of the front cross (the diamond was most recently acquired by the East India Company and became part of the British Crown Jewels when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India in 1877.-	The Kings's Sceptre with the Cross was made in 1661, and is so called because it is surmounted by a cross. In 1910, it was redesigned to incorporate the Cullinan I, also known as the Great Star of Africa, which at over 530 carats (106 g) is the largest cut clear diamond in the world. During the coronation, the monarch bears the Sceptre with the Cross in the right hand.-	Ravens - Ravens of the Tower of London are a group of captive Common Ravens which live in the Tower of London. The group of ravens at the Tower comprises at least seven individuals (six required, with a seventh in reserve). The presence of the ravens is traditionally believed to protect the Crown and the Tower; a superstition holds that ""If the Tower of London ravens are lost or fly away, the Crown will fall and Britain with it.-	Yeoman Warders are also known as ‘Beefeaters’ - It is thought their nickname is derived from their position in the Royal Bodyguard, which permitted them to eat as much beef as they wanted from the king's table.Tower of London should not be missed at any cost !!!",Wow. Didn't think an attraction could be more boring.
"May 25, 2014","Total rip off!The tour consists of a bunch of signs telling you what might have been there. The tower of beasts is nothing but a bunch of animal drawings they assume the king might have had. The Crown Jewels are just a series of replicas on display that take at most 10 minutes to see. The hall of Kings is a collection of simulated armor and fake swords. And best of all after paying the outrageous admission for this junk, they have donation boxes every 10 feet. Skip this one for sure.",A day not to be missed
"February 9, 2018","How to spend a whole day going back through history, firstly do a small 45 minute tour with the Yeomen guards they are a font of knowledge about the Tower of London, they give you a brief history lesson and then point you to the different parts of the historical monument. Wander through the vault housing the Crown Jewels, or the area that was used to house unusual animals see armour throughout the ages or walk the ramparts.It’s amazing how quick a day can seem. Plenty to do for adults and children alike. If in London you have to visit The Tower of London it’s a must see.",Another historical experience
"December 23, 2017","Take your time, see the towers, the crown jewels and try to imagine life as lived in the Middle Ages.  There is so much history it might help to review it before you go so it's easier to understand what was going on under the various rulers.",WATCH OUT FOR THE ADMITTANCE PRICING SCAM
"October 25, 2017","Large letters on the admittance pricing board stating £28.00Smaller letters saying actual price is £24.80 excluding the voluntary donation.Ask for 1 adult and automatically get charged £28 by the cashier and when you question this you get a completely rude response.You are never given the option if you want to include the 'voluntary donation', you just get charged for it.....how many people do they rip off with this every single day, especially the foreign visitors who struggle, or cant read English...!!!!!!!!!!!!",Best tour in London - Must See!
"July 7, 2017","This was our favorite tour.   We we're discouraged by a vendor selling guidebooks at the entrance from taking the Yeoman Warden tour, but chose to take it anyway.  WE WERE SO GLAD WE DID!  It was the best tour of our week in London.  Our Guide, Lawrence, was outstanding.   He had a great sense of humor, was extremely knowledgable and kept the entire group engaged in his script.   We then went through the line to see the Crown Jewels. From the history of the Tower to the influence by the royal family, there is some much history within these walls.  Overall a very good tour.   ",By all means PRINT your tickets before arriving!
"June 12, 2017",If you purchase tickets on line before your visit (and there is a substantial discount to do so) by all means PRINT the tickets before you arrive. The web site says you can go to the group tickets window to pick up your prepaid tickets. We are waiting in a crazily long queue on a Monday morning. If I had known this I would have paid full price for tickets on site (much shorter queue). Now we'll never get to see the Crown Jewels. So disappointed in the pre-purchase ticket pickup process at the Tower of London!,Incredible - Must do the Beefeater tour
"May 6, 2017","We got to the Tower before opening time so were among the first to go in which was great because we were able to go through the Crown Jewels display with hardly anyone else in there before heading back out to the first Beefeater tour.  There were so many people waiting (i'm guessing nearly 100) for the tour that we nearly decided to wait until a later one, but once the guide started he kept the whole crowd entertained, and involved.  It was fanastic how he well he presented the tour.  He was also very funny especially considering the grim and gruesome content of his talk.  I would definitely say this is an absolute must when coming to London. After the tour, we went through the White Tower which was really interesting and then explored the other sections. We used the National Rail 2for1 voucher here as well",One of our best days in London!
"April 24, 2017","This was a must-see.  Be sure the see the jewels, the line looks long but it goes fairly quickly.  Buying line hopping passes ahead doesn't save much time at this venue",Immerse yourself in history
"February 10, 2017","Be prepared for line ups...long line ups to get in because of bag checks. Line goes quickly though. Get there when it opens in the morning. First thing to do is get a map and go immediately to the crown jewels. If you wait for the tour, there will be a line up about a mile long to see the same jewels. SEE THE JEWELS FIRST! Then, you can go back to the moat for the crowded beefeater tour which is included in your ticket price. Very entertaining and informative with some humour thrown in for good measure. He will point out buildings, but will not go into them. Go after the tour. You can also get audio guides for a fee and skip the tour, but only get the guides AFTER you see the jewels. The jewels are pretty spectacular, and the bonus is that if you get there early, you can see them alone and go through as quickly or as long as you like, otherwise uou'll be snaking along in there like a snail; I kid you not.  As the day goes on, it will get really busy. You might want to go into the white Tower right after the jewels as there are line ups too, but no where near as long as for the jewels. The tower has armour. You can see a couple of armour suits from King Henry  XVIII; one was for a slim man in his 20s, the other was fitted for an obese man in his 40s. Quite a difference from his youth and the result of a severe jousting injury to his leg which resulted in a sedentary and very painful lifestyle for the unfortunate king. There are also cannon, guns, swords, pikes, horses armour and much more. There are also a few videos inside for you to enjoy.In the prisoner rooms, you will see the names of famous condemned people who scratched their names, initials or sayings in the stone. One of them was the young, 16 year old, princess Elizabeth who luckily was later released and became England's greatest queen.Outside, there is the place where the wretched Anne Boleyn met her death on the block by a French executioners sword by order of her husband. This is also the place where the teenage Lady Jane Grey, queen for just 9 days and beaten and forced to marry against her will was also beheaded by Mary I whose army overwhelmed the tower. There are many gift shops throughout the tower with different price ranges. You will also be surprised to find the eremains of the former zoo, once full of exotic animals who were gifted to various royals and who met their untimely demise in the dank London air and atmoshere.Throughout your visit, there are theatrical plays going on that encourage audirpence participation. Don't expect to be sitting down either as you will be moving around with the costumed actors from one place to another. It was quite entertaining! The one I saw told the story of William the Conqueror of znormandy, France and Harold I of England. The audience had to take sides on who they thought should be king, then plan their attack. Great fun for all ages, and lots of comic relief there too! You can see this in pictures of this story if you go to Bayeux, France to see the 1000 year old Bayeux Tapestry. The visit to the whole Tower complex easily takes 3 hours or more, and don't rush through as you can learn a lot. It is a must see important site of British history. Note, that there are cobblestones and narrow stairs everywhere. Not good for wheelchairs or strollers, but I did see both. ","Awesome, full of history!"
"August 20, 2016","So much has already been written about the Tower of London, so I'll keep it short.1. Buy tickets online to skip the line. Also, see the Crown Jewels first as the line grows throughout the day.2. Set aside 3-4 hours if you want to see everything.3. Go on a tour. The beefeaters are friendly, funny, and charismatic. ",Get a tour with the Beefeaters and you will love every minute of it!
"July 26, 2016","We had a great weather to visit this fabulous structure and while the ticket price is steep in my opinion (25 pounds for an adult!) thanks to to free tour with one of the Beefeaters it was all worth it!. We learned a lot of the gruesome history, the intrigues, the murders, while being entertain at the same time. The Crown Jewels were beautiful and we spend quite a bit of time just walking the walls and imagine the times of the Kings and Queens that inhabited this palace so long ago! Go in the afternoon, there is so much less people and you won't have to queue to go and see the Crown Jewels.",Great historical spot in the city
"April 3, 2010","The Tower of London was the first attraction we went to see during our visit to London, and I think that it turned out to be a great way to start our trip.  One of the great things about coming up through the Tower Hill tube station is that you are greeted with the remains of an ancient city wall that dates its lowest levels to the time of the Romans.  This in itself solidifies just how much history this city has to share.  We had booked our tickets online prior to our visit and were able to pick them up at the group tickets window rather than waiting in line at the regular windows.   One of the best things to do during your visit here is to take a tour led by one of the Yeoman Warders.  Since there isn't a great deal of signage around, this is by far the best and most entertaining ways of learning about the structure.  The gentleman who led our tour had a great sense of humor as well as a great deal of knowledge which made our visit very enjoyable.  Taking the tour also allows you to enter the church where Anne Boleyn is buried.  Had it not been pointed out to us, I would have never known it was there.   I didn't have a huge interest in seeing the crown jewels, but since we were there, we decided to check them out.  Overall the display is nice but the lines leading up to the displays are a little poorly designed.  You have to go through several rooms of films and with the way some of these rooms are set up, you can't get through them if you aren't interested in watching and because it is interesting for some of the people in the line, it can feel like it takes forever.  Despite this minor set back though, this is a truly amazing site and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",Well worth the time---Don't miss it!
"September 23, 2009","We visited the Tower of London in March, 2009.  We went late in the afternoon and had no wait to get tickets.  We elected to go on the Beefeater's guided tour----which was AWESOME!  Our guide was charming, HILARIOUS and very knowledgable.  Not only did we learn alot, but as they are not just tour guides (they are really in the military)---we felt like we were exposed to living history.The grounds are beautiful and every exhibit is well done----good views and info.  We had no major lines to see anything---including the Crown Jewels.  If it's a rainy day---don't worry---there are alot of things to see inside.  A small umbrella would take care of you in the walking from here to there.The only thing we would have done differently was to budget more time.  I think you really need about 4 hours to immerse yourself in the experience and see everything.",Not To Be Missed!!!!!!
"July 14, 2009","I have been to the Tower before but this time my husband & I decided to take the tour with the Beefeaters. What a wonderful, fun, insightful tour!!!!! I am a huge Tudor history fan & the information we received was outstanding!!!!!I would encourage all to go & tour with the Beefeater!!!!A++++",Tower of London
"July 1, 2009","If you are a history buff, such as myself, you'll love the tower of London. I would recommend taking one of the tours (included in the price of the ticket) by the famous Beefeaters. They start at the entrance to the Tower. I posted pictures and some more details on my travel blog:http://adams-travel-blog.blogspot.com/2009/06/first-couple-days-in-london.htmlIt is a lot of fun, although I wouldn't recommend the nearby Tower Bridge museum unless you have a lot of time. It was a little dry. Of course take a few photos of the bridge!",Don't miss this one!
"April 26, 2009","The Tower of London was a highlight of my first day on a recent trip to London.  The history, the legend, the crown jewels, the yeoman warders and their stories all work together to make an unforgettable experience.  If you want a taste of authentic history, make this a priority.  Wear your walking shoes, climb the towers and soak it all in.",My favorite spot in London
"April 5, 2009","The Tower of London was my favorite stop in London during our four day visit this past week.  Although a little pricey to enter, the Tower is full of interesting sights and the Beefeater tour was outstanding.   Note that the Beefeater tours can get quite large, but our guide (and the others we saw) were very adept at dealing with such large groups.  Plan to get there early though before it gets to busy.  I would recommend planning to spend 2-3 hours there, if not more.",Excellent visit!
"February 13, 2009","I love places with history and Tower of London is definately one of them. I read here a couple of negatice comments about this attraction, but on my point of view these are due to lack of knowledge on the tower, or limited interest on historic facts and old building. But then, why go there then? Everyone is entitled to his/hers opinion of course, so...I visited for first time at the end of January. I made it there about 14.15, excellent timing as last guided tour was on 14.30 . There were no queues at all, maybe due to time of the year (no peak season).Our Beefeater was Alan. Alan has a nice singing voice, I first though that he is of Irish or Northern England origin, but he said he comes from South West England or something. Anyway, I loved hearing his voice, and I could understand him too (I am a foreigner and that's important!) Tour was informative and funny, and Alan helped everyone to create an image on his mind of how things were in the Tower some centuries ago. Very nice and lively commentary! We got to see the Chapel too, which is open only when on a tour I think.After the guided tour, I spend nearly two more hours there, but there were not enough! I saw the Crown Jeweleries, no queues here too, and I wonder in the various different parts of the tower, watched Beefeaters and Guards going on their usual buissiness and rituals, and of course I spotted lots of ravens. I liked the views towards Tower Bridge too, and towards the execution place and the ex-Port Authorities building which is now owned by an insurance company or something. Time was not enough, and I am sure I should have missed something, no matter how much I tried to explore around. Some maintenance seems to be going on parts of the Tower too.I'd like to come back,to take an audio next time. It would be interesting to have information on more details and smaller items that may have not be explained on the guided tour.A very pleasant visit if you are the kind of person that loves history!",very interesting place
"December 5, 2008","I visited the Tower of London with my 13 year-old son ( we come from Spain ) in May. I was happily surprised that the visit really was worth the ticket. The Beefeaters' tour was absolutely entertaining, they explained every aspect ( past and current )of the place in a very amusing way. We spent nearly four hours wandering in the fortress, listening to the Beefeaters and enjoying such a interesting place. I have visited London several times, but it was the first time I visited the Tower. We had Mr. Jones ( one of the nice Beefeaters ) touring our group and he was most friendly, helpful and profesional. Thank you Mr. Jones, we really enjoyed your guided visit, it was fantastic!I had just watched The Tudors TV series on TV and it was amazing and thrilling to be at the same location, especially when we got to know where Anne Boleyn was executed.My son, who was inicially reluctant to join the visit, enjoyed the place and the guided tour very much,I definetly recommend this visit.Greetings from Spain!",Definitely a must see
"October 24, 2008","One of the must sees in London.  We got there too late to get in the first day we were in London, so we got food from the street vendor and a bottle of wine and glasses from one of the pubs nearby and brought it back to eat and drink at one of the tables by the River Thames.  One of the most enjoyable memories I have of London.We did manage to visit the Tower of London later in our trip and it was spectacular.  The White Tower, as well as the Crown Jewels, are not to be missed.  The Crown Jewels had a little bit of a Disney Land feel, with the conveyer belts carrying you by the display to avoid people from gawking and creating a bottleneck, but are breathtaking nonetheless.",A Fun Afternoon!
"October 21, 2008","The Tower of London is a major reason for visiting London. The Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) are funny, informative and give great tours. The Tower houses the Royal Crown Jewels which are a treat to view. The history lesson you get during the tour will stay with you, especially when you come home and watch historically based movies:)Buy your tickets before you get there as there are always crowds. Many hotels can sell you tickets and the Big Bus Tours both have stops right outside the perimeter so it is easy to get there. There is also a tube stop right outside the Tower area.",Brilliant day out
"September 21, 2011",I went to the Tower of London with a friend while in london recently. We spent the entire day there and loved it. We arrived just as a beefeater tour was due to start (these are included in entry). he was fabulous. Very engaging and interesting. After the 60min tour we got the audio guides and self-directed around the tower. the only downside of this was that the handset is not one with headphones. there was a jack for the smaller insert but not the general one - only downside was that it is annoying carrying the set around at your ear. otherwise an very enjoyable day and a great attraction for all ages,History That You Can't Pass Up
"September 18, 2011","For those of you that will be staying more than 3 days or so I would suggest getting the paper travelcard.  They have 2 for 1 admission specials on their website and the Tower of London is one of them.  If you have time I would suggest taking free Yeoman ""Beefeater"" tour.  They do in fact live there so it's nice to hear from someone who takes pride in what they do.  The crown jewels are the main attraction and we didn't have to wait long as we went early afternoon before the crowds started to arrive.  There is plenty to see as you walk the grounds and on top of the inner wall.  There are plenty suits of armour as well as interactive displays in the White Tower.  You can easily spend more than two hours here so be prepared to take your time.  Afterwards you can go up the Tower Bridge, often confused for the London Bridge, there was only one walkway that was operational when we went but we also had a 2 for 1 admission coupon so it was pretty cheap.",Terry Humphries (Yeoman Warder) Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations
"July 23, 2013","The historical significance of this place cannot be understated. It is an impressive piece of living history via the amazing crown jewels and the brave fusiliers regiment, albeit you have to pay quite a bit for the privilege of experiencing it first hand. As a plus, if you want to engage in casual banter or discover the origin behind the choreography of the Queen's Guard marching (more specifically, I found their way of fist clenching to be wimpy, and wanted to understand if it could be interpreted as a non-provocative statement, or a sign of lost elegance), you could have the misfortune to stumble upon the said Beefeater T. Humphries, who will immediately be offended by your question and gratulate you with the categorization of stupid. Initially, I assumed a reaction as such to be the result of poor T. Humphries eating too much prion-laden beef, but on further reflection I ended up with a conclusion, which I embedded in the review title. Normally, I would have filed an official complaint with the Chief Warder, but good luck finding a way to do just that.",Points to Make your Visit Memorable
"March 18, 2013","The Tower of London is an amazing place that is full of history, stories and very interesting artifacts and jewellery. A few suggestions to make your visit enjoyable. First, purchase your tickets online before you go to London. When you arrive at TOL, you pick up the actual tickets at the guest shop, you avoid the lineups and you enter through the VIP entrance. Second, try to get to the Tower first thing in the morning. We arrived at 10 AM and just walked in to see the Crown Jewels and we were able to stay and see the crowns a few times. An hour after we saw the Crown Jewels, there was a 5 hour lineup to get inside! Third, join the Beefeater tours because with the tour you gain entrance to the Chapel Royal of St. Peter and Vincula which is not open to the general public. Plus the Beefeaters have a wealth of knowledge and interesting facts! Fourth, go to see the Crown Jewels in the Waterloo Block as soon as you get into the Tower grounds.This is the one building with the longest lineups. Fifth, the White Tower is the largest building with the most things to see and read. Be careful! Once you enter the building you are directed by arrows, barriers and personnel to follow the path that takes you from the front door up all the floors then into the basement and then out. We went in to take a quick peek but we were trapped inside and had to do the full tour. So be sure you have the time and the patience before you enter.  Sixth, walk the ramparts (walls) - it is very interesting to be walking on 1100 year old stones while looking at some of London's newest buildings (The Shard and the Gherkin)! Lastly, make sure that you leave at least 3 hours to see this attraction. We were there for just over 3 hours and we still did not see everything! We will be back.",Wheelchair guests avoid
"August 25, 2012","I took my 18 year old daughter in her wheelchair. We were charged £17 for her and I was admitted free. Great deal you might think.... No, it was a rip off. Due to the cobbles we found it difficult to negotiate the site and had to abandon the trip for fear of breaking her chair! Only the perimeter path was ""accessible"" together with the jewel house. Absolutely nothing else.  £5 would have been appropriate! I was also told by a seller that I should be happy as I was admitted free - did she expect me to abandon my daughter and do the tour alone! Don't bother!",Must see is an understatement.
"August 11, 2012","This place is pure history and you get the chance to walk around in the footsteps of all those Kings & Queens and other assorted royalty and other world famous characters. The Yeoman Wardens ARE fantastic. Simon,Simon,Simon was the MAN who took our group through some history and fascinating facts about Tower of London , the Yeoman Wardens themselves and more titbits of history. The tour ""flies"" by and then you have the opportunity to look at all those jewels!!!. The cafe's are great to sit down and let it sink in. The buildings are nearly 1000 years old. Some of the stairways and corridors are small but this adds to the GENUINE feel of the attraction. I know other trip advisors have said it but it really is A MUST SEE.",Diamonds & Beefeaters
"June 22, 2012","I loved this visit, the diamonds are amazing, the Beefeater guides are very knowledgeable and full of fun... look out for the graffiti carved in the walls of the prison cells by their poor inmates awaiting the gallows!",History compromised for profit
"April 1, 2012","Bitterly disappointing since going as a child. £20 entry to overcrowded empty exhibits. Aside from Henry VIII jousting armour, little number of exhibits. Am sure the crown jewels were more exhaustive when last visited. White Tower was good on ground floor but got progressively banal as you climbed the crowded stairs.Then to top things off, after waiting a couple of hours for the church service to end, was told only Groups are allowed in the Chapel Royal!!!! DisgustingWill NEVER visit again and if you're in any way disabled or infirm, be prepared for many cobbles and stairs. Little evidence of disabled access. Such a shame for our heritage to be treated this way. ",Get ready to be processed.
"March 15, 2012","Pay the heavy entrance fee and then set off on the one way system through the Tower, miss anything and want to go back, forget it, bit like being in Ikea. And then! pay extra to get a glimpse of the Crown jewels after an interminable queuing experience. When finally getting into the jewel room I was tapped on the shoulder by an attendant and told to move along when I dared to stop for a closer look!   Give it a miss, go to the wonderful museums available in the city. Nearly all free!",Put This At The Top Of Your List
"January 9, 2012","This was a London attraction at the top of our ""must see"" list.  We are glad it was.We purchased our tickets ahead of time and saved a bit of time.  The line to enter the exhibit seemed long but it moved very quickly.Once in the exhibit, we were most impressed--from start to finish.  The swords, crowns, and other jewels are stunning.  I highly recommend this!","Great choice, tour a must!"
"October 27, 2011","We were low on cash whislt in London, so we could only see and do a smahll handful of things. I was debating whether this was going to be a good choice for our coin, but afterwards I was so glad we did. We went reasonably early on in the day, and lucky we did, there is so much to see and do. We spent all day there and still didnt see everything.When we arrived, we tagged along with a tour led by one of the Warders. He was so entertaining and was a great character. It was in no way cheesy and he managed to get many genuine laughs from a large audience. He was so informative and if that was the only thing we had of got out of our Tower visit, we would have left happy.We saw the Crown Jewels and explored the rest of the castle. There are so many rooms and pathways, we didnt quite get to see it all. We needed a break during the day so we went to one of the cafes and enjoyed some tea & scones. They were reasonably priced and were delicious. Being Australian, we didnt have a great deal of English History or Royal Knowledge, but this has really generated our interest and thirst for more.I highly recommend a visit here and definatly try to get involved in the guided tour.",More than a piece of history
"October 26, 2011","I'd never realized the tower was not just a tower, forgive my ignorance... It was such a good visit, I must tell you.Tips: Be there at 10 am, no queues. Buy your tickets at the gift shop at the exit of the Tower Hill subway station, way cheaper.The place is so well taken care of, it's worth a bunch of photographs. There's a lot to see: the scaffold site, the Bloody Tower, the Crown Jewels, the Fusiliers'Museum, the White Tower, the Medieval Palace, the Traitor's Gate seen in so many movies and tv series. It can take a couple of hours but it's totally worth it. The Beefeaters are really nice to you and answer all of your questions with a smile, great!And if you still can manage, go up Tower Bridge, the view is amazing!",Amazing place full of history and great stories.
"June 26, 2016","This was our first visit to the Tower and we absolutely loved it! I researched for helpful tips for visiting and found some, which indeed made our trip here nice and fairly easy:- Choose the lesser evil: visiting during weekdays there's usually lots of student groups but then again on Saturday and Sunday there's bigger chance for large masses of people.- GO EARLY. Check the opening times and go there as soon as the place opens. If you want to see the crown jewels, DO THEM FIRST. Memorize the map of the Tower and learn the way to the jewels, so that you can walk directly there. When we did this, we didn't have to stand in lines, just walked right in. Two hours later there was a long line outside the building.- There are fair amount of stairs to climb, if you truly want to see as much as you can in one visit.- Do take water with you. You can buy bottles of water, beer and soft drinks among other refreshments from the Tower too (the cafe on the East side) but they are a bit costly.- Reserve hours for this sight. One or two hours even is not enough!- If you are under 18, you can not not buy things like letter openers (shaped like swords) from the gift shops. I saw someone wanting to buy a letter opener, but she was declined when she turned out to be 17.",Impressive Collection of Crown Jewels and Armor in Historic Castle/Prison
"August 13, 2015","Our trip to London was a bit last-minute so I rushed to put together a sightseeing itinerary. We knew we wanted to go to Tower of London to see the Crown Jewels (well, I did, anyway) but had no idea that we would be seeing multiple crowns (as well as staffs and swords) dating back to King Charles II (1660s); I expected only to see the current (Queen Elizabeth II) Crown Jewels. WOW!!!!  Spectacular. In addition, the armor of past kings on display in the White Tower, which we went through to get to the Crown Jewels, was amazing.Recommendations: (1) Plan a minimum of two hours. In this amount of time, you'll be able to view the exhibits in the White Tower, the Crown Jewels and take a brief walk on the wall surrounding the Tower of London and looking out onto the Tower Bridge. This was two hours at a fairly brisk pace. That said, don't be discouraged by the long line for the Crown Jewels. It actually moves really fast...about 10 minutes from the very end to the door. (2) check AT LEAST the day before you plan to visit  to see if there are any special events taking place on the grounds that you might want to see and plan your visit accordingly. We arrived at about 3 pm and had JUST missed a medieval jousting demonstration (horses, armor and all) because I wasn't aware if was occurring which was a bit of a bummer; (3) Realistically, you can easily spend a full day (or more) exploring the grounds and (4) No need to purchase tickets ahead of time. The grounds are quite expansive and can accommodate many people at once.",Nice for a day trip
"July 28, 2015","The ideal time to visit London’s attractions are in mid-summer. But there again most of the fellow tourists already know that and hence it is extremely busy. A visit to the tower of London, adjacent to Thames and near the iconic London Bridge is a nice addition to one’s tourist itinerary.","Interesting, Historic and Great Fun!!"
"July 3, 2015","I went here with my girlfriend recently.It is quite expensive but in my opinion it is well worth the money (£54 with a programme).The journey around took a long time which is great, several things to see, the crown jewels, the tower itself which is a 4 level museum, the royal fusiliers regiment HQ (I think it was theirs).Nice, reasonably priced cafe on site with great flapjacks.... and I know my flapjacks....All in all:Great visit.Super interesting.History is great.Architecture is beautiful.Loads to see.","An important place in British history, included in London Pass"
"June 25, 2015",This place is one of the world’s most famous fortresses/royal palace. We spent around 3 hours here. It's worth to visit. A tour by Yeoman was fun and valuable (it's included in the price of an entry ticket).More about Visit the Tower of London with The London Pass http://goo.gl/WTxjq2,Great Visit
"June 9, 2015",Great Visit......enjoy.......This was an excellent way to spend a few hours in London..... recommend...,Poor customer service
"March 28, 2015","Tried to visit yesterday with a valid 2for1 voucher I had, along with my required train tickets. However, it wasn't accepted with the supervisor stating it was a school holiday and the offer had been withdrawn. It certainly isn't a school holiday in the north, and by the looks of all the school children in their uniforms not in the south either. Decided to spend my money on a place that actually wanted my custom and left. Not worth the £25/person entry fee!",Good attraction
"March 6, 2015","It is recommended to take a tour with Yeoman Warder. It is enjoyable and provide you with the information about the place and the history. Don't take audio guide, you will pay 4 pounds just to listen to the same information from the tour.Tip: come before 11:00am, otherwise it will be crowded.",We queued and queued
"November 2, 2014",And after horrendous queues to pick up tickets and then horrendous queues to get through security we gave up before we even got in! Totally unrealistic queues during half term -don't do it! Disastrous visit. Children were gutted.,Amazing time....
"October 31, 2014","Great day had by the four of us, Nanny, Mummy, Son (9) & Daughter (7).We got there early, we were there at 8:15am & walked round the whole site seeing every bit of the poppy moat display.We then got in the ToL queue at about 20-quarter to 9am, this meant that there was only a handful of people in front of us....unbeknown to us at the time, this also gave us a massive advantage to seeing the Crown Jewels with absolutely no waiting & hardly anyone in there with us. Straight after the CJ's we went to the Torture Tower, there was about 4-5 people in front of us so we didn't really wait.By the time we came out from the TT & went over to the Bloody Tower the queues had started to build up, from that point on the queues just got bigger & bigger for the Crown Jewels & the Torture Tower. It felt like we were ahead of the pack wherever we went, as we'd been in the main attractions first.We had no problems walking round the tops of all the walls & could take our time wherever we went, we didn't feel rushed & we saw & did everything.We really did have a fantastic time here, the kids thoroughly enjoyed everything. I love the way things are displayed or shown for you to understand what it was like, my children didn't get bored once & kept asking questions after each bit.It's really emotional seeing all the poppies in the moat & awful to know that everyone is a life lost to war. I'm so glad I bought one before they all sold out.One last thing...I pre-purchased our tickets online before we went, another 'phew' moment!!! As there was also a queue for entrance tickets.Totally & utterly recommend visiting here!!!!Carole : )",Great Experience...well worth the cost
"September 11, 2011",I am so happy I chose to visit here. I was only in London for a day and a half and had to decide out of all the attractions which to take advantage of. Everything is a bit pricey but the Tower London which I ended up spending about half a day was worth it. There is so much to do and learn here... Much more than just the crown jewels if you enjoy history.,Getting to the roots of London
"August 27, 2011","Although whilst on  holiday I always visit a landmark or attraction to enjoy the experience, I always make it a point to get a little bit of history of the visited locality. Tower of London is surely a landmark in London just as the Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Yet to visit the tower of london you need at least three hours.  This place is full of history surrounding the attrocities committed by certain medieval kings and queens.  Make sure you get to the Yomen tour which is included in the entrance ticket. This tour starts every half an hour from the internal main gate of the tower of London. It is very informative and at the same time enjoyable.  There is so much to admire inside this place even though this place is more for adults. Yet children will also enjoy themselves even if if a bit tiring getting from one building to another. nevertheless a visit to the tower of london is a must and not to be missed,  Also do not forget the ceremony of the keys which is held at about 8.45pm. This ceremony is only for ticket holders which anyone can get for free at least two weeks before the visit.",Favorite London attraction!
"August 26, 2011"," The Tower of London  was probably the greatest attraction in london. It was included in our London pass so we didn't even have to pay extra for admission. There is 1000 years of history at the tower. There are enough exhibits and activities to stay busy all day so make sure to plan enough time. Our favorite exhibit was the crown jewels. It's a must see, especially on a first trip to London.",Tower of London visit with audio headphones a must.....
"August 26, 2011","We arrived at the Tower of London, expecting to join in the pre arranged guided tour that they provide with admission...Big problem, there had to have been 100 people in the group, we could'nt hear anything being said...we left, decided to just tour on our own...Big mistake...after 20-30 minutes, not really understanding all the detail's of each of the landmarks, went back to the entrance, and paid for a headphone and pre recorded audio of each of the buildings, and their rich history...big difference....If we had not done this, we would have left after just seeing the Crown jewels, and not enjoyed all the other historic sites on the premises....Very Important....",Terrific tower - London legacy
"August 26, 2011","Spent half a day here, brilliant experience. Lots to see and do. Food and drinks expensive, so take your own snacks. Jewels were beautiful. Best to visit early in the day, less people! ",A Stone Jewel in a modern setting
"May 26, 2011","We (myself, wife and 12 year old daughter) went to see the Tower of London on Easter Sunday. Crazy, you say!! Not really, the line-ups were a bit long first thing in the morning however purchase your tickets online and then bypass the initial ticket booth lines and ealk to the info centre just further along; walk in, no line, they print the ticket based upon your receipt number and just like that you are in a much shorter line.The weather was fantastic and the Tower was better. The attraction is very well kept; go the the CrownJewels first thing; no crowds and a more relaxed atmosphere (later in the day, the lines were probably over a thousand people in length). There is lots to see and do (the wall walk was great as my daughter and I got caught up in the idea we were defending the tower). Chilling in places with the poignant carvings in the walls detailing the words of the unlucky guests (in some cases, very possibly the last words). There is a great Tower of London app for the ipod however make sure you pop by a store area first so the app can load (it is free but needs a quicker signal). There are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore (some require lining up ) and all are worth it. The Beefeaters are excellent sources of information and do not mind posing for a pic or two. As well, there were costumed actors wandering about providing glimpses of the times...they were well versed in their roles. There was even a reenactment of the stealing of the jewles from 400 years ago...well acted and funny too.All in all, well worth the price of admission. Save a few pounds and order online and also save one set of lines.We spent a lovely day there and it was weasy to get to via the tube. Food choices are fairly slim (the fish and chips places near the tower are not bad but expensive).",not good for wheelchair access
"March 1, 2011","We visted many of London's attractions whilst there for a short weekend, but i must say wheelchair access in the tower of London was terrible. As my father is disabled, there was very limited access to all areas, so didnt agree paying for him. He enjoyed looking at the crown jewels but apart from that there was nothing else he could see, i found it hard work pushing the wheelchair over cobbled streets and up hills as me father is a large gentleman. Beautiful place to visit though.Nicola (Lancashire)",a yeoman warder tour is a MUST
"August 21, 2010","we had our first visit to the Tower of London in August 2010 and it was definitely quite interesting.  we stumbled upon it after riding the ""hop on/hop off"" tour bus & luckily happened upon one of the last tours leaving with a yeoman warder.  he was FABULOUS and so knowledgable & personable and just made the visit that much more interesting.we visited the white castle, which was fascinating in that it's very, very, old, but be forewarned, there are lots of steps, so for those who are less athletically inclined, this might not be so fun!the crown jewels were the absolute highlight of the visit, and while the line to get into the actual exhibit seemed quite long, it actually was quite bearable.  our warder tour guide told us to wait until close to closing time to minimize our wait, and we were happy to heed his advice.  we waited about 20 minutes in total and once inside the building, the line moved quite quickly.  there is a movie portion whilst waiting in line that explains the history of what you are going to see, and then when you do get to the actual jewels, a moving ""sidewalk"" keeps the crowds going.we spent about 2-3 hours here & that was plenty.  highly recommend taking a river cruise back up the thames from tower, as it's a great way to see the city & nice to sit down after touring the tower!",fantastic
"September 24, 2008","My daughter & I were in London for 7 days in late 2007.One day we walked  & walked and ended up at  the Tower of London. We hadn't planned on being part of a guided tour. But as one was starting when we got there we decided to tag along.It was just fantastic. The Beefeater who was our giude was sensational. He was funny, a great storyteller, & had  a vast knowledge of history.My advice to anyone visiting London is to make sure you do not forget to go to the Tower of London. I hope you are lucky enough  to have the guide we had. An experience not to miss.Shirley & Amanda",Must See in London
"June 20, 2008","Everyone should visit the Tower when in London (early in your visit so that you can get a good history lesson that applies everywhere).  Arrive early in the day, skip the Beefeater tour and head right for the crown jewels (before the crowds), then go back and get the Beefeater Tour.  The guards are very knowledgeable and tell funny stories (they do, kiddingly, pick on your children - my teens thought they were hilarious!  We also enjoyed a short show with peopel in period costumes doing some fencing and sword play.  The prices are high, but well worth it!",Great Place to visit!
"May 26, 2008","This is a great place to visit while in London. I would deffinitely suggest getting the guided audio tour as you learn so much more then you would just reading the descriptions.  The Tower Bridge is also about  a 3 minute walking distance from the Tower of London and worth the walk across (didn't pay to walk above but walked the pedestrian path across).  t was raining all day when we went to visit but it was still worth the trip.One other suggestion, if you have time, is to head over to the National Gallery (free of charge) once finished with the Tower of London so you can put a face to the Kings, Queens, prisoners etc. you just learned about at the Tower.",A must see experience in London
"August 10, 2007","The Tower of London is a must see for anyone traveling to London for the first time. When going there, I notice there was no line for buying tickets, which is great. The tours happen every half of the hour (ex. 10:30). But check on this as it may have changed. The best thing is the guild tours are free (by the Yeoman Warders dressed in red suits when I went to visit). It takes about 3 hours to see everything, but worth it. If english is not your native language they do have a rental place where you can rent a headset which will talk about the Tower of London as you walk around it (I think it is about 5 pounds in price). ***phil",Watch out for Edward I
"January 29, 2007","Spent about 3 hours at the Tower with a 10 year old.  Wonderful experience, especially the drama in the medieval tower.  Worth checking when it happens.  Edward The First was so interesting.  Dont forget to see the crown jewels and take the guided tour of the White Tower.  Several well priced cafes and restaurants close to the tower.  Take The Thames Cruise back down the Thames to Westminster Pier (beside Houses of Parliament), opposite London Eye.",A mirror through the Thames' winds
"August 28, 2004",I discovered through the Tower Of London the ages' reflection with a deep selection of what London has best and most wonderful!,Not to be missed!
"September 12, 2003","Being the site of 900 years of history, there's quite a lot to contemplate here. Much more so than it's name might imply.An enthusiastic Beefeater told the story of the Tower's history with great drama and humor.My visit sparked an interest in English history and upon returning home I sought out books and films to learn more about the characters associated with the site.I enjoyed the 3 or 4 hours I spent here and would like to go back to the Tower of London on my next visit to the city.",AMAZING
"May 25, 2021","Amazing - a must see when in London. You can see and feel history around you, beautiful views of London. Recommended if you are in town.",Super Recommended
"November 1, 2020",Absolutely recommended for public of all ages. Truly educational and a fantastic way to spend the morning or afternoon. Spare at least 2 to 3 hours to enjoy this magnificent piece of history. The Crown Jewels a must but there are lots things to see and do. The facilities are kept ultra clean. Súper recomend to book a tour with one of the Beefeaters. The souvenir shop is lovely and if you are hungry we spot there’s a hotdog/cafe wagon near one of the souvenir shop inside the Tower complex. Absolutely loved it!,A wonderful historic landmark
"October 31, 2020","Tower of London is  a popular tourist attraction situated on the bank of the River Thames. The Tower of London was a prison from which there was supposedly no escape. Throughout its history, the building has been a fortress, prison, palace, and has even served as a zoo. There is a well-exposed armory here, as well as an exhibition of weapons, coronation insignia and jewels. The Tower Fortress is still inhabited today. Its community is made up of Yeomen Warders and their families, the Resident Governor, officials, and a chaplain and a doctor. The symbol of the Tower are the ravens that live in the towers of the fortress. They are particularly protected and fed, and they also have their guardian among the guards. The reason is the legend that says that as long as the ravens live in the fortress, the British Empire will last. For history lovers, this is a real intellectual treat. For many exhibits, descriptions in several languages, A well-guided visitor's route allows you to get to know this  place well.  A must see in  London.",Amazing historical location with so much to see 
"December 31, 2019","You can spend hours in this incredible piece of history, listening to the Beefeaters or audio guides, seeing the high quality exhibits. However if you don’t want to queue for an hour plus for the Crown Jewels you need to be early and go straight to this. ",From Silken Thomas to Capt Blood
"December 31, 2019","Visited here over the Xmas period , need to get in early as it’s a great attraction , main draw is the Crown Jewels , overall if you a history buff or not it’s a great place to Visit , prob most impressive is the Norman church in the white tower , would recommend to visit , steeped in history and watch out for the Queens Guard , don’t get in their way , because they won’t get out of your way !!! Ravens are very boisterous and fun to watch . ",Awe-Inspiring
"December 31, 2019","The Tower of London is one of the most majestic sites of London, and a must-see even if you only have a day or two. But go early.  I cannot stress this enough.  We paid for a special early admission to watch the opening ceremony, and we were first to see the Crown Jewels.  Within an hour the line was crazy just to get in the building.  The early access is definitely worth the price, about $75.",Great day despite the crowds
"December 30, 2019","We came between Christmas and New Year, and the crowds were out in full force. We got there right when it opened, and went straight to the Crown Jewels, so we waited less than 10 minutes to see them. By the time were done with the Crown Jewels display, the queue was out the door, and by noon, the queue threaded back and forth by the white tower three times. Despite the crowds (we are talking wall to wall people in the towers), we had a lovely time. We learned a lot in the armory. There were Victorian Christmas characters around to chat with, and a live band played Christmas music. Very interesting history, and I love the immersive storytelling via video on the walls (in the queue for the Crown Jewels as well as in the Bloody Tower, for example) - I haven’t been to the Tower in 10 years and those were a great addition. Crowds around the beefeaters were so large we couldn’t hear their tours, so we appreciated the video storytelling. I highly recommend visiting, and if it’s to be a busy day, I recommend getting there early and heading straight to the crowd jewels to avoid the long wait. ",Missing staff
"December 30, 2019",There was a lot of visitors this Monday 30 December. The waiting line was impressive and we unfortunately had to leave it after 90 minutes of patience with our 2 young kids and tens of people jumping the queue which was without any control. The entrance price is high enough to finance better service to visitors. Pre-booking visiting slots should be proposed.,So much History at London Tower
"December 25, 2019","If you do one stop in London to cover experiential history this is the place to go.  It covers hundreds of years in short digestible chunks that is easy for the kids to follow along.  Walk thru the castle see the Crown Jewels, see the difference in architecture, armor and government over the centuries.  Best to eat before you go - there’s a small snack shop with limited options and you may want to spend a few hours there.",We Saw and Learned Quite A Bit
"December 22, 2019","We only had 2 hours to see everything at the Tower of London and we made good use of our time. Man or woman, be sure to visit the Crown Jewels as even swords are in this display. The armory was impressive and walking the armaments was a nice little tour. We enjoyed it very much. ",Take the Tour!
"December 17, 2019","I very much enjoyed the tour of the Tower of London. I do not think I would have enjoyed it as much or gotten as much out of the visit had we not taken the tour given by the Yeoman Warder (aka beefeater). Our tour guide was fantastic, but this is no ordinary tour guide. The yeoman form the Royal Bodyguard and each one has at least 22 years in the armed forces before they can apply for this position. Our Yeoman was very knowledgeable and entertaining, but he also took his job and position very seriously. This was a highlight of my trip. Plus, of course, the crown jewels are located here which was incredible to see.",Worth it! 
"December 15, 2019","Ordered our tickets online via Klook to save some money, which worked great. Did the yeoman tour and had an awesome time. The warden was informative, funny and spoke with passion!I would recommend going early in the day, because it gets crowded quickly. Luckily there is lots to see, so there is lots of things to discover! ",Jewels and Ravens
"December 4, 2019","Took the advice of some tour books I read beforehand and got there first thing in the morning (purchased my ticket online).  Headed straight for the crown jewels to avoid lines that would soon form, then took the beefeater tour, which was amusingly given by celebrity guide Alan Skaife, aka Ravenmaster, then did a tour (actually a one-on-one Q&A since no one else attended) of the white tower, then some free roaming.  A pretty good solo itinerary which still took over 2 hours. I think 3 hours would have been comprehensive, but I had other places to go and the crowds were getting thick.  Pretty compulsory for a London visit.",Excellent wish we had more time to explore
"October 25, 2019",Tower of London was one of the main reasons why we went to London. Got tickets easily and no queue so lucky from what people say. Inside it’s magnificent like a TARDIS. Short queue for Crown Jewels also and this is very well done. Loved seeing the Ravens and armed guards in their bearskin hats. ,Amazing experience 
"October 24, 2019","Visiting the Tower of London was the best! The weather wasn’t in our favor. It was cold and rainy, so I can only imagine how much better the experience would have been minus that. Please make sure you have access to a map. The grounds are crazy confusing. I arrived right at opening (‪9am‬) and went straight to the Crown Jewels. Plan to do that first to avoid the long queues. Huge thanks to the nice, funny Yeoman Warders who pointed me in the right direction for the tour. I was so lost lol! We visited one of the museums, which was quite ineresting and made it to the Yeoman tour just in time. Due to the rain, the tour was in the chapel and we heard some very interesting stories about the tower and the executions. Wow, just wow! Our last stop was the tower itself. Be prepared to walk up and down stairs if you want to get the full experience. Going up was okay, but we had to take a full spiral staircase all the way down. It was definitely an experience!",History brought to life
"October 23, 2019","I had never been in this iconic complex before (""Tower"" doesn't quite explain it properly) and ended up spending more time there than I'd planned. Things were certainly livened up by Yeoman/Beefeater Scott Kelly who quickly won his audience over. His black sense of humour had everyone in stitches but it didn't detract from the sometimes awful history of the place. I certainly came away from the place with a new-found appreciation for it. The British Crown Jewels are also here, of course. Still, I found myself coming away thinking more about the many people who had been imprisoned in the various buildings in the Tower. The entrance price is steep but there is plenty to see. The staff are also pleasant and friendly. I visited early on a weekday in mid October so the crowds weren't bad at all. I'm told it's an entirely different story during the summer.",Walk in history
"October 22, 2019","Wonderful day. Not overly crowded but the line, or should I say queue, for to see the Crown Jewels was excessively long all day. However the other Tower of London highlights were not that crowded and just as interesting.  The Tower of London is a great historical landmark and rich in world shaping history.  It also sits right next to one of the most iconic landmarks in London the Tower Bridge. If your interested in history then this is a must see as it was for me. I purchased my tickets before leaving America from the Historic Royal Palaces web site. No waiting.",One of the best sites to see in London
"October 22, 2019","Simply, this is one of the most interesting sites in London.  One can learn a lot about the history of England and the Tower.Here are two suggestions for a good visit:  (1) Get there as early as you can because this is a very popular attraction.  (2) Take the free Beefeater tour before you begin exploring on your own.  It will make your experience so much more rewarding.  Our Beefeater was Sean and he was great.  The tour starts every 30 minutes on the hour and half hour from just inside the entrance, down in the moat.",Reputation precedes it - rightly so
"October 19, 2019",The reputation of the Tower of London is like no other. What this fortress has seen over the centuries is incredible. Preserving the past and educating people about history is just part of what makes a visit to the Tower special,Definitely worth a visit
"October 18, 2019","This bastion of history doesn’t disappoint.  If you are wanting an authentic slice of London - you cannot get closer than this.  Steeped in the gory history of London’s monarchy the Yoeman Tours are captivating, funny and informative. The staff are extremely helpful and charming.  If you’re not in the mood for a tour the grounds are excellently laid out so that you can explore all four corners without spending unnecessary time retracing you’re steps.  The crowned jewels, chapel and endless array of armour speak volumes of the wealth and might in the establishing of England. There is even a mini changing of the guard. Ravens and classic shots of the Tower bridge make it alone. ",Must See While in London
"October 18, 2019","I get it... there are many, many things to see in London; however, the Tower of London is so incredibly entrenched in history that it’s a must for anyone passing through town.  The kind of place where you find yourself thinking “ok wow I’m actually in England”.  Catch a Beefeater tour for the best experience (no need to schedule into one, they have predetermined departure times and you can tag into any of them).  Beefeaters (official name: Yeoman Wardens) must meet 3 criteria to become a warden at the tower, I’ll save it for the explanation at the tour but let’s just say it’s intense and the criteria cannot be met by an average Joe.  These guys seriously know their stuff and all have that true English wit.  Did I mention the CROWN JEWELS live within an exhibit at the Tower of London?  So amazing.  Honestly, my parents had recommended I visit the Tower and I agreed thinking it would be your standard castle, didn’t even realize the jewels were there. It’s very cool for all ages and really exceeded my expectations.  Not to mention the exit leads you to a beautiful riverside walk!",Fascinating
"October 14, 2019","Advisable to go early and head straight to the dazzling Crown Jewels to beat the crowds. Fabulous collection and fascinating to learn of their history. We then took our time to explore other parts of the Tower complex - plenty to see, skillfully displayed and explained. Highly recommended.",Take a beefeater tour
"October 14, 2019","There is a lot to see here, you can spend a lot of time trying to get it all in.  The tour is free, try to catch it or just join it if you see if happening.",Exploring Medieval Times
"November 22, 2019","I never thought this Tower would hold so much history! It’s like seeing Lord of the Rings, Hobbits, Snow White and the Huntsman come to life. There were characters on site as well...And actual British Royal Soldiers on post. So many towers to explore, each holding a story. There’s also a fun gaming area towards the end of the tour. Don’t forget to see the White Tower which is in the middle. We paid our tickets with a tour company not at the door. It allowed us to bypass the line. There’s a skating rink next door too!",Great history and the British Crown Jewels
"November 22, 2019","If you’re in London, you have to visit the tower. In spite of the name, it is a full Fort and Castle, not just a tower. Lots of interesting history. I highly recommend the Yeoman guided tour is free and definitely worth the time. The British Crown Jewels are housed in the Gallery, and also make time to tour the White Tower and The Chapel of St John the Evangelist.  It’s easy to spend 2-3 hours touring the grounds.",Amazing place
"November 22, 2019",Must see while in London,"This was a great place to visit to learn about history, explore historic buildings, see the Crown Jewels and more while learning about some of the stories of those who spent time there both grisly and take. There was a lot to explore and see! "
"November 5, 2019",Incredible site,"The Tower of London is made up of many buildings. The crown jewel part is well worth the long lines if you want to see the crown jewels. No photos are permitted. Another area has the old armor and another the baptismal font, challis's, etc. Very interesting. The Ravens are kept at the Tower. "
"November 4, 2019",Amazing!,"So much to see, the Beefeater we followed was very knowledgeable and great with a joke.  Only wished we were able to take pictures of the Crown Jewels "
"November 3, 2019",Excellent for the Crown Jewels and Yeomen Experience,"Honestly, this wasn't my favorite tourist attraction in London but it deserves a 5 star rating for the Crown Jewels and the excellent tour offered by the Yeomen Warders, the latter of which was AWESOME! It's funny seeing a recent review that mentioned a lack of armory, which I actually felt was a bit overboard and repetitive. I can only look at so many swords! Obviously, this is personal preference.We toured in early September in the morning, although we didn't arrive exactly at opening time. Given that, I was a bit worried that we would have to wait forever to see the Crown Jewels and that it would be an overwhelming experience. Luckily, there was really no wait and the crowds weren't too bad. I thought it was funny that they had a moving sidewalk that takes you by the majority of the jewels but it's actually a great idea to prevent people from parking themselves in front of the glass and blocking the view for others. You can keep going around if you want to spend more time looking. It was annoying that SO MANY tourists disregarded the clear ""No Photos"" signs and symbols (camera with a big slash through it for those who don't speak English) as the staff had to keep yelling at people to stop taking photos. I believe you can take photos everywhere else at the Tower, just not the Crown Jewels.Again, we so very much enjoyed the impressive Yeomen tour and have the utmost respect for their service. They provided an engaging and entertaining narration of the amazing history of this place. Not to be missed."
"October 29, 2019",Just as interesting the second time around,"I have visited the tower twice. First late in the afternoon on beautiful November day 2015 and An early morning dreary day 10/25/19. At both visits there were NO crowds. We used the London pass and walked right in. ( Other reviews commented on crowds we had none at either visit). This time I took the beefeater tour and it was very entertaining. Gary was funny, informative and entertaining. Then we walked right into the Crown Jewels and finished with a walk around the tower wall which has amazing views. The only crowd we ran into was in the delicious but unorganized cafeteria. "
"October 29, 2019",Palace PASS!!!,"My group got family memberships to the Historic Royal Palaces and visited three palaces for the price it would have cost to visit one.  And it provides a discount in the cafes and shops.  The Tower of London was the first my group visited and it became the BEST bit of the trip for some of our group members.  The crown jewels, the history, the beefeaters, the tour, the cafe.  It's all FANTASTIC.  DO NOT MISS THIS JEM!"
"October 28, 2019",Beefeater Scott Kelly is the BEST!,I did not know what to expect when we arrived at the Tower of London.  They were having a guided tour and we decided to have someone show us around.  Beefeater Scott Kelly was assigned to do the tour AND it was his birthdayHe is very personable and informative.  There were several kids in the group and he kept their attention through the whole tour.  I really enjoyed my day at the Tower of London.  It would not have been as exciting if we had not had the tour with Beefeater # 409!!!
"October 26, 2019",A must-visit,"My second visit to the tower was just as good as the first, if not better. I did the Yeoman Warder tour with Scott Kelly (#beefy409!), and he was fantastic! The tour was educational and highly entertaining. We spent close to 4 hours here, and enjoyed every minute. Well worth the entrance fee."
"October 13, 2019",Tremendous ,The crown jewels were amazing.  The vast amount of history in the entire place.  There is only one things I can say. You have to put it on your list while in London!
"October 10, 2019",I finally did it after 6 years & 2 trips to the UK,"The wait was worth it!It was not a pleasant weather day in London; we chose to walk along the Thames rather than doing the Underground; bad choice!However, the walk around the Tower was clear & dry.It is an amazing place, nooks & crannies everywhere, so much to see, so much to understand.I will do it again, even if it does take me another 6 years of waiting!"
"October 10, 2019",Tower of London,We weren't sure what to expect we went straight through with the London passes which was great  we did an audio tour then we thought let's do a guided tour with a beefeater which was brilliant ...very interesting place with so much history...a must do I  my opinion
"October 10, 2019",Don't miss it!,Be prepared for lots of stairs... But totally worth it! This is an amazing must see stop in London!! 
"October 9, 2019",Tower of London,"We prepaid our entry to avoid the long lines and were very glad we did! We loved our history lesson from the guide who is a Yeoman guide, it was very interesting and being a great story teller he had us shocked and laughing within minutes."
"October 8, 2019",Tower-ing history,"First and most important with all tourist attractions is Buy Your Tckets First, typically on line through multiple providers to get discounts and more importantly avoid the ques to enter which at times can stretch for over 1.5hrsOkay so you've done that and you're at the entry, with your backpack, camera, water bottle and or sunscreen / umbrella for London's uncertain weather. Next, take the guide booklet and enjoy the immensity of what is a renowned London landmark that has to be seen. Whilst its historical place is world known nothing prepares you for what you see until you're actually there. From the grand entrance, through the grounds with the various exhibits and demonstrations featuring recreations of the period to the crown jewels allow yourself a good couple of hours to absorb all the Tower has to offer. There is adequate seating in the grounds to rest, eateries to quench your appetite and thirst along with the obligatory gift shops for souvenirs catering to all tastes and budgets, it's a wonder Lloyd's bank aren't there to offer a personal loan or three... August through September weather was spot on for an Aussie used to the highs and lows our ever changing climate can throw at us, so if London is on your list of great cities to visit, plan ahead, get on line and get amongst it."
"September 29, 2019",Wonderful castle ,Always a great visit and the Crown Jewels are fabulous. It is well put together and you can also join a free tour with one of the beefeaters for a bit of local flavour.Children well catered for as well with specific activity book for them to follow along.
"September 21, 2019",A fascinating series of buildings going back to around 1200,"Generally speaking well maintained, the are different areas with fascinating stories to tell, from zoos, to prisoners, and spies and historically it takes you right up to the World War II; there is a good cafe area, and events for all (period costume), Beefeaters with their wonderful stories, irony and sarcasm, resident ravens, display panels, etc. Routes are organized into one-way systems which assists the flow. Entrance fees per adult are now about 27.50 sterling (or 30 with a donation) per adult and 75+ for two adults and up to three children. So, if you are intending going ensure you make the most of your visit, go early enough and allow as a minimum three hours. At closing time the Beefeaters are good herders, which they do with a lot of wit, and very thoroughly and you will not be allowed to stay even a minute or so beyond closing time."
"September 15, 2019",Great way to learn history of England,This was a very crowded day for us.  We had to wait in the line to see the crown jewels for an hour.  But it was worth it.  So beautiful with some incredibly large gems.  There is a lot to see in this area.  Many families with children where there and seemed to be enjoying themselves
"September 13, 2019",Ripped off by Trip advisor,"Tower of London was Awesome! Buying my ticket from Trip Advisor was not...the app messed up my date so I called Trip Advisor and they did nothing but tell me the transaction was final, with a promise to call me back and “see what they could do” ...they never called. So I booked with Expedia with a 24 hour cancellation policy and really loved The Tower of London. I will never buy with Trip Advisor again..."
"August 27, 2019",Wonderful!,The Tower of London was the best part of our trip to London. The history of the building and the architecture makes you feel you are back in time! The Jewels of the Crown are very interesting and makes you understand even more the history of this beautiful country.The extra fee for the audio tour was worthy.Definitely recommend this attraction when in London.
"August 20, 2019","Oustanding, go early for best experience","My wife and I visited here for second time as were here 7 years ago. Wanted to spend more time as we loved the site and exhibits. The key to this place is go early. Not sure why folks would subject themselves to crowds and long lines when it's avoidable? We took tube, got to Tower Hill station at 830, walked to entrance and were with the first 50 people there at 840. Buy your tickets before hand to avoid the ticket purchase line here and process, go straight to line for entry. There are no priority lines,everyone with a ticket is the same.They open promptly at 9, think it's later Sunday/Monday.Line was about 250 people by 900. We went right in and to the Building with crown Jewels display. Walked right in, no crowds, casual experience and amazing!By 1100 the lineups for the crown jewels section were over 2 hours long and the place was noticibly busier everywhere. By that time, we had enjoyed the most popular sections and without crowds for the most part. It was VERY busy when we left at 1200 and large groups strwaming in. This is a quality and unique experience, but not if you come at a the wrong time! Do yourself a favor and arrive 20-30 minutes before opening and you'll enjoy it so much more."
"August 17, 2019",Must see the Crown Jewels,"I would suggest you arrive early, and head straight to see the Crown Jewels.  The lines grow quickly.  They are truly amazing.  The rest of the lines weren't terrible."
"August 15, 2019",Accessible for disabilities,"Thank you for all your support, staff today were amazing and my daughter and son had the best time. The interactive staff Karen and John were so helpful with helping with lift access from floor to floor meaning they didn’t miss anything. The brought history to life for my reg blind daughter and autistic son, highly recommend booking the interactive tours ..⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5 stars team .."
"August 12, 2019",A must see in London!,"Plan to spend a solid half day (at very least) in this amazing place. So fascinating, full of history and I would HIGHLY recommend taking the time to experience it all. We stood in line to view the crown jewels and it was definitely worth it. Don't need to see them again but was glad to have spent the time to see them. Next time we go back I would plan more time here and would also plan for a tour to learn more."
"August 2, 2019",I’m a Tudors nerd! ,I love everything to do with the Tudor era and was itching to come here on our latest visit to London as I haven’t been since I was a Teenager. For peak season we didn’t have to fight the queues too much. We booked the audio tour for £5 each but I don’t think we needed it and they got quite weighty by the end. Of course the highlight was seeing the Crown Jewels- we didn’t get rushed along at all. Would thoroughly recommend a day here. We spent 3 hours and still didn’t do everything! 
"August 2, 2019",summer visit,"This is not a tour, merely a pass for all 3 places, we exchanged our paper booking into the tickets at the Tower of London. get there as soon as they open as the queues get crazy. you will be given a pass that is valid for 2 years. i would say it is impossible to visit all 3 in one day. but is easily manageable over 2 days. all the places are enjoyable and can be done at your own pace, plenty to see and do at all 3 places. there are security checks at the entrances so carry as little as possible, these do not take long. all in, enjoyable places to visit"
"July 29, 2019",Worth Your Time,"If you have even the slightest interest in English history, you have to tour The Tower. Myself, I am fascinated by the Tudors and many of them have spent time here.  After all, who hasn’t heard the tale of Anne Boleyn?The Tower is actually part of a huge fortress. I suggest you take a beefeaters tour (as I recall it’s free) you’ll learn the history of how this complex came to be. In any case you’ll see “Traitor’s Gate” through which Anne Boleyn entered The Tower just days before she was convicted and beheaded.Couple of tips, get your tickets in advance on line and go first thing in the morning. Best to arrive about 30 minutes before it opens. The line will be long but the area is photo worthy so you’ll be easily distracted by your surroundings. Also, once the doors open the line moves surprisingly fast."
"July 25, 2019",History Overload!,"So much to see and do here...it's a must see for all tourists!  A great place for families...my sons loved it.  Royal history, executions, armor, torture, crown jewels - there's something for everyone."
"July 25, 2019",Fantastic piece of history! ,Absolutely loved visiting the tower and it’s grounds. There is so much to see and do there! I loved seeing the ravens and learning a bit about them! Very well set up too in these challenging times 
"October 30, 2020",Great day out,"I am a Londoner who shamefully has never been to the Tower of London so we took today to visit.  It’s an incredible place with so much history and well worth a visit.  We hired the audio tour and it was well worth it, also the staff are always willing to answer questions if you want to ask.  There were absolutely no crowds which is a shame for the finances but fantastic for visitors as no queuing!"
"October 25, 2020",Wonderful visit,"First visit to the Tower of London as always put off by the crowds. Visited early October, eerily quiet but ideal for getting photos.  We arrived early but walked straight in, no issues with access. Very covid safe which meant one way systems in place. Some areas closed because of safe access issues but this was to be expected. It didn’t spoil the visit at all. No queues for the Crown Jewels which was great aswell. Beautiful surroundings steeped in history with very knowledgeable staff. The Uber boat also stops right outside so easy access from anywhere."
"October 23, 2020",Birthday day out at the tower ,"So due to covid 19 our plans for my daughters 30th has to be curtailed and after some thought we decided a day at the tower followed by afternoon tea would be lovely. The Tower is immaculate, the Crown Jewels simply breathtaking and the queues non existent due to the current situation! The Beefeaters were helpful and really friendly ! Superb day out made even better by the lackOfPeople"
"September 16, 2020",Very beautiful,"Long lines to access the British Crown Jewels, but it's really worth it even once in a lifetime. Very well kept, they even have a space where crows live. Really spectacular."
"August 16, 2020",GO NOW while it's quiet.,First visit for 40 years. Very quiet due to restricted numbers. Take advantage while it lasts.  Not fully open but plenty to keep you interested for an hour or so.
"August 16, 2020",The Tower of London not to be missed on any visitors agenda.,"I first went to the Tower in December 1957 as a National Service soldier in the Royal Fusiliers, I stayed there for ten weeks carrying out basic training, before joining my Regiment, in which I served for two years, twenty months of which I was posted abroad.I still visit the tower Often at the age of eighty four for Regimental reunions, Over the years I have got to know this wonderful historic place very well and it’s easy to say it really is a Crown Jewell in London’s great history.Recently there has been some talk of making the Beefeaters redundant, Im’e normally slow to anger but this utterly stupid decision is beyond belief, these totally knowledgeable are an integral part of the Tower and all in stands for.Leave well alone."
"August 6, 2020",Don't go at present,"Really disappointed, I don't think it should be open at present. I have been here before and had a great time. However at present more than half of the tower is closed. This should be made clear on the website before you book tickets. There's a one way system which lots of guests are not following; furthermore during the crown jewels section no one was following social distancing. The workers should be monitoring social distancing, we were standing back and allowing others to see the jewels then would step forward to look and yet others would be pushing in and leaning over us. Then to top it all off they make you exit via the shop to which they make you wear a mask to enter the shop and leave - bear in mind this is the only way out luckily we had masks. I must add the staff in the shop had no masks on. Reqlly disappointed and complete rip off of £25 per ticket. Don't go here at present - especially as hardly anything is open!"
"July 26, 2020",Could Spend a Whole Day,"Depending on your level of interest you could spend almost a full day wandering around. Recommend getting there when they open to be the crowds. If you do so, you can immediately go see the Crown Jewels without a crowd. Then retrace your steps back to the front to join a Beefeater Tour. They provide a good rounded introduction to the Tower --highly recommended. Once the tour is complete, take your time and explore the White Tower, Chapel, etc..."
"March 23, 2020",Family vacation ,"Very nice venue with everything from jewels to armory, interesting for everyone in our group. London Pass recommended to avoid ticket line "
"January 3, 2020",Great attraction and even better with the free tour,"We went to the Tower of London a couple of days ago and we lucky enough to join a tour with tour guide Clive. He was fabulous! Very knowledgeable, articulate, and funny. I would highly recommend going on the free tour and seeing the Crown Jewels."
"June 8, 2019",Worth the time spent,"There’s a lot to see inside. My suggestion is to buy tickets online in advance. This will remove the flexibility of your schedule but you won’t have to queue that much. Get the earliest schedule and once inside, i suggest go to the crown jewel first as that’s where the longest queues are. It’s worth falling in line for of course. The star of africa is unbelievable. It almost looks fake because of the size of it. Then probably do the beefeater tour (it’s included in the ticket). They’re funny and informative. Then do the tour of the white tower. There’s also a lot to see inside. Also, if you come very early, your photos will be a lot better because of lesser people."
"June 8, 2019",You have to see the Tower,"My wife and I visited with our adult daughter. The Beefeater Tour of the Tower was provided by Yeoman Warden Scott Kelly. His charge of about 60 tourists may have been daunting but he led us expertly and confidently through the tour.  He gave a lively, descriptive narration to point out the facts associated with the Tower. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the stories and history of the Towers' significance in the British psyche. We spent about 1 hour with his tour and then about an hour wait in the queue to see the Crown Jewels. It was worth the wait and the Crown Jewels are very impressive. One last thing.  Be careful of the ravens at the Tower. Do not feed them. It was a great afternoon and would go again with friends or family."
"June 6, 2019",I Was Left Wanting,"When you pay for entry and the tour I have certain expectations.  Sure we saw the crown jewels, but I think of the Tower of London I think of the prison and the likely fate of transgressors.  The chapel where Ann Bolin is buried was closed.  The tower where most were kept, and the prisoner graffiti I saw as a teen, was closed.  There is a exhibition of torture tools.  Closed.  But we got to see the garden and a couple of Beefeaters.  There were plenty of people . . . why is everything closed or off limits?!  It was a let down for us and wish we had our money back."
"June 1, 2019",Best of London,"If you're wanting old London and monarch history, this is a must see. The best site we visited during our 3 days in the city. Go as close to opening time as possible when the line is shorter and moves quickly, and go straight to the crown jewels. Doing that got us right in and viewing the most popular part. The White Tower is also amazing right in the center. Loved all the nooks and spaces throughout the entire grounds."
"May 30, 2019",A historic royal fortress,"Entry charges are around 27 pounds including donation. one can choose to pay donation or not. For students the charges are around 19 pounds. Located majestically along the river Thames it over looks the tower bridge. Initially it was a prison later converted to castle. Here one can visit to know the royal life of British kings and queens. Many jewels, scepters and crowns are kept here. There is also a war museum inside."
"May 29, 2019",Go early to miss the queues,This is our second time of going and so we went straight to the Crown Jewels as we didn’t go last time. We got there about half ten prepared for a long wait but though the queue went past the barriers it was moving so we weren’t just standing around. After about 20 minutes we were in. There is lots of information and glitz and glamour. Good to find out more about the history of the monarchy and see the famous Jewels. Very well organised and authentic. Liked seeing the soldiers and the ravens and the grandeur of it all. After we had lunch and wandered round we saw the queue for the Crown Jewels again. By now it had grown so long it was snaking right back down past the cafe. So by half one the queue must have been well over an hour.
"May 29, 2019",Worthwhile seeing,"I’ve been twice to the Tower of London, the first was in winter and ran out of time to see the whole place properly. On this visit we made sure we arrived earlier! Magnificent and interesting is all I can say. Definitely worthwhile visiting and seeing the Crown Jewels. "
"May 28, 2019",Loved it ,Fabulous to see the white tower and of course highlight of the Crown Jewels.  Definitely a must see when visiting London 
"May 28, 2019",The jaw dropping Tower Of London,We arrived 30 minutes before It opened just incase there was a huge line. Bit it actually wasn't that bad. If you arrive early there are a few places near buy to grab a quick bite and also take pictures of the tower bridge. The line went quickly and we were inside the grounds fast. Maps of the place are very helpful. There is so much to see. You can take pictures every except inside the jewel tower. The jewel tower is very impressive with its crown jewels on display. Simply breath taking. We had the London pass which gave us entry to the tower of London. This is a must see. There is a gift shop and bathrooms inside. Alot of stairs to climb so keep that in mind. So much to see and absolutely beautiful place. 
"May 28, 2019",Great History and So Much To See,"My husband was surprised at how much there was to see here. You can cover it in as little as an hour or you can spend several hours. It all depends on how much you want to see and how much detail you want to learn. There are many towers and buildings that you can enter on your own with a self-guided map. If you choose, you can listen to a Beefeater, or yeoman Warder, who will review some history and interesting information about the Tower. There are also warders in some of the buildings who are happy to answer your questions. The White Tower, completed in 1097 and once the tallest building in London, today has a lot of armor. The famous Ravens are outside to view. The Medieval Palace, created by Henry III in 1220, displays the elegant style of the day. The Queen's House is the official residence of the Tower's governor and guarded. And of course, the Crown Jewels are housed in one of the buildings. Note that there is a lot to see here but seeing the jewels themselves is a quick viewing. You are not allowed to linger too long. There are many other shining plates, crowns, swords and scepters to see within the building in addition to those with the special placing. Since The Tower is a major tourist attraction, getting here first thing in the morning is highly recommended. If you come later, you will wait in line to get in, and then likely wait in a line to see the Crown Jewels. We bought tickets at the Tower. We were there an hour before the ticket booths opened. By opening, the lines were long but since we were first in line, we moved along quickly. You can also purchase tickets online. As with most major attractions, ladies, your purse will be checked. Definitely worth a visit as long as you get there early. Otherwise, you will waste part of your day with so many other things to see in London and even in this area of London."
"May 28, 2019",Not enough time!,I had booked a tour of the tower for my family but did not realise there was so much to see there. Unfortunately I had planned about 2 hours for this as with teenagers I did not expect them to be totally interested. I was wrong there is so much inside here to see and so much history. The tour with the Yeoman was the highlight and I would recommend getting this tour for a very good insight as they live here full time with their families.
"May 23, 2019",Much ado about nothing ,"Like many things in London this place is highly overrated. The best thing is the view of tower bridge you get standing outside. We did at least get one of the “enthusiastic” Beefeaters to do the introduction/opening, which was the best thing inside the walls. The Crown Jewels were ok, until you think about the the privilege and exploitation they represent. Not my cup of tea. "
"May 23, 2019",Always the best to do in London !,Love so much the history and amazing mechanic design of the bridge It’s amazing how does it work in their. In fact I started from engine room as my first stop which was amazing And I am glad I did it the first stop ad it made me understand far better how the bridge work . Wow wow and wow Then good to go up the bridge which got two bridges and glass floor to experience above the bridge even! Glad also with god weather when I. Paired this time. High re moment. Will day number one item to do in London 
"May 22, 2019",Surprising,Not a huge “tour” person but upon entering we were told a Yeoman Warder would be given a tour so we decided to wait and go along. We were not disappointed. The Yeoman was very educated in his history of the tower and pointed out things we never would have noticed on our own. It was worth waiting a few minutes to join the group for the tour and it didn’t cost any extra from entry fee. I would highly recommend being guided by a Yeoman Warder. 
"May 21, 2019",Interesting tour. Excellent guides!,"The tour is interesting and full of history. The Beefeaters are excellent and very entertaining. You would not expect this much from a free tour! I would make sure to get in line for the tour rather than just wander around on my own, take the tour and then wander later when you know what you are looking at."
"May 20, 2019",Fascinating example of the layered history of London,"This was one of my favourite sites on my trip, although it was an after-thought. Booking online will save you a little bit of money, but you do have to print tickets off or collect at the site. They do not do mobile tickets. I highly recommend the audio tour for the extra money. It gives you enough of an orientation and history of the various parts of the site and in a clear, orderly way. You can read about the various buildings and rooms, but it wouldn’t be as clear which buildings date to which period of history.The Crown Jewels are AMAZING! You cannot take pictures of them, but that keeps the crowds flowing, I think. This is obviously a main attraction for many, so expect to line up. If you don’t see a huge queue already built up, get in line immediately before it does! This will save you a 30-45 minute wait. Either way, it’s worth seeing!If you don’t want to deal with the crowds around Buckingham Palace to see the Queen’s guard, you will get to see them here too, as well as the Beefeaters. Plan on at least 2-3 hours to complete the visit, if you do the audio guide and take the Yeoman Warden tour (included with ticket). This is obviously a popular attraction, so go early, when it opens to avoid the masses. "
"May 20, 2019",Great day out in London.,"My son had learnt about the tudors and was intrigued by the history so I took him here. We booked online the day before as it’s cheaper on the day. You need to print your tickets before hand, mobile versions are not accepted. The queue to get in was minimal. We were in after 2 minutes. We went at 11am. There were a lot of tourist groups so we just slipped past them all into more open space. The weather was good to us so we had time to walk around and take in the buildings peacefully. My son really enjoyed seeing all the armoury and weapons and the Crown Jewels. Lots of places to sit down both outside and inside exhibitions. Plenty of staff around, we didn’t need help but they seems friendly and approachable. There was a small shop selling cakes and sandwiches and a larger cafe that we visited. There was an array of food available, hot and cold and plenty of space to sit down and eat inside. I would recommend around 4-5 hours to see everything. My young son wasn’t interested in reading the small print he just wanted to see the artifacts and move on. We were out by 2pm as he had gotten tired and wanted to go home, plus the weather was tiring cloudy and windy. But we did see the Crown Jewels, the white tower, bloody tower, the chapel, the armoury, the ravens, the fusilier museum and the area where Anne Boleyn was executed. I held back when the big groups came through and they all seems to be rushing and pushing through, which I don’t appreciate. We slowly moved through once the rush had moved on. The gift shops sold many times from t shirts, pencils, sweets, feather pens, books to plastic knights swords and helmets. Very reasonably priced. We opted for a souvenir fridge magnet for £5. I’ve visited here a few times before and it still continues to amaze me every time. British history well preserved and at its best. I would recommend visiting in the summer months as it’s right by the river and as there is a lot of walking to be done around the site in summer you can enjoy the sights and the sunshine."
"May 16, 2019",Very Historic,"We were in London for a week and staying very close to the tower. We did the tour the last day. We weren’t sure if we should do it because it was 30 pounds at the entrance. So we decided to look on line and were able to get tickets for 24 pounds. Boy we were glad we did !!! It was such a great place to visit. Very historic and so much to see, you think it’s just a boring castle , but when you go in and see it it’s like a whole town in itself. You also get to see the Crown Jewels. Made me want to read more about it. Would definitely recommend seeing this . It’s a once in a life time experience."
"May 10, 2019",Can’t miss while in London,A group of friends and I visited on a rainy London day. Beefeater spoke on the history of the tower in the chapel. Self guided rest of the day. Give yourself 4 hours to see everything. Crown Jewels are amazing. Easy tube ride from wherever you are staying.
"May 10, 2019",Fantastic!  See the jewels first.,This is an absolutely amazing place.DO NOT BUY TICKETS FROM VIATOR FOR SKIPPING THE LINE.  We did - got there at 10 - huge lines - had to wait to buy group tickets and were told by the clerk that no one skips the line and that they had told Viator to stop selling these tickets as they are a scam but to no avail as they are still for sale.There is a ticket line and a security line.  The London Pass allows one to skip the ticket line which would be great as it is quite long.  The security line is really long but moves quickly.  Once inside go directly to the Crown Jewels.  We were there at 10:30 and only waited 20 minutes - within an hour the line was about 2 hours long.  I was skeptical about how interesting the jewels would be - they are quite amazing to see - definitely make this a priority.Tours - the Yeoman Warder guides are very interesting and funny - skip any outside tour company and just join a free Yeoman (Beefeater) guided tour. Definitely worth a visit!
"June 22, 2019",Visit to Tower of London,"Advantage of tour was tickets purchased ahead of time eliminated the need to wait in line. Beefeater tour was wonderful, but I think that is also included in tickets purchased on tower of London’s website. Not sure of other advantages to purchasing through trip advisor."
"June 21, 2019",Well worth a visit,Went for the first time today and loved every minute. My favorite thing was the Bloody Tower...but a close second was the Crown Jewels. So much history to learn and refresh my memory with.  My biggest suggestion would be to get there 2 minutes before they open and get in line for your tickets (if you didn’t buy them in advance). We were shocked at how much longer the lines were 1-2 hours after opening. 
"June 20, 2019",wonderful history,"This was our first stop on our London itinerary and it was worth it.  The Crown Jewels exhibit was great, and the history behind Tower of London is amazing."
"June 19, 2019",Visit,Great place to visit with a friends and family lots of nice things to do and see and learn about staff and guards are very friendly
"June 14, 2019",Humbled as a US citizen. ,The history is so humbling to walk in the same rooms as Henry VIII and other sovereigns. The tours given by the Beefeaters were well worth the time.  We had Scott Kelly who used engaging humor to educate us. The cafe had great coffee and some ok food.  
"June 14, 2019",Visiting Tower of London is a must do,"It was a bit of a rainy day - no big deal. Great yeoman tour + crown jewels. Give yourself plenty of time to tour battlements, see exhibits, etc. Friends (they were both from London) said it was a ""must do"". Certainly they were right."
"June 11, 2019",Be prepared for crowds ,This is a must to see but get there early to beat the crowd. Don’t fall for buying the tickets at the kiosk in the underpass as you have to queue up in the group booking line that can take longer than the normal ticket line. Definitely do the tour with the yeoman as they are very informative and funny. The queues for the Crown Jewels looks long but it flows very quickly. Worth the wait. All the other exhibits are excellent as well 
"June 10, 2019",Brilliant visit.,"So much history, so little time.Visit. A must see in London Cafe; a bit expensive for what you get.Listen to the free Yeoman Warder Tours to get a real feel for the Tower.Enjoy."
"June 10, 2019",Amazing historical site but priority ticket not helpful,"Enjoyed visiting the Tower of London in late May.  There's many amazing sights to see and the recommended three hours for touring the Tower is not enough if you really want to enjoy it.  I would recommend at least 4.5 hours.  As for the priority ticket, the group travel line is often as congested as the regular ticket line...even early in the morning.  Perhaps we will there on a very busy day but we waited in the group travel line for at least 25 minutes.  That being said, it is cheaper to buy the tickets online regardless.The Tower of London is worth well seeing but think carefully about if the priority ticket price is worth it.  "
"June 10, 2019",Probably the #1 attraction in London,"It’s a cliche and most people go here, but it is worth it. It is an incredible landmark full of Western history. This is a large complex. Most guidebooks said to leave 3 hours to visit—we spent 3+ hours and still missed a lot. Some tips: Go early. This is a popular attraction. We got in line about 30 min before it opened and the line behind us was pretty long. Go to see the Crown Jewels first. They have to limit the number of people who go in at a time. We went directly there and only waited about 5 min. An hour later, the queue looked like the line at Space Mountain. There are also free tours every 30 min. We skipped it because the crowds were huge, but it might be worthwhile. Make sure you print tickets before you go. They don’t accept any electronic vouchers, or emails. Those who failed to read this ended up waiting in the queue to get in only to be sent back to the ticket office when I hey reached the gate. The only downside is that by mid morning it became so crowded, it wasn’t really enjoyable anymore. That’s July travel in Europe. The other downside is that, interesting as it is, you are reminded that human beings can do some awfully horrible things to each other. "
"July 20, 2019",More than expected,"So full of history. I was completely surprised to find that the Tower of London is a large white palace that is not visible until you are inside the walls.    So cool!   There’s almost 1000 years of history in those walls.  We chose to do the Yeoman Warden Tour with a beefeater and am so glad we did.  His name was Gary and he was so informative.  He was also very funny!  Look up the requirements to become a beefeater.  It’s actually quite fascinating.  The Crown Jewels were worthy to visit.  They are beautiful.   We got to the Tower about 10 on a Wednesday, did the Yeoman Warden Tour, then went to see the Crown Jewels.   There was no line at that time.   We went right in.  We did tour the Actual white tower.   There are lots of cool armor suits and weapons displayed. I wish there had been more about the actual building itself.  It is beautiful. We also at at the little cafe.  We both thought the soup and sandwiches were good. Glad we did this tour.   It is surprising how many people have been to or live in London who have never actually been inside.  Make sure to go "
"July 19, 2019",Amazing historic site!  Get there early!,"The London Tower and Westminster Abbey are THE most popular attractions in London. (Well, and Buckingham Palace, but I visited in June and Buckingham wasn't open for tours until July). You MUST get there before opening if you want to avoid long lines. My friend and I only had 2.5 days to visit London, so we arrived at the Tower before opening the morning after we flew in. There were hoards of people walking to the entrance already and we headed there promptly with our London Pass cards in hand. While other attractions simply scan your London Pass card at the entrance, I soon discovered that The London Tower does not. You're required to go back to the ticket office and get a paper ticket. Lame. Luckily, we were there early and hadn't waited in line at the entrance just to be sent to a line at the ticket counter; otherwise, I would not have been a happy camper. But in June before 9, there were no lines, so we turned around and walked back to the ticket office and got the lame paper tickets and then came back to the entrance and handed them to the ticket collector. By now the Tower was just opening, so there still wasn't a line at the entrance. We just breezed right in. Sadly, in July and August, that is NOT the case. You can expect a long line before opening, and it only gets worse as the day goes on. *London Pass holders have skip-the-line (fast pass) entry at the London Tower; however, the longest line forms at the Crown Jewels room, which is found on the other side of the fort once you're inside. THAT is why you need to be there before opening. You don't want to miss that room.We power-walked straight to the crown jewels room across the fortress (as many sage TA reviewers have advised) where a line had ALREADY formed. What?? HOW?!  How did they all get there??  It was only about a 20min wait to enter the room, but it irritated me nonetheless. This girl does not do lines. Once inside; however, the line steadily moved past the paintings and exhibit items. A little TOO steadily. Visitors ride conveyer belts past the sparkling crowns and jewels, and while I appreciated not having to wait for a crowd to move so that I could see, it also meant one quick glance at each item was all I got.  *Sniff*  *Tear*    )':     Moreover, visitors are not allowed to take pictures in there. Boooo! The best thing to do afterwards is go back to the entrance and take a yeoman free tour of the fortress. A new tour begins every 20 minutes or so. We didn't take one, though, because we were pressed for time with only 2 days to see London, so we quickly ran around the fort, reading signs, listening to the audios, and taking pictures. I wish now that I'd taken one, but I still learned a lot about the history of the fortress. If you don't have time for a tour, at least walk the ramparts and take a picture of the Tower Bridge in the distance. See the weapons room and London's first ""zoo"" of exotic and wild animals that the royals kept from the 13th - 19th Centuries. Climb the stairs to the bloody tower and learn the history of the prisoners who were kept there and about the two princes who were imprisoned there by their usurping uncle, King Richard. The fortress building from the inside isn't that awe-inspiring; it's actually more impressive to look at the fortress from the outside. The portcullis is pretty cool, though, no matter which side you look at it from. I listened with interest as a yeoman explained the importance and function of the gate. When you leave, walk along the Thames and look up at the Tower Bridge ahead. Then turn back and look at the fortress and admire the sheer size and strength of it. Though impressive, it's not the architecture that draws most people to this fortress / castle / prison - it's the history embedded in its walls. Even if you aren't a history buff, seeing this site will help you imagine the traditions, customs, politics, and perils that were inherently woven into the fabric of English society."
"July 12, 2019",Tower of London,I tried to reach someone at Trip Advisor Corporate in Massachusetts on July 5th. Couldn't reach a anyone and several voicemails were full.I'll be home on July 30th. Someone from corporate should call me before I write my review.
"July 10, 2019",Awesome Historical Experience!,Well worth the visit. We took a water taxi from the Emankment pier and landed right at the Tower. Wandering around as a self guided tour was great and took 2 hours to see all the major areas. We attended at 10AM when it first opened and the line moved quickly. It gets VERY busy by mid-morning. The line up to view the jewels ques up immediately. Worth the visit. Warning - do not buy a “skip the line pass” online like I did. It is a waste of time as everyone has to line up. You are only buying advanced tickets. Anyone can take the Beefeater guide as well; that is not unique to any online offerings. 
"July 9, 2019",Must see but get there early ,"I recommend the free guide tour with the yeoman. Very interesting and funny but does get busy, so get there just as it opens at 9. We had to buy our tickets at the door and they didn’t open ticket booths until 9am so I recommend buying tickets prior and printing them off before you go! You can’t show some tickets off your phone. Also, see the Crown Jewels first!! The line will get ridiculously long the longer you leave it!! "
"July 8, 2019",Buy Tickets Directly Instead,We loved visiting the Tower of London and our Beefeater tour was excellent but purchasing this package requires you to stand in the Group Ticket line first and then the general entrance line second.  So it's double queuing.  We arrived before opening time and were surprised to find out that the Group Ticket office opens at exactly the same time as the general entrance line.  Didn't save us any time at all.
"July 8, 2019",Arrive early and head straight to the Crown Jewels!,"This incredible site needed 4 plus hours to see.  But best tip we received was to get there early by 9.30am to buy tickets or line up and then head straight to the Crown Jewels so as to avoid the plus 90 minute queues later in the day!  The rest you can do in your own time, despite the crowds."
"July 2, 2019",Walking in the steps of Royalty,Thoroughly enjoyed the Beefeater tour. Our Beefeater was called Laurence and he was very knowledgeable and entertaining. He explained the important aspects of the history of the buildings which make up the Tower of London in a way which was suitable for all ages and enjoyed banter with the crowd.We didn't queue to see the Crown Jewels due to the length of the queue but saw all other important buildings. The food in the on-site cafe was expensive but this it to be expected. A good choice of cakes and food and the room was clean and table were cleared quickly by the staff.I advise you to get there early and go and see the Crown Jewels first to avoid having to queue for a long time.
"June 26, 2019",Huge and Beautiful,I just got back from London last night and had to do a review on this place. I am very into history and loved the period of the Tudors (although it was quite a bloody timeframe). I was so excited to see the Tower knowing this was Ann Boleyn's final resting place. It was quite a walk around inside but worth it. There are shops you can purchase various items from if you want to take some history back with you which I of course did. Buy your tickets online in advance and you will have a very easy entrance.
"June 24, 2019",Must do!,"We spent the better portion of a day at the Tower of London and it was definitely with the price of admission.  We started off with one on the Yeoman tours but the group was simply too big for it to be enjoyable.  We were near the front for the first stop and he was witty and very engaging- but the group was simply too big- as we walked from stop to stop there were times I couldn’t hear or see him- so after the first 3/4 we broke off from the tour and had a great time exploring on our own.  The queue for the crown jewels is Long but it moves steadily and there were costumed actors roaming around enacting skits that made for great entertainment.  The wait is worth it- seeing all of the beautiful jewels and crowns was my favorite part! The various towers, the kitchen and torture room were all awesome we had a great cup of tea and slice of cake in one of the cafes.  There are also several gift shops that have loads of cool souvenirs if you want to shop and an amazing view of Tower Bridge.  I would definitely allocate the better part of a day for this- it’s too much to rush through in just a couple of hours."
"May 8, 2019",Step Back Into Medieval History,"In a city awash in history, the Tower of London may be the best place of all to see. Stroll paths walked by kings and villains. See the Crown Jewels. Try climbing the stairs to the top of the White Tower (if you dare). Allow at least three hours to take it all in."
"May 3, 2019",So muc fun,"Great place for families, loads of interactive activities for kids with a prize at the end!! There is plenty to see and do for both adults and children. Expensive gift shop and cafe but hey what can you do?! Would recommend lining up early to see the Crown Jewels, there was a little rain and the line was 40mins long, but bought a cute umbrella from the gift shop!"
"April 19, 2019",Wonderful but take a picnic,A wonderful visit and not sure which was my favourite bit. The Beefeaters were spectacular and Spike gave us a lovely chat in the chapel. Crown jewels are stunning and I felt really proud of our history even though it was grim in some places. Give the food a miss and take your own picnic as there are seats to sit on. Sausage roll £3.50 and the cake was over a fiver for a very pathetic piece. Dont waste your money in there.
"April 11, 2019",Must see for any history buff,"No visit to London is complete without a stop at the Tower of London. The history of this place is amazing!! I highly recommend joining one of the Yeoman Guard (beefeater) tours which starts from the moat every 1/2 hour and is included in the entry fee. It was recommended to us by our concierge and the tour truly brought the Tower of London to life. The tours are given by active duty guards and our guard, Lawrence Yates was fantastic. Besides seeing/hearing about all the history, seeing the crown jewels was unreal."
"March 31, 2019",A GREAT TIME,"If you can be there quite early (around 10 am), a guide will take a small group and tell everyone stories about this wonderful place, with a lot of humour! visit the white tower, and most of all, feel free to see the crown Jewels!!!"
"March 25, 2019",One of the best landmarks in London,"Someone told me this is a must when visiting London without spoiling too much and boy was he right. Being able to see to royal crowns, scepters etc from past and present was a delight and that's not to mention the Koh-I-Noor. Definetly worth every penny!"
"March 19, 2019",Long day out,"We got to the Tower of London at about 12:00 and there was so much to do. We started by going to the Mint which was quite interesting and there was interactive things for younger people to do. We then started in a room which leads you to a sort of one way system where you go around most of the top level of the castle which is different rooms that were used by different people in the past. It wasn’t overly busy and you could easily get into everything we just didn’t have enough time. As we didn’t get to finished the whole tower we are definitely going to go back. There are only 2 negatives, the price of the cafe was rediculous and we were greeted/served by a rude member of staff (Holly) who spoke to us in a rude way. Overall it was a great day and we are looking forward to going back."
"March 17, 2019",Amazing history,"I've waited for 35 years to visit the Tower of London and it did not disappoint. The aura of history was everywhere. The buildings were gorgeous. The crown jewels, the white tower, the ravens, the memorial for those beheaded. I will remember them for the rest of my life."
"March 11, 2019",Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly Rocks,"I had a personal tour of the Tower and it’s amazing history with the Towers newest and possibly most charismatic Warder, Scott Kelly.  His passion and enthusiasm is so infectious I didn’t want to leave after the tour had finished!Only recently sworn in, it’s obvious he’s in love with the job and as such you get the best experience possible. He personally invests in his audience, ensuring everyone who is fortunate enough to find themselves following will hang on his every word. He also loves a selfie and will pose in front of a camera all day long. If you’re after a memorable photo of yourself and a Beefeater then Scott is your man as he’s nearly as handsome as me, not quite though!!You’ll struggle to have a better time in London than a tour with this loveable rogue."
"February 20, 2019",A must see when in London,A very good overview of the history of England. The white tower give a pretty good idea of haw the Tower developed during the years. The crown jewelry is amazing.
"December 3, 2018",Must visit! ,"Would recommend anyone to visit here with an interest in history. It was a lot bigger than expected so there is plenty to see, it goes through the ages in different areas of the attraction. Seeing the actual armour worn by kings gone by was so interesting, as well as the Crown Jewels. If you book online it’ll save you some money perhaps, I would say it’s a reasonably priced attraction! Also plenty of opportunities to take some good pictures and get a great view of London. "
"November 29, 2018",Great tour with Yeoman Jason,My friend and I went on this tour last week.  Mr Jason was fun and interesting.  He gave good info and answered all of our questions.  I have been on this tour twice before but it always so interesting and fun.  
"November 26, 2018",Go Early!,"If you want to truly enjoy the Tower of London without the crowds, I would suggest signing up for an early morning tour. This will allow you to watch the changing of the guards and get you into the tower to view the crown jewels before the masses of people start filing inside. "
"November 25, 2018",Nice vist,The kids loved it here learning all about the bloody history Well worth the entrance fee England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 has so much rich history
"November 12, 2018",Mixing history & fun!,Very cool place rich with history told by the resident Beefeaters. Recommend that you purchase the “skip the line” tickets during busy seasons. Don’t bother during off season. 
"November 12, 2018",Trip Highlight,We  LOVED touring the Tower of London and especially seeing the Crown Jewels (i had no idea this is where the coronation items are kept). It was so educational and definitely a  must see if you go to London. Everyone from all ages with enjoy it.  
"November 10, 2018",Not to Be Missed!,"There are a ton of places to see in London but I decided that I definitely wanted to experience this one and I loved it. We went just before 10am on a Tuesday, it was a bit overcast and no line to buy ticket or enter! Cost for each adult was 29.5 pounds and about 14 pounds for our teenage son. Upon the recommendation of the ticket girl we went straight to the Crown Jewels before more crowds arrived. Amazing! No photos allowed in this exhibit. All the regalia used in the Coronation are kept here, plus many older crowns. So. Many. Jewels! Most impressive. We walked the battlements, learned about prisoners kept, killed and tortured in the Tower. We spend most time in the White Tower, where there was tons of armor, artillery and history, including some interactive displays that were nice and broke up the dry history a bit. After a while many school groups arrived and some areas were quite crowded. There are some nice places to grab a bite to eat, mostly casual able to serve many folks. We bought an egg salad sw, grapes, chips and waters for about 8 pounds. We didn't do the free tour with the beefeater but I would next time or maybe get the audio tour where you rent headphones and gear. Fantastic views of tower bridge from the battlements and inside the white tower. Oh, we also bought the guidebook for 4.99 at the ticket booth which has lots of info and is a nice souvenir. We left by 1:30 but you could easity spend all day there."
"November 7, 2018",Yeomen Warders tour,"We were at the Tower of London on October 26th, we took the last Yeomen Warder tour, we had the pleasure of the spiky humour of Yeoman (Jason,I think)Woodcock, we enjoyed his humour and did learn quite abit from the tour. We loved his humour and presentation, if you want to wander on your own, you are free to do so, we liked the tour and even tho the line up to see the Crown Jewels was long, it moved fairly quick......it would have been nicer to actually been able to see the Crown Jewels closer if the crowds were not 2-3 deep around the displays, if you are not good in crowds, definitely not the place for you, but if you enjoy history with a slice of humour, do the yeoman warder tour! Thanks Yeoman Woodcock!"
"November 7, 2018",Go Early!,"We went right when it opened and had most of the rooms to ourselves.  We went directly to the crown jewels and could take our time looking then to the white tower, then everything else. We were finished before the crowds came.  Lots of fun exhibits and several cute shops."
"October 29, 2018",Huge queue to see the Crown Jewels,"The Tower of London is an impressive monument, worth to see it, but we were waiting for about 1 hour in a queue to enter the hall with the Crown Jewels - take care of it especially if the weather is not good!"
"February 18, 2019",Interesting and busy,This is a very interesting attraction to visit given its history and exhibits.Be prepared for queues as it is very busy indeed. The Crown Jewels are one of the main attractions but the displays in the White Tower are also good. The views from the Tower of the London skyline are also impressive.
"February 10, 2019",Cannot miss this historical  treasure chest,"If you can see this on a Monday, buy your pass ahead of time, and arrive before 10 at the group sales office and there will be no wait except in the summer. The pass includes all parts of the tower and a Beefeater tour. (Either start of end with this). Try to see the Ciorwn Jewels first as this gallery is the most popular. Also be sure to explore the armory in The White Tower and be sure to take note of the size of Henry VIII's armor. You can do the whole tower in just over 2 hours, then follow this up with a visit to the Museum of London and a 5:00 p.m. Even Song at Westminster Abbey. Get a 7:30  reservation at Rules far in advance (London's oldest restaurant) and make this a Historical Day to remember."
"January 22, 2019",Superb ,I was enjoying Our tourist Guide! He his very funny And friendly! But I remember I meet two Guides also they are Rude just asking self they refused! I was thinking maybe not allowed to took them pictures but at least they say in a nice way not allowed something like that!! Anyway overall is perfect 
"January 16, 2019",Living History,"This is a must-see stop forAnyone coming to London. Almost 1000 years of history in one place. If you really want to get an overview of London and British history, this is the place. Kings, Queens, traitors, criminals, victims and their tormentors—it all happened here. Jewels, armour, implements of torture, ravens, a church, medieval and Tudor buildings, a slice of all aspects of life in London through the ages. Take the Yeoman Warder tour, it is not to be missed!"
"January 15, 2019",Felt like true royalty 👑 ,We did not have a lot of time so we did not visit every part of the expansive Tower of London but we did make sure to see the Crown Jewels. You will probably be amazed at the large size of the line but it moves fairly quickly and I recommend you do not miss it; it is by far the main attraction. 
"January 2, 2019",Super Tour,"We booked ahead on-line for the visit, and it mentioned we could have the beefeater tour.  It wasn´t too clear how to get that part of the tour, but it was right after the entrance-- every 30 min a beefeater would come up and start a tour.  Our guy was SUPER, SUPER, helpful.  Very informative, super funny and very knoledgable.  Told us the history in a way that young and old found it easy to capture.  Porbably one of the best tours we had"
"December 27, 2018",Excellent mix of outdoor and indoor touring,"Fascinating attraction that is a must see in London. The tour by the Yeoman Warders or ""Beefeaters"" is a must. The Crown jewels (assembled from many lands), as with most things that glitter, are interesting. The different towers offer some interesting glimpses into the past.Perfect for families with little children as there is ample outside space for them to enjoy but enough history and inside space for those curious to be satisfied."
"December 12, 2018",History,One of the richest place in the history of London. Takes you to the ages ago and moves you. If you are looking for some historical place to visit don't forget to this it ;-)
"December 11, 2018",Must-see-in-London,"This is a very wonderful tour. We spent a full day there with my family. However, please note that purchasing the tour via TripAdvisor does NOT get you in earlier at all. In fact, it delayed the entrance process as we had to line up to get the tickets from group ticket counter!!! So what's the point of purchasing the tour in advance. That said, Tower of London is a must see if you travel to London."
"December 11, 2018",Don’t miss it,"This was our third visit to the Tower of London. We returned to take a family member. You would like this attraction if you enjoy history. The main exhibits within the main tower feature loads and loads of armor and weapons in beautiful historic buildings. I thing the best part is the regularly scheduled tours by the beefeaters who are both humorous and informative. On the day of our visit, it was so hot that the  tour was shortened and took place in the chapel, but not all it includes a walk around most of the area. We visited mid-day on the first day of school holidays, and the line for the Crown Jewels was ridiculously long. If you want to see that part, you would need to visit at the opening time so as not to waste your visit time feeling like cattle. Also, if there are any planned talks scheduled, take advantage of them- very informative and interesting. "
"August 2, 2018",Love Stories or Blood and Gore?!?,"One of our first sight-seeing stops on a recent visit to London, The Tower of London tour was rich with England’s history and interesting tales.  Be sure to take the Warder Yeoman tour, which assembles just inside the main gate.  Our guide #BeefeaterDave was absolutely fabulous.  Knowledgable and witty, full of facts and fun.  The line to see the crown jewels was a little long, but well worth the wait.  It did move quickly and there are many things to see along the way, like the large raven, who are a big part of the Towers history.   We also enjoyed the Torture Museum.But, you’ll have to go see for yourselves to learn more..."
"July 24, 2018",So much to see!  Beat the long entry queue by taking a guided tour.,"You can spend an entire day at the Tower of London and still not see everything.  It's huge and there are many different things to see and do.But first you have to get in.  You can buy tickets ahead of time and queue up for the bag check and wait.  Or, you can take one of the tours such as the one run by London Walks which meet outside the Tower and then use the group entrance to skip most of the queue.  We paid 10 pounds each for the tour but got 12 pounds off admission to the Tower.Once you're inside, here are some of the highlights.Beefeater tour.  These guards are a symbol of London and the tower and give regular tours but with as many as 100 or more people at a time.  It's your decision whether to take one or not, but in my experience it's difficult to hear what they are saying.  If you're lucky to get on a smaller tour they are a great way to see the Tower.  They are extremely knowledgeable and tell their stories with humor, humility and compassion.The White Tower.  Dominating the middle of the Tower property, the White Tower was the original building.  Today it houses a museum on several floors showing historic suits of armor as well as many other artifacts and weapons.  Typically there is no queue to enter the building, but you should be prepared to climb steps as you ascend.  At the end of the tour you used to walk down a steep spiral staircase but when we visited in June it had been replaced temporarily with a work staircase while repairs are being completed.  The work staircase is actually nicer than the spiral stair although it makes a lot of noise.The Crown Jewels.  This is probably one of the biggest reasons you came to the Tower.  The queue (and there is nearly always a queue) is usually pretty long, but moves fast.  Expect to wait about 30 minutes.  Once you're in the building you'll still have to queue for an additional 15 minutes but there are audiovisual displays to help keep you involved.  When you finally get to the jewel vault there is a moving belt that takes you past the jewel cases.  Photographs are not permitted but you are allowed to go back and ride the conveyor as many times as you like.Wall walks and towers.  These vary from time to time, and this summer there were at least three different ones.  One includes a look at some medieval torture devices.  I suggest watching the queues and when they get short you take those when time permits.Beuchamp Tower.  A personal favorite and often overlooked, this tower was a prison for more than 100 years and some very interesting graffitti was carved into its walls.  It will only take you 15 minutes, but well worth the stop. It's up near Tower Green.Tower Green.  This was the site of the private executions.  Today a sculpture of a pillow marks the site.The Ravens.  Don't miss the spiritual guardians of the Tower.  They can't fy because their wings have been clipped but they still manage to climb to many points in the Tower and squawk at tourists.  Don't feed them your fingers, and if you go to the raven cages, ignore the squawking noises which are a recording.Toilets.  There are toilets near Traitor's Gate, down by the Thames exit, but they are very small and there is almost always a queue.  The better choice is when you're exiting the Jewel House - those toilets are larger and more modern.  There is a third choice if you dine at the Armory Cafe, they have toilets there as well.Food.  The Armory Cafe has reasonable prices and a good selection of healthy food.Exiting.  The exit is NOT where the entrance is.  It's down by the water gate and exits onto a promenade along the Thames.  You can have your hand stamped in case you want to leave and get lunch nearby and return.Have a great visit to this iconic structure known around the world."
"July 22, 2018",1000 years back in time ,"Great experience ! It’s just a beautiful site, full of history.We arrived early (before 10 am) on a Saturday morning via the very convenient Tower Hill tube station. We started with the Crown Jewels as there was no queue. At 11 we enjoyed the Anne Boleyn theatrical representation that was extremely interesting with great actors. Then we continued with the 1hour  Beefeater tour. This is a must as it is very informative and super funny.After that you we visited the rest of the buildings, including the guided tour of the white tower."
"July 21, 2018",The Yeoman Warder tour is a MUST!,"The tour made this whole visit worthwhile. Our guide was hysterical and had me laughing the whole time. He is a great story teller and turns history, which can sometimes be boring, into a story that has you wanting to know more. It was really convenient to purchase tickets at home and print them out before our trip. When they recommend getting there at opening if you want to see the jewels, they are not kidding! We got there about an hour after opening. The line for the jewels was about 40 minutes. By the time we left a couple hours later the line was more than twice as long."
"July 15, 2018",A great mix of history and entertainment ,We recently visited the Tower of London and must say I was impressed. In terms of value for money I found the Tower excellent value bearing in mind we were there for 4 hours.I would recommend going early and going straight to see the Crown jewels as the queues tend to be longer the later it gets.I would also recommend the tours with the world famous beefeaters. Not only were they incredibly knowledagble but so entertaining.Once you have done the tour there are also self guided audio tours available should you wish to explore more.There is a lovely restaurant situated in the Tower grounds-great for taking a quick break!Highly recommended
"July 14, 2018",Great experience,"This was one of the highlights of you trip to London.  The history of the place and the stories that surround the tower made this very meaningful and enjoyable.  Walking the grounds was an awesome feeling; seeing the crown jewels was spectacular.  One of the best parts of this were the tour guides giving the spiel in costume, explaining each stop very clearly.  It was like hearing a story so it was memorable.  The looks on the children's faces and the inerest they showed during the presentations was a credit to the staff."
"July 9, 2018",Crowded but Informative,Get there early.  There is a lot to see and it gets crowded.  The Beefeater tour guides are great and worth talking to.
"July 7, 2018",Definitely worth visiting,"Would recommend an early visit or towards end of day around 4, there is much more to the place jewels are just one part of it. I would say it is much easier to visit in the early morning 9-10 as far less visitors are around, tube is the quick and easy way to travel and it’s inexpensive."
"July 6, 2018",Must aee,"This is an important landmark to see. Lots of history in one location. The Tower grounds were larger than we thought. You could easily spend an entire day here. In the 3-4 hours we were there, my kids and I didn't see everything.  Arrive early or later as the lines for the Crown Jewels and Torture Rooms can be long. As you exit the Tower Hill tube station, there's a platform to view the tower. Cross the street and go right. Entrance location is a little confusing. The ticket booths are outside the tower. The price of admission is high, but it includes a donation of about £6 per ticket. You can purchase a ticket without the donation. It's no big deal. They don't scoff at you. We certainly dropped money in the gift shop. 😜The tour with a Beef Eater is a must - included with entrance price. BE ADVISED it's a little graphic as this was a prison and execution sight. You may want to prepare young kids. But I wouldn't skip the tour bc of that. The CROWN JEWELS are also a MUST, even if the line is long. It does move.  Kids stood in line and I bought ice cream. The cookies and clotted cream was outstanding!  As you enter, there's a brief history of the jewels and the Civil War. Allof the jewels are beautiful. NO PHOTOS. There's a moving platform that passesIn front of the collection of crowns. If you want to see them again, you can go again. If you don't see the changing of the guards, don't worry. The queen's soldiers patrol in front of the entrance to the jewels. That was also a highlight. One final note, there is a children's gift shop. "
"June 27, 2018",From William to Wills - 1000 years of history,"Simply a must see. Simply a must hear - the Yoeman Warders guides are outstanding. The blood, the glitter, the gripping stories, this is the place. Avoid weekend lines and crowds. Best go at opening. "
"October 14, 2018",What a ruthless place!,"So much gruesome history in one place, if you have time for only one place to visit in London it has to be this place. We took the free beefeater tour with our excellent guide who's name was Spike 40X ( I forget the last #) but he was super entertaining and full of information . The whole experience was fantastic...thanks Spike"
"September 26, 2018",Historic and Live Show Watch,"It is not hard to find this place considering that the tower of london itself is quite tall and are visible from far. Ticket price is okay, and the place itself is quite huge, with clear writing of historical event, if you love history and have time for all day, you can probably take your own pace and read as you go. There is some show going on at scheduled time, with purpose to educate visitor on what happened last time.Interestingly there is big black crow, where legend say does not fly away from the tower of london as they are the guardian of the tower. Worth the visit definitely"
"September 23, 2018",Get here early!,"This is a great ""self tour"" but you HAVE to get here early. Literally be the first in line and hit up the crown jewels FIRST. The traffic is horrible with all the people now and even in the off season the amount of people waiting to get in here was around the corner. We were about sixth in line getting there 45 min before it opened. But again well worth the wait when you see the crowd behind you. The Ravens are probably my favorite of this place. It's very fascinating and highly recommend!"
"September 19, 2018",Come late,"We passed by early just before they opened and the queues were ridiculous. We came back just after an early lunch and walked straight in. The queue for the crown jewels was about 30 minutes and the queue for the torture chambers, which we didn’t bother with, was longer and slower-moving. We took one of the free Beefeater tours which was fun and didn’t last long (15 minutes). Plan for a minimum two hour visit to see the White Tower, Crown Jewels and have a look around the castle. You could spend all day in here if you look through every building in detail as it’s all very interesting and well-laid out. There are lots of cafes and kiosks dotted about inside."
"September 18, 2018",Beautiful September Day,"I was fully expecting a huge crowd, so we bought our tickets online. Printed them at home, and walked straight up to the entrance gate and went in. I was very time saving and I’m glad we did that. The tickets were not for a particular time just date. We arrived about 11:00am and took about 2 1/2 hours. It was very interesting and if you didn’t want to buy the audio tour there were plenty of signs to let you know what you were seeing. Free tours inside with Yeoman guides all dressed in their black and red uniforms. The ravens were out in the yard, and watch yourself because they can be very “ friendly “.This is a very old fortress so saying that, lots of steps to walk up and down, some very narrow. The views outside are beautiful if you walk to the top of the wall. Perfect for photos of the Tower Bridge. Great for families ( just don’t take the little ones down to the Torture Chambers). The main royal crowns and jewels can be 2 ways, either a moving walkway ( that keeps the crowds moving) or farther  back has elevated viewing area which you can take your time. No photos in that area. The rest, feel free to use your camera. Excellent toilet facilities, they were clean and tidy. A great site in London, don’t miss it."
"September 17, 2018",Get up early as the Brits and those visiting London love a queue!!,"We experienced this wonderful piece of British history on a Tuesday (the Tower of London opens early on a Tuesday). Even at 9:00am the queues were long, but with the London Pass we avoided some of this delay. Make sure you see the Crown Jewels before 10:00 am as this is when the your groups begin to arrive. At certain times there are live performances in the grounds, but make sure you get on to one of the Yeomans Tours as they wonderfully entertaining and provide exceptional information about the Tower. Walk the battlements at the end of your time and then go and enjoy a pint at one of the many pubs nearby. Enjoy!!"
"August 23, 2018",Highly recommended ,This tour was highly recommended and we totally agree. We did this first and had an incredible Beef Eater guide named Shady. Be sure to take the tour of the Crown Jewels. 
"August 11, 2018",The Gem,The Tower of London was a great learning experience about London's rich history.  I would not miss the Beefeater tour which was enjoyable and surprising funny and the Crown Gems.
"August 6, 2018",History!,We went in the afternoon and bought the tickets righ there. There was no line. We went in no problem.  But we saw the line to see the royal jewelry and decided to see all the other sites first.  That was a good call because later the line for the jewels was less and moving faster.  The jewels are impressive!!!  The rest of the tower is ok but not presented as impressive as it should. Given I he importance of the place 
"August 6, 2018",London visit,Great place to visit. Such a rich history. It has everything for a complete family visit. Something to interest each member of the family. Crown jewels display is awesome. So is the armory. The guides ( royal wardens) are awesome.
"July 13, 2017",Must visit,"This is a must visit tourist location and is a place covered by the London Pass.Get there early so you have enough time  to see everything.   When you enter, just past security on your left you'll see a small sign indicating when the next Yeoman tour will start- make sure you allow time to go on this tour.  The Yeomen (Beefeaters) are hysterical and knowledgeable and you'll have a great time learning about The Tower of London.   It's free.  Get in line to see the Crown Jewels even if you think you have zero interest in them- they're really cool and there's other things to see.  You're there anyway so go.In the building across from the jewels are armor and weapons displays.  Again,even if you think you have zero interest go.  The craftsmanship is amazing.The torture room is a huge let down. One small room with a rack.  That's it.  The line moves quickly so if you want to see the device, get in line.There are a few reinactments going on throughout the day- I suggest getting to the exhibits first and walking through the tower rooms and if you happen upon a the actors doing something, stop a moment and watch.This attraction should take about 3 hours- maybe longer depending on lines and how long you spend reading and looking at the displays."
"July 12, 2017",Fantastic day out for all,"Five tips for a great day out with children or without - 1. GO EARLY!!! Especially if you are going with children. You won't regret getting up early when you see how much time you'll save. Book your tickets in advance and ideally have them sent to you before you go as even the pre-booked ticket queue builds up before opening time. If you have tickets to collect aim to be there 20 minutes before opening time. DON'T wait until the day before buying tickets and be there before opening time as queues develop very quickly.2. Do the Crown Jewels FIRST. Head straight to the centre of the Tower area and do this as you will be able to see more, spend more time on it and queue for a tiny fraction of the time compared to those who go later in the day. 3. Do the Yeoman Warden tour second. Head back towards the entrance and pick up one of the regular tours (included in entrance fee). Our YW was hilarious, knowledgeable and entertaining throughout and our children loved him. Not the dry boring experience they might have thought. Thanks to YW Thynne!!!4. Buy a guide book (not the children's one). It's great value, has excellent content and will enrich your experience.5. Be prepared to spend all day here. We spent 6 hours and it wasn't too long and not one minute was boring. Our children (11 and 9) were really engaged the whole time between the tour, Crown Jewels, towers, wall walk, ravens, museums and re-enactments (this last thing being put on for the kids and is again funny and educational at the same time)."
"July 5, 2017","That was nice place for visiting, also knights were amazing !","That was nice place for visiting, also knights were amazing ! Weapon room was very attractive and also jewelry room."
"July 2, 2017",Step back in Time ,Tower of London might be my favorite thing we did on our recent trip to London. Just being able to walk around in a place so rich in history made me giddy.  Here's the tips I have to offer----get there early as it gets busier as the day goes on. Purchase tickets on line as there is a pick up window to the left of the regular ticket window with a MUCH shorter line where you get to retrieve your tickets. Definitely go straight to the Crown Jewels first as that line also gets longer as the day goes on. You must take a free Beefeater tour!!  I believe they start every 30 mins near the entrance by the moat. We had George and he was amazing. He told the slightly colorful history with enthusiasm and humor when appropriate. Totally worth a visit here. All kinds of rooms and areas and ramparts to explore. Super easy to arrive by tube. Short walk from the tube station. 
"June 29, 2017",A Must See in London,"Years of history and free guided tour make this a perfect place to spend the day.  We booked a ""skip the line"" ticket via our hotel's concierge and we were fortunate to arrive just in time for the free guided tour that they have every hour or so by their ""Raven Masters.""   It was really one of a kind experience and you get to see the crown jewel and all the fancy armory on display.  I would strongly recommend a visit."
"June 16, 2017",Beefeater Tour Was Superb!,"A place filled with history. It is best to buy to buy tickets online so you can skip the queue and head straight inside. Beefeater tour: It is FREE! And it happens every 30 minutes. So if you've missed out on an earlier tour, you could wait for the next one or just randomly joined in another tour if you see one as you roam the place. Places of highlights:Check out the Crown Jewels! (Try to do this first as there's quite a queue to get into the building). Changing of guards: you'll witness this outside the Crown Jewels building. I witnessed them at 2pm if I've not mistaken. They have plenty of sessions (you might need to check on that). There are 6 ravens residing in this tower. If you're lucky, you will find them randomly seated and you could score a selfie opportunity with one of them. Enjoy and have fun! "
"May 26, 2017","Tower Hill Scaffold Site, easily missed site of Execution.","In the Small Park on Tower Hill at the end of of the War Memorial to Merchant Seaman and Woman is the Memorial to all the People Executed on this spot, you can easily miss this small Memorial and it was only 5 years ago I found out it's position, all the dates and Names of these unfortunate people are listed."
"May 24, 2017",Take the guided tour!,"The guided tour is an hour long and included in the price of admission.  It's well worth it.  Yeoman Warder McMenamy was or guide, and he was absolutely fantastic.  He clearly was passionate about what he was doing because it showed in the way he presented his information.  He provided a lot of great history while mixing in the right amount of humor to keep the group engaged.  If you're looking for a history lesson only, pay for the recorded tour.  Overall, the castle was so interesting.  We spent over 3 hours there, and only one of those was on the guided tour.  There's just so much to see and do.  Definitely worth the money to visit."
"May 9, 2017",History!,"What an amazing, if bloody, history this place holds.  Take the Yeiman Warders tour as it is a great way to get an overview and hear from someone living at the tower and continuing to make history moving forward.  Our tour was done by Moira Cameron, the first female Yeiman warder at the tower.  The Crown Jewels are stunning but it is the history and architecture of this place that shine above.  Must do in London!"
"April 30, 2017",Proper must-see location,"We recently signed up to Historic Palace membership and feel it is well worth the money as the Tower is included.The guides (yeomen) are excellent, giving character to the stories of the Tower. There is so very much to see. All around. Very nicely looked after too. There were a lot of people yet nowhere felt crushed.They could probably do with opening more toilets as the queues weren't great.The restaurant is also very good value. At £5 for roast vegetables with pasta it was tasty and plenty enough for lunch.Truly iconic, breathtaking buildings and surrounding."
"April 24, 2017",So much more than just the home to the Crown Jewels,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London. We used our London Pass to enter and getting through the ticketing process was very quick and easy. We received a guided tour given by a beefeater guide on the top of each hour and really enjoyed hearing the history and stories told to us. You get a lot of great back story about the history of this great place and it really helps bring the place to life. After the tour, you're free to explore the grounds further at your own pace and of course view the crown jewels. No photos allowed inside the hall that holds the jewels so put your cameras/phones away and just take it all in with your eyes. The jewels are stunning and quite unbelievable. I couldn't imagine visiting London and not including a visit here so make sure as you put your itinerary together, you include this incredible site."
"April 23, 2017",A Disappointment,"I visited years ago, and came again now with my family. It is nothing like it was.First I'd like to say that I acutely appreciate the historical significance of the site. I remember the spirited, authentic and delightful guided tour given by the Beefeater guides - and add to that the crown jewels, so what's not to like right?Well - brace yourself. The crowds are massive now, and although the British do a good job handling it, there is no getting away from it. The queues are immense. The number of people with us on the Beefeater guided tour was well over 200. It was very hard to move from place to place - or to hear our guide through a throng of people. Moving through the tower castle itself was a challenge (did I mention its crowded?) and I found the newly arranged display within the caste - the armory collections - to be tremendously shallow and uniquely uninteresting.  It was as if they dumbed everything down to the level of a Disney attraction - which with the crowds and queues it now surely resembles. The crown jewels require standing in their own queue to get into the exhibit. The wait time looked to be easily more than an hour, with a queue stretching outside its designated area and around the entire castle, and hardly moving. We passed. Oh - and did I mention that it costs over 24 pounds per person?  One final note - all this is in April. I can't imagine what it's like in summer.We escaped from the tower and let out a sigh of relief. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
"April 15, 2017",We stayed here longer than we thought,"We printed a 2-4-1 National train ticket voucher from home, so for the 2 of us to get in it was £28. That included a £4 donation to maintain the tower. (So could have paid £24 for the two of us if we had declined it.) Since we saved on buying a second ticket we went ahead and happily agreed to pay it. There is really a lot to see at the tower. Once we got in, we walked past the Beefeater tour and went straight to the crown jewels. It is absolutely amazing to see them. There is a moving walkway that goes on the front and backside of the jewels and we rode the walkway several times each to see them from every angle. Afterwords, we went back to the entrance and joined a Beefeater tour. The tour was funny, informative, and interesting. Don't miss it. It is included in the admission price. Afterwards, we set off on our own to walk along the walls and visit the various buildings. This was actually a gift shop we bought something from. My husband bought a touristy shirt and I bought a small bag with the ravens adorning it. I think my bag was £2. Afterwards, we went out the exit directly across from the gift shop and sat in the small beer garden on the Thames with a view of the Tower Bridge. Great day. "
"April 11, 2017",A Must See in London,"This was a wonderful and fascinating place to visit.  Our family loved it  DO NOT MISS THE free BEEFEATER Tour.  Lawrence was amazing.  Seriously, do not skip the Beefeater Tour.  "
"April 10, 2017",Fascinating London History for All Ages...,"The Tower of London is a major attraction and has something to offer almost everyone. We had a limited amount of time and chose to take a self guided tour rather than the Warder's Tour. We spent about 2 hours wandering through the massive fortress and there is plenty to see. Not only is the fortress structure impressive, there are many great exhibits. Of course the Crown Jewels are not to be missed but the armor and weapons rooms are also real treats. The view of the Tower Bridge is spectacular and favorite photo spot."
"April 7, 2017",Fabulous experience,"How lucky are we in the uk to have some amazing history to go and visit. We visited this amazing place with our kids a few years back but decided we missed most of what interested us. We had a fabulous guide by the name of Spike and his knowledge was 2nd to none with a brilliant talent to entertain as well. I love our countries history and never realised what we have here. Standing in the chapel inside the grounds of the tower amongst over 1500 buried famous people including Anne Boleyn, bought tears to my eyes and goose pimples everywhere. A brilliant display of weapons, amour, the crown jewels, ravens, and much much more, if your any where near you must visit and ask for a tour with Spike, great bloke and a gentleman. Thank you for a great day"
"March 22, 2017",So Many Laughs / So Much History,"I had never done the Tower of London tour and wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Let's just say, this was by far one of my most favorite tours ever.  The Beefeater, Mark, was a riot.  He shared history as well as humor.  If in London, you must visit The Tower of London."
"March 16, 2017",Overpriced!,Ended up not going in due to the price!   Travelling with my mum (78) we planned the London trip to include a visit to see the crown jewels but after getting there and being told 1 adult and 1 concession was £50 we walked away.  Outrageously expensive!  
"March 13, 2017","Book ticket online in advance, & go in the morning when it opens","I've been to London a few times, have never been to ToL, till last visit back in October last year.  I was a bit hesitant, that it may be over crowded, & over touristy.  Yes, it's a bit touristy, & can be very crowded, but IMO, it definitely worthy of a visit, esp. If you are visiting from overseas.  It's not fair to rate this place a 3- star, when one did not get in to visit, because of crowds & expenses; it's not even fair or objective to rate when rather did not get to visit a place in depth.  My recommendation is to book your ticket in advance before your trip, you will receive your ticket by mail.  I got my before heading to London, & I went first thing in the morning in a nice cool sunny day, I was able to get into CoJ without any crowds or waits, I was able to take my time to truly appreciate what they have to offer. There are many points of interests inside ToL,  one could really spend at least 1/2 day there.  That's what I did, it got quite crowded when I was ready to leave at 1PM, with many large groups.  Research, learn & plan ahead, you will enjoy your visist, no only limited to this massive attraction."
"January 26, 2017",Soaking up some History,"Had a great day out at The Tower of London, full of history and the Beefeaters tour is very interesting and our guide was quite funny too and interacted with the crowd.   Appreciate, it is educational for the school children but I do think there should be a limit on how many schools go on the same day, as it was packed with kids everywhere screaming so failed to see what they were learning but great day out, full of history.     If you want to see the crown jewels go early as that queue gets longer as the day goes on.     Allow yourself plenty of time to get round all the towers and to see everything and take a packed lunch as the café is a bit poor.  Overall a great day out."
"June 25, 2018",Amazing,"Being able to visit the places I studied for years was amazing. It did not dissapoint!! I am a lifelong student of history, and the stories were heard at the Tower helped add to and complete the knowledge I already knew. Book study is important, but seeing in person is incredible. Once there you can start to visualize what life was like all those many, many years ago. This is a must see for historians, but everyone would benefit from visting the Tower."
"June 17, 2018",Lots of history!,"The Tower was our first stop in London, and it was a great introduction to the history of the place. The campus of the Tower was huge, and had lots to see. We did not do the tour, but walked on our own to the things that interested us. We loved reading about the kings and queens who lived (and died) there, and tried to imagine their ancient world. The crown jewels exhibit was magnificent, and we enjoyed a short outdoor drama, ""The Last Days of Anne Boleyn."" Very well done!"
"June 14, 2018",Lots of History,"Our family led ourselves around and enjoyed the many bits of history throughout the buildings and grounds.  If we had spent more time there, we would have taken the guided tour.  The staff is friendly, and the sites and attractions are very well organized and appointed.  The Crown Jewels are spectacular to view up-close, and the torture area is interesting.  "
"June 4, 2018",Take the tour,This place is great. Definitely a must see attraction while in London. We opted to take the tour that was offered. Our guide (beefeater)  was excellent. She had a great sense of humor which added to the over all enjoyment of the stories being presented.
"May 21, 2018","Totally worth it, spend there at least 2 hours","The tower of London is full of history, I recommend taking the tour with a guard as soon as you enter (they are every 30 minutes and the last one departs at 15.30pm in summer time) and then go through all the different towers and the white tower later.There is a lot to read and learn, the tour with the guard is only 45 minutes, so add to that at least 2 more hours. You will see:- different towers where they held prisioners (it wasnt a prision though)- The King's rooms (this was the Monarchy house for around 500 years)- The Royal Ravens- The current Crown Jewels- The torture machinery- The Chapel- The execution areaand moreEnjoy it!"
"May 10, 2018",Must See in London,If you are interested in knowing anything about English history this is a must see.  Spent the most part of one day here in April and barely scratched the surface.  Best plan of attack - get there early - just a bit before opening - and if possible buy your tickets on line in advance (avoids one queue).  This place gets more crowded as the day wears on. Plan on spending at least 3 hours here!
"April 29, 2018",Visit Medieval London,"The Tower of London is the premier attraction in London.  This was my second time at the tower and the tour was full of new and riveting information I hadn't heard the first time.  The Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) conduct the tours and they have all been specially selected for their service to the Queen and their oratory skills.  Their knowledge and story-telling abilities are sure to have all ages hanging on every word.  You will not be disappointed by the tales of intrigue and torture that happened within the walls of ""The Tower"".The crowds were quite a bit larger this year so, it's a good idea to try to keep up with the Yeoman Warder when he moves from one location to the next.  While they project their voices very well, it can be difficult to hear if you get stuck at the back of the crowd.The yeoman warders will recommend visiting the crown jewels but, if there are other things you're interested in, such as the White Tower, forego the jewels.  As impressive as some of the jewels are, the exhibit isn't the most interesting thing in the tower.The chopping block where HenryVIII's wives lost their heads is no longer there but there is a modern display that marks the spot where it occurred.  Your visit to the tower will take several hours but you don't need to leave the tower to get some lunch.  There's a fairly good cafeteria with a decent variety of foods but a somewhat difficult seating situation.  Long rows of tables are close together and it can be difficult to navigate to one of the middle seats, while carrying a tray of food.Overall, I recommend everyone visit the Tower of London on your next trip."
"April 12, 2018",A must see... The Crown Jewels,"This is one of the highlights of our trip and traveling with young children was not easy but the kids did well.  And one of the highlights was getting to the Tower of London and seeing the Crown Jewels.One word of advice right from the start... get there early and head straight to the back where the building is for the Crown Jewels.  It gets busy quickly and then the line extends for quite a bit.  We didn’t have to wait at all and walked right in.  The tour is all ages and did not disappoint.  I learns a lot about the history of the Crown Jewels and how the collection came to be.  Fascinating!!  Then we went to the big tower to start our tour there where you learned about the history of the Tower of London, and the people who took part in the building, restoring, rebuilding, etc.  We also learned a lot about the kinds and the succession of rulers and the armor and weapons used in battle.Great walk around the battlements and multitude of towers and even a separate building which houses the Museum of the Fusaliers, which I enjoyed but the young kids... not so much.  Great time for all... highly recommend this site for visitors!!"
"April 5, 2018",very busy weekend,"Had the Yeoman tour, Spike was his name, and boy did he entertain, was a great tour which tells you so much more than just walking around, was busy but it was easter"
"April 5, 2018",First time visitor tips,"Here’s our tips after visiting for the first time.We were lucky in that the crowds were nonexistent for our Christmas week visit, but I would think with larger crowds this advice would be even more applicable.Buy your ticket online and in advance. Print them out and skip most of the lines to enter by following the signs for ticket holders. Once inside you’ll see groups waiting for the virger tours. Walk on by for now (we’ll take that tour later) and head straight ahead looking for the sign directing you to the Crown Jewels (second left). Walk up the stairs and the building housing the jewels will be right there and hopefully a small line or none at all if you get there early enough.Once you’re done with the jewels you can either head to the white tower which you will be facing when you exit, or you can head back to the entrance to catch a virger tour. We headed back and joined a tour. One tip here would be that the groups gather near the sign that points to where they actually start. Follow the sign and go down the ramp and wait there.Your tour will end at the chapel near the Crown Jewels so if you didn’t visit the White Tower before now is the time. After exiting the Tower, head to the South Walk. It will be down the road just a bit after you exit. Take your time to view the rooms and the views from the fortresses defensive positions.I would allocate 2-4 hours to see the Tower. Read up on the Tower and it’s history before you go. Get pictures with a Beefeater (they’re super helpful and nice), and watch for the Ravens."
"January 1, 2018",Always Wonderful,"We get to London with some regularity and about every 5 years we go back to the Tower.  We went last week and it excellent.  Our ""Beefeater"" was full of facts and every bit a perfect ambassador for the tower.  While you can see the tower without the guides, they add greatly to the experience. One is in awe when looking at the crown jewels.  The White building is full of history and exit thru the modern, seemingly mandatory, torture chamber now know as the gift shop. If you have not been to London, put this on the must see list. If you have seen before, return to see it again as it is a glimpse into both the good and the bad parts of history"
"December 9, 2017",AN EVERGREEN!,"If you go and visit London, you cannot help visiting the Tower! Please, go there three hours before closing."
"November 19, 2017",Fascinating tour,The tour around the tower grounds was fascinating. One truly gets an impression of old London life and royalty with its happier and devastating historical moments.
"November 13, 2017","The White Tower - and the Crown Jewels, too!","On a recent visit to London, we anticipated long queues, and decided to make the Tower of London our first stop of the day.  We arrived about an hour before the site opened; took some time to photograph the Tower Bridge; and then stood at the entrance in the London Pass queue.  We were among the first to enter, and made a bee line for the Crown Jewels.  We had easy access without waiting, and we got to linger a bit in front of this spectacular bit of British history. The jewels are magnificent to say the least.  The 530 carat Star of Africa diamond cut from the 3100-carat Cullinen is on the great Scepter.  The Koh-i-Nor is on one of the crowns.  It's really a thrill to see some of these legendary jewels and regalia.We also took some time walking the walls of the Tower; we visited the Traitors' Gate; ogled the ravens; and visited the Bloody Tower with its rack.  We saved the White Tower until last, and were rewarded with a stunning display of armor, and a half dozen other interesting exhibits.  I took time at the Tower Green to think about the executions of some of the more famous prisoners of the tower including two of King Henry VIII's wives, Thomas More, and Lady Jane Grey.  It's a chilling feeling to be right where it all happened.I loved arriving at the Tower of London so early in the day.  This move saved us lots of time.  There are a couple of gift shops to visit as well.  I loved the shop just next tot he Jewel House.  Enjoy this must-see site when in London."
"October 25, 2017",Tower of London According to Spike,"We took a tour of the Tower of London under the guidance of the venerable Beefeater better known as Spike. The decision to tour the Tower and all it has to offer should be on everyone’s list of things to do when visiting London and you won’t be disappointed.The tour itself is only about an hour in length and anyone can tour the grounds and buildings using the map and other information available on site but the tour with a Beefeater guide is quite the treat.First and foremost you do get a very good explanation about why the Tower was built and the stories about successive Kings, Queens and the intrigue and violence of the Royal Court of the day. More interestingly are the stories and how they relate to to-days world and how history shaped us.Oddly we think of pollution, as a problem of to-day but not so, pollution was a problem several centuries ago. The moat around the Tower was so polluted with raw sewage that it became a significant health hazard and after about 400 years or so the Royalty of the day agreed to have the moat filled in with sand and shells. It became a parade and practice area for the soldiers. The stories of the intrigues of the court and the violence can be felt as the tour progresses.The tour itself ends at and in Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula where you really learn about the background of the church and the number of people who were beheaded and buried there.Spike himself has quite the vocabulary and challenges people with questions or comments about the history and present day events. There’s a continuous banter, about England and the United States that is very friendly yet laced with a dry wit. Unfortunately there’s nothing mentioned about Canada in the exchange. However this oversight is easily forgotten as soon as Spike moves onto the next subject.In the Chapel Spike did take the time to explain how he became a Beefeater, the requirements and the staunch loyalty to the “Crown”. In fact there is no doubt in his mind that Prince Charles will become the next King. This came, as he was explaining his uniform and the letters and insignia on his uniform. What will the new King call himself? The question is, to be answered at some future time.This is a most highly recommended tour but after that there is still much more to see such as the Royal Jewels with everything from rings, Sceptres, Crowns, Swords etc. Quite a spectacular array.Fortunately there was also a “Food Fest” being held is a large section of the moat so we were also able to sample a large variety of foods and beverages. The Fest itself was not part of the tour but the passes we had gave us access.Overall the major consideration anyone should make is the time required to do the tour with the Beefeater and just walk around the site is time. Don’t be in a hurry, do not think it’s an in and out. You can easily spend 3 to 4 hours visiting and there would still be things to see.Yes, definitely a must see and do when in London."
"October 5, 2017",Get there early,"We were told to get there early by friends and this is definitely the case. With gates opening at 9am on the Saturday, we got there at 8.45am. Stood around for a few minutes and then we could start to go in. Being early, there weren't that many people around. We went straight to the Crown Jewels. Walking through, with no pressure of crowds, we could take our time and actually enjoy the experience. We could walk through a couple of times within jumping an queues.Could even get close and personal with guards on duty. Great photo opportunities.The rest of the attraction was easy to navigate and still without too many people around it was a pleasure. As we left around 11.30, you could see the crowds had built considerably."
"September 23, 2017",A must see!,"We took a guided tour of the Tower. While I wouldn't recommend that specific tour guide, I think a guided tour could be a good choice of this place, which is quite expansive. There is a lot to see, which could be done in under three hours if you don't mind missing the crown jewels. Otherwise you definitely need more time."
"September 14, 2017",An absolute must!!!!,"So much great history explained by the Yeoman who effortlessly guides you through the most important areas.  His tales were beautifully explained with great drama and made the experience very memorable.  Thank you, Steve.....a great story teller.Once inside the grounds inquire about the area to wait for the next guided tour.  The only way to get the real history.  After the tour ends, explore the exhibits on your own.  Something for everyone.  My favorite was seeing the Jewel House.We bought the London Pass which allowed us priority entry.  Also saves money if you are visiting the best London sights."
"September 14, 2017",Highly recommended activity,"Our family absolutely loved this tour. My husband and son were not really up on their British history, but they learned a lot and really enjoyed it. There is a lot to see, more than we thought, so this is at least a 1/2 day, if not more, excursion. I recommend waiting for the tour guide as they really add to it (especially our tour guide, he was fantastic, but sadly can't remember his name). There is a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes. We did not eat on site, but you are there a long time so eat in advance or take snacks (the onsite ice cream is wonderful). It is quite near the Tube station which makes it very convenient."
"September 1, 2017",My #1 London Attraction,We had a brilliant visit to the Tower. The history and customs are fascinating. And its a treat to have a guide from one of the Yeoman Warders who live on site... thanks Bob!!Nice to get the boat down the Thames from Westminster to approach London Bridge from a different angle.
"April 2, 2018",SO MUCH HISTORY,This place is awe inspiring! The history the events that happened here. We had success early in the morning with getting in to see the Jewels before the line got bad- listen to the Yeomen. If your time is super limited- see the Jewels and the White Tower.....
"March 18, 2018",Worth a visit,I’ve been to London a few times and only went to the tower on this last visit and can’t believe I waited this long. It is very much worth it’s entrance fee and more. So much information to absorb and a lot of interesting different areas to see. I went with fellow colleagues while on a business trip and honestly weather you are solo or with a group you will have a great experience.  
"March 1, 2018",Unbelievable history,"This place it's a must visit, from all the history to the amazingly architectural buildings. From the Crown jewels to the Traidors gate.. Two tumbs up"
"February 17, 2018",Incredible—but I honestly would have skipped the tour.,"I love Tudor-era history, I love castles, and I love swords, so you know that I was excited for the Tower of London. I finally tackled it on my last day in London. I had bought a ticket in advance, which was useful. The Line of Kings was probably my favorite part, a museum exhibit of suits of armor, swords, and more. It's several floors, and has all kinds of fascinating swords, daggers, guns, and more, as well as several incredible suits of armor for horses and kings, displayed wonderfully. The Crown Jewels were of course incredible (although—and I know this is shocking—I think the Scottish ones were much nicer). The Tower and its history are huge, and hard to take in even in a full half day, but the guides and signs are really helpful in walking you through the high points and the history. I saw a reenactment, which was fun; the wall has one of ~the~ best views of the Tower Bridge; and afterwards it was easy to catch the water taxi to other tourist attractions. I even got to see two of the ravens, and while people warned me that those ravens are bigger than any ravens I've ever seen, I still wasn't really prepared for it. You get to see several historical places of note, like the Stairs in the White Tower where the bones of two children, believed to be the princes who disappeared just before Richard took the throne in 1483, often believed to have been murdered. You see Traitor's Gate, and the famous places where Elizabeth I, Mary Queen of Scots, and more famous royals and rebels were brought in, imprisoned, beheaded, and more—there is a memorial to those beheaded at the Tower. I had a really great time despite how much my feet hurt, and it was a day packed with history and wonder.I wasn't a big fan, though, of the famous Yeoman Warder tour. It had fascinating history for sure. The most interesting information was about the warders more than perhaps the Tower—who they are, that they sleep there, what their duties are. But considering that I had to wait a long while for a tour packed with other people, it seemed rather short, and I was also extremely turned off by the repeated sexist language and jokes by my tour guide—I let his first joke about women running off to the jewels and men to the swords go, but after he'd made similarly weird, gendered statements about a dozen times, I was really over it, and exchanged an eye-roll of a glance with the woman next to me."
"February 6, 2018",Impressive structure and amazing beefeater,"The structure itself is impressive: huge, very well-kept and stunning in its old beauty. We loved the tour with our beefeater Spike (#402) who made it really interesting and even funny, thumbs up for him! (If you ever read this, thanks a lot for today's tour!) Unluckily we didn't know the chapel was closed on Sundays due to functions so that was a bit of a disappointment because we would have loved to have a look at it once we had paid the entrance to the complex but nothing that couldn't be solved with a visit to the Queen's Jewels that are completely worth the Sunday crowd."
"January 28, 2018",Fav place in London,Love love love!! This place is so fascinating. The history is incredible and you MUST DO A TOUR with a beefeater. It was hilarious. Best tour guide I’ve had in years. You learn AND laugh a lot. The crowd jewels are here and gorgeous. I could have spent hours here. Must see in London!! 
"January 25, 2018",Spike the Beefeater guide on our tour cares and was excellent.,"Taking the Beefeater tour at the beginning of your visit to the Tower of London is a must. This will help to truly help to bring past to life.  I applaud Spike for his informative and really witty tour. The tour takes about 40 mins and then you are free to explore for as long as you wish, give yourself plenty of time,  perhaps 3 or 4 hours."
"January 21, 2018",Classic London!,"The Crown Jewels are not to be missed! So much history. Great tour. It’s bigger and more elaborate than I’d anticipated so,leave plenty of time to see it all. "
"January 19, 2018",A historical oasis,I didn't know what to expect from the Tower and in the end it was a highlight of my visit to London. So much to see and it is like an ancient village in amongst the hubbub of modern life. 
"January 16, 2018",A Marvel,Well worth every single penny. You need at least 5 hours if you want to see everything. Ifyyou want to see the crown jewels just go early to avoid queues.
"June 29, 2015",Arrive early,"Here are a few tips for enjoying one of London's most iconic and interesting historic locations:1. Purchase tickets in advance. It is easy to purchase tickets online, in advance and have them mailed to your home - even if you live outside England. 2. Arrive early. We arrived just before the gates opened at 9 AM and were among the first visitors into the Tower of London. We immediately went to view the Crown Jewels. Along with only a handful of people, we were able to spend considerable time admiring the royal treasures. By midday the line was enormous, but early in the morning there is no line.3. Eat early. There is a very good and reasonably priced cafeteria on the premises. At 11:30 AM there is no line and we enjoyed an early lunch in relative quiet. 4. Take the Beefeaters Tour. What we appreciated most about the Yeoman who led our tour was his genuine pride in England's history. He was approachable and humorous and helped us appreciate the remarkable history we were seeing."
"June 26, 2015",Definitely do the Yeoman Warder Tour!,The Tower of London was a wonderful tourist destination. We took the Yeoman Warder Tour and the information was astonishing. It was a first hand account of from the men who have lived there for hundreds of years and it was FREE! The Crown Jewels were fabulous!
"May 24, 2015",Must See Attraction,"So, in my opinion here are the Must Do's at the biggest (besides the National Gallery) Must See attraction in London.1) Get there early...10-15 minutes before opening on a weekday (8:45) is probably enough even if you don't have a London Pass (highly recommended though).  We were the 2nd couple in line.2)  Go immediately to the Jewel House...We were the 1st people in there.  The moving conveyor sidewalk wasn't on and we had 15 minutes of being the only tourists there.  After your 15 minutes of silent contemplation, go over to the guard and ask as many questions as you want...they have some fascinating stories.3)  About 9:50...wander back to the entrance and find the Beefeater there and take the 1st tour.  This was educational and amusing.  Our guide was very funny!  You will learn the history of the Tower, hear some grisly stories, learn about how to become a Beefeater, and even meet a crow!  Tour took an hour and should not be missed.4)  Next go to the top of the wall and do the walk...Wonderful views inside and out.5)  Finally take a tour of the White Tower....especially the Armor Museum.That took us about 3 hours...You could easily spend 2-3 hours more but definitely plan on a 9-12 visit.  Kids of all ages love this place.  My wife and I are 60...we loved it too!"
"May 21, 2015",How to truly do the Tower.,"If you want to do the Tower of London, here is how you do it properly. Buy tickets on-line, This way when it opens at 10 am, you avoid the lines at ticket counter and walk straight onto the sight of the Tower. Make your way to the crown jewels right away. Once you have looked at the crown jewels come back to the entrance to find the next Beefeater giving a tour. These guys will take you around and give you loads of info about the history of their residence (yes, they live there!). After you have toured with the Beefeater, then walk around in the various buildings at your own pace. You will notice the line with an hour wait at the crown jewels and say to yourself ""thank goodness we did that first!"". You can also get a nice lunch on site but if you come out there are many restaurants right at the exit of the Tower. Enjoy!"
"March 28, 2015",Definitely go!  Here's how. ,"I don't do crowds or lines. So here's how to avoid them:  purchase your tickets ahead of time on-line, print out the email voucher that is sent to you and bring it with you on the day of the visit. Arrive just before they open. Go to the Group ticket line and pick up your tickets. Head inside the London Tower and go straight to the Jewels. See that first and then return toward the entrance for the Beefeater tour. Well worth it. Then simply enjoy the other parts of the Tower at your own pace. No better way to do it!"
"March 24, 2015",Fascinating Day,"We were fortunate to go to the Tower of London this August right after they had placed the poppies in memory of the 100 year anniversary of  WWI.  The tower is fascinating place, make sure you go on a Beefeater tour.   They are informative and entertaining.  It will take you most of the day to see everything and the line for the crown jewels looks long but moves along and it is worth the wait."
"February 18, 2015",Such a let down for such a fantastic historical sight,"I am really interested in Tudor history, particularly Anne Boleyn so I was so excited to be going to the Tower of London to see for myself the place where so many amazing things happened in history. I was however really disappointed at the poor effort curation and research that I saw. The main 2 attractions are the Crown Jewels for which there was a 2 hr queue when we went so we skipped them as I was more interested in the history of the place than that part anyway, and the 2nd big event there is the exhibition of the great exhibition they have had there for 300 years. They put a lot of effort into an exhibition about this exhibition which was primarily wooden horses and armour from various monarchs. Instead of giving you information about the armour or the monarch who wore them you get lots of detail about the exhibition itself which is not nearly as interesting. Around the whole site there are 2 or 3 mentions of Anne Boleyn and her location when she was kept in the tower was not known. Most disappointing was the Bloody Tower for which we queued to get in and saw 3 boards with some vague information about the princes in the tower and a projection of a film from the 1970s about Richard III. I really wanted to go there and be able to imagine what it was like to have been kept there or to have stayed in the royal palace. I'd like to have learned something new and really felt the history in the place but instead I felt like things had been put together with minimum effort and barely any research. I was quite upset having been so looking forward to going and having paid so much for a ticket. Honestly you get as much from going and walking around the outside as you do from paying to get in. They need to hire new curators and make the history come to life as it is such a waste as it is. "
"January 26, 2015",Excellent Guided Tour of the Tower,"We paid for a guided tour and a very jovial and friendly Yeoman Warder or ""Beefeater"" guided our group through the Tower. The Crown Jewels were fantastic as you could view them all up close. The chapel, traitors gate...all very good to see and hear from the Yeoman Warder about the history behind it all."
"November 10, 2014",Remembrance Poppies - a once in a lifetime experience,"Moving, touching, thought-provoking and poignant. Visited on Remembrance Sunday along with countless tens of thousands more - the traffic was horrendous but our discomfort doesn't compare with their sacrifice. Thank you all ... We will remember."
"November 10, 2014",Fantastic family trip out!,Our kids (& us) loved the Tower of London. We went on one of the tours by the Yeomans - Yeoman Dave. He was fabulous so many people on the tour but no issues hearing him at all. The kids LOVED all the history and hearing about the gory details of executions! (kids aged 7 & 9). We were there for 3 hours but could have spent much longer we didn't see everything we wanted but ran out of time sadly. We will go back next trip again.
"January 14, 2017",Amazing place and fantastic tour,"We booked online the morning of our visit and saved a little money and a lot of time. Doing this you skip the long ticket lines. We hooked up with a tour from a Yeoman Warder (""Beefeater Dave"") which was great. The tour was fascinating, appropriately long, and free with entry. The crown jewels are definitely worth getting in line to see. The White Tower is pretty good. Lots of armor. "
"January 3, 2017",Must See -- Requires a Half-Day at Least,"This is one of the three ""not-free but must see"" attractions in London, along with St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. Plan on several hours to explore the complex completely."
"January 2, 2017",Make sure to take a Beefeater Tour!,"*Thank you Clive for an amazing tour!*Visited with my wife and cousin. Arrived before 10am, so we were near the front of the queue to obtain our tickets (we ordered online, but the 'vouchers' needed to be exchanged for actual tickets). We were surprised by the sheer amount of other tourists who arrived for opening time. The queue to actually get in to the Tower was very long, but moved very quickly (walking pace).We missed the first Beefeater tour, so we explored the Tower grounds on our own. Toilets were quite a trek away. Saw the Bloody Tower - very interesting, as well as the Crown Jewels. The Crown Jewels are in an exhibit case, with a moving walkway on both sides (like a conveyer belt), which kept people moving along, and prevented having to battle through a large crowd of people to see them. Really interesting exhibits with a lot of interesting information.The surprising highlight of our visit, though, was the Beefeater Tour. The ""Beefeater"" we saw was a guy named Clive. He was full of really interesting information and stories, and really brought things to life. He was very entertaining and enthusiastic.I won't spoil things for you by telling you some of the things we learnt, but it was all so memorable. Really, really captivating and enthralling. So glad we went on the Beefeater Tour, and that we stayed for the whole thing (took about an hour).It was a little bit chilly this time of year (Dec 2016), but coming from Canada it felt balmy to us! A lot of the other tourists were dressed in hats and scarves and thick coats. Especially if you go on one of the Beefeater Tours, there's a lot of standing around.Got to witness one of the parades to the chapel, which was pretty cool. All staff and other Beefeaters on site were very friendly, helpful and approachable.See if you can spot the ravens!To get the most out of the experience you will probably need to be mobile. The Bloody Tower had a long set of narrow, twisting stairs. There's a lot of walking around on uneven cobblestone paths. The historic ambience of the Tower was a tad ruined by the introduction of an ice-rink (with loud thumping music) near the front gates."
"December 29, 2016",Wait for a Tour,"This was one of the best parts of the trip. My advise to travelers who want to know the history is to wait for a tour from a Yeoman Warder or ""beefeater"" The Tower of London has a very long and rich history. Plus it's where they store the Crown Jewels (no pictures allowed inside, but it was spectacular!). Our Yeoman Warder tour guide, Dave, was fantastic; witty and full of stories about the Tower's history. Arrive early to avoid crowds."
"November 27, 2016",Very interesting,It is a must see in London.  We were there at 9am and the grounds were still quiet.  We had time to take some great pictures and then went to the Treasury.  It was nice to be able to linger and admire all the magnificent crown jewels.  We came out from the Treasury and wow!!! The place was packed with tourists!!!  We did tour the rest of the area.  Highly recommend going early to avoid the crowds. 
"November 22, 2016",Beefeater Towley's Brilliant Tour,"This was our first visit to London.  It is a wonderful city with much to its visitors.  After my niece and I arrived at the Tower of London, it leaves you in a state of awe.  The walled area is massive.  We entered through a large arch and we were immediately led to our guided tour.  This tour was led by a true storyteller; Beefeater Towley.We were a bit behind schedule.  The tour had begun.  Beefeater Towley was telling tales of Tower Hill.  He moved us on inside the walled area and stood upon a square stone to reach every speaker.  With his tremendously detailed stories of the gruesome history and he always followed with that British, great wit.  There were many gasping by the frightening torture stories and many belly laughing from his quick delivery of humor.  It was not all gruesome,  as he expressed respect for the dead entombed in the nearby church, and the serious duties in his position.  He is not a ""tour guide,"" but rather a man that takes his royal duties seriously as a member of the Queens guards.This was the best guided tour with Beefeater Towley.   He engaged his audience with fantastic tales of the tower of ""terror,"" kept us moving and building on his storytelling.  It was a pleasure to be in his company and he made us all laugh.  You cannot miss storytelling at its best."
"October 20, 2016",A glimpse into medieval London,"Highly recommend a trip to the Tower when in London-we made it a day starting with St Paul's then continuing on to Shakespeare's Globe all on the same end of town. The history of the Tower is fascinating, varied and bloody-as the famous Yeoman Wardens' tours will highlight in considerable decibel! Note that the tour, running every hour, is included in your ticket price and by far is the best introduction to the Tower. The Crown Jewels on exhibition is a must, even with the long Disneyland-like queues. We visited the royal beasts, WWI exhibition and the dungeons-all relatively quick and worth the consideration. Note-avoid the overpriced Cafe within the Tower and opt for more picturesque options along the riverbank just outside. "
"October 6, 2016",Don't miss this!,"Loved our brief visit to the Tower of London.  Our tour with Beefeater Dave was so interesting, and the Crown jewels are not to be missed.  "
"September 27, 2016",Really interesting,We have been to London many times but never visited this attraction before.  Once inside there was so much to see.  Only downside was the long queues which took a long time.  The crown jewels were beautiful and although you were ushered along a conveyor belt like a suitcase you could go back for another look if you wanted.  Really interesting history and the guides were informative and amusing.  Look out for the old graffiti from famous prisoners in the tower! 
"September 19, 2016",Must-do tourist visit in London,"The Tower of London is one of the most popular places to visit amongst all tourist attractions in the city.  Best planning is to get there early within the first 30 minutes of opening.  Very short lines at that time of day and much less congested compared to later in the day.  If you want to see the crown jewels, do that immediately upon your arrival in the tower.  Limited visitors early in the day will have you in and out of the crown jewel exhibition within 20 minutes so that you can circle back to the entrance gate and catch the next Yeoman guided tour.  (Be sure to note the frequency of the guided tours when you enter the tower so you know when the 'next tour' will be.)  Beyond the crown jewels, the second thing you want to do in the tower is take the Yeoman tour before crowds start to arrive by 11am.  If you explore some of the outer walls and rooms accessible to the public, plan 2-1/2 hours for your visit assuming you get there early before many others arrive.  Also, when exiting the tower, exit the side towards the Thames river as this will give you a view from the 'front' side along the river."
"June 12, 2016",Beefeater Dave!,"Beefeater Dave's guided tour was the absolute best part of our visit to the Tower. His knowledge coupled with his sense of humor and quick wit made an incredibly fun hour. Besides that, seeing the Crown Jewels involved a long line and wait, but had interesting pictures to look at and things to read while waiting in the queue. The Tower is a must see for everyone visiting London."
"June 5, 2016",A place I love,breathing the history of the city. this is a place we visit many times a year (we're members of the English Heritage) because of the lovely sensation it gives. once inside you walk back in the ages. If you choose a weekday far from the weekend (and far from summer holidays) you can better appreciate these vibes. the crown jewels are just the icing on the cake
"June 3, 2016",2 day trip to london,A good attraction to visit in London for a reasonable price my wife and I paid £30 for us both to walk around the grounds and towers palaces ect it takes 2 to 3 hours worth going around with a beefeater Barney was quite amusing do wear comfy shoes try and visit mid week when it's not so busy
"May 25, 2016",Yawn,"Fell for the old tower of london scam :( Buildings from the 1200's? Ya right. Clearly built in the early 1900s. Also it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out that the lions, placed by the ""moat"" (which is really just a grass field), are not real. Except for maybe a handful of Japanese tourists all of the others will quickly notice. The misleadingly named Tower of Blood had not one drop of blood in it. The actually tour was full of fictitious stories by a man dressed as a hotel attendant, quit listening immediately. P.S. no kings or queens. ripoff"
"May 21, 2016","""Listen to your guide""","We love history but even if you are not interested in history but listening to The Beefeater chat is amazing, some of them should be on stage. The way they expresses the happenings of the tower,not in a lecture way but fun, passionate & dramatic way. Teachers at school could learn a thing or two from them!The Tower is an absolute must for any visitor to London, the saying ""one for the road"" came from The Tower. We were lucky enough to have SPIKE the yeoman conduct our tour, he is so good at speaking and making himself heard, I could tell the other people in our group were also feeling his passion and enjoyment. He made us feel privileged to be sharing his knowledge, if you do visit, try to get on his tour - great bloke!I enjoyed the story of the wired animals too, and surprised to learn how many people had been held at the tower.100% great visit."
"April 23, 2016",Great for cattles,"If you like being treated like a cattle this is the place for you. The only thing where you treated as a client is the place where you pay, after that abandon all humanity until you exit."
"January 30, 2016","Visiting the Tower? Go with ""London Walks""","No need for me to give further fulsome praise to the most iconic of all London's historical landmarks......this is the ""must-see"" attraction.However if you want to really enjoy it, go with ""London Walks""11  am on Wednesdays and Sundays from Tower Hill Tube  (meet by the ""Tower Hill Tram"" coffee stand).  There's no need to book. A London Walk takes about two hours and costs £10 or £8 for concs. (kids under 15 accompanied by their parent[s] go free) There's an admission charge to the Tower but you get a big discount. And it's VIP admission – no standing in line. You get to jump the queue! Cribbed the last bit from their website but its well worthwhile especially when its busy and very entertaining. Are London Walk guides ALL actors?"
"January 30, 2016",Engaging and educational !!!!,"My family and I had a wonderful time....Yeoman John Donald was a fantastic and knowledgeable guide with a great style, presence and sense of humour...."
"January 18, 2016",Simply amazing.,The history that surrounds this place is incredible. There is so much to see and so much to learn. Set a lot of time aside for this as you need as much as you can (the three hours I was there did not cut it). Take a camera and good waling shoes - there are a lot of little steps and cobblestones. I will return.
"November 20, 2015",A London must!,"We toured the Tower of London in September and it wasn't crowded at all! There were no lines and stress free. Our tour guide, Lawrence, was incredible. He was so enthusiastic, informative, and funny. If you can get in his group, do it! You won't be disappointed."
"September 12, 2016",Very Nice Tour,"I recommend doing this tour of the Tower of London as it his a very good history of what was in the past. I only wish they would open up more of the tunnels, caves, and prison to people so they can also see the bad that was done here too !"
"August 24, 2016",Take a beefeater tour,We had Beefeater Dave and he was fantastic. the tours are free and last about an hour but its a great way to learn about the complex and how it was used.
"July 26, 2016",Great way to spend an afternoon,"I have always wanted to see the Tower of London, and am so glad I made the effort.  We decided to go on a beefeater guided tour, and thanks to Beefeater Dave, we had a really enjoyable time with lots of gory history thrown in.  But there is so much to see and do, take the tour first then the rest will make sense.  The queues were not too bad to see the Crown Jewels so we went there too, and that was lovely.  So much information available, and lots to read.  We finished off the day by wandering down to the river to see Tower Bridge and were lucky to see it open up to let a boat pass under."
"July 23, 2016",Excellen Tour Guide,We arrived just in time for the free guided tour of the Tower - it was a great way to learn the history of the tour - our guide brought his history to life - which was great for the kids!
"July 21, 2016",A Step Back in Time,"A definite must while in London. English history starts here. Book on line. Audio guides a must. Arrive early and see the Crown Jewels first. The armory is fantastic but almost too much. The cafe serves very nice lunches, making an all day visit possible. We were at the Tower from 9:00 am to 2:30 pm, and saw about 80%. We skipped the torture chamber, so cannot comment on that. There were lots of activities for children, but as we were four adults, we did not join in. "
"July 9, 2016",Tower of London and Beefeater Tour,"We got to the Tower shortly before 3 PM. We went to the Yeoman Warders Tour, aka Beefeaters tour. The Yeoman Warder that was our guide, Spike, was very knowledgeable, of course, and he managed to get the attention of about 200 people that was following him around. To see everything in the Tower, including the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, the Torture dungeon and more, 2.5 hours are not enough. Give yourself some more time, as the lines are almost as long as those for rides in Disneyland :-)"
"July 3, 2016","Must See, Best Attraction in London","My favourite attraction in London, though you have to get here early to be able to fully appreciate its beauty, history & space before the tourist groups arrive.My wife & I got here first thing in the morning when it was just opening (at 9am), and was able to enjoy the fresh air, the calmness around the tower and take some magnificent photos before it got extremely busy by around 10 - 10:30 am.Following some other travelers' advice, we went to see the Crown Jewels first before back-tracking to the start and visit the rest of the area, which we highly recommend as it allowed us the freedom and space to see the magnificent crown in peace without the touring crowds. It's unfortunate we weren't able to take photos inside but fully understand this given the value of the Crown Jewels on display. Seeing the security and the thick windows and doors just adds to the thrill of seeing the Crown Jewels, knowing you're looking at millions of dollars of history.After seeing the Crown Jewels, we then walked back towards the front entrance to join one of the free Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) tours which runs every 30 mins. We highly recommend this, as it was extremely enjoyable/entertaining and you get to learn a lot about the Tower of London as well as British history. The friendly banter the tour guide initiates just adds to the fun.After these 2 activities, which we highly recommend to do first, you can then roam freely around the Tower grounds and visit the various displays such as the Ravens, the Royal Beasts, the White Tower (armory), Torture Tower & the Wall Walk. On the Wall Walk, you can see amazing views of the Tower Bridge, the Gherkin and the surrounding areas. Throughout the day, there are also staged shows with actors recreating ancient events amongst the crowd, which was great fun.This is included with the London Pass, so we were able to walk straight in when we arrived.Highly recommended, and a must if you're visiting London."
"June 23, 2016",Classic but crowded,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Tower of London.  The site was fascinating and historical.  The yeoman warder (beef eater) tour is a can't miss treat.  Spike did a fantastic job.  They are all military veterans!  Cafe food and prices were decent.  The line to see the Crown Jewels was about 45 minutes, so be prepared to que up and wait.  Otherwise a classic London attraction worth the time and expense."
"June 21, 2016",Must See,"We really enjoyed the tour and the tour guide/Beef Eater Guard, Dave. Very nice intro to the historical site and then you are free to check out all the places within the site...which is more than one tower FYI. Dave did a nice job combining history and humor.Definitely worth checking out and give yourself a good 2 1/2 hours to have a thorough visit."
"June 16, 2016",The Sea of Poppies,"I cannot say enough about the impact the Sea of Poppies had on me. To realize that over 888,000 British soldiers died in the Great War and that there was one poppy planted for each is just an incredibly moving tribute to their ultimate sacrifice. It is a truly humbling and overwhelming sight. Remember the fallen."
"November 9, 2014",Wonderful,"The ceramic red poppies were a wonderful moving sight, the papers and TV don't do it justice. Yes, it was crowded but there was security in place showing you where to go and people were moving on  so you could get a lovely view. Well worth a visit"
"November 8, 2014",WW1 poppy remembrance outstanding,"Possibly one of the most humbling experiences. Really glad we took the kids to see the poppies before they disappear. Can't suggest strongly enough to visit. Crowds very busy, but worth the trip"
"November 8, 2014",Poppies,"Beautiful act of remembrance, so glad we visited, best to go early to avoid the crowds, we arrived at 815am"
"November 6, 2014",We will never forget,"The Tower of London is great at any time but this year it's a bit special with nearly 900 thousand Poppy's in the moat to remember the fallen of the First World War, I took a 3 hour stroll around the Site to say it was beautiful  is an understatement but it made one think having found out our family lost two family members in the conflict.Get to see them before they go and they become a memory."
"November 6, 2014",Worth it!,"We planed to spend half a day here-- and spent the whole day instead! There is just so much to see here. We started with a tour guided by one of the yeomen warders-- a great way to start. Then spent the rest of the day exploring the area on our own. We were lucky enough to visit during the art installation for the 100th anniversary of WWI, and the moat around the tower was full of ceramic poppies-- stunning.The Crown Jewels were, of course, amazing to see, but expect to wait in line for the chance. We only waited about 10-15 minutes to enter the exhibit, but I would imagine that wait is much longer in the summer.It seems there is something to see in every inch of the Tower of London. Oh, and the ravens were interesting too!There are several souvenir shops and little cafés around, so if you are feeling peckish or need retail therapy you can do that too."
"October 31, 2014",Unmanaged crowds are dangerous,"My wife and I bought a £59 family ticket online to take our grandchildren (aged 8 and 5). The visit was an immense disappointment and actually quite dangerous.Crowd control and queue management was absolute disgrace. The difficulty began from arrival at Tower Hill tube station - not the Tower's responsibility I accept - and continued outside the Tower, with an immense crush of people milling around, many not knowing where they were going, pressing through queues, some jumping queues or inadvertently starting new queues, tripping over children and buggies, becoming angry etc. etc. Staff seemed entirely absent with the only advice coming from the service people selling poppies. It was quite frightening and any sort of incident would have produced injuries very quickly.If we hadn't already of paid for our ticket we would have gone home right away.We did eventually manage to get into the Tower and found movement inside almost as difficult. There were extremely long queues for everything (including the cafe, the Crown Jewels and the Armoury), crushes in the Bloody Tower, Medieval Palace and the wall walk. Once again the very long queues were completely mismanaged with people having difficulty passing through them to get anywhere, people arguing and finding they'd been standing in the wrong queue and tension very high. Once again, the situation was extremely dangerous; especially so for children.The Yeoman Warder tours and talks - which I have found added an exciting feature in the past - were simply impossible to hear due to the crowds. It became clear that we were not going to be able to queue safely for that length of time with the children and after visiting the toilets (which were thankfully OK) and the shop to spend about £30 on souvenirs, we went home; once again negotiating dangerous and unmanaged crowds on the way out..The Tower of London has always been important to me. My father took me there in the 1950s and I took my children there in the 1980s. It is part of my history and heritage. Visiting inspired me to read and study history and politics. Yesterday's visit was an immense and expensive, dangerous and upsetting disappointment.I understand that it was Poppy Day and that the poppies in the moat have become a tourist attraction in themselves (we could hardly glimpse them) but it is plain that there is going to be a serious tragedy at the Tower of London unless the crowds are brought under control. A serious warning on the website might be advised but there is nothing.My sad conclusion is that you should avoid visiting the Tower of London unless you go in 1957"
"October 31, 2014",Poppies,I went to the tower just to see the poppies I was not disappointed The display is absolutely magnificent and well worth a trip just to see it It was very very busy but the number of people viewing the poppies only added to the enormity of the art work It was very moving. We didn't go into the tower itself but even so we spent a good two hours just walking around the moat looking at the poppies. I highly recommend this
"October 23, 2014",Sea of Poppies Blood Swept and Tears,Very privileged to be part of the voluntary team on Saturday that planted the Ceramic Poppies It was wonderful to see all the visitors showing such an interest Having viewed the Poppies from above with all the spectators it really is breathtaking Please go and see this at the Tower of London then stay for the last post as the roll of honour is read out .... Very moving What a wonderful tribute .......
"October 21, 2014",Tower of London,"My wife & I used Tesco vouchers on Friday 17th October worth £30 so only had to pay another £10 to get in. Almost immediately we got inside at around 11am, a good crowd had gathered and were laughing away as Beefeater MARK, I believe, (pics to follow) was beginning his entertaining and amusing walking tour of the Tower. The Byward Tower was first and then the Bell Tower and Traitors Gate. Mark constantly kept the crowd informed, spellbound and laughing with his special brand of storytelling. St Thomas's Tower followed and then the awful story of the Princes in the Blood Tower. Now were outside The Chapel of St Peter & Vincula, where Mark pointed out a nearby spot where amongst others, Anne Boleyn had lost her life in a beheading. Inside we went and it was very solemn (no cameras/pics/phones) as Mark very movingly told the story of the death of Anne Boleyn (a tear ran down my face) - 3 queens of England, Anne B, Catherine Howard and Jane Grey, and two saints of the Roman Catholic Church, Sir Thomas More and John Fisher, are also buried here. Here the tour ended on a higher note with applause and smiling faces as we exited the Chapel. So much more to see, including the Crown Jewels in a new setting created in 2012 by De Beers, The Armoury including Henry the 8th body and horse armour (note the H&K for Katherine on his armour skirt (see pic). We were lucky to have also seen the amazing Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red in which teams of volunteers are installing 888, 246 handmade poppies to mark the death of each member of the British Forces in the 1st World War. 5 hours very well spent absorbing 800 odd years of history. Admittedly not very user friendly for wheelchair users or buggies due to the age and sheer volume of stairs in the Tower."
"October 20, 2014",Gorgeous Poppies,"Hurry quick to see the gorgeous red poppies outside commemorating almost 900,000 military deaths in WWI.  It is beautiful. The crown jewels were the best part - simply amazing.  Could easily spend the entire day here with so much history to soak in."
"October 18, 2014",poppy display,"Excellent, don't need to pay to see it. Plenty of room to enjoy the view. Walked along the embankment to get there which was lovely."
"October 18, 2014",Sea of Poppies - so moving.,"The sea of poppies at The Tower of London are amazing. We went at 17.45. We saw all the poppies and then at about 18. 10 a beefeater and a guardsman marched to the mound. The beefeater solemnly read out the names and ranks of quite a few of the men who gave their lives for king and country during World War One. After this the guard played The Last Post. Every one stood in silence as a show of respect - so moving. The whole thing made me weepy at the thought of such a loss of so many young men and women, and that was just from Britain and the Commonwealth. How anymore thousands from around the world died and how many more suffered for the rest of their lives?"
"October 18, 2014",Poppies!,"If you're in London until November, don't miss a trip to the Tower to view the ceramic poppies commemorating WWI.  There is  a poppy for every British soldier killed during WWI.  It's a breathtaking, but sobering sight to behold.  You don't need a ticket to view the poppies.  "
"October 17, 2014",A Blast from the Past,"Followed tips by fellow TA advisors and got there when it opened.  If you do this, there is no need to buy skip the line or special passes.  We headed right for the crown jewels and were able to make a number of passes before it got crowded. After visiting the White Tower, we headed back out to the main gate for the Beefeater Tour.  Our guide was a retired army Sgt-Major who provided lots of interesting anecdotes with a humorous twist.  Allow about three hours to get a good feel for the place."
"October 12, 2014",Poppies,went today to see the First World War poppies installation .So very moving .What a fantastic experience 888246 beautiful ceramic red poppies free to view from outside the Tower of London .How ever had this idea deserves a medal  well done who ever you are  and thank you for this experience
"October 12, 2014",Fantastic!,"My husband and I travelled to London today on an organised coach trip to the Tower of London... mainly because I wanted to see the Poppies.  We were so lucky that the sun shone all day apart from a short shower at lunchtime.  We hadn't been to the Tower for abouit 25 years so it was good to re-visit and see the (amazingly clean) historic buildings again.The highlight of course is the stunning display of ceramic poppies which can be seen without actually paying the admission fee to the Tower.  When the sun shone on the poppies they sparkled.It was tear-jerking to remember that each poppy represents someone who died in WWI, and inspiring to watch the many thousands of visitors taking pictures and paying their respect."
"October 11, 2014",The poppys of remembrance - stunning and moving,"Wednesday 8th October, we made a rare visit to London, even though we live in Surbiton.  Once we had completed what needed doing we decided to visit some of the sights, one of the things we agreed we would like to visit was the Tower of London to see the poppys of remembrance. The display is know as Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red.The moat surrounding the Tower was full of the ceramic poppys, a sea of red, with some of the poppys down the wall of the Tower, almost like blood trickling down the wall into the sea below. It is so amazing, thought provoking,  emotional and a fitting tribute - 100 years World War 1. There are over 888,000 poppys representing the fallen.The poppys will be on display until 11th November,  so not there for much longer. This is so worth seeing. Congratulations to the Designers, Organisers and Planners of this poignant spectacle it is amazing.There is no fee to view the poppys."
"October 9, 2014",Take the Beefeater tour ...,"The Tower of London for its historical value is probably a 3+ walk around ... but the Beefeater tour is hilarious, fun, and educational ... making the visit to Tower of London a 5 rating!"
"September 3, 2014",Horrible Histories bought to life!,"Had a Fab family day out here. We were going to go to Madame Tussaurds but were put off by the reviews about how busy it is at this time of year. We definitely made the right choice!We were lucky enough to get a tour from a Yeoman (Beefeater) called Mark, he was fantastic and bought all the grisly stories to life. Even our children were hanging off every word. The que for the crown jewels looked enormous, I joined the end which was down by the café at 2:30 by 2:55 we were inside the que was very fast moving so please don't be put off by the length of it.A great day out well worth the entrance fee (which is cheaper if bought online)The poppies are overwhelming they still have another 500,000 to lay. its very sobering when you think each one represents a life lost!"
"September 3, 2014",Poppies and the Last Post,"I strongly recommend trying to catch the planting of the Poppies in the Moat of the Tower of London. Equally Moving is the Last Post, where they are reading out some of the names of the Dead from world War One, from the middle of the field of poppies at sunset. The Poppies are amazing, since they are ceramic, one for each person who died during the war.This is only on until the end of the year."
"August 24, 2014",Disappointing -- except for the Crown Jewels,"This was far and away the most disappointing attraction of anything we visited during our week's stay in London.  Price was a touch high -- and then, when you're through the gate -- we learn we have to pay AGAIN for an audio tour (which was, I think the only place we toured where this double-take was the case). To make matters worse, the audio is the most discombobulated.  Rather than have options for site 1, 2, etc. (which usually would be marked), as most tours did, this one apparently HAD to be done in order -- and woe to those (like us) who didn't want to see things in the order specified.   We finally just turned it off and walked around where we wanted to.   It seemed to us that they also wanted to avoid explaining the main thing the tower had been about -- i.e., a prison and place for some executions.   The only thing to spare this from being even more awful was the crown jewels.  They were truly exquisite.    The audio tour people need to take a page from Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace, both of which had EXCELLENT audio tours, with the price INCLUDED in the admission.  This desperately needs to be reworked."
"August 22, 2014",Incredible display,I went to Tower of London to see the WW1 poppy display in the moat. It is beautiful in a sad way . Am arranging to come back to London beginning November to see the completed display . My advice don't miss it . Go now go November but go its worth it
"August 15, 2014",One of London's Well Kept Heritage,"Go early in the morning to avoid crowd and once you pass the main arch after the security check  , there is a clock that indicate the next tour conducted by a costumed Beefeater. My previous  tour with one of the Beefeater was hillarious and interesting. Unlike other attraction where audio guide is included with the entrance ticket, the audio guide here had to be paid for separately. Besides, the grim history of this fortress you will be able to see the ongoing exhibition of the Crown Jewel and Royal Armouries. Definitly a attraction that worth your time."
"August 10, 2014",Poppies,We only went to see the Poppies and didn't go into the Tower of London. You do not have to pay to see the PoppiesThe sight of the Poppies is incredibly moving and even now is quite a sight. It will be breathtaking by the time they have finished. The last poppy will be placed on Armistice Day.The volunteers are assembling the Poppies on sight and each of the volunteers has a link to the First World War. A lot of the foreign tourists were more concerned with taking selfies and didn't appear to stop and think about the poignancy of it all.Link for the page 
"August 9, 2014",Going to the Tower of London ruined our holiday,"We went with the best of intentions. Had been to Windsor Castle the day before for a lovely day but ended up in the 'Gaoler of Towers' office having a hot sweet drink  for an hour after being verbally attacked and abused but one of the Yeomen.Alarm bells started ringing at the beginning of the tour when he made many offensive comments.  He really didn't seem to like women very much,  other nationalities had snyde comments,  and he seemed to be more preoccupied with the self promition of his after dinner speaking than the job he was actually in uniform to do. He was giving the impression that there were issues. The pace of the tour was unbelievable. After a very strange tour my son asked if he could have a picture with him, as you would expect that many tourists would ask. The man went into a  complete meltdown and started screaming about two inches from the face of my child. Ranting and screaming that he wasnt mickey mouse amongst other things and that he was a soldier. He had complete and utter hatred on his face. Without being melodramatic, it was traumatising and it has a surprising affect on you, especially when you werent able to protect your child from such a person. I don't upset easily but we was so upset I ended up sobbing to another Yeoman, he was luckily was a real gentleman. Later it didnt take me long in finding reference to the bad man as my son calls him on the Internet and on You Tube for his offensive comments. (Yeoman warden) Given that they have ""Investors in people"" status I would question the decision to allow this man access to the public, or awarding the status in the first place as clearly this has been going on for a while. . It does not appear to be a one - off.Even though I made a complaint to the Historic palaces I have heard nothing since. That is how much they invest in people. Far too full in August.... crammed!"
"July 27, 2014",Arguably London's best attraction but ticket sales are dreadful,"The Tower is one of my favourite places we visited during our stay in the UK. The buildings are largely intact, with William the Conqueror's White Tower amazingly unchanged since it was built in 1078. There's plenty to see, but you shouldn't miss the tours run by the yeoman warders - these guys are not just knowledgeable, they're very entertaining too, and they really make history come alive. There's no extra cost to join one of the tours, so be sure to do it.There's a fairly impressive display of armour and weapons in the White Tower, but having recently been in Paris and seen the massive collection at Les Invalides, we were not all that interested in more of the same. I did stop to admire a number of things, including Henry VIII's lance and the various suits of armour that belonged to him though. The Crown Jewels are the big drawcard here and really are spectacular. The size of the stones in the Queen's crown have to be seen to be believed. You do need to plan your visit fairly carefully. We arrived before the gates opened and once we were in, headed straight for the Jewel House, where the crown jewels are held. There was no queue to get in at that point, but progress through the rooms was still quite slow. By the time we came out, there was a long queue, snaking back and forth at the entrance.Once we'd finished there, we headed back to the main entrance and joined a tour. That was one of the most entertaining hours we spent in the UK. Following the tour, we took our time going through the White Tower and the Medieval Palace. We had planned to visit the Bloody Tower next, but by this time there was a crowd waiting to get in and we'd been there a few hours, so we decided to skip it.A thoroughly enjoyable visit.Now for the negative: The ticket sales system is chaotic and not explained properly on the website. I bought our tickets online the night before our visit. The email confirmation I received stated that I needed to print it and bring it to the group ticket window to obtain my tickets. There was nothing mentioned about printing anything at any point in the booking process prior to this and I was annoyed, as we had no access to a computer or printer, only having a phone and ipad. There was no information about what time the ticket office opened, so we arrived an hour prior to the Tower opening time in the hope that we could get our tickets early. No such luck. The Tower opened at 10:00am on Mondays and so did the ticket sales windows. We had breakfast and went back at 9:30 to wait. By then, there was a long queue at the individual ticket sales windows, another queue of people (who already had their tickets) building at the entrance and a short queue of people like me who'd booked online at the group sales window. A staff member appeared and informed those in my queue who had printed copies of their emails that they could just go and join the entrance queue - no need to get tickets, the email would do. This is contrary to what the email says - why not say that in the email? They have no provision for scanning barcodes on mobile devices though, so I still had to wait. Also, if you've booked tickets for multiple sites (e.g. for the Tower and for Hampton Court Palace), you still have to wait in line.The ticket sales offices opened at the same time as the gates, so I had my husband join the queue to get in, thinking that the queue of ten people in front of me would move quickly. Nope. By the time I got to the window, the people who HADN'T booked online already had their tickets and were halfway to the gate. Ridiculous.By the time I got our tickets, everyone who'd arrived without pre-booking was already inside, so it was a completely pointless exercise to have bothered booking online - oh, except that I saved 2 pounds.My advice is to book online well in advance of your visit (to save a bit of money) and make sure you can either print the email, or call at the group ticket window on a prior day to your visit to collect your tickets."
"July 22, 2014",An amazing must see in London!,"The Tower of London is an amazing site to see in London but you'll need probably 3-4 hours at least to see it all.  It cost £22.00 for an adult but you can get discounts by purchasing through their website ahead of time. We bought the London Pass (a definite savings if you plan to see the major tourist sites in London).  The Tower of London is included in the London Pass AND gives you a Fast Track option so you can bypass the long ticket lines.BIG TIP:  The Tower of London opens at 9:00am...go early!  You want to be there early as this is a popular site to see and does get extremely crowded.  Once you are in, go straight back to see the Crown Jewels exhibit (no photography allowed in the Jewels building).  The lines for this get extremely long as the day progresses so go early and go straight to see these first.  There are numerous buildings towers and museums to tour.TIP:  A  must do is to take the guided tour with a Yeoman Warder (aka Beefeater)...incredibly interesting and some of them are extremely hilarious!  Tours run every 30 minutes and last for about an hour.  You'll find the starting/gathering point for the tour near the entrance to the Tower of London, just follow the signs.  You'll want to skip doing this first though as you'll want to see the Crown Jewels first before the crowds increase.TIP:  Wear comfortable shoes (preferably rubber soles).  Some of the buildings/towers involve VERY narrow and skinny spiral stairwells up and down.  If you have mobility issues you will be limited in access to some areas unfortunately.  The Tower of London hold a 1000 years of history.  It's been used as a place of executiion, prison, armory, mint and museum.  Go early and give yourself plenty of time to enjoy this amazing area of history."
"June 8, 2014",Tower of London,"The tower is very old, started by William the Conqueror in the 1080's next to an old Roman wall.  There are actually 21 different towers with lots of different displays.  The display of armor was extensive and very interesting with very good descriptions.  The most popular exhibit is the Crown Jewels.  The crowd control was pretty good and not too obtrusive.  To see the crown jewels, you are sent through a number of rooms with interesting information to regulate the flow.  The room with the major exhibit uses people movers next to the crowns so everyone gets to see up close and no one can block other people.  You are able to go around and go by as many times as you can.  At noon, it was easy.  At 3, when I was trying to cut through during a rain shower, it was mobbed with a huge tour of French school children.  It is the luck of the draw.All the exhibits were well done with clear explanations.  I skipped the torture chamber.  The exhibit about the menagerie included great sound effects and interesting statues, as well as what happened to them (they were eventually sent to the London Zoo).Throughout the tower, were exhibits on earlier visitors to the Tower and their responses to what they saw, along with drawings or old photographs to show what the exhibits looked like then.There is a cafeteria, with mediocre food at high prices.  I had the 9 GBP for lamb tagine with vegetables and cous cous and a cup of tea  (10.65 GPB), that was mostly sauce, gristly lamb and very few vegetables - and too sweet.  This par for the course for major tourist attractions - similar to Disneyland.This is definitely a worthwhile place to see once but probably not twice."
"May 14, 2014",History Revealed,"If you are visiting London then the Tower of London is an absolute must. I have been twice and was simply overawed by the history that is captured here. everything from the Crown Jewels to the Towers themselves. The story of the Ravens and visiting the Chapel where Anne Boylen and other famous traitors and Wives of Henry VIII are buried. If you visit plan to spend at least a half day (we ended up spending all day!).Some hot tips:1.Do the Beefeater tour, As well as being very informative and entertaining it will also get you access to the Chapel.2. Get a London Pass/Travel Card. This gets you free access to a lot of sight seeing destinations in London or at a reduced cost and lets you skip a lot of queue's."
"March 31, 2014",Some practical tips,"There's no point in repeating the endless accolades given to this attraction - everyone knows it's one of the star attractions of London. So given you're inevitably going to visit it, here's some helpful tips to get the most value out of your visit:* In the high season, if you don't arrive at the ticket booth by 9am, you'll never get ahead of the crowds & will be surrounded by crowds all day* The shoulder season isn't as bad (before June & after September) and you can get away with arriving at the ticket office at 9.45am ready for the beefeater tour at 10am, commencing from just inside the entrance gate.* Entrance fee is expensive but the clever thing to do if you are staying in London for 5 days or more is to purchase National Railway's (ie, the overground, NOT the underground) 7 day travel pass (good for all modes of public transport in London) which enables you to take advantage of their ""2 for 1"" offer at many attractions, one of which is the Tower. The pass gives good value on transport if you use it every day and for the featured attractions, lets in 2 pass holders for the price of 1 adult. Into the Tower, that's a saving of £22!* Do a beefeater tour upon arrival at the Tower, as it is an excellent overall introduction to both the history & layout of the Tower. Aim to arrive 15mins before the hour to take the tour on the hour.* If you can't arrive by 1pm, don't go that day as you won't have enough time to get full value out of your ticket. You need at least 4hrs to see the basics inside the Tower with a 30min break for lunch.* Don't go on a day forecast to rain as you will not get a comprehensive beefeater tour in the rain, and so miss out on the excellent introduction.* After the beefeater tour, find out from the information leaflet handed to you upon entry (or from one of the information booths) what other tours are on that day, pick the ones you want to target & plan your day around those times.* We picked & enjoyed: 1)the Anne Boylen tour (play actors acting out in the Tower grounds a small drama about the preparations for Anne's coronation as Queen, with actors in costume highlighting the popular resistance to the coronation)                       2) the White Tower tour which shows you the features of the central fortification (the tower), such as the royal toilet & the chapel at the top of the Tower* As there is only one cafe in the whole complex, it gets crowded after noon, so have an early lunch to save time, or pack a lunch to save both time & money.* Try to visit the Crown Jewels as early in the day as you can in order to beat the crowds* It is worth purchasing an audio guide to explain what you are seeing when not with a live guide. Be aware though that the audio guide does not narrate the Crown Jewels.* If you are short of time, based on our experience of a full day seeing everything, you can afford to skip the following:   1) The Fusieliers Museum - this is essentially a military museum highlighting small arms, uniforms & medals. All of these are of low interest compared to attractions elsewhere in the Tower.   2) The Torture Museum in the basement of the Bloody Tower is small & based on reproductions of equipment. If you've been to other displays of torture dungeons elsewhere in Europe, you can skip this.   3) Beauchamp Tower can be skipped as all it has of note is some fairly unintelligible grafiti carvings in walls done by prisoners over the years The must-do's are the Beefeater Tour (the only way you will be able to access before 4.30pm the Tower's Church where Boylen & other famous executed prisoners are buried), inside the White Tower, the Crown Jewels, and a walk around at least some of the turrets on the surrounding walls.IN SUMMARY, don't miss a thing by arriving early and planning your day there along the lines indicated above.(If you have found this review helpful, please indicate so by clicking the Helpful button)"
"October 17, 2015",Hilarious (and informative) Yeowman,We took the Yeowman tour at around 11am and loved every minute of it! He was funny and very interactive! The lines moved pretty efficiently in the Crown Jewels exhibit. Will definitely visit again!
"October 15, 2015","If you can only do one thing in London, this is it","London is expensive, really, really expensive.  And I live in Sydney and it's not cheap here either so I am used to a high cost of living but London is on a whole other level!  So I recommend finding as many free or super cheap options if you are a tourist, like the Boris Bikes etc. and be really selective about where you go.  That's why I say if you can only do one thing in London then The Tower is a brilliant option.It is a stunning building with an incredible history.  It has been incredibly well preserved and it has been wonderfully well set out for tourists.  This is a place that children, teenagers and adults will all enjoy.  I was blown away by how well run it is and by the quality of the displays.  It must be a leader in its field internationally.  Do the free tours, set aside hours and see everything.  The restaurant inside was excellent (up market cafeteria)."
"August 31, 2015",Historical huge must,"Such a huge place it takes hours to go through it all, and then we skipped the Crown Jewels because the line was so long. We did join the tour with a Yeoman guard and that was great. Being interested in history this site is a must. "
"August 25, 2015",Poor use made of a great historical building,"This magnificent building promised a great deal from the outside. You expect history to be retold with displays, vignettes,etc. instead what do you get. A beefeater shouting a little history, costumed 'actors' re-enacting some historical event which nobody could hear. The Tower was half full of armour with only a small attempt at engaging the paying public. The queue for Crown Jewels snaked around too far, at this point we decided to leave. It's about time the owners got their act together. Maybe a visit to Williamburg Virginia should be undertaken (at their own expense) where history was presented with enthusiasm, colourful, friendly and clear. I did not need to told that funding was tight, it will remain even tighter if the product is badly sold. Get your act together, stop blaming and get working."
"August 15, 2015",Go early and follow a Beefeater,"The tower has a ton to offer for the history nut or casual tourist. You'll see so much of Britain's history here in one concentrated area. Two things I will mention. Go early and do the beefeater tour. The later it gets on in the day, the more people pack in and the slower everything gets. Especially the Crown Jewels. We breezed through that and by the time we left there was a two hour line. That and everywhere else became moving herds rather quickly. The Beefeater tours look like a tourist trap. They're not. These guys are legit. They're animated, full of passion for what they do, and know everything there is to know about the tower. Your whole experience will be miles better if you take advantage of their contribution rather than just walk the grounds yourself aimlessly. Their tour will give you background on everything and then you can gravitate towards what interests you most with more context."
"August 5, 2015",Tourist Trap,"I lived in central London for six months and can confidently say that there is no greater waste of money than visiting the Tower of London. Much of what can be seen at the Tower is either a cheap recreation or can be seen for free elsewhere in London. For example, the ""torture chamber"" portion of the Tower is simply a small room full of modern replicates of medieval torture devices and is altogether uninteresting. The other rooms and exhibits in the Tower of London are not much different from what you can find in any of the myriad of castles around the UK.  History buffs may take a great interest in visiting here and may even be able to justify the cost, but for the average traveler, I would say that your money is best spent elsewhere. "
"July 17, 2015",Not worth the price!,"My sisters and our dad took a trip to the Tower of London during the Christmas time. I first was reluctant to go because of the high ticket prices (even for children). We still ended up going. The line going in wasn't that bad, but as soon as we went in (mostly just to see the Crown Jewel) we found out that the waiting time to see the Crown Jewel was 2+ hours. Other exhibits had similar waiting times too. We then went to see the amour exhibit, but that too was people squished right next to each other. There was no space for actually browsing around. After 15 minutes of trying to find the exit, we exited and decided not to go anywhere else in the Tower of London. I would say unless you have a lot of time to spare, the ticket price is not worth it."
"July 11, 2015",Loved It!,"Wonderful Experience!  Here are my need to know tips:Before you go:*Go online and secure ""Ceremony of the Keys"" tickets.  One of the coolest ceremonies I've been to. *Go on you-tube to see Yeoman warder tour.  I've got small kids and miss most of what is said on tours, getting the tour a head of time gives me the information if I miss it. Also hearing it twice you might actually understand what is being said or look up what you don't understand. (1) Get the London Pass, as there is a separate line for London Pass holders(2) Get there when it opens(3) Go to the Jewel house first, que up and see the jewels.  Lines get long! (4) Go back for the Yeoman Warder Tour (given every hour) - if it's raining they take you to the church, not as excitingLoved every moment!  Hope you do too!"
"July 9, 2015",A great day out but long queues,A great experience and it was fascinating to see the Crown Jewels . The queues did spoil it a bit but the beefeaters were very informative and kept us entertained
"July 2, 2015",cracking day,"Tower of London is without doubt, one of the best days out in London.  If you want the Crown Jewels get there early as you can, as 90 minute / 2 hour waits are not unusual - we walked straight in at 10am! don't be tempted with a coffee and breakfast otherwise you'll end up queuing.  Get on a free beefeater tour - they are so knowledgeable, and although they look like their in costume (don't ever call it a costume though) , they are ex - servicemen / women with a minimum of 22 years in the armed forces.  There is much to do, but do a beefeater tour first (after the crown jewels) to get your bearings and understand what it is you are looking at - this is not Disney or Harry Potterland, but a 1,000 years of British history. There are cobbles so walking in high heals in not recommended - those damned Tudors had no consideration.  Nothing required more that 5 minutes queuing and you can amuse yourself with gasps of ""awesome"" every few moments  from the queues.  People watching is a pastime in itself - do not miss the changing of the guards, but do not get in their way, as you wont be told as they will march straight over you.  The beefeaters are the friendly security you can see. The Tower is a working regimental armed forces headquarters so the three or four lines of security that you don't see are not just armed with sharp pointy sticks and a loud voice. We saw a couple of exhibits being transferred (under a blanket) inside the complex (whilst we were on the ramparts) with four man armed army escort - and that was inside the grounds.  They definitely weren't soft and cuddly security"
"April 19, 2022",Cheap at half the price (obviously),"Feels odd doing a review for the Tower of London. You just simply must see it.We had a great morning out here. £29.90 each is a bit pricy, but we got two for one by printing off a voucher from National Rail, showed our train ticket at the box office and hey presto, half price.(You're welcome! :)We started off as many do with a yeoman (beefeater) tour that were running every 30 mind. The tour was free and starts just by the entrance. We had the honour of being led around by Yeoman Paul who is a real entertainer full of knowledge and a great sense of humour.He said we made his day by asking his name for a review. Nope, you made ours, mate.The tour is a fantastic way to start off the visit as its only 45 minutes to an hour and really sets you up to explore the rest of this beautiful historic masterpiece yourself.We finished the experience with a well earned trip to the Spoons opposite so really did experience the best of British that day. ;)"
"October 16, 2021",Awesome place,One of the best landmarks in London Loads fo things to see and do for all ages.Great historical place and steeped in history from 1066 to 2021.Highly recommend
"May 31, 2021",Worth a visit ,If you like history and gory details of previous royalty and this is the place for you. I was blown away by the crown Jules and also the various towers in which the Jesuit priests were imprisoned. 
"May 25, 2021",Impressive,Fantastic experience with a lot of interesting sightings and plenty of history Kids really enjoyed themselves as well as got a bit of knowledge
"April 24, 2021",Tower of London,Visiting it gives you a lot of knowledge about Royal family history.  And was so nice seeing ravens just walking around you! The best time for going their is the summer. 
"December 29, 2020","In constant awe, the crowd jewels are a must see",Worth every penny!! We visited July 2019 and my goal was to see the Crown Jewels. This place certainly exceeded my expectations. There was a full day of things to see and learn about. It was very hot in July with limited share so an umbrella may be good to have.
"November 27, 2020",Great for socially distanced visit,"It was a stay-at-home August and I wasn't sure about getting out to London at first.  Tickets were easy to get at short notice and we found only a short queue on arrival.  Inside within 10 minutes, we found plenty of space for distancing.  All internal areas were accessible and it was easy to observe distancing rules with all routes clearly marked out.  Great day out if you like history and the look of crown jewels.  Beefeaters were very welcoming, answered every question and posed for photos.  A great day out for a history buff or anyone with kids."
"November 6, 2020",A terrific tour!,"We hadn’t planned to visit the Tower of London but changed our minds while we were in London as it sounded so good! It was definitely worth it. There were no Yeoman tours available that day so we booked standard tickets and paid an extra £5 each for the audio guidebooks which were really interesting and informative and made the Tower visit easy to follow. I would recommend the audio guidebooks if you can’t book a real-life tour. We were able to see the Crown Jewels which was super impressive and well worth the visit, even just for that! We also saw the White Tour which is now a museum (I recommend doing that last), and the famous Ravens protecting the Tower. The only thing we could see was the prison, it was closed. I’m not sure if it was closed due to Covid-19 restrictions or just generally closed as it wasn’t clear but nevertheless there is a lovely space outside where you can sit on a bench and listen to the audio guidebook explaining about all of the infamous characters who were executed there!  Just beside there you can see the beefeaters guarding the entrance to the Crown Jewels. A lovely visit and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something to do in London!"
"October 31, 2020",Half A Day Required to Walk Through London's History,"My travelling buddy & I started our day by visiting the Tower of London as I wanted to see the Crown Jewels. We headed to the closest underground station which was Tower Hill & crossed the road to get to the Tower of London. Since we had bought the London Pass, entry to The Tower of London which was £28.90 was free. All we had to do was show the London Pass app on our respective handphones to the gatekeeper & get it scanned & we were in!We joined the Yeoman Tour as it is included in the price of an entry ticket. The tour lasts approximately 45 minutes to an hour & departs every 30 minutes. We were all led into the chapel of St Peter & Vincula to listen to a Yeoman who talked about the Tower’s stories. The Chapel is also the burial place of 3 Queens of England - Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard & Jane Grey. All were accused of adultery & treason.After the tour, we were led out of the chapel. We caught the “Changing of the Guards” session. It was so surreal. The guards were smartly dressed of course!We saw 2 of the Tower’s black ravens. They were on the ground & looked pretty much comfortable in the presence of humans. Currently, there are 7 ravens, in case 1 goes missing. Legend has it that if 6 ravens were to leave the court, the Tower will fall. The ravens are looked after by the Raven Master. Apparently, their wings have been clipped. There was also a huge canon on display for that instagram photo!Our 2nd stop was to the Crown Jewels. The queue was long & we waited close to 45 minutes before going in. The wait was worth it as we got to see the magnificent Crown Jewels on display. In my opinion, the most beautiful tiara on display was Queen Victoria’s Emerald Tiara. The Imperial State Crown which Queen Elizabeth II wore during her coronation was also displayed. Photography & video recording were not allowed as expected. There was a gift shop nearby & we dropped in as a 10% discount is given on all items to London Pass holders. Sadly, even with the discount, the items were quite expensive. Hence, we left empty-handed.Next was our visit to the White Tower, an example of Norman architecture in the heart of the Tower of London & one of the most iconic symbols in Britain. The Chapel of St John is in the White Tower. Basically, you can see the Royal Armouries in the White Tower & a dragon armour sculpture too!We also visited the Bloody Tower. It was where the 2 princes, Edward & Richard were kept before their disappearance. It was also thought that they were murdered there. Overall, I think half a day is required to visit all the places in The Tower of London."
"October 29, 2020",What a castle ought to be,"I'm a New York City tour guide on vacation in London. The Tower of London is a beautiful castle built by the Norman conquerors and their descendants to control trade on the River Thames and intimidate the local population of London. The Tower is located on the north bank of the Thames at the southeasterly corner of the City of London (the original old walled city). When you come out of the Underground at Tower Station on the Circle Line (yellow) there is a portion of the 2000 year old Roman wall still standing. There is also a DLR Terminal called Tower Gate a couple blocks away. Another exciting way of arriving or departing is by Thames Clipper River Bus at Millennium Pier a few steps from the Tower. I used the boat to get to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich after my Tower visit. Getting into the tower is £22 for adults including a small contribution. You can save a couple pounds online. The audio guide is another £3 and that is purchased once you enter the a Tower on the right. Come early! It opens at 9:00 AM. Select 4 on the audio guide and proceed directly to the Crown Jewels. High school students from Britain and the Continent will invade shortly en masse. Once you have seen the jewels (no photos) take your time and go back to select 1 on your guide and enjoy the rest of the Tower. If you need a restroom use them now before the aforementioned classes begin to. There are many helpful employees at the Tower. One explained to me the duties of the Royal Jeweler because all of the jewels, crowns, scepters, orbs, and plate travel to state occasions and royal family events. I learned about the mace. Parliament cannot conduct business without the mace present because it represents the royal authority so there are maces kept in both Houses of Parliament. When the Queen visits to open Parliament and she walks into the House of Lords they politely cover their mace laying on a table in a velvet cloth because the Queen, the royal authority, is present in person. As the man explained to me, ""This is what makes us British."" Don't forget to take pictures of the Tower Bridge framed by the windows inside the medieval turrets."
"March 29, 2014",Great history lesson,We visited London from the U.S. in May. We walked down the south side of the Thames in early afternoon with a refresher stop at the Oxbow before going across the Tower bridge for a tour of the Tower of London. It was well worth the walk and the price of admission. The Beefeater guide (these fellas are actual military personnel who guard the premises including the Crown Jewels) was both witty and very informative on the long history of the tower and it's famous residents. The tower itself is amazingly constructed and preserved. Don't pass up the armory across from the Crown Jewels repository. We did take a black cab back to our hotel (St. Ermin's) The driver was very friendly as we found most in London and gave a great tour on the way back. A great day overall. PS we walked by the Wheel but chose not to ride as it seemed a bit pricey and was crowded.
"October 15, 2013",Go early or dont go at all,We went early (8am) and location opened at 9am.  Got tickets and went inside and within the hour it was hard to move around and enjoy the sites.  The crown jewels exhibit was very impressive.  The views near the waterfront are very nice.
"August 25, 2013",Go early and stay long,"Warning - this place can get really crowded as the day goes by.  We went first thing one morning and didn't wait in a single line - anywhere.  And this was in June.  So that early morning thing really works!  Anyway, we thought the entire complex was fascinating and we spent four hours exploring - a one hour tour with a Beefeater (I do agree with some other posters that they ought to increase their ratio of Beefeaters to visitors) who was charming and interesting, and then three hours of wandering and poking about.  The Crown Jewels were worth seeing, though I wouldn't have waited in a long queue to do so - I mean, they were interesting but there are more interesting things to do there than wait in a long line.   I would recommend that you read up on Tower history before visiting - you will know more about what you're looking at as you wander around, and I do recommend wandering after you go on a Beefeater tour.  I probably won't visit the Tower again, but it was well worth the time and effort to see."
"June 22, 2013",Overpriced and disappointing,"I have to agree with the minority who find the Tower very disappointing. Of course there are some interesting things, and one rather lovely one (St John's Chapel) but I've tried twice to enjoy visits there, failed, and at £20.90 per adult I won't be trying again. It is, in concentrated form, what we've done to the more prestigious of our ancient sites and towns: touristify them to the maximum, promote them relentlessly and watch the crowds roll in despite extortionate charges. While Windsor Castle is still quite enjoyable, and Hampton Court very much so, the Tower has just let its mass-tourist agenda go too far. Good business, no doubt, but I just find it sadly unsatisfying; you can package things so far that even what is real feels fake."
"February 21, 2013",A good day out!!,My husband and I went to Tower of London and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  It is advisable to take a picnic lunch with you tho as the eating places inside are busy and expensive.  This is not a cheap visit so be prepared to spend at least 3 - 4 hours looking at everything.  Nice photo opportunities of the Queens Guards and also the Crown Jewels is something to see.
"October 25, 2012",A Day at the tower,"This was my first visit to this attraction, and what great value for money, the guided tour with a ""Beefeater"" was very informative and very interesting, learning serveral things we, as children were never taught in school.Time just flew, and before we knew it, the whole day had passed, and with the added bonus of NO queueing anywhere, very well organised, and to see the crown jewels was truly breathtaking.  Excellant day !"
"October 12, 2012",Queens Keys,Did you know you can book an exclusive invite to the Queens keys ceremony.This is a must do! Go to Tower of London website for info.
"August 25, 2012",In need of a re-think.,"My wife and I have been to London many times but for some reason, never to “The Tower”. We had just been to Spain where we had visited numerous beautiful and impressive historic sites and decided we would like to see the Crown Jewels. For some reason we imagined the Jewels were in “The White Tower” and there would be a few other displays of historic interest. Wrong! The first inkling of this was when confronted with the entrance fee, 19 pounds plus voluntary donation. Then the map of the grounds with its extensive walls, many towers and their respective rooms. We waited for one of the Yeoman guides as this seemed like an entertaining way of learning about the history of the place. At first the jovial humour of the costumed guide amused me, although my wife and her English cousin found all the murderous joking cringe worthy. However by the third stop, when he started going on like some archaic comedic cliché about the nationalities of our group and less about the history, I was ready to leave the group too. This was not a good start! There seemed to be other guides in fancy dress walking around with groups but we never got to make a comparison with this guide. We soon discovered the Crown Jewels are not in The White Tower and we joined the long queue to see them. The winding passage was lined with  large colourful back lit images  relating to royalty but personally I found them out of keeping stylistically and largely uninteresting and uninformative. The Jewels themselves were another matter and were astonishing and fascinating… but I could not really say beautiful. We then moved on to the White Tower which is apparently largely built with light coloured imported French stone, although the guide book barely acknowledges this interesting fact. The display of armour in the tower museum was mildly interesting, as was the weaponry and other devices of torture and death, but it is a little sad that the most interesting item on display was probably fat old King Henry VIIIth’s  cod piece! Seemingly, a dying old man’s attempt at a power statement in the face of  his failing health, or possibly a medical necessity because of his STD,  it has been argued. There were many other lesser towers to visit but perhaps the most interesting for me was about the Tower of London’s history as a zoo. Astonishing for us today.  My overall impression though, was that The Tower of London needs a make-over. The curators need to make up their mind what they are trying to present. Right now as a historical site, it lacks a sense of cohesiveness, and even a sense of dignity that many of the historic sites we visited in Spain displayed. It is certainly not beautiful in the way that they are but does have a history which could be presented better. I feel it struggles to entertain without sufficient real content to hold our interest. The expensive admission fee could help buy this. I would be pleased to act as a consultant! (Smile)"
"August 19, 2012",Best London attraction for the money,"The Tower of London (a castle, really, with a large white tower in it's center) is a great two to three hour visit to examine London's history mostly from the 15th to 17th centuries. While it is one of the more expensive sites to visit (20 pounds per person), it is likely one of the best to spend on. From the Thames it looks somewhat smaller than it really is. When exiting the Tube at Tower Hill, proceed through the underpass that faces the castle walls, then walk right about 100 meters, and you'll reach the ticketing courtyard. All in all expect about 300 meters from the Tube to actual entry over a lightly sloping concourse. Some notes for consideration:- You may purchase your tickets online and then pick them up at the group sales window, which is separate and to the left of the general purchase windows. You will save two pounds per ticket and likely avoid longer queues. There is no need to print out your ticket information, just provide the counter clerk with your order number. Tickets are valid for single entry up to seven days from purchase.- You may wish to walk around the inner walls of the castle before heading to the center courtyard to see the white tower itself. Just after you pass the ticket gate, there are a set of stairs to your right which allow you to get onto the inner walls. Follow the walls all around the castle and you will go into nice exhibits at every tower you come across, eventually reaching the crown jewels which are on exhibit during the Summer of 2012. Note that once you get on the inner walls it may be difficult to get back down as there are no open exits until you almost walk them all the way through.- There is a small outdoor cafe on the premises (Raven's Kiosk) that sells sandwiches and traditional pasties. It's sort of built into a wall cavity in one of the corners next to the souvenir shop. The food is acceptable and somewhat economical if you are in a hurry to get a bite to eat and move on (four to five pounds for a panini or pasty, one to two pounds for a soda). There is also a restaurant available if you'd like indoor seating, more variety, and higher prices.- Just in case you were expecting otherwise, the royal beasts exhibit is not a real animal exhibit. It shows, mostly through drawings and projections, the types of animals that were housed on premises at earlier times. Good mostly for small children.- Dedicate around two hours to see everything on your own. Add another 45 minutes if you want to tour around with one of the yeoman tours. These tours are quite fun and informative, but can get very crowded, and since the voice of each yeoman only carries so far you'll need to be near the front of each tour to truly benefit from it.- Although it is an outdoor attraction, the premises do allow for viewing even under rainy conditions as most of what you see is either inside the main (white) tower or in one of the other towers around the inner wall perimeter.A great attraction overall for any age."
"June 15, 2012",Tower of London - tips and review,"Loved the Tower - but haven't seen a lot of reviews that give any tips....Took the District (Green) Tube line to Tower Hill station stop. Very easy. ** TIP for tickets: go out of the station, turn left and go back down the other stairs as if you're going back into the station entrance - there is a little gift shop at the bottom right of the stairs - ""The Tower Gate"" that sells tickets for the Tower of London. BUY here & save yourself the big queue at the site. It's a short 5 minute walk to the site - and a few gift shops and cafes around as you go. TIP: you get a great view of Tower Bridge as you get close to the entrance gate. Take some pics and you can also get some great pics of the Tower Bridge inside of the Tower of London site. Tip: As some have said - plan to get there at opening. Then do yourself a favor and DO go see the Crown Jewels display FIRST. Go in the gate, down a bit and at the first ""real"" left you can make go into/ cross the courtyard and into the largest building at the far end - pretty well labeled. Crown Jewels has some great displays first (films, swords, etc) and then into the ""main room"" where you can go on a conveyor belt on either side of the main Crown Jewels OR you can also walk up & stand/ stare at them from a slightly elevated platform behind the conveyor belt. You can go back around and do the conveyor again - we did to enjoy all the majesty of the jewels. Then some great displays on the Coronation Banquet  pieces and some great armour, etc. Take your time to walk around & explore all the towers, walls, grounds & embankments - there is a LOT to do. NOTE: there are a lot of stairs, a lot of them very narrow and shallow - so take care if you have mobility issues. Great insight & displays and ""self taught"" lessons on the history, torture, animals, etc of the Tower along the way. Again, lots of stairs. Be prepared. Also - about 11 am the tour groups and school groups start pouring in - be prepared for large crowds, who seem to like to stop and talk in doorways (why! move over!) and walk in front of your pictures. Enjoy the sites & pageantry of the Fusiliers who are on guard - and there is a great military exhibit/ museum in the building across from the White Tower. Stop in the White Tower for a great look at history, armour & kings across the ages. The Yeoman/ Beefeater tours are every 30 minutes - but they are back up at the very front of the site - right after the entrance gate. Amazing stories and history! Not including the Yeoman tour - we took over 3 hours to walk around - and that was in the freezing rain. If it was nicer, we could have taken longer."
"April 25, 2012",London Tower Twilight Tour - A MUST,"These limited space, often sold-out twilight (7pm) tour of the London Tower was fantastic! They run only Wednesdays in the winter through March. The Yeoman Warders provide a hilarious, spooky tour through the palace at night that's beautiful, insightful and fun -even if there's alight rain. Our Yeoman had lots of personality and knowledge about the history and ghoulish events at the Tower. A must if you are available on one of those Wednesdays. We happened to get our ticket through eBay before we left, otherwise, it was sold out. Go an hour early to see the Crown Jewels first as they are not in the tour (closed behind a vault safe at that time of nigh)."
"February 28, 2012",Family vacation,A must see to understand whom and what London is... as well as London Bridge!
"January 6, 2012",MUST SEE IN YOUR LIFETIME,WOW. Wish we'd planned an entire day for this excursion. The Crown Jewels are here as well as the infamous Bloody Tower. You really feel as though you've stepped back in time. Fascinating place. Enormous too. Be prepared for a lot of pictures and walking.
"September 12, 2011",spent 4hours there and still didn't see everything,"We had bought tickets online in advance. There wasn't much of a line to get tickets or get in but it was nice to have a backup incase it was busy. We were able to take the tube directly to the tower as there is a 'tower' stop right across the street.  Checkout the old roman wall outside the subway station and another excavation on the pedestrian walk way on the way to the tower. There was a yeoman tour guide ahead of us so we joined that group instead of waiting 20mins for the next one. Our guide was humorous and informative. He led us into the inside of the keep and ended at the chapel. No pictures in the chapel, but make sure to check out the tomb markers at the front alter where Lady Jane Grey is as well as some other notables. The Normal 'white castle' was fun to see, it had large exhibits in the main rooms and smaller views of every day life in others. If you are claustrophobic some of the winding stairs and hall ways can be tight, but it's worth a look around. We visited the crown jewels right around lunch time so the line was shorter and moved quickly. I was surprised that there's a moving sidewalk to get you by the crown jewels, but i guess they don't want people looking too long and clogging up the cue. Beautiful stuff, not a very long exhibit but worth a look. we had lunch in the Tower Cafe. they had a good variety of pre-made sandwiches and chips as well as some really good baked goods, hot plate options like fish n chips and brisket. Make sure to pick up a raspberry tart, it was about the best thing i'd had all week, my husband had the Victoria cake and he said he wished he had gotten my tart. We exited on the river side where there are fantastic views of the Tower Bridge (aka: London bridge). Great opportunity to walk over and take a closer look. well worth the time, i didn't expect to be there more than 2hours but we were there for about 4hrs, so give yourself lots of time."
"September 12, 2011",Fun Times at the Tower,"We went to the Tower of London--- it was crowded but SO FUN and INTERESTING. Take the time to do the tour with one of the ""Beefeaters"" (Yeoman Warders). Ours was so informative and FUNNY. Doesn't matter how large the group is; these fellows can really belt out the information (you almost feel the need to stand at attention out of respect). We viewed the Crown Jewels, toured the central White Tower, took a break at the cafe (which BTW, was managed VERY PROFESSIONALLY), took a walk around the outer wall, and viewed the Fusilier Museum.... we didn't intend to, but we spent 5 HOURS at the Tower! GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!"
"September 3, 2011",Awesome Place to Visit,"My wife and I visite the Tower of London in March of 2011.  I have been before during the Christmas season and it was much more crowded.  The weather wasnt great, but March is probably the best time to go because there aren't nearly as many tourists as there would be in the summer.  Make sure you take the guided tour that is free and given by one of the Yeomen.  They know just about everything there is to know about the Tower and you'll learn things you would otherwise miss by going around on your own."
"August 26, 2011",Super interesting,"The Tower was very interesting. Although the guided tours were that large that you couldn't really hear the guides. I  bought a book about the tower, so that we could tour it by ourselves and read the information.We didn't make it to the jewelry room, because we were heading to a concert in the evening. I would recomend to go to the jewelry room first thing in the morning, because the lines build up true the day.I really enjoyed the tour, and would take it again, on my next visit. There is alot of things to see that have to do with the Tudors. I watch the show Tudors on TV, so I found it particularly interting to know about that epoche. Everybody who saw the show can easily understand what happened there. It was amazing to see all those rooms where those kings really lived. And the armour collecting is really great. They even have childrens armours, which I didn't even knew existed."
"August 26, 2011",Arrive early and see Crown Jewels first,The key to a great visit to the Tower of London is to arrive early and see the Crown Jewels before the crowds get too large.We went in early August on a Saturday. I had pre-booked tickets the night before on line to save a few pounds. I planned to arrive at 9AM but we didn't get there until 10AM. The crowds actually were not as bad as I expected. However by lunch time it was packed.
"August 25, 2011",Tower of London - and other sites - on the cheap,"Went to the Tower Area yesterday with grandson via C2C rail line from Essex. Train line goes via Fenchurch street to Essex coast. Went online to C2C and as long as you can show 2 train tickets you can get a raft of 2 for 1 entrance offers to the Tower and lots and lots of top London Attractions. I bought tickets from LimeHouse to Fenchurch Street only (1 stop). I got a cheap ticket for me and only paid £1 for grandson's off peak child which saved a LOT of entrance money on our visit to the Tower and Churchill's WW2 Museum at London Bridge.The other cheapo tip I have for visiting the Tower is to NOT go inside if you have a large group. It is VERY expensive for a family to visit (2011 prices adult £19.80, child £10.85) and unless you are mad keen to see where people's heads got chopped off you may not think it's worth the entrance. ALL of the Royal Armaments from the Tower are no longer there but are in Leeds (a VERY long way from London). Also all we saw of the Crown Jewels were pictures and videos. Just walk around the perimeter, take as many photos as you can of the outside walls including gates where the Beefeaters stand. Believe me, most people will never know from your photo's you have NOT been inside the walls. Also in the summer months, there are usually Jousts held in the old moat area on the outside of the walls. These also are free to watch and take pictures of."
"July 29, 2011",Our favorite,"After a two-week trip through Ireland and London, we decided this was our favorite place to visit.  Seeing the crown jewels and taking the Beefeater tour provide you with a sense of what the monarchy means to Britain (somewhat foreign coming form the US).  We learned so much and were highly entertained the whole time.  Plan to spend a couple of hours, but it is well worth it."
"June 24, 2009",Dont miss it,"This place is a favorite of the locals and tourists alike. I enjoy visiting on the weekdays, when the crowds are fewer. Take the tours but give yourself at least an hour to imagine things by yourself on these fabulous grounds."
"May 20, 2009",Step back in time,"A must see when visiting London. Get to know the Towers history through of one the guided Tours so you get a better picture of how things were. Although a great place to see, it can get very busy... buy your tickets on line before hand to save time lining up."
"May 5, 2009",Great attraction but see it after you have gotten over your jet lag,"The Tower is great. I booked my ticket online which saved me having to wait in line. (It was good because you had a seven-day window to go to the Tower. A good option if you suddenly change your plans) Our problem was we went the to the Tower right after we landed in the UK from the states. I thought we could easily ride the tube from our hotel to the tower. But a lot of tube stations were closed for repair (which I hear is typical in the weekends). What was going to be a direct trip on one tube line turned into a convoluted journey with transfers and lots of walking. By the time we got to the Tower we were more tired than before. I wished we had saved the Tower for another day and went to a smaller museum instead. My son ended up sleeping outside the White Tower on the park bench while I looked at the Henry the 8th exhibit -- a good one to see. All in all, the Tower is excellent. I just wished I had more energy to enjoy it!"
"April 15, 2009",Simply Amazing,"Though it is not the cheapest thing in London, it is certainly one of the most exiting. Walking through the gates, I journeyed back through time as we were led around the grounds on a tour, looked at the amazing artifacts inside of the museums, stared at the royal jewels with amazement, and watched the ravens tear apart their lunch. This is an adventure that you will never forget and is truly worth the price!"
"March 8, 2009",Great day out!,"Great attraction! A must see!!! I had doubts about going as I had heard what a tourist trap it was and hate overly busy places but I loved it!!!The Tower has such a vibrant history, and the Crown Jewels live there!!!I started my trip with a Yeoman tour, which although was crowded, I could hear him well thanks to his booming ex-military voice.The Yeoman was hilarious!!! I usually feel that tours drag but he really dramatised every last moment!!!I really enjoyed my day here but felt there could have been more by the way of talks/tours and the layout of certain exhibits was a little confusing.I think a good tip here is to plan your time here using the tower of london website, as orientation around the different towers can become pretty daunting! And join a tour!"
"March 4, 2009",Fascinating,"I arrived at around 10:30am on a Tuesday, so it wasn't overly busy. I queued very briefly to buy my ticket and not at all to get my audio gude. I was planning on going on one of the Yeoman tours, but the crowd was so big for it that I struggled to hear him. I chose instead to get an audio guide at the price of £3 (with a student card). It was absolutely worth that extra cost. It provides you with five main tours covering all aspects of the Tower, as well as the option to listen to extra commentary as you make your way around it. You could spend hours just ambling around listening to it. As it was, I just did the five main tours, plus a couple of the extra commentaries and was there for two hours. Overall, the Tower is a friendly, very welcoming place. Everyone there seemed very willing to help and answer any questions and were brimming with information. Plus, the Tower is just such a must-see site - definitely worth your while."
"March 3, 2009",Magical place,"Me and my partner have visited the tower of london twice in the past year and both times we have really enjoyed it. The first time we did the audio guide and this has to be the best audio guide we have experienced, it's just concise and informative. There is just so much to see and the space just fells magical.The second time we visited, we went on a yeoman tour and which was very entertaining and we got to go in the chapel with this one. We even got to see a few of the ravens with coloured tags on which I have since checked have names and other information listed on the website. It's just a fanatstic place!"
"February 15, 2009",Lock me up anytime.... this is a great experience!,"We visited a week before Thanksgiving.  We arrived at opening time, and there were NO crowds. We very nearly had the place to ourselves. Everything we had expected and more. The Beefeaters were all friendly, a wealth of information, and posed happily for embarrassing photographs.  By the time we left, several hours later, the number of visitors was still neglible. Have a GREAT meal when you are finished at Wagamama, just across the walk from the entrance before moving on."
"January 16, 2009",The Ultimate Attraction for English History,"The Tower of London will always be my my ultimate site in London! When I got there I found that the Beefeater tours were too crowded, so I did an audio tour instead.  It was by far the best choice! The audio tour has an amazing amount of information stored on it.  It allows you to have a basic idea of the history, or if there is something you want to know more about, it gives you the option to hear about the subject in more detail. The actual castle is in amazing condition!  There is so much to see there!  It was amazing to see Traitors Gate (where Anne Boleyn and other 'traitors' were bought through to the castle), The Crown Jewels (including the crowns og previous kings and queens) Be ready for lots of walking though, and there will be crowds.  But I highly reccommend an audio tour.  It really separates you from the crowds so that you can truely immerse yourself in the awe of the unbelievable history!! I was in awe of this place, I love history, and this was just the most amazing place that I visited in the UK."
"January 10, 2009",Excellent Slice of History!,"What a treat to see the Ceremony of the Keys last December! Every night for at least 700 years, the ceremony has taken place at exactly 9:53 PM. Tickets are free, but you must request them in advance by post. A word of warning, however - the ceremony is indeed carried out my members of the Tower of London Guard and they do not suffer fools. You will be escorted out if you can't keep from yapping! Witnessing the Tower lock-up is a fantastic way to end a day of London sightseeing and I couldn't recommend it more highly!"
"June 22, 2011",Great way to know British history,"First thing: book tickets online; that entitles you to a discount.  Also, a ticket is valid for 1 week from the date mentioned.  So if you have to make your own itinerary, this flexiticket is a boon.  Instead of taking a bus tour of London or a hop off hop on tour, you can save money by doing a free walking tour of London and using a traval card/oyster card get down at Tower Hill tube station and make your way to the Welcome Centre to get the ticket vouchers in exchange of your online tickets.  It is best to come early morning when most tourists are at the Buckingham Palace to see the Change of Guards (1130 hours).  You can avail of the Yeoman's Warder tour which gives you a hang of the Tower and all the history and gore associated with it.  You should then make your way to see the Crown Jewels.  If you have the energy, you can then see the White Tower (if you are interested in the various armours and weapons used by the royals of yore) and the Medieval Palace and take a walk along the walls of the Tower.  It can take up to 4-5 hours if you really want to see the Tower in detail; if you are short of time, take the Yeoman Warder tour followed by a visit to the Crown Jewels followed by a walk along the walls of the Tower.  This attraction is a must see if you are in London"
"June 12, 2011",The must-see attraction in London,"When in London, you must stop and spend a half day at the Tower of London, it will be well worth it. Just after getting in, there are free tours leaving from the entrance led by a Yeoman Warder that take 1 hour and give you a good idea of the history of the Tower. These guides are humourous and knowledgable so take advantage of that.There is a lot to see, the crown jewels are amazing although the line to get to see them can be very long. On a Friday late morning, it wasn't too long.  The Tower itself has a lot to see inside but there a lot of stairs to climb both up and down so it can be tiring. There is a large gift shop in the basement of the tower. The walk aloong the walls has some great views of London. I recommend the cafetria for lunch, wasn't that expensive and had a good selection. The only thing that disappointed was the torture chamber as nothing really to see in there. My kids were rather disappointed in that part. A tip is to buy your tickets online and then pick them up at the ticket office. A family pass was a great deal and reduced to 47 pounds when buying it online."
"May 19, 2011",A fun and historically interesting afternoon,"The thing that struck me the most about the Tower of London is the overwhelming sense of history that it exudes.  For me it wasn't the crown jewels or even the beefeaters (or Yeoman Warders to be correct :-) that created a connection to the past but the architecture itself.  There really is something special about touching stonework that was completed on the orders of William I.  Certainly worth a visit for anyone interested in British history.I would however recommend not going during 'peak times'.  I went at lunch time on a Saturday and some of the ques were pretty long.  I'd recommend either going in the morning before the coaches of tourists arrive or later on in the afternoon, although I should point out the last Yeoman Warder tour is at 3.30pm."
"March 24, 2011",Must see attraction,The Tower of London is a must see attraction.  Visit in the morning when it first opens (10.30). See the Crown Jewels first when there is no crowd. Definitely do the Yeoman Warden guided tour.  They are very informative and entertaining.  Allow 3 hours for the visit.  The Tower is a very short walk from the Tower Hill Tube Station.
"December 20, 2009","So much history, so little time!","We stopped here as our first sight in London and I really enjoyed it.  The size was amazing to be in the middle of a large, modern city and to be able to see the different layers of restoration and repair that it has undergone in the hundreds of years of it's existence.  The crown jewels were beautiful along with the other royal collections of trumpets, swords, and serving wear.  It was fascinating to ascend the tightly wound stairs to the actual tower where prisoners were kept and had inscribed the masonry.  The Henry VIII exhibit had just opened and I was amazed to see all the military wear for people and horses.  Being American, this actually brought to life some of the world history that we seem so detached from.  It was an amazing collection of armor and wealth.  I would certainly return again!"
"November 4, 2009",Wonderful Experience,"My friends and I got to visit the Tower of London in March and we all had a wonderful time. The Beefeater who gave us the tour was extremely funny. When we went into the Chapel and he told us that Anne Boleyn was buried there, it was unreal. The Crown Jewels were amazing and to see the graffiti on the prison wall's was interesting. We didn't stay to watch the demonstrations they put on outside - we caught a few moments as we walked by and earlier in the week when we were walking around there - but we ended up spending about 3 hours there and it was great. I would definitely go again! They were in the process of constructing their new Henry VIII exhibit, so it would be fun to go back and see that. This is definitely one of the must-see places in London and there's a great little restaurant not too far away called the Dickens Inn."
"November 4, 2009",Jewel of London,"This is the best cultural/sightseeing tour i have ever had the pleasure to go on. An overwhelming example of British History from the legend of Henry the VIIIth to Queen Elizabeth. I would happily visit the tower of London time and t time again and not get bored, the knowledge of the Beefeaters was outstanding and the humour .... forgivable !! The crown jewels and the solid gold punch bowl are something i wont forget !!!!!"
"October 26, 2009",History and the Crown Jewels - not to be missed!,"Spent a few hours at the Tower of London and it was worth seeing.  We saved a lot of money by grabbing a 2 for 1 entrance coupon from www.daysoutguide.co.uk.  We took the tour with the beefeater which gave us all the info we needed on the history of the place.  Our beefeater was quite funny as well.  I recommend the tour or you'll be walking around looking at old buildings without having any idea what they are.After the tour, we visited the Crown Jewels, which is located inside the Tower of London.  We were there in April, so there wasn't a huge line to see the jewels, but I imagine it would be packed during the summer as they are setup with many rooms and rope offs to accommodate a long line.  The jewels were a cool highlight of the trip - we saw the largest diamond ever found and it was an incredible collection.The place is great to see for its history and the jewels.  It's also near the Tower Bridge, so you can hit both attractions on the same trip out."
"September 27, 2009",Our Teenagers Loved It and Learned So Much History,"The Tower of London was our first stop on our recent trip to London and our teenaged boys are still talking about it.  We had no idea how much they would appreciate it.  Do not pass up the Beefeater tour - it was excellent!  He was amusing and very informative, so our boys got a very good sense of the history before wandering through the buildings.  Our group was quite large, but he spoke loudly and clearly and waited for everyone in the group to get close enough to hear him.From the outside, we thought it looked quite crowded with school groups, but once inside, everything flowed and we didn't need to stand in any lines.  There is so much to see - plan to spend at least 3 hours there.Our younger son hasn't studied World History yet, so we were a bit concerned about him following the events.  He was so fascinated and picked it up so quickly because of the interesting way that it was presented.  We then went to Windsor Castle where King Henry VIII is buried, and our son was in total awe of his grave - the entire history was tied together.The Crown Jewels were amazing.  There are guards there who will answer questions (as well as telling you to put away your cameras - make sure they are in your bag, don't even have in your hand).  There is a moving floor that moves you slowly past the display, but there is also an elevated step where you can stand and read the descriptions of each crown.  Obviously, this is another do not miss display.Absolutely, a must-see!"
"August 1, 2009",A must see for HIstory lovers!,"My Husband and I went to the Tower on the last day of our Honey Moon, and we loved every minute. When we first got there we took a general tour around, within a half an hour we were recuited into a rebillion to seize the Tower and took part in a recreation. It was very educational and very fun! The actors playing the rebels on our side ( locked out of the main tower grounds) Were very believeable, it was like stepping back in time! The whole experience took about a half an hour and ended in a briliant sword fight! Afterwards we went and seen the crown Jewels which is a must see! We had some ice cream, bought some souviners, and seen the rest of this amazing peice of history"
"January 7, 2009",Don't lose your head,"I have taken this tour three times in the last 7 years and enjoy it every time. The beefeaters are lovely, the history so rich, and the building a monument. The tour groups are larger in the summer season than the rest of the year, but prebooked tours are not a must, though well advised in peak times. The crown jewels are a must see, as is the weapons museum. Questions ? You can e-mail me at snshinetv@aol.com."
"December 31, 2008",Best Day Out in London!,"We spent a fascinating 4 hours at the Tower and we still didnt see everything!I would highly recommend the guided tours provided by the Beefeaters, they make the place come alive and you learn things you never would have known by just looking around. Was a little disappointed that we didnt get to go into the chapel but there was a service in progress that day, but that just means I have an excuse to visit again!Crown jewels were great, you go past on a travelator which is good because that means there is never a crowd around the cases (and you can go around and around as many times as you like!).I have been to quite a few of the big attractions and musuems in London and this by far was the best. It seems expensive for a day out but I think it is completely worth it for the amount of things you see and learn. And if you use your tesco clubcard vouchers, it's free!Highly higly highly recommended!"
"December 3, 2008",Ceremony of the Keys,"I visited the Tower twice during the ten days I spent in London.The first visit was during a weekday with several hundred other tourists.  I won't recount the visit in detail, aside from the fact that I agree it is a ""must-do"" while in London.  The Crown Jewels, the White Tower, Traitors Gate, and the Chapel of St. John are all worth a visit.  The audio guide was especially useful, focusing on the numerous stories behind the surroundings.The second visit was at night during the Ceremony of the Keys.  This is a nightly event that is worth a look even for those who think they have seen enough pagentry and royal happenings.  According to our guide they have only been late once during this ceremony.  (While the city was being bombed during the Blitz and even then it was only by 6 minutes).  Of note, it is a bit tricky to gain admittance and must be done well (2 months) in advance.  Further information is available on the official website."
"November 15, 2008",Go to the Tower!,We visisted the tower last Thursday and had a thoroughly enjoyable day.  We booked tickets online with 365 and saved a few pounds.  My tip would be to go straight to the Crown Jewels exhibit.  We went at 10 am and the queue was minimal.  By the afternoon it was huge (even in October).  Then we went back to join a yeoman guard tour.  Our guide was Mark and it was very informative as well as hilarious at times.  Not to be missed!
"November 1, 2008",great attraction for learning English history,"My husband and I thought the Tower of London was great. It is actually several buildings all surrounded by a large moat in the middle of London, surrounded by modern town and on the river Thames. It contains the old ""White Tower"" which is where most kings and rulers lived, including Henry VIII, the spot of the beheadings of various people, including Anne Boleyn, the treasury of England, where you get to see the crown jewels of England, and other buildings that I'm not sure what they were. I must say that the crown jewels are a MUST SEE! They are awesome, the only way to describe them. The tower has the dungeon where they tortured some, you can see the Traitor's gate, where they brought Anne B. through in a boat, and you can have a guided tour there by a beefeater (in uniform) who will explain everything. I thought the raven story was interesting and there are still quite a few there. All in all, it was very interesting and the crown jewels makes it worth seeing at least once."
"October 18, 2008",Wow---The Crown Jewels!,Take the Beefeater tour so you can take inall the history. The Crown Jewels aremagnificent. Shoot your photos on the Thames with Tower Bridge in the background.
"September 17, 2008",OK but very long queues,We queued for 45 minutes to get tickets to go in (and not all the ticket booths were open).We really enjoyed the Beefeater and White Tower tour.It is a very interesting place to visit but we found the queuing for everything out weighed the enjoyment of the day.
"August 18, 2008",Great Place to Visit,"We were only in London for two days as part of our eleven day European vacation.  We chose to do the British Airways Eye, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, War Museums and the Tower of London.  The Tower of London was, by far, one of the most interesting tourist destinations and well worth the visit.  Unfortunately, we only spent a couple of hours here.  I would recommend at least four hours to see everything and have time to do at a leisurely pace.  Again, we crammed a lot into two days."
"June 20, 2008",We were treated rudely,"While the view of the castle is fabulous we were surprised to be treated so rudely by the staff at the Tower of London.  Be warned if you are traveling with children do not take part in the guided tours as the tour guides are not ""child friendly"" and the staff running them did not seem to care for children."
"June 1, 2008",tower of london,"This was a really interesting part of my trip. i booked ahead as i thought there might have been a queue but turned out that i wouldnt have had to. still it was very convenient that you can book your ticket on the internet but the date is flexible within 7 days so i could choose when i was free to go within those 7 days (brilliant for tourists with flexible plans).Definitely join an beefeaters tour - they're fantastic!!! great way to mix in the history of the place with an engaging, humorous approach. Seriously it was the best tour i went on in europe.The Crown jewels are quite spectacular, it was just dissapointing that the travellator seems to whiz you by them very quickly... make sure you take a good look! and probably a good idea to get a postacard of the jewels as photos are not permitted (a bit dissapointing actually). But no worries because there are at least three souveneir shops around (subtle hint to get you to buy something??)Im not all that into my battles weapons or protective armor history but if you are there are some brilliant displays.Good day out, take a decent half day if you can to absorb everything."
"January 23, 2008",Crown Jewels are breathtaking!,"We visited the Tower of London during our 9 day stay in London in March 2006. My favorite part of the attraction was the Crown Jewels. You actually go into a vault like room and the Crown Jewels are encased in glass with 2 people mover conveyors on either side. Luckily, it was not crowded when we visited and we were able to spend as much time in the vault like room that we wanted. The Tower also has some wonderful gift shops; bought a tiara/crown for myself.The architecture is wonderful and the history alone is one that should draw any tourist to the Tower of London.This is a must see in London.Enjoy!!!"
"September 10, 2007",A Great Family Experience,My son and I went in December 2006 and enjoyed this the most of everything we saw in London.  Especially interesting were the men who dressed as and demonstrated what is was like to be a knight.  The Beefeaters were all very knowledeable and entertaining.  The Tower itself is incredible.
"January 7, 2007",Great fun,Although this may seem like an expensive place to visit it is really worth the time and money.  Take the time to walk round and listen with the Yeoman of the Tower you get o hear all the horrid bits of the Tower and also get to go inside the really small chapel.  Its also nice to hear about the people that still live inside the Tower walls.  Inside the White Tower you can see the suit of armour that Henry 8 wore - you ladies reading this look at his protection that was given to his jewels no wonder he went through 6 wives!!!  Good time will be had even if it's not nice weather.
"October 22, 2006",Must See,This is a must see when in London.  Follow the Beefeaters tours.  They add alot of humor with the information they provide.While you are there see they Crown Jewels.  Pictures do not do them justice.
"August 13, 2004",WOW! So that's how they did it...,"I visited the Tower of London by myself and had the best time! I was over in London for a study abroad, and was trying to avoid any places that would teach me useless history- but I got a kick out of walking through the tower and seeing the different tourture devices and weapons used in all different types of battle. This would be a good place to take kids, as there are people dressed up in ""old london"" clothes that perform sword fighting acts and such. The exit of the Tower is also right by the London Bridge. This was definitely worth the wait, but it is sort of a long wait. But highly recommended."
"July 10, 2004",Neat place but NOT appropriate for small children,"We found the Tower of London fascinating -- from the history to the architecture to the tour by the ""Beefeaters"". I can't really add anything to the previous reviews EXCEPT a small warning. We brought two smallish children (< 4 years) there, which was a mistake. Not only was there very little to hold their interest, but so much of the Tower is twisty staircases and narrow passageways, basically useless for strollers. If you do bring kids in strollers, you'll end up either doing what my wife and I did - taking turns sitting outside with the kids while the other goes through the various towers and exhibits - or missing the best parts entirely."
"December 16, 2003",A must see,"There are not enough words to describe the Tower. If you are not a history buff, there is still plenty to go and see from the armor displays to the Crown Jewels. If you are a history buff, it is a completely jaw dropping, awe inspiring experience. The vast differences of the experiences of the people who have lived there - voluntarily or not - is something that sounds as if it is out of a romance fiction, but it's not, and you are standing right where it happened.The entry line is long (or was when I went) but oh, is it worth it."
"September 23, 2003",Soooooo Very Worth It!,I can't say enough good things about the Tower. It is worth every penny of its entrance fee. There are so many things to see and learn about that you will more than likely be overwhelmed and in awe at the same time. Ask the beefeaters about some of the ghost stories of the tower or about anything at all from its history and it's guaranteed they will have the answer. Also check out Tower Bridge while you are there. It has stories of it's own right to be shared.
"September 20, 2003",Great Tourist Destination - just avoid TodayTix,"Great place to visit as a solo traveller. Would recommend buying tickets directly through the tower ticket window. I bought a ticket online through #todaytix and even though the name suggests tickets for today, I selected the next available date for entry ticket looking at the day of the week not the actual date. Turns out they only sell tickets for a week in advance. After noticing the error within two minutes of purchase, after multiple chats through their bot and email support. They were unwilling to help resolved the issue and effectively stated too bad you agreed with t&c which state no refund. Anyone seeing this post and what a cheap entry ticket for Wed 18 Oct 2023. Please let me know. "
"October 16, 2023","Interesting experience, reinforces our historical knlowedge.","Interesting experience, much larger area than I expected, was unaware of the layers of defense. Surprised by the size of the area on confinement for Ann Boylin. Was unaware of the torture devices. "
"September 1, 2023",Amazing Experience,"We could feel historical significance of this castle in so many ways. More than three hours flew by as we explored the place. I found it be a very moving experience. And for our teenage son, it was the highlight of our trip. "
"August 31, 2023",Amazing experience and well worth the time and money,"Great experience and way to learn about the history of London! We found this very informative and rich with information that you could read and explore at your own pace. Tour with staff was great, they were enthusiastic and clearly passionate about what they did which was great to hear.There is something for everyone here which makes it great for all types of groups! We would recommend going early, we went when it opened and didn’t have to queue for the Crown Jewels (go here first to avoid lines) and managed to see everything before it got super crowded"
"August 31, 2023","A Must see, book the 10 a m tour!","When in London….this has to be on your list for sure! SO many things to see, the castle does not disappoint, Crown Jewels however did somewhat…mostly bc I thought I’d see all the Tiaras they’re always fighting about (isn’t there always a battle over who will wear what tiara to which wedding??)….and NO tiaras! Lots of crowns on display, still breathtaking, but no tiaras! Just saying….Kids loved the Armory, we appreciated the history! LOTS of stairs to climb so if you have knee/hip issues, this may be a tough one for you. Also, try to make the 10 am tour as it gets VERY busy and line ups go around the castle for tickets!!"
"June 19, 2023",Important Structure to England and London - MUST SEE ,"For me any visit to London should include a visit to the Tower.  There are things in London older and today there are things that are more significant.  However, there is probably nothing older in creating the significance of London today than the Tower.  While London was important to the Romans, it lost all significance until William the Conqueror established the White Tower here shortly after taking control of England.  From that moment forward, the Crown of England became more and more linked to London.  For a long time this was the Royal Palace residence.  However, over time as new palaces and governmental institutions were created, especially those in Westminster, the Tower lost its political importance.  Still, it continued to have an importance as a prison and as a place of protection.  Today the Crown Jewels are still held and protected here.  All of this is essential to the reason you should visit.  When you visit, absolute must sees are the White Tower (the original Norman fortress) and the Crown Jewels.  However, do not miss the outer rings of towers and fortress walls.  We started our tour at the entrance with the lions, who symbolize the ruling family monarch.  However, shortly after entering the Byward Tower, we entered the Traitor's gate to climb up to Wakefield Tower which had some good displays of when the castle was a royal residence.  We then walked the outer walls for great pictures of the city (some of the best we have) to see the Lanthorn and Salt Towers before making our way to the former royal menagerie (zoo).  We then walked the inner courtyard before visits to the Crown Jewels and White Tower.  Let me say the White Tower has the armory and some fun things for children as well as a beautiful stone Norman chapel.  Before leaving we stopped to see the display for the wives of Henry VIII and then we saved the best for last.  Any visit to the tower has to see the Ravens whose presence is required to keep the monarch in power.  Again this is an important building for both England and London and it is essential for any visit.  "
"May 28, 2023",Be prepared to queue and patiently wait (and hope you might see something!),"Been about 10 years since my last visit and had been prior to that too. This time it seemed it was catering for the masses and do I mean masses - almost impossible to see exhibits such were the crowds. This was not over the Easter weekend either ! Goodness knows what it would’ve been like then. Given we spent over £100 on tickets this was hugely disappointing.  Despite a really good  guided tour, which given inclement weather took place in the chapel (a relief as there were so many people it would have been impossible to hear otherwise), it was simply queues, queues and almost fight to see something. I have huge nostalgia for past visits. Don’t think I will be back again which is quite disappointing as this was my favourite place to visit in London."
"April 11, 2023",Great place,Great place! Great experience for adults! Great experience for kids!You feel the history in the walls. Unforgettable!
"November 7, 2022",Auld England,"We went there this morning, August 26, 2022. It was everything I expected of old English history and more. We entered about 9:00 after buying tickets at the ticket booth.  We were told about the Jewels tower, so we decided to see that before it became too crowded to enjoy. Bummer that they don’t allow you to take photos inside of it, but we could in other parts of the tower buildings. The coronets in the Jewels tower were breathtaking, and thinking about how old they were was mind boggling. The tower opens at 9:00 and it’s probably a good idea to get there early to avoid crowds. Also enjoy the spectacular views of the London Bridge while you are there."
"August 26, 2022",Superbloom super bad,Waste of time and money Lots of dead plants and more or less the same flowers all the way round.Was in and out in 15 minutes.Seen better at my local park.
"June 30, 2022",A surprising highlight for the 10y old kid!,"A surprising highlight for the 10y old kid! Our recommendation align with many others here: - Meet up early on the day if possible (we met up 10:00 on a Saturday)- Go straight to the Crown Jewels (if interested). This was the second best thing to do for us- Then go for a tour with the Yeomen Warders (Beefeaters). If you and your kids understand English, this must be 10x better than the audio guide. The beefeaters give you a fantastic impression of the life behind the tower walls. Look out for Scott Kelly!- If you have time and energy, go through the buildings and sites."
"June 12, 2022",Really Great Tour,"Visited early October, wanting to take advantage of the lack of crowds, (and kids!) and it was a great success. The Beefeater Tours are not currently being run which was a shame but we did opt for the Audio Tour at £5 per head so we would get history and context to what we were seeing. We have suffered some dreadful audio guides at attractions before so can confidently say this really was one of the best. The technology was very modern and easy to use, the audio very clear and informative and the visual guide on the smart screen of the device logical and easy to read, even in sunlight. The guide is actually several different tours to different areas of the palace, each perhaps 20 to 30 minutes so you can choose which you do and in which order. I would say do them all, especially when it was as quiet and comfortable to move about as it is now. Good value at £5.We had no concerns re Covid the whole time and staff were in evidence throughout cleaning and wiping surfaces. There were no queues and we saw everything really easily. It’s also important to say that the history, grounds, displays and building are amazing. The difficulty is trying to ‘get your head around’ the fact the tower has stood pretty much as it is for 1,000 years!"
"October 20, 2020","Fantastic place to visit, so much information and history","The Crown Jewels are amazing, the whole place is full of history and it is very easy to access all the information you need. Probably the best historical venue l have been to"
"October 19, 2020",First trip to the Tower ,Loved everything about this place. We had a tour with a beefeater... this is an absolute must. So informative and so much to do in the tower l. You can easily spend the whole day.  
"October 18, 2020",What a wonderful experience,"We needed time away from home so decided to go to London for a few days and as I'd only ever walked round the Tower of London I decided to book to go in.  Wow did I chose the right time to go.  Had a wonderful time was able to able round looking at everything and not being rushed or pushed out the way there were only about 400 people booked to go round for the whole day instead of the thousands ... a plus point of Covid (the only one) was really interesting and the Beefeaters were all so friendly and I believe really enjoyed telling you about the Tower.  As for the Crown Jewels well whats not to like about them.  Again you was able to really spend time looking at everything and reading about it all.  All in all a very wonderful experience shame it took me so long to get there, but then would I have enjoyed it as much with crowds of people?"
"October 17, 2020",Brilliant ,"With no queues, we were able to wonder around without impediment. We got to see the Crown Jewels without being rushed, and took time to marvel at places so steeped in history. I wish the Yeoman Tours was on, but in the current climate, it is understandable why they are cancelled - this said, they are around ti answer questions. "
"October 8, 2020",September 2020,"Very quiet,we went at 12noon, no queues to get in or to see the Crown Jewels.Great time to visitRavens were on form "
"October 6, 2020",History,Really enjoyable visit..lots to see...stepped in history..approachable staff...have been before..always see something new 
"October 4, 2020","Very quiet for a summer’s day, but not as quiet as I had been led to believe","Having seen several reviews, and some advertising, saying how quiet the Tower of London was we decided to give it a try.The highlight of this visit of St Thomas’s Tower with the reconstruction of Edward I's bed-chamber – a wonderful room with fantastic views; just now sure how we missed this on our last visit!This was our second visit this year (meaning our “Historic Royal Palaces” family pass has already saved us money) – the last was in January and I can definitely say the Tower of London was busy than in January.  In January there were no queues to see the crown jewels, in August there was a long queue. The advantage of the HRP pass is that you don’t feel you have to see everything in one go (hence missing St Thomas’s tower on the previous visit) which then makes the whole visit a lot more relaxing.During lockdown there are no warden tours, so the Beefeaters were a lot more visible and easier to ask questions of.  In addition, the area next to the Thames was cordoned off and only accessible to those visiting the tower (a huge plus as this area is often packed with sightseers).  Outdoor catering and toilets are available. Not all of the Tower of London has re-opened, but still well worth a visit."
"September 28, 2020",Great experience,We had a lovely time visiting the Tower of London. It was very well run with all COVID measures adhered to.
"September 27, 2020",Brilliant,Brilliant! We all thoroughly enjoyed it. The stories you hear on the way round are made for teenage boys! Crown Jewels are spectacular. Can’t recommend enough.
"September 21, 2020",Good trip,Good trip though quite expensive also good 4 schools and  colleges in London you need now to be covid-19  friendly 
"September 4, 2020",Another great trip,I have been to the Tower of London before but it was many years ago. I took my partner this time round and they chuffed with the experience.  It’s lockdown so to our surprise it was lovely and quiet considering it was August . The Crown Jewels & armoury was our favourite especially as the staff were so nice around that area.
"September 3, 2020",Fantastic - well worth a visit,"As a family of 3 we visited the Tower of London in Aug 20 – when the lockdown had been lifted but everywhere still quiet. I have to say what a fantastic experience this was. Whilst it is sad to see the numbers down and not as many people visiting, but as a tourist to this site it was amazing. No queues to see the Crown Jewels which are truly stunning and breath-taking…in fact they were so mesmerising that we went in twice and on the second time we were in the viewing room alone, we took ages looking at everything, we felt really lucky. The Yeoman guards were all friendly and were keen to answer any questions and were more than happy to talk about the history and points of interest. The guard near the Bloody Tower was particularly informative and he spent ages with us telling us about Sir Walter Raleigh and the history of his time in the Tower. The white Tower is also amazing, with so many interesting and historic pieces to look at and information to read. This place is fantastic, we spent ages walking around, saw the ravens, visited the café and the shop. I know we visited in exceptional times and I hope that the visitor numbers increase for the attraction but believe me seeing this place when it was quite with no queues and being able to go around at our leisure was truly a privilege. It is fantastic. If you only do one thing in London - do this."
"September 2, 2020",Best time to visit,"Right now is the best time to visit everything is so quiet - took my children on Friday afternoon pre booked online walked straight in ! Covid 19 precautions taken seriously - hand sanitizer stations / one way systems / and floor markings - not all is open to visit and only select drink/ food stalls , but had a great couple of hours ! Thankyou"
"August 23, 2020",Fantastic!,"Amazing, beautiful place.  Stunning buildings, fascinating history.  So sad to learn from the Beefeaters that it is facing threat of closure following lockdown.  Please visit!  It is quiet and you will see the crown jewels without the usual queues."
"August 12, 2020",Family visit to the Tower of London,Due to the pandemic we booked as a family for 10.30. We arrived on time and the organisation was excellent. Everyone was extremely helpful. It was a wonderful experience. The Yeomen were exceptional. We were able to see everything. The facilities although limited were excellent. I was with my daughters and grandchildren who loved everything they saw. As an older person everyone was extremely kind and helpful. It was a wonderful experience and we all had a fantastic visit.
"July 23, 2020",Felt ripped off!,"Went with kids and family. Mum booked tickets on the website, but didn’t realise a lot of it is closed due to Covid-19!For £25 (instead of the usual £30) I felt ripped off!The grounds and the houses are beautiful - it’s like a little village inside, the yeomen are friendly and helpful, but all we saw was the White Tower and the Crown Jewels - the rest was closed - the kids were looking forward to seeing the Bloody Tower, but it was closed. We all thought it was quite boring!I think £15 is OK to pay. £25 is FAR too much - especially as I am a British taxpayer living in London - these things should be free or heavily discounted for us, it’s our history!In the summer months, roughly 12,000 people visit the tower, at around £30 per person that is ALOT of money!"
"July 22, 2020",To many people taking selfies,I really enjoyed my visit to the Tower of London though it was way too busy full of selfie   taking tourists who didn't care about the history of the place. I had to wait 20 minutes to see the crown jewels because of everyone had there backs to it and phones out.
"July 21, 2020",Great time to visit - and support a good cause,"This was the second weekend of opening after the COVID closure of summer 2020. We we able to book tickets a couple of days beforehand. Numbers are strictly controlled and this is probably a unique opportunity at any time of year to visit with just a hundred or so visitors within the Tower at any one time. Strongly recommended!Entry was very efficient - we arrived a few minutes early and went straight in - and there is a clear one wau route through the castle. Like most Londoners, I last went when I was ten, so it was great to see it again with more knowledge. I took my teenage daughter for her art project on armour and we spent a happy 90 minutes there - could easily have been longer. The smaller buildings are shut (but there is plenty to see outside), and the Crown Jewels and White Tower had plenty on show inside, including the beautiful Norman chapel. There were enough visitors inside the exhibitions that we felt more comfortable wearing masks - it is not compulsory. The ticket feels good value (and I'm now upgrading my ticket to membership so as to visit Kensigton and Hampton Court too). The beefeaters and guides have plenty of time to explain things to visitors - including the huge impact of COVID on the palaces' finances. If you can visit, it is both a unique time to do so, and a very good cause.One set of toilets is open, but there is no cafe or indoor seating open in the Tower (a takeaway kiosk would be useful), so take a snack and a drink. We ate afterwards, looking over the Thames and with a coffee from the little kiosk by the pier. Catering options in the immediate vicinity are pretty limited, particularly on a Sunday."
"July 19, 2020",TOWER OF LONDON TOUR,"If there is a tour you must do while visiting London, it is this one! This tour had so much educational information and was so well explained that if felt like I was living in the actual time. Our tour guide is dressed like a knight and explains in detail everything about the castle. He walks you to the courtyard, the different rooms in the castle, all while explaining everything to you and interacting with you. He challenges you while you learn and makes everyone stay engaged. You will also see how they used to do the changing of the guards there AND you get to see the jewels used by the old kings and queens. It was totally worth it... takes no longer than 2 hours."
"June 13, 2020",Mr & Mrs Abedalkarim ,"We visited the Tower on Sunday and we are very disappointed that we were not informed about the facilities that would be closed off ,  it seems most of the jewels were locked away. We understand about the COVID situation but the cost was inappropriate with lack of advanced closures."
"September 21, 2020",Worth a Historical Visit,Crown Jewels are just awesome. You have to admire the craftsmanship of these beautiful pieces of our history.  We could not guess the value! Lovely to see the Yeomans and Guards in their uniforms.  The Yeomans are so informative and such gents! Walk around the battlements for goods views of London. Traitors Gate is no longer is surrounded by water but stand there and think about the poor souls entering their fate.
"September 21, 2020",For history lovers,"Well preserved monument, with reach history. Early visit recommended to avoid large groups. A tour guide was very helpful."
"September 20, 2020",One of the best experiences I have ever had!,"Wow! This is a fantastic trip. Firstly, to be there without the usual crowds was brilliant as you could really take your time and get a good look at everything. There is so much to see with so many twists and turns.An absolute highlight... in fact one of greatest moments I have ever experienced was visiting the Crown Jewels. Simply stunning and displayed so fantastically so you can really soak it up from all angles and see every detail. A wonderful lady (I wish I had her name to quote) took time to personally explain each item and tell us all about its history and the different gems that were in them, who they were designed for etc. She was fabulous and really went the extra mile! Overall one of the best attractions I have visited in London! I LOVED it and will never forget my experience."
"September 19, 2020",Very nice and educational,Good value for money as we spent 4 hours learning British history from one of the cradles. Very interesting and nice. 
"September 15, 2020",Ask for Luis!,"A wonderful experience, in particular the tour of the Crown Jewels by Luis who was generous with his time and gave brilliant insight and history to each of the crowns and their diamonds. Thank you for making our day special."
"September 14, 2020",Tower,I think the tickets are a bit pricey but it's worth a visit and the staff are all very informative and friendly
"September 13, 2020",Fantastic History Lesson,"The Tower has been in my family history since the early 1400s, my grandfathers were constables at the tower, one grandfather was beheaded there in 1547 and my 2nd cousins Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard also met the same fate. The chance to visit doesn't present itself often due to commitments, however, yesterday was such a day. I'd been chatting with the governor and the curator recently and I seized the moment of opportunity to visit.We parked the car in the Tower Hill Coach and Car-Park just a few minutes walk to the Tower, there were no queues as one might usually expect, as due to COVID-19  you have to pre-book with a time-slot. Well, we arrived 15 minutes early and were let straight in. There was a small bag search on the way in but everyone was socially distanced.Once inside there were no Yeoman warders giving guided tours of course, which is fully understandable, but due to a lack of visitors there was also no ""crush"" to see elements of the tower and we could, at leisure make our way around the tower soaking up the history. At certain points, there were Yeoman warders who were more than happy to chat about history and we learnt quite a few new things yesterday. A special mention to Yeoman Warder Briggs and Yeoman Sergeant Fuller who were very helpful indeed. The crown jewels are usually heaving, queued for ages, but we were able to just walk on in, and linger to view at our leisure, even go up and down the travelator a few times.Accessibility wise, I took my mobility scooter and it was a nightmare on the cobbled streets, a real bone-shaker, but doable. The Disabled toilets behind the jewel house were spotless and worthy of a 5* alone. We couldn't go in the white tower due to mobility issues, but it didn't make for any less an enjoyable visit.If you want to visit.... now is the time to do so"
"September 7, 2020",A must in london,"If you have time for one thing on London, this should be it. You will be overwhelmed by the history and the whole tower experience. I cannot sell this enough.  "
"September 6, 2020",Great First Time Visit,"For some reason we have never tried the Tower of London but seemed the best choice in the current climate.On a warm or hot sunny day this is a must. There are multiple towers to explore , all rich with fascinating royal history. Even with our young children , the content kept their interest throughout the tour.The Crown Jewels are a sight to behold and worth a visit on its own.There were no queues or crowds due to the pandemic which made the whole experience comfortable and we never felt rushed at any point.Furthermore we had the privilege of watching the guards changing as well as regular conversations with the Yeomans.At the moment I would thoroughly recommend a visit.Ps. Be aware of the ravens , they will take your food !There were a couple of food outlets around though for the reason above I would recommend doing this before or after your visit ( upon exit there are multiple cafes / coffee shops). "
"September 4, 2020",Great -- even in the rain,Always love going here. A must is the chapel tour where the go over the history. Not too long and good information.
"June 7, 2020",Thanksgiving holiday,"We enjoyed exploring London over Thanksgiving. The Christmas decorations were up so we enjoyed those at night. Tower of London was entertaining, we spent about 3 hours there including a great beefeater tour. "
"May 16, 2020",Amazing,I always had an interest about castles. And this building satisfied me most so far. This place is actually something as cool as Eiffel tower. 
"April 14, 2020",You MUST do the Beefeater tour,"Being that we only had about 1.5 days in London before heading to Africa, we had limited time to pick what do to but WOW we are happy we chose that Tower. You can spend HOURS here if you have the Time but we managed to see a lot in about 2.5 hrs. The Beefeater tour, included in the price, is worth it; so much information and great British humor too! Don't miss the Crown Jewels as well! The grounds were beautiful and so many great places to grab pics! Don't miss out on this fantastic attraction: )"
"March 22, 2020",A real must if you're in London for a holiday,"A great experience, to begin with. You'll spend at least a couple of hours, maybe even 3 if you go to every available room, courtyard or armory.Also, the audio guide is informative and entertaining, and even moving, from time to time. Fully recommended."
"March 18, 2020",Expensive - but worth it!,"I didn't even want to take this tour when we arrived - but my wife and daughter did!  I'm so glad they insisted.  Everything was above excellent.  If you love history, this one that should not be missed"
"March 17, 2020",Tower of London,This is a must see if you’re visiting London. Be sure to allow yourself at least several hours to roam through the complex which includes the Crown Jewels and an extensive display of armor. Take the guided tour with one of the ‘Beefeaters’ who are knowledgeable and spirited.
"March 17, 2020",Awesome,Great piece of architecture with great history. Its must visit in london. Often rated as top attraction of london. 
"March 10, 2020",A must watch place,The kids would resonate with the rhyme of London bridge is falling down.Do take the river ride on Thames Clippers
"March 7, 2020",Must visit,"This is one of the most visited sites world wide not only in London , to make the most of your visit to understand the history you either join a tour or take the Audio guide and thats what I have done ,using the audio guide will help you understand the history with no rush of the tour, the rich history of this site is over whelming , and you will get the chance to see the royal jewellery there. This place will take between 2 hours and 4 hours of your time ( 4 hours if you want to go deeper in the history side as this castle was the home of many kings and queens ). Best time to visit early morning"
"March 7, 2020",Gotta see!,"If you’ve only limited time in London, the Tower should be a top priority! Be sure to catch a Yeoman’s Tour—they begin right after the entrance and are free—to catch the spirit and hear the stories that go with the Crown Jewels, turrets, etc."
"January 27, 2020",60th Birthday Trip,"This was the 1st visit for my husband but he hates crowds so decided to go in January as knew it would be quieter, what a great experience, we headed straight to the Crown Jewels (WOW) then to the White Tower also WOW, then mooched around the walls and then went for some lunch, allow plenty of time."
"January 26, 2020",Must See in London,"Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly gave us a memorable tour:  super interesting and full of information, but also very funny."
"January 25, 2020",Super interesting!!!,"First of all, the guided tour was awesome! The tour guide was extremely funny and redacted the storys in a fascinating way. Absolutely loved the place."
"January 25, 2020",Off season relaxed visit,"The Tower of London audioguide (which we did) does not do justice to the Beefeater or other in-person guided tours (we were fortunate enough to hear both during the course of our self-guided visit), but is well done and works for self-paced and more in-depth touring. The audioguide was well-done and helpful (particularly the historical content). This is a wonderful season to visit if you have flexibility as there were no crowds and limited lines. We could make multiple passes through the Crown Jewels and White Tower sections, in particular. Staff were helpful and efficient. Definitely worth the visit and walking (multiple staircases).  "
"January 23, 2020",History and marvel,The tower and its story are really interesting even if not so special: tower is very well maintained and kept.Really impressive are the Crown Jewels: a must see in London.
"January 21, 2020",Worth visiting,This was certainly worth a visit during our trip to London. Perhaps a bit pricey but you can spend hours here exploring and finding out about the vast history of London and the monarchy. 
"January 21, 2020",Fun day out,Great chance to explore a place tied in with many of history's infamous characters. The theme actors added to the experience.
"January 20, 2020",An Informative Visit,It was quite interesting to hear the history of the Tower told by Yeoman’s Warder.  Incredible stories of what they used to do and on what appeared to be very scant evidence.
"January 19, 2020",Beautiful view of Tower Bridge,Very interesting place to visit. My favorite part was the photo opportunity of tower bridge. Overall it’s a great history lesson. Next time I will be taking advantage of the free tour. 
"January 12, 2020",Fun and informative.,Amazing to see the beauty of the crown jewels.  Easy walk lots of history.  The beefeaters dont give nearly the tour they did in the past.  Only a quick intro in the church.
"January 1, 2020",Great Tour,The Tower is very impressive and definitely worth the trip.  Best to go early to void the inevitable crowds!
"January 1, 2020",Very interesting attraction,"We got a two for one entry price as we traveled by train to London. The place is bigger than you imagine and has plenty to see, read and hear. The history is fascinating and there is something for everybody. I would recommend this as a must see if you visit London."
"December 31, 2019",Very cool!,Give yourself plenty of time; definitely see the crown jewels and do the tour with a Yeoman Warder guide (unless you are easily offended - and I mean that in the nicest of ways  - they are hysterical)!
"December 31, 2019",Yeoman Warder tour,"We felt lucky to have an excellent tour with Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts. The fascinating history of the Tower was delivered with great enthusiasm, wit and humour, and he managed to hold the attention of a very large group of British and multinational visitors. It was a tremendous way to start our 5 hour visit. All areas were incredibly busy, but the hour queue to see the Crown Jewels was definitely worthwhile, with the presentation inside very well laid out."
"December 31, 2019",Tower of London,A must see location while visiting London.  So much rich history here to take all in one day.  Enjoy walking the grounds and hearing the stories told by the Beefeaters as well as played out by period actors.  Give yourself a full day to enjoy.  My only regret was I would have arrived earlier.
"December 31, 2019",Ticket organisation could be improved but a great day,"When we visited, it was already very busy despite it just opening. After waiting in a queue at a ticket booth for nearly 20 mins, a member of staff told us we needed to go to group tickets to collect on site. We then had to go and join another queue which was frustrating. When you get up close to the group tickets, there is a board on the floor which tells you this is the place to collect tickets. However, given the number of visitors, this was impossible to see on arrival and I think it would be much better if this attraction displayed this information much more prominently. Once we got in though, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely be returning. As others have said, getting to the crown jewels quickly will save you having to queue for too long."
"December 31, 2019",Take the Yeoman Warder tour!,"Get here early if you don’t want to stand in long lines to see the Crown Jewels (in the early afternoon we waited about an hour and 20 minutes).  The Yeoman Warder tour is definitely worth the 45 minutes it takes; history - royals, murder, executions -, and a good bit of humor mixed in.  Yeoman Warders are incredibly knowledgeable, approachable, and personable, even answering individual questions once the tour has concluded.  A must see/do if you’re visiting London! "
"December 30, 2019",A MUST,"A real great place to see. Very successful so you need to expect a very crowded area, particularly if you want to see Crown Jewels (magnificent) and White Tower with its great collection of armours. 2 hours will be at least necessary, but count 3 because of waiting times to access best places. Enjoy"
"December 30, 2019",Amazing MUST See,"Plan on walking a ton, taking many stairs and not caring a bit. This is a must see if you are in London. Plan on spending the better part of your day here. The armory is set up like a piece of artwork, the jewels are stunning.. and don’t forget the beheading places and the Black crows. Our families favorite part of the trip. "
"December 29, 2019","Interesting, Fun, Historical London Must See","No visit to London is should be complete without a tour to Tower Caste. It’s expansive presence on the River Thames provides hours of entertainment and history. It’s a self guided tour so you can take as long as you want, but the architecture and artifacts there make it worth lingering. If you hope to see the Crown Jewels, planned to arrive early before long lines form."
"December 29, 2019",Tower of London,What is a trip to London without a visit to the Tower of London?  My friend and I opted for the beefeater tour-thankfully it was a clear but cool day.  The beefeater tour is outside.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it when visiting the tower since it gives you more background.  There are a lot of steps (240) so beware.  I did enjoy the tower and the display of armor throughout the ages.  I was expecting to see cells as this was an old prison and was disappointed by that.  Bad of me?
"December 28, 2019",A Fabulous Slice of History,"I've been to London several times, but always avoided the Tower of London because of tales about crowds, but being there on a fine Fall day in the ""shoulder season"" was very rewarding.The Tower of London is a misnomer. The photo is of White Tower, an early fortified palace. However there are 40 buildings inside a walled compound, telling English history spanning several centuries. There's Traitor's Gate where 'enemies of the state' were brought in by water to their jail cell or execution, but there are also museums on the grounds, excellent education signage, the quarters where Sir Francis Drake was quartered with his family -- three times -- before being executed may years later. And be sure to join any group getting a lecture from a Warder (the proper name for the mis-named Beefeaters). They are superbly educated on the history of the compound and sometimes funny too. Don't forget to view the Crown Jewels assembled over many years of the British Empire. You can be there for hours if you want to soak in the importance of this site (which is right near Tower Bridge and water tours on the Thames)."
"December 28, 2019","""A sight no one ever beheld without Astonishment""","Tower of London is synonymous to  the Crown Jewels and in itself does not need an introduction. Visiting this palace, go straight to the Crown Jewel as it has the longest line up. There's a lot to see as it comprise of a few buildings and boasts of it thousand years of history. Be wary of steep and narrow stairs and uneven terrain/steps. I find that buying tickets online is a bit cheaper that at the gate.Its interesting to see the White Tower and its Royal Armouries with the giant sculpture of Dragon and King's Lineage and Medieval Palace. Also, it is very close to the London Tower Bridge which makes for great selfies/pictures.Hope This helps,GorgeousRaquel"
"December 28, 2019",Awesome ,Have been twice now and still have not seen it all yet fantastic easy to get around and there something for everyone 
"December 24, 2019",Tier of London,Absolutely loved this visit. Didn’t get to see everything due to time but learnt so much from what I did see. Definitely recommend this but plan for a whole day visit.
"December 24, 2019",Beautiful at night,"We were only in London overnight so we had to see it at night, no option to go in.  Beautiful views of the tower and the bridge."
"December 23, 2019",Nice Historic Perspective,"We waited for a tour from a Beefeater, and I think that is probably the best part of the visit. It only lasted around 30 minutes, and that is probably the biggest shame. The Beefeater was knowledgeable and entertaining, and I would have liked to listen/learn more. The crown jewels are obviously spectacular to see, but pictures are not allowed. The White Tower holds plenty of history, but overall I wouldn't expect to spend more than two hours at the Tower in total."
"December 22, 2019",Amazing. ,Highlight of our first trip to London. We spent nearly 3 and a half hours here. We did not utilize a tour but instead had our own materials for info. I imagine it’s a bit hectic during peak times so thankfully we came during off season. So much history. This site is very well kept and informative to those speaking other languages as well. 
"December 22, 2019",Because it is still posible to live history,if you love all the movies about being a knight in shining armor then the tower is for you. i felt i was at the round table
"December 22, 2019",Nice places!,This a very import place if you want to get to know a little bit more about London history.The exhibition they have about the jewels of the crown is amazing. You should totally check it out if you have the time 
"January 10, 2020",well worth it,Not just the history that makes it so worth a visit - its the staff- the beefeaters and supporting staff that make it a really nice place to visit- unfailing friendly and helpful from the kind man in the ticket booth who did his best to help with a ticket problem all the way to the staff in the tower -despite the cold weather -the guided tour with the Yeoman warder was funny and informative and staff in various parts of the castle were really friendly and happy to chat  tip- it is cheaper to book online ( you will still have to queue to pick up your tickets)  but be wary of ticket sites that wont give you a refund if you have a problem -go with one that offers a refund
"January 6, 2020",History Beheld,"I knew the story of the place, but seeing it in person is something else entirely - I recommend it. The Yeoman guide was pretty amusing too!"
"January 3, 2020",The Tower area is a must-see,"The Tower of London is part of a larger experience, which is collectively well worth seeing.  The audio tour is a good option. We very much enjoyed it, including seeing the Crown Jewels."
"January 3, 2020",YOU CAN’T MISS IT IF YOU’RE VISITING LONDON,"The Yeomen Warders of Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, give an amazing tour, the most enthusiastic guides I’ve see in any historical place or museum. An absolute must see for all London visitors. "
"January 2, 2020",Crown Jewels,This was a great self walking tour of the Tower. The main reason I wanted to see this attraction was not only the history but to see the Crown Jewels. It was amazing to see the size and detail of this facility.
"January 2, 2020",Just fabulous ,"What a great experience for young and old. A true understanding of part this country’s history. The violence and methods of torture should be told as a history lesson. We had 3 young children with us and they came away with a greater knowledge of their history. Fabulous guide, who was also humorous and knowledgeable "
"January 2, 2020",Guided tour of Tower of London,"Feel I have to respond to the negative reviews of the Tower which have filled the newspapers today. I visited the Tower a few months ago with my two small children (ages 5 & 8). We all loved the tour from the Beefeater, who was entertaining, educational and very polite. The tone of the tour was perfectly in keeping with our expectations and we couldn’t fault any aspect of the visit. The simple fact is, our history has at times been a violent one and the Tower has played a central role in that story. That is what makes it such an interesting place to visit! Anyone offended by a retelling of our history needs to get a grip of themselves.All the staff were so helpful and clearly enjoyed dealing with the public. I would enthusiastically recommend this attraction to any family visiting London. In my opinion it is the most fascinating place to visit in the whole UK."
"January 2, 2020",Authentic Beefeaters and Ravens, Brilliant way to hear about history of England. The tour guide was great and explanation of what the Tower was used for was insightful
"January 2, 2020",Very interesting! ,We really enjoyed touring this piece of history.  Lots of interesting stories.  We even got to see the the Crown Jewels and watch the guards changing and practicing routines.  
"January 1, 2020",The Tour Guides Are Fantastic!,"We went on a rainy day, as all of our trip was rainy. Unfortunately, by the time the next tour was set to start, it was a downpour. The guards took it in stride and did a condensed version of the tour in the chapel, before letting us explore solo. We got a lot of the information regarding the property and the Tower of London, as a whole. It was nice to have them be so accommodating, especially as many people in our group were not prepared to spend the day in the rain. We were able to explore the grounds on our own also, so I felt it was still worth going, despite the weather. I hope to go back for the full tour on a sunny day in the future."
"December 22, 2019",History laden ,"Absolutely loved our visit to the Tower of London.  It was very, very cool to get a sense of life in the the Royal Court. Strongly encourage you to visit especially the go and see the Crown Jewels and the White Tower.  "
"December 21, 2019",Value for money,"We took the audio guide option , partly because my partner is French and doesn't have a sufficiently good grasp of English to be able to fully understand a Beefeater's explanations , but principally because we wanted to do the tour at our rhythm and to linger or have a break when we wanted . We were there for over 4 hours and saw more or less everything , even getting to see the Crown Jewels before the hordes descended . Lots of stairs , mind you , so bear that in mind ."
"December 19, 2019",Impressive collection of armory but the Crown Jewels not to be missed.,"This was my second visit on a cold and rainy day. We toured the grounds and the different exhibits. Entering the Tower grounds took minutes but if you want to see the Crown Jewels expect to wait about 45 minutes. The jewels are stunning and simply should not be missed. The Ravens are neat, take a moment to learn the story. The place is spotless and well maintained, highly recommend this view into history."
"December 18, 2019",A great day,Me and my partner visted the tower of London recently. We had pre booked our tickets on line. We went straight in through security and picked up our audio commentary pack. We then had a good 3 1/2 hours tour around the full site with excellent commentary. We took part of a tour with one of the Yeoman who was a lovely guy who was very imformative with a good dose of humor. A great way to spend a day in London
"December 17, 2019",Loved it,Though I am not  remotely a neophyte to English history I loved this venue .... a great day the staff that are amazing... great way to spent the day
"December 11, 2019",Visit Tower of London,Enjoyable afternoon at Tower of London.  The Beefeaters tour was interesting and fun. Lots of history .Crown jewels are amazing. 
"December 10, 2019",Nice to be there,"Me as big lover of UK and London, i can just say, perfect! Nice walk and close to london (tower) bridge! If you are in London, you must see it!"
"December 8, 2019",Not to be missed,We’d been to London a few times but somehow missed the Tower. The history associated with the tower was amazing. Seeing the Crown Jewels was very impressive and walking around such an impressive building 
"December 7, 2019",Amazing ,It has more to do and many to see if you are hear you must go.It is an amazing experience for childrens and adults
"December 6, 2019","Second Time Here, Love it Even More!","Perfect Day with a chill in the air and no lines to speak of!! The jewels are so amazingly beautiful. The history is very riveting, especially the graffiti walls of the prisoners who were held at the Tower.  I was by myself on this trip to the Tower of London but I did notice that there were a whole lot of activities for the kids. The tour guides and/or Wardens had the group attention with their stories.The little cafe was also good. I had a quiche and I enjoyed it. A little pricy but heck, I'm on vacation.I highly recommend this experience and will go back again if I'm lucky enough to come back to London."
"December 5, 2019",Captivating ,"The tour guide makes the tour.  Our “beefeater” was SO good!  He was entertaining, informative, and made history regarding the Tower of London come alive.  It’s as if the grounds were speaking to us through him.  I could have listened to Scott Kelly all day. It’s very important that you get the guided tour before you walk around the grounds.  Otherwise you have no idea what you’re looking at.  The chapel on the 3rd floor is in its original state.  It’s amazing to see in person. GO to this site.  It’s well worth it!!  #ScottKelly"
"December 5, 2019",So cool....,"An absolute must when visiting London - I was actually going to chop this off our list when we hit London. We just came from Edinburgh, Scotland and said - 'meh, what's another castle' I am SOOOO glad we went. From seeing the crown jewels to the views and history of the City. It was an amazing adventure!"
"December 5, 2019",Unbelievable,"As a history nut, I was in heaven. We spent about 4 hours there and pretty much saw everything we planned on seeing."
"December 4, 2019",Lots of Armor,"My hubby just loved this, especially the Hall of Kings. The grounds are just beautiful, great views of the Tower Bridge, so much history! So glad we made this stop."
"December 4, 2019",YESSSSSSS!,"I have waited so long to see the tower! This was by far my favorite part of our visit to London.  We explored every possible thing there was to do there.  Take your time going through, take a guided tour from the guards at least twice, since they are only 30 minutes.  Each guard focuses on something different and has a different personality.  So much fun.  Creepy rooms, beautiful jewels, amazing stories, sad stories, crazy history dating back so many years, and the crows!!  You can visit and see a lot in 2 hours, but I recommend taking your time."
"December 4, 2019",Amazing ......! ,This place is simply amazing. So many historic events have occurred here and being there was quite awe inspiring. It is significantly larger than it appears. You could spend all day here. The white Tower was impressive (a lot of steps) with a lot of interactive displays. Plenty of tours and such like. Highly recommended. 
"December 3, 2019",Very interesting and very large,Huge area to walk through with lots of different buildings and exhibits. Really enjoyed the talk on the Ravens and learning their names and stories. You will want to make sure you have plenty of time to wander around and explore. 
"December 2, 2019",This is the #1 site in London - all others came later,"If you only have 1 or 2 days make the Tower your priority.  It is 2,000 years of history and 1,000 years of English history in one place.  Outstanding, interesting and funny tours by the Yeoman Wardens (Beefeaters) are included.  If you take the train to/from London look for the 2 for 1 voucher from the train company.  We printed a few days before arrival and it worked - 1 ticket free.  "
"December 2, 2019",Crown jewels,"We went to see the crown jewels first as it gets very busy very quickly. Awesome diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires to name but a few of the stones.After the crown jewels we went and explored the rest of the tower Including the execution tower.Well worth a visit. A must for young and old. "
"December 2, 2019",A must see in London,Visiting the legendary Tower of London is a must see for anyone who pays any attention to the evolution of western civilization. Amazing stories well presented in a tourist friendly intriguing style
"February 9, 2020",First Visit,Great place of historic value. Got tickets from Discount London online and saved over £30! Some fab things to see and the Crown jewels are not to be missed! Great way to spend a morning 
"February 9, 2020",One of the best in London. ,If you are in London for sightseeing or travel you should never miss this place. This place is so good to learn history. 
"February 5, 2020",Worth a visit!,"Something everyone should do on their first London visit.....arrive before the gates open, go straight to crown jewels then meander around everywhere else.  A lot of stairs to climb but there is so much history here - just do it!"
"February 2, 2020",Excellent experience ,"There is so much to see here that you could nearly spend a full day here The building itself is so impressive, the views spectacular The way the tour is organized is superb The variety to see, the various rooms & the interactive parts are excellent The Crown Jewels obviously a highlight My son wanted to see the ravens but sadly only one was aroundStaff excellent and very knowledgeable Highly recommend "
"February 1, 2020",The white castle,Great place to visit enjoyed the beefeater your very factual and interesting enjoyed the walk around afterwards found it factual interesting great staff
"January 29, 2020",Tower of London is a must!,"So I decided to spend a day by myself to explore this amazing historical place in London. And it turned out to be the highlight of my entire trip! What a place!I spent three hours there and it wasn’t enough; I hope that I can go again one day to learn what I have missed the first time.My advice to you :1- make sure you allocate enough time for this visit2- the entry fee is so worth it 3- you don’t need to buy in advance as there wasn’t a long queue 4- make sure you buy the audio guide, it’s really good 5- leave some time to read and try the interactive information games6- it’s better to go by yourself especially if you’re getting the audio guide because it takes you to another world 7- make sure you visit all the towers and better if you read about them beforehand Enjoy!! "
"January 29, 2020",History comes alive!,"The Tower is one of the oldest fortified sites in Britain, and certainly the most famous. It is easy to dismiss it as a trite tourist site, but that would be a critical mistake. Best to read something about the history of the Tower before going, and then both taking a tour if you have the time, or at least walking around with a guidebook. It's the details that make the Tower fascinating. The armorial museum, for example, is spectacular, but the details to notice include the dents in some of the armor from proofing: the were shot with firearms to make sure bullets would bounce off. The lists of imprisonments and executions are daunting but an authentic and unavoidable part of British history. The architecture of the Tower and its place in the development of 11th century fortifications also merits close attention.One could easily spend half a day or a full day here. The most rewarding visit, however, would combine the Tower with a ceremony or pageant celebrated there. Remembrance Day is a good example, but there are many others. The Tower also is sometimes the site of summer concerts, and that brings forth yet another aspect. A very special and memorable place."
"January 28, 2020",Always great.,Been to this fabulous place many times before. Every time its great value for money with so much to see and do. Hope to return soon.
"January 28, 2020",Monumental.,"No visit to London is complete without a visit to the Tower of London, with its rich history, the Crown Jewels and countless photo-ops of this magnificent fortress."
"January 27, 2020",Tower of London,Had a lovely afternoon there. So much to see. Definitely do the Beefeater Tour first which was very interesting and informative.
"November 9, 2019",Tower of London,"The best tour in London is the Yeoman's Tour at the Tower of London.  Actually it was the best tour in London, Paris and Amsterdam.  "
"November 6, 2019",Highlight of any visit to London.,Well worth every cent to visit this historic site. Spent hours here and found all of the exhibits well laid out. When early to avoid the long wait to view the Crown Jewels. 
"November 6, 2019",DO NOT MISS !!!,This is the History of London and England. If you love history and want to learn the origins of the city and country---from the beginning---it starts here. Magnificent preservation. 
"November 5, 2019",Historical Site,Had a great time walking around with my wife looking at all the different exhibitions. Laid out very user friendly and easy to navigate. A must visit while in London. 
"November 5, 2019","If you ever visit London, Tower of London is a MUST SEE!","give yourself plenty of time to visit this castle, its a must see castle with a lot of history and the Crown Jewels. need at least 5 hours for the visit."
"November 4, 2019",A “must” when in London ,"Take a tour with a “Beefeater” inside the Tower of London and learn a little about this famous place.Very interesting for both adults and teenagers!  I would recommend going there early, to avoid the longest queues. "
"November 4, 2019",Yeoman Warder Tour - A+,"Expensive, but worth the price. Arrive early (preferably at opening)...go directly to the Crown Jewels Room (to avoid hours-long waits later)...next go to the Yeoman Warder Tour (BEST part of the day!) where you will learn EVERYTHING you need to know about the rest of your visit. Lovely day, wonderful experience. We spent twice as long as we had planned, there was so much to see! **PS Find a 2-for-1 coupon at ""Days Out London""."
"November 4, 2019",Fabulous,"I arrived just after opening and there was hardly a queue. I didn't bother with the beefeater tour, audio or a guidebook as I like to fo my own thing. Pick up a free map as it suggests a basic route and you can then fit in the other bits yourself. There are plenty of information boards in multiple languages and even some Tudors still walking round! Give yourself 3 hours plus even at quiet times so you don't need to rush. The Crown Jewels are amazing, which I think is to be expected, but I found the armouries very interesting even though I didn't expect to. I was in awe to be able to walk in the footsteps of such as Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn."
"November 3, 2019",Pinnacle of London History!,The Tower of London and the history behind it paints a picture of the ruling class and the many uses of the Tower and surrounding infrastructure throughout the years. The tour with a resident Beefeater is a must! The Crown Jewels and museum of artifacts are a nice touch. 
"November 3, 2019",Must see ,Great place to visit with kids. Beautiful view of the city! If you live hights you must cross the glass floor. You even het a sticker of you do!
"December 1, 2019","Iconic London, good tour by Beefeater","We live in London but only do the tourist things when we have visitors.  It's years since we've been to the Tower.Got the tickets at the ticket booths (10am 25 November so not very busy).  Went straight to the Crown Jewels (almost empty) and had time to have a good look.  Then joined a Beefeater tour, he was seriously good.  Very informative with an excellent delivery.  We then went up the White Tower and down to the torture area - great fun!!!  Did a walk around and went into all the various parts.  Allow several hours for a visit."
"December 1, 2019",The beautiful Tower,"Went and spent a good few hours in the Tower, is beautiful and everyone should go and enjoy it. I love the history of it all so just amazing. A must go to place for anyone and everyone. "
"December 1, 2019",Must see for the historically interested,"Visited the Tower of London with family. The highlights were, except for seeing the Crown Jewels, definitely the super professional guide (Yeoman, Lorentz) who combined a thorough knowledge of British history with a large portion of British sense of humour. This is a must for anyone interested in history and royalty and especially likes to see a lot of historic armours and weapons. Do set off enough time for this though since there are many things to see within the Tower of London."
"November 28, 2019",Historical,My husband and I visited Tower of London and we did not dissappoint. We joined the beefeater tour and we had an amazing time. Our guide is funny and kbowledgeavle. The pace is filled with history. We saw the royal crown.
"November 28, 2019",A must-see in London!,"In a short walking distance from tube you will get an excellent all-day historical experience for a good value. If you don't like walking upstairs, you have still lots of options to choose from. The Crown Jewels exhibition is one of those stairs-free.After you finish the Tower, don't forget to take the Tower Bridge."
"November 27, 2019",Excellent tour,The beefeaters tour guide was informative and funny.  Was only disappointed when it ended. The Crown Jewels were magnificent!  The display in the White tower was also worth seeing.
"November 24, 2019",Awesome tour,We really enjoyed this visit.  Make sure to do one of the Yeoman tours to get the full experience.  Crown Jewel display is really impressive too.
"November 24, 2019",Brenda,Our second visit to this amazing historical Tower. The Yeoman were very informative and helpful especially when my mother (who's 87years young)was determined to walk up the steps of the White Tower. The first visit was to see the Poppies which was absolutely phenomenal. My mother has one of the Poppies pride of place encased on her sitting room wall!
"November 23, 2019",Exceptional.  Please don't miss!,"Our Yeoman guide, William, was the absolute best part of our trip to London.  Tour was outstanding and the grounds themselves really awesome.  We're not big ""tourist attraction"" or ""museum"" people, but this was a really great activity for 3 hours or so.  Also has a cafe with pretty good food. "
"November 23, 2019",Loaded with history ,"We went to Tower of London just this past Monday and it’s a must see if you are visiting London. Loaded with history and information that will occupy your mind. I have heard you need 2-3 hours here and that’s a fair assessment. We spent over 2 hours wandering around on our own, not following the guided tour. Definitely do not miss it! "
"November 23, 2019",Fantastic History and Enjoyable,"Thankfully it didn’t rain on us on this trip. Our kids enjoyed wandering through all the exhibits as they were definitely kid friendly, especially the museum portion dedicated to the history of weapons used back in the last couple hundred years.  I personally enjoyed seeing the Crown Jewels, and reveling in their beauty and splendor.  It was a fantastic morning!"
"November 23, 2019",Let the Yeomen guide you!,"A cold November day we took the guided tour with Clive.The hour just slipped by while our Yeoman Guide shared with us history and anecdotes of the tower. The rest was excellent , worth a trip just to see the jewels."
"November 22, 2019",Historic Site,"Do take the Beefeater tour which is free along with the ticket. Lots of history associated with this site. Off course the Crown Jewels are here, and are a must see. Allot at least 2 hours to cover most of it. Highly recommended. "
"November 21, 2019","History, glamour and lots of stories",This iconic historical attraction is great. We visited in November and taking advantage of 2 for 1 ( with train tickets) it became a reasonable priced excursion. Queues were non- existent and we were able to view the fabulous Crown Jewels leisurely.
"November 20, 2019",Incredible ,"This is a must see attraction while in London , with a bushel of history. Very old and interesting. Many photo ops and close to the tower bridge and many other attractions. "
"November 18, 2019",Beefeaters are a Blast!,All the gory details and humor to boot! When visiting the tower make sure you go on the guided Beefeater tour. They have a great sense of humor and engage the crowd in their tales. 
"November 18, 2019",Tower of London - Worthwhile Visit!,Visiting the Tower of London - go early!  Book the tickets on line and visit the Crown Jewels first!   It was a fabulous day with so much to see at the Tower of London.  The Beefeaters are lovely and very informative of the special history this place brings.  We caught the tube to Tower Hill Underground Station and it's right there!  Brilliant!  Also walking distance to the very pretty Tower Bridge - a must as well!
"November 13, 2019",Tower of london.,Fabulous was a really good daySo much to see and do Jewels beautiful Can highly recommend a day out here
"November 10, 2019",Nice and educational,"Took my mum here and we had a nice time. The beefeaters were nice and engaging.The tower has a vast history, some of which is quite chilling.Nonetheless we enjoyed our time here"
"November 9, 2019",I could stare at the crown jewels for hours!,"Interesting tour where you can learn a lot of history about England and her people, along with the Monarchy.  We especially enjoyed the room with the crown jewels - such pagentry.  I need to buy myself a crown!  You have access to many buildings and there are people (Beefeaters) who enjoy telling you the history and significance of everything."
"October 29, 2019",Amazing history,Been here once before for the keys ceremony. But never to see the white tower or the Crown Jewels. It was amazing. Yes it was a little busy and yes we had to queue for 20 mins for the Crown Jewels. But it was well worth it. There is so much history. We purchased tickets online directly and received them on my phone so no entry queues for us. We walked straight in. We were probably there for over 5 hours and we could have been there longer but we were all so tired. Will definitely go back again one day!  Son is 7 and throughly enjoyed it.
"October 29, 2019",Awesome,Beautiful site...Crown Jewels was amazing to see!! Be sure to bring umbrella!! :) The line is long but moves quick
"October 29, 2019",Must see in London,"Of all the things I saw in London, this is a must see.  We spent about 4 hours at this place and it was well worth for kids and adults.  I purchased a London pass and did not have to wait for tickets.  I got there first thing in the morning as this does get crowded"
"October 29, 2019",Loved it,"We toured the tower and loved it. Get there when it opens and see the Crown Jewels first to avoid long lines. You can rent an audio tour for 5# that is nice. Or take a guided tour. Be aware there are lots of steps and hills so wear comfortable shoes. The history is amazing and be sure to go into the church. Almost 1000 years old and still uses for services,  plan on 3-4 hours unless there are lines."
"October 29, 2019",Crown jewels were beautiful,Everyone needs to see the crown jewels on their trip to London.  There is a lot to experience here if you like medieval history.  This place has existed for a thousand years. you can feel the history as you walk around and in the buildings.
"October 27, 2019",An Outstanding Experience,"The Tower of London is a genuine five star site, especially if you are the slightest bit interested in history. We arrived at opening time where we picked up our on-line tickets. Although getting in was a bit slow, the Tower precinct is big enough for the crowds to be spread out.There is much to see as sections of the Tower were constructed at different times. The Medieval Palace, the White Tower and the battlements and even the ravens are all fascinating while the Crown Jewels display is not only interesting, the flow of people is well managed. The family consensus was that the display about the death of the Princes during the Wars of the Roses was the highlight of that part of the history which dealt with imprisonment, torture and executions.The Tower is not to be missed."
"October 27, 2019","Crown Jewels are here, lots of history","It takes about 3 hours to see what you want but this was great to see the history of London here. Included are the Crown Jewels, which are sometimes removed because current royalty borrow them for events. There are tours of armor, the ravens, and so much more. Very close to the Tower Bridge and Thames River cruises. "
"October 26, 2019",Why was this never on my to-do list for London??,"As a history buff, I’m really wondering why I never visited the Tower of London during my previous work trips!! This is a very popular attraction, particularly for schoolgroups. We went straight through with the London Pass and joined the first Beefeater tour of the day, which really helped to set the scene for the rest of the visit. The tours were really popular with large groups but the yeomen made sure that they could be heard and were very funny and entertaining. The ravens were big birds! We did not have to wait to see the crown jewels as we were there fairly early, and they were definitely worth the time.Most parts of the entire well-preserved complex were used for different exhibits, which made for a good half day of exploration. Routes were well sign-posted to ensure one-way traffic only and prevent congestion in narrow spaces. Not a place for those with mobility issues. An easy walk to Tower Bridge from the exit along the river. "
"October 24, 2019",MUST Visit while in London,"I was hesitant to visit the Tower of London because of the crowds and price but - it lives up to the hype guys. So cool. So much amazing history here! I could easily have spent 3-4 hours at the Tower of London if we hadn’t gone so close to closing. Yeoman Warder tours are offered hourly and included in admission price. Make sure you join a tour!  I’m usually not a fan of organized tours, but Yeoman Warder Scott Kelley was seriously the highlight of our visit. He told us some amazing stories/history and was hilarious. He had the whole crowd laughing and entertained the entire time. Tip: buy your tickets online rather than at the ticket office to save a few pounds 😉"
"October 24, 2019",Hungary,Do not miss it.Wery intresting and nice exhibition and building. Buy your ticket in advance not to wait too much.
"November 2, 2019",Great morning out!,It was my mom's first trip to London. This was her favorite stop. The free tour is short but packed with info. Then you are free to roam and explore. Would definitely recommend. 
"November 2, 2019",Crown Jewels fantastic,"We thoroughly enjoyed the Tower of London. Even with Heavy crowds things moved smoothly. Plenty of food choices, interesting areas to visit, easy to know what your were looking at or walking. Just an enjoyable historical place to visit."
"November 2, 2019",Arrive early!,We took the advice on another review and arrived early to ensure we would see the crown jewels.  And we did!  Without a line to wait in.  Great historical learning experience.  Would recommend a visit!
"November 2, 2019",Very busy,Used our historic palaces pass and walked straight through. The audio guide helped us to move around and gave us a great insight into the tower. It had interesting facts and stories for different areas. The queue for the crown jewels was very long so we skipped it this time and there were areas where you couldn't get through due to crowds. 
"October 31, 2019",Excellent place for some history,I am a huge history nut so this was a must see on my London Bucket list. I'm going back to London and plan on going to the Tower again.
"October 31, 2019",Worth every penny,"Visited the Tower of London and was surprised at how many different uses it had through history. The Yeomen Warders ran a free walking tour from the entrance which was worth it. Our tour guide was hilarious and great with kids. It’s clear they take their job seriously and pride themselves on the service they provide. We heard several stories and were able to navigate the main areas. Afterwards, we wandered the grounds, saw the Crown Jewels, areas where zoo animals were held, the ravens and several exhibitions. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Great views of Tower Bridge also. A must visit when in London. "
"October 31, 2019",Amazing,Amazing Place. Great guides. Expensive coffe. I would go there again. There is much to see. And it is a great part of our European history. 
"October 31, 2019",Yeoman Warden Matt was great!,We really enjoyed the Warden tour!  Matt was very knowledgeable and very funny. He made the tour entertaining and explained about the Tower and the parts to see.  I would recommend doing the tour with the Warden first.
"October 30, 2019",Met a terrible D C Phillips who was beyond terrible.,"I visited the Tower of London on Wednesday 30th October 2019. Basically the attraction is to see the Crown Jewels. I saw a beefeater D C Phillips and a boy was taking a photo of his parents with beefeater Phillips.  I went up and tap the boy on his shoulder to get his attention, and asked him if he can take a photo for me with beefeater Phillips?  I was condescendingly reprimanded by beefeater Phillips and I was close to tears as I have never in my entire life been treated this terribly before. I have traveled and toured 5 continents, and lived my whole life in 2 continents, and I lived in Leeds, England, as a tertiary student for 4 years.  In my many years of touring various countries in various continents, this is the most unexpected shocking incident that I’ve encountered. It is with great sadness in my heart that I relate this terrible encounter with D C Phillips at the Tower of London."
"October 30, 2019",The Tower,"This place is really a fortress, so much history. Take a tour and listen to the tour guide, Beefeater.  So much history it was more than I could have imagined.  Time well spent. I recommend this on yourLondon experience."
"October 18, 2019",Rich History,It is worth the visit if you are into the history. This tower has a rich (also sad) history behind it. Long time ago people tried to escape it and today many people want to go inside it.They still have some old traditions and I really respect that.
"October 18, 2019",Tour of London,Make sure you start the tour with one of the Beefeaters. They added so much to the tour - history and humor.
"October 18, 2019",Yeomen not impressive at all,"The Yeoman didn't impress - they pride themselves on being rude (as if it's supposed to be part of the ""act"") and we were herded in a group for a tour with commentary.  Asked very nicely for a photo with the Yeoman, he rudely acquiesced, sure they know they're going to get asked for photos a lot as part of the job? We couldn't hear the Yeoman when he started his spiel on the tour, an audience member respectfully requested him to speak up for us at the back, but this was ignored. So we got bored not hearing anything and went on our own to explore.  Look seeing the crown jewels was nice I guess, and exploring the buildings were really just okay, though the building with the armour and horse armour was quite impressive.  Seriously I think you get enough of an impression of what the Tower of London represents by viewing it from outside, and finding out information from the web.  My recommendation - save your money, truly."
"October 16, 2019",Lots of history ,Great experience visiting the Tower of London. Lots of history and interesting facts. Great for anyone. 
"October 15, 2019",Lots of history ,"Took our barely out of teens son there and even he loves it.  There was a group of teens harassing one of the guards at attention wearing the bear skin hats.  The ‘beefeater?’  Put that you bed right quick!Crown Jewels line was long, but worth it."
"October 15, 2019",History revisited,"Another of the attractions in London but all one sees is the castle,which is been maintained so very well and the Crown jewels( with Kohinoor) being the tip attraction....at at entry fee of 30.30 pound"
"October 15, 2019",Brilliant,"What a brilliant way to spend a day. We spent 6 hours here in the rain, it was great despite the weather. We managed to see the Crown Jewels, which were beautiful and very well presented. We also visited many different towers. We had a guided tour with Beefeater Lee Scott or Scott Lee ( I cant remember which way round it was -lol) he was hilarious! He was very informative giving us a good overview of the history around the chapel but also about his role. He was brilliant, he had a great personality and made the tour not only interesting but also really funny.They have a brilliant cafe which is very well priced-they also sell alcohol. We needed it to forget about the rain. Such an amazing day, we spent £55 on two adult tickets which I think I great value.Highly recommend! "
"October 14, 2019",Yeomen Tour,"The Yeomen presented facts in a light hearted entertaining manner. If one uses a cane, don't need to stand in the long line to view the crown jewels. We were unaware of that kind jester until we reached the doors and were ushered in."
"October 14, 2019",Royalty At It's Best,Every attraction was simply amazing. Our favorite here was the Crown Jewels! It was unbelievable to see the crowns and other jewels worn and used by the Kings and Queens of England. All of the history of the entire Tower was amazing! The White Tower building had all of the armour used by the Kings and their military. It was also great to see the British military guards that stood outside the Crown Jewels building. We also saw the prison where prisoners were kept as well as the torture chamber. The cost was only $27.00 per person however they will attempt to charge you $30 which includes a $3 donation to the Tower.
"October 13, 2019",Fantastic day out - allow at least 4 hours.,As soon as you enter into the entrance gate join the Beefeater guided tour - so informative and they walk you through the main buildings and walkways leaving you near the entrance to the Crown Jewels.  The guided tours are every half hour and included in the price of your ticket and last just under an hour.  Our hour flew by very quickly with Barney as our guide.  He was helpful; informative and very funny - telling all jokes as if he was telling them for the first time.  At the end of the tour we were free to walk throughout all of the buildings and quickly joined the queue for the Crown Jewels (which had more than doubled when we left).  So much history and so many interested things to see with plenty of interactive displays for the children.  An absolute must for anyone visiting London!
"October 24, 2019",Tower of London-the jewel in England's crown,"The Tower of London is a must-see for every traveler to London. It was here that William the Conqueror built his fortress/tower to stake claim to London. The history of the fortress, wall and Tower are all explained in detail by the delightful Yeoman - or 'Beefeaters' as they are called. These ‘Beefeaters’ live in the Tower. It was interesting to learn about the ravens that were all around the grounds. According to legend, at least 6 birds must stay within the fortress grounds or, legend has it, the monarchy will fall. Needless the say, the ravens are fed well and taken care of! We were fortunate to have a clear, sunny day so it really made the Tower experience a memorable one!"
"October 23, 2019",C'Mon...It's the Tower of London!!!,"Get there before 10 AM.  Wear comfortable walking shoes-the cobblestones are killers. If you want to view the Crown Jewels (and-why wouldn't you?!) get there at opening time and make a beeline for the exhibit...or be prepared to stand in a snaking line for over an hour.  Stop and listen to the Beefeaters giving their talk...educational and entertaining.  Be prepared for LOTS of steps, very windy and narrow staircases...and an amazing peek into the history of London."
"October 23, 2019",Historical,Very nteresting place to visit for a history lesson and to take a look around the area and walk around
"October 23, 2019",Must see tour,"If you only go on one tour while in London make it the Tower of London and give yourself plenty of time. There is a lot more to see here than I thought. Very informative guide by the Tower Guards and have to be impressed by crown jewellery. Don’t worry about crowds, things move along. Avoid school holidays."
"October 22, 2019",GIve your self time to see this,"We went to see this just after lunch, the lineups to the Crown jewels is very long, so my suggestion is to line up first,  if that is something you really want to see.  The lines do move fairly quickly, but it is still a long wait, but very worth it to see.   We also used their prerecorded tour, which gave a very good tour.  "
"October 22, 2019",Great place to visit,At first we were welcomed by the excelent guide of the place to the free tour. The guide was amusing and with a lot of knolledge. It was realy fun!the castle is big. Consider at least 2.5 hours for the visit. The london bridge is a nice photo from there.
"October 21, 2019",Living History,Fascinating place. i could easily spend all day there. Unfortunately time was limited as there were other places we wanted to see in the short time we were in London. The Crown Jewels are a must & are truly an incredible sight. Give yourself most of a day to truly experience the History of the Tower.
"October 20, 2019",London tower History lesson ,"Thank you yeoman Scott Kelly for a fantastic, informative and entertaining tour of the Tower of London. This was my second time at the Tower and so glad I went back. If you get a chance make sure you do the free tour given by the beefeaters. You learn so much not just the history of the tower but also the beefeaters. The tour is only for 1 hour. "
"October 19, 2019",Wonderful day at the tower,The best place to get the feel of England in one trip! The tour guides are just wonderful. They truly enjoy what they do and it shows. Berry was so informative and knowledgeable about the tower! He made the trip so much better by giving his time to us. One of the better place to see in all of London.
"October 13, 2019",Exceeded expectations,"I've visited London many times and even lived in London, however only visited Tower of London for the first time recently. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, we did a tour with one of the Yeomans which was very informative. So much incredible history in the place.We didn't see the Crown Jewels as there was a very long queue and the teens weren't keen to line up. "
"October 13, 2019",Amazing tour,This was one of my favorite tours by far! The tour guide who is an actual beefeater was funny and extremely knowledgeable. It was interesting to hear all the history. After the tour we had time to walk around on our own.
"October 13, 2019",Underwhelming,"We bought the tickets in advance. It helped a bit with lines. The tower is impressive from outside of it. Good place to take many pictures. Inside of it was blah! The Crown Jewels and the grounds are ok!! If someone has a short stay in London I recommend not to go inside and waste your time. Nonetheless, it is a must see from outside. We took the boat back to west minister, short ride and beats being stuck in the crowded subway and  the traffic. The boat ride ticket was included in our hop on and off tour."
"October 12, 2019",History at its most fun!,"This was my second visit to the Tower of London, but the first with my family. The Yeoman Warder guided tour was funny, informative and entertaining. The mixture of architecture, historical importance, weapons and armor was enough to appeal to everyone. My visits were almost 20 years apart but this attraction has not lost its spark and i would recommend visiting to anyone and everyone who is exploring London."
"October 12, 2019",History and humour from the beefeaters,A very iconic part of London history. The beefeater tours run for a perfect 45 minutes and are worth the entry fee themselves. Don’t go on a rain day if possible as the tour will get cut short and not many sheltered areas.
"October 12, 2019",Great interesting visit!,"If you like history, this is a must.  Fascinating history and lots to see.  Leave at least 3 hours in order to see it all.  I also reccommend getting the audio tour-- it costs extra but it was worth it for the information.   You could also read your way through the exhibits if you'd rather but the audio tour still provides a bit extra.  Plus there is a bit on the audio tour that you can listen to while waiting in line to see the crown jewels."
"October 11, 2019",Tower of London,"Good to finally visit the Tower of London. It was very interesting to explore the Tower, see the Crown Jewels and learn about some of the history of the site."
"October 11, 2019",Wow ,"A must if you are in London!  The buildings, jewels, beef eaters and all are worth a few of climbing stairs (204) in tower. "
"October 19, 2019",Mind blowing walk through history!,"The amount of historical events that took place in just this one place is incredible! To fully appreciate it take the live narrated tour. Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, some of the oldest buildings in London, and the Crown Jewels. WOW! The narrated walking tours are included in your admission, but only go at certain times. When we went, the last one was at 3:30. Earlier is better so you can take time to read all the information plaques and appreciate where you are. Easy to get to from the Tower Hill tube station. Look for the ticket booths across the plaza from the castle, then you walk down to the entrance. Take the tour!"
"October 11, 2019",Terrific tour,"I cannot imagine a better tour than the (free) one my (adult) daughter and I took in late July with Yeoman Warder Lawrence Watts as our guide at the Tower of London.  He imparted the information with humility, extensive knowledge, the most wonderful humor, and extreme patience.  At one point a child was sitting on the ground in front of him, piling leaves and little rocks on his shoes as he spoke.  He did not miss a beat. It is, by the way, a great honor to be a ""Beefeater"" or Yeoman Warder of Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London.  Warders are retired from the Armed Forces of the Commonwealth with at least 22 years of service and hold the Long Service and Good Conduct medal. Allow plenty of time for the tour, looking around, and seeing the Crown Jewels (there will probably be a long line)."
"October 10, 2019",So much history,"I always thought of the Tower of London as the place where the Crown Jewels were kept and didn’t know much else. However, the Beefeaters there do a phenomenal job of guiding you through the grounds and teaching you about the history surrounding it. Definitely get there early, like before it opens early, to get your tickets b/c there is definitely going to be a line. We go there one hour early and were the first in line. Once they opened, we had our tickets and were inside in less than 10 minutes. Totally worth it to get there early in the day, especially because it enabled us to see the Crown Jewels without being crowded by a mass of people. If you’re visiting on a Sunday, just know you can’t visit the chapel b/c its closed on Sundays. The Tower should absolutely be on your must see list and plan to be here for about 3-4 hours if you really want to see everything. "
"October 10, 2019",The Crown Jewels,"What a beautiful collection of family heirlooms Wow, I have never seen so much BLING in my life. Downside NO PICTURES allowed."
"October 10, 2019",Beefeater tour is a must,"My folks and I went on the 10am beefeater tour on Oct 10. Our tour guide, Andrew (Shady) was amazing. He directed a very large group with ease, not one person complained. He was extremely informative, very funny and was really good at engaging the group. Would I go again? Absolutely. "
"October 10, 2019",Tower of London,"OMG I had no idea the Tower of Lindon could be such an interesting excursion. I loved it!  Our tour guide had so much passion, knowledge and pride of the history behind the tower that it was awesome to hear it. The Crown Jewels exhibit was the icing on the cake. A must see while in London!"
"October 10, 2019",On the All Time Favorite’s list now,"So, let me start by saying I’m not prone to enjoying “tours” or guides, that said, it seems like my wife plans one for just about every place we visit and I really enjoy her so...I end up on a lot of tours. The tour here was conducted by a Beefeater named Shady (sic) and it was an absolute delight! He was informative, witty, and very knowledgeable and entertaining about the Tower. Bonus, the tour was included with the admission ticket so it’s a complete no brainier. A great way to spend 45 minutes to an hour."
"October 10, 2019",Great,What a great visit! Weather was perfect adding to the enjoyment - get your tickets in advance and arrive early - well worth the cost of admission.
"October 10, 2019",Informative half day a tivity,"It’s a busy attraction with a lot of school groups during week days. We joined the free guided tour, which proved to be very informative and our guide Shadee (sp?) was lively and entertaining. The Crown Jewels on display were amazing to see up close. "
"October 10, 2019",Tower of London a must see!,"I have been visiting the Tower since I was a child in the 50s.  It is a definite must. And it is a good idea spend the day there.  So much to see and do including a walking tour with one of the Yeomen Gards (Beef Eaters).  Your tour gard will tell you the history, the legends, and point out all the places where famous people from the past have been incarcerated.Also at the Tower are the Crown Jewels and religious relics used during coronations. There is so much to see and do and there are cafes serving full lunches and sanwiches or you can bring your own picnic."
"October 10, 2019",Worth the reasonable price of admission,"When you consider the MANY areas of significance of this London landmark, and you consider the value of the expert and humorous narration provided by the Beefeaters (yeoman warders), this is a tourist must-visit site.  Plan for a minimum of 90 minutes, longer if you want to visit every corner and nook of the site.  "
"October 9, 2019",Do the free tour!,"My husband and I kept debating about going here. We spent the money and did it, and it ended up being one of our favorite things we did!  Once you enter, you’ll see there is a spot to wait for one of the beefeaters to give you a tour. They go off every 30 minutes if I remember correctly. Well, it’s so worth it!  Our guide was awesome!  He was loud, real, and know so much history. It was a entertaining way to get into the history that is behind the Tower of London. Grab a free map and make sure you check out all the different things to see, some of them are easy to miss. Do the Crown Jewels first as there is always a little line. "
"October 9, 2019",Fantastic Experience,We were very impressed with the Tower of London. The tour guide was knowledgeable and entertaining. The Crown Jewels were well worth the short (1/2 hour) wait!
"October 9, 2019",So much history,"It's simply a must if you never been there. There's history everywhere, with lots of interesting things to see. Use comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk a lot."
"October 9, 2019",Great part of History,Went as part of a tour. Lots of people and very informative. Security went very smooth and I would highly recommend to everyone.
"October 9, 2019",What a fabulous place to spend a day!!,"We visited at the end of March 2019, never been before, wished we had!  And yes, so much bigger than we thought, so much to see - wonderful!!  As with other attractions, we used the 2for1 train offer and it saves such a lot of money meaning we enjoy it even more!!  A friends advice was to arrive as they opened, bought tickets with no problems at the ticket office and to go immediately to the Crown Jewels as a queue builds up through the day.  We walked in at 11am and just a handful of people looking at the jewels, by 1230 there was a long long snaking line of people all around the building going around the corner!!On this occasion we decided not to do the guided tour but the buy the lovely guidebook and make our own way around in our own time, we did pick up snippets of the guides telling groups all about the history, and no doubt next time we go we may do a tour.  Everything was totally fascinating, the displays, the towers, walks along the battlements, seeing the ravens, reading the information and not realising how much history it contained - yes, we British do that well - hanging on to our history and informing everyone and making it so interesting to all - whether you are 70 or 7 you will love it.  And don't forget the views - you can see across the Thames and all the iconic landmarks, Tower Bridge, The Shard etc etc - gorgeous!! The uniforms, the pomp and ceremony, the colour - shame we missed the filming of 'Inside the Tower of London' which must have happened there just after we visited - watch it on TV or iPlayer, its wonderful!!We spent the day there before our theatre trip in the evening, well worth the whole day, but do take a picnic and drinks as with all attractions it can be pricey to eat there.  But saying that, just before we left we went into the cafe which I think was inside the Artillery Museum and had an extremely refreshing mug of tea for a £2 a mug - now that really IS good value!!"
"October 9, 2019",A must place to visit in London,This attraction is included with the London Pass. So its a direct entry to the gate. You don't need to visit the ticket counter. Please note that those with baby cart it can be quite difficult to carry the cart as climbing lots of stairs are involved in the visit. You can park your baby card just after the Traitors Gate by putting a 1 pound coin. The nearest metro station is Tower Hill and from there its only walkable distance. There is a tour with Yeoman Warders every 30 minutes. Sometimes it can be quite crowded but is also a good option to take the audio tour which is almost equivalent to what they say. You can have your own tour at your own pace. Expect about 2 - 3 hours of visit time.
"October 9, 2019",A Must See,"This is a must-see on your visit to London.  I recommend buying your tickets online in advance to avoid lines.  We got there soon after it opened and went straight to the crown jewels before it got too crowded.  After that, we walked back to the entrance area to take the free yeoman warder's tour.  Not only do you get a great history lesson but it was very entertaining.  Shout out to our hilarious guide Jason Woodcock.  You can spend anywhere from a couple of hours here to all day.  It just depends on how much you want to see and read."
"October 8, 2019",Expensive outing,"This was on our must-see list while in London but it wasn't as much of a hit with the group as we expected. The extra 'donation' cost caught us at the ticket booth - that seems to be common at a number of London attractions to automatically include it unless you ask to remove it (which then seems mean spirited).We visited midweek, off-peak season and it was still really busy. Loads of school groups too.A few of of the exhibits are fresh and attractive but others are tired. I visited a number of years ago and found the crown jewels a lot more attractive in how they were presented then.The higlight was the manager in the gift shop, she was chatty and knew lots - particularly about the ravens, more than was shared at the actual raven talk by one of the Yeoman Warders (who by his admission wasn't the Raven Master)."
"October 8, 2019",A London Must See,"We arrived in time to take an yeoman warder tour (free).  This tour lasts about 45 minutes and includes many stories and anecdotes.  Get the audio guide to complete the visit.  If the day is busy, go to the Crown Jewels first.  Be sure to visit the Bloody Tower.  Learn about the Ravens. We spent 4+ hours there, and there was still more that we could have done."
"October 7, 2019",Good history! ,Just visited the Tower of London and had a good time. The history was explained and lots of things to see. The royal jewels were great to see!
"October 7, 2019",Beefeater tour was great!,Had a great visit!  You must do a beefeater tour!!!  Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly was our guide and was fabulous. My 13 year old loved his stories and was amongst the first to follow him around the tower to hear his stories and history. It was great to be able to put some of the stories we heard on our tour with some of the other places we visited.
"October 7, 2019","Fascinating history, count on spending a few hours ","Spent a sunny afternoon at the tower enjoying learning about it’s long (and often bloody) past. I had the audio tour and that was helpful. I plan to go back sometime because even with a decent amount of time, I only saw about half of the complex. Would recommend going early as there was a long line for the crown jewels. "
"September 22, 2019",Amazing,You need to spend at least 3 hours to take all in. It’s huge and gives you an insight on how life was  in 1200. The armoury is mind blowing as is the Crown Jewels. The beef eaters walk around to add to the atmosphere.
"September 21, 2019",A must-see,"Thoroughly enjoyed touring the Tower of London.  We chose to tour on our own, but guided tours are also available.  Lots of history to see with the secession of Kings and queens.  The Crown Jewels were a highlight and a must-see!  The Tower should be on everyone’s list- and don’t miss the resident Ravens.  We used it as part of our London Pass- a great value also."
"September 21, 2019",Amazing,It’s history at its finest. So much to see and do. Loved the Ravens and their story. The Crown Jewels are not to be believed. Hard to believe such things exist. That the jewels are real. Loved everything about this historic landmark. 
"September 20, 2019",Like history?  Go here!,"An amazing place to visit!  If you like to see old architecture, you will love seeing the buildings and the walls. In one building, you see the Crown Jewels and the information about each is placed next to them.  Very beautiful jewels!  In the White Wall Tower, you see the armor and shields of all the kings.  Also, you will see where Ann Boleyn was beheaded.  If you visit London, you must go here!"
"September 19, 2019",Tower of London 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿,Great tour. Could have spent all day here no problem. Crown Jewels a highlight. Well worth the money
"September 19, 2019",Take the tour! ,"The Warder who led our tour was fabulous. Highlights are the stories behind each of the buildings and the execution history, as well as the royalty who resides here. One note: the glass coffee table that is supposed to be contemporary art in the place of the courtyard near the white tower - that thing has GOT TO GO! "
"September 19, 2019",Clive was outstanding,"We loved our time at the Tower, but the highlight was our beefeater tour with Clive. He was informative and entertaining and shared lots of the gruesome details about the towers past. If you go to the tower make sure to book a beefeater tour. If you’re lucky you may get Clive. "
"September 18, 2019",Guided tour of Tower of London,The Tower of London is very popular with lots of visitors.  Going with a guide makes it much easier to see everything and get a detailed interesting background history.  Plan to set aside 4 to 5 hours to take it all in.
"September 18, 2019",Yeoman Warder Tours for the win!,Definitely sign up for a Yeoman Warder tour. The stories vary from guide to guide and it's always excellent to swing by and say hi to the ravens!
"September 18, 2019",A must see in London,"There's a lot to see, so schedule a lot of time.  There is a lot of walking and many, many steps.  It was fascinating to see such history, from remnants of the Roman occupation, to the torture chambers, to King Henry VIII's armor.  We loved it and want to return to see more.  The crown jewels are a must see."
"September 28, 2019",Fascinating history of London.,We spent an afternoon exploring the Tower and even three hours wasn’t enough to experience all it has to offer. Allow plenty of time and ensure you get the audio guide to make the most of your visit. Crowds aplenty but still an enjoyable experience. 
"September 27, 2019",A must if you are visiting London,We visited as a couple.  Eventhough we live in London and drive past often we decided to visit this time.  An amazing place to visit with a lot of history and of course the crown jewels are amazing.  I would allow atleast 3 hours to see everything properly.
"September 27, 2019",A Must See for First Time Tourists to London,"Of course you must go to the Tower of London. It’s a better experience if you arrive early, it’s much less crowded. We were in when the opened. We used our London Pass. It’s the only way to see the London attractions, down load them to your iPhone wallet.It’s a bummer that they don’t allow photos of the Crown Jewels, but we understand there are reasons. It doesn’t take long to visit TOL depending on how much you are into museums, etc. We got through and took a taxi in time to see changing of the guard at Buckingham. If you want to do the boat ride back to Westminster, you won’t make it to the Buckingham in time,"
"September 26, 2019",Awesome,Arrived at 1.30pm and spent the whole afternoon there.  Quite a few large groups on tours however did not feel cramped.  Very educational as well as sending you back in time to get a taste of how life was back in those days.  Absolute value for money.Not to be missed.
"September 25, 2019",Probably the best visitor attraction in London,"Definitely one of the best of the London sites to visit. Really enjoyed our visit, there's more to see than I expected. There is sometimes long queues to see the crown jewels although the line moves surprisingly quickly. As well as souvenir shops there is a couple if places to eat and drink, the food is expensive though."
"September 25, 2019",Enthralling,"This is one captivating place to tour. Go early as it gets crowded. Chock full of history, gorgeous crown jewels, thought provoking exhibits of armor, weaponry, tools, uniforms, so much fascinating information. Lots of walking & steps… Plan on 3+ hours"
"September 24, 2019",A Complete Bust,"I could never locate the place to exchange the printed receipt for the actual tickets.  So, this activity never happened for us.  We lost our money. Very disappointing. "
"September 24, 2019",Creepy as it was meant to be,We went in the Rain so it was extra creepy ( in a good way ) There are a lot of stairs to climb if you want to see it all so if you are handicapped it might not be for you unless you can walk and climb stairs . If you are just slightly handicapped go to the information center and get a front of the line pass as that helps a lot for the long lines. I learned a lot of history about London and captives of the Tower especially Sir Walter Raleigh . Do not go on a day that rain is sure thing
"September 22, 2019",Awesome tales of the Tower,Guides were very knowledgeable and funny. Must see this historic place on your visit to London. Not to be missed! 
"September 22, 2019",A Must if You like History,"We had a great afternoon! There are free guided tours every half hour and our guide was informative and funny. The guides are the ""Beefeaters"" dressed in their garb. The tour gives some history and gets you started and then you can wander wherever you want. The Crown Jewels are amazing. Plan on spending at least 3 hours and they close at 5:30pm."
"September 18, 2019",Interesting and fun. ,"We really enjoyed this visit and spent more time (almost 4 hours) than we expected. The Beefeater tour is a must. Informative and very entertaining. Get to the crown jewels exhibit early, or the line gets long. I thought it was very well presented. We explored all of the areas, including taking a break for an ice cream. Lotsmofmnistory, lots to explore!"
"September 18, 2019",A must visit when in London,This was one of the highlights of our visit to London.  Such an amazing castle and the armour and Crown Jewels were awesome to see.  You really must visit this when in London!
"September 17, 2019",The Tower of London is a must see!,"There is so much history here, that it is amazing. You can do it in about 3-4 hours depending on how much you do and how much time you spend at each. When we were there the line for the Crown jewels was extremely long! We really enjoyed our time there!"
"September 17, 2019",Great Time and Tour,"We did a 2-hour tour with Sara of Context tours.  It was a beautiful day and she did an excellent job.  We started early in the morning and did not even have a long wait to see the Crown Jewels.  There was a lot to take in, but it all was fascinating."
"September 17, 2019",Not handicapped accessible,This  was an interesting tour and very informative. However I have a bad knee and no elevators were available. So I missed out on some of the towers because I couldn't walk the steps.
"September 17, 2019",Take the guided tour,This was one of our favorite attractions while in London.  Clive was our beefeater guide.  He was hilarious.  Plan on spending at least 3 hours while there. 
"September 16, 2019",Don't miss this.,"If you have to choose attractions, choose this one.  Not only will you see the crown jewels (not personal jewels) put you will learn a lot of history. Buy tickets from the Hop On/Off buses for a discount. "
"September 16, 2019",The Crown Jewels are impressive,Definitely worth the price of admission Seeing the crown jewels was definitely the highlight for me Also the Beefeater who does the explanation of what went on there did an excellent job - make sure you wait for the tour - it is no extra cost 
"September 16, 2019",Great place,"Great place to visit, our warden on the walk Kevin, was informative and entertaining.  Amenities were clean and accessible.  "
"September 16, 2019",A London Must See,"We arrived in time to take an yeoman warder tour (free).  This tour lasts about 45 minutes and includes many stories and anecdotes.  Get the audio guide to complete the visit.  If the day is busy, go to the Crown Jewels first.  Be sure to visit the Bloody Tower.  Learn about the Ravens. We spent 4+ hours there, and there was still more that we could have done."
"October 7, 2019",Good history! ,Just visited the Tower of London and had a good time. The history was explained and lots of things to see. The royal jewels were great to see!
"October 7, 2019",Beefeater tour was great!,Had a great visit!  You must do a beefeater tour!!!  Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly was our guide and was fabulous. My 13 year old loved his stories and was amongst the first to follow him around the tower to hear his stories and history. It was great to be able to put some of the stories we heard on our tour with some of the other places we visited.
"October 7, 2019",A must,"Didn’t have a lot of time here, wish we would have had more time to explore. We were later in the day arriving and they close up promptly at 5pm. Go early. The Crown Jewels are amazing and there is just so much history here."
"October 7, 2019",Awesome History!,"We were pleasantly surprised that we did not have to wait in a line to get in.  We were able to join a Beefeater tour immediately. Although the history at the tower is quite gruesome, Spike made our tour fun.  The crown jewels were quite impressive but the collection seemed quite small."
"October 7, 2019",Gruesome London Tower,"If you have any anticipated ideas on the Tower of London, you can be positively surprised when you actually visit it. The beefeaters are able to recreate a historical atmosphere that cannot be beaten. Besides, the traditions and real events seem just as real as a current affair.The crown jewels are of indelible value. Unforgettable experience indeed."
"October 6, 2019",Interesting site tour,I've been to the Tower of London a couple of times and have always found it interesting. Amazing history for you to see and experience. i suggest a tour guide who talks about all the nuances of the Tower and its history.
"October 6, 2019","A ""Towering"" Experience","We gave it about 3 1/2 hours which allows for a good over-viewof all the major displays/attractions. Highlights for us were thearmor display, the several cells--especially where Sir ThomasMoore was held, the area where prisoners carved messages inthe wall, and the execution area. The Crown jewels of course are beautiful but the viewing is so much like  beingherded along like cattle at a pace that allows only limitedviews--one can go through a second time if you want to stand in line twice. We had a just ok but pricey lunch  in the old marketbuilding. Overall, a very worthwhile attraction. A longer visitprobably is warranted if one is really into the long history of allthe various  ""towers"". A negative is the limited amount oftoilets (WC)-we encountered lines both times we had need."
"October 5, 2019",Highlight of London Vacation,"This is a must see while in London. The grounds are loaded with history and the buildings are incredible. The Crown Jewels should be your first stop, arrive early as soon as they open and head up the hill to the Crown Jewel building as later in the day it will become uncomfortably crowded.  Be sure to also find the Beefeater tour, very informative and entertaining.  Overall a must see stop while in London!"
"October 5, 2019",Fave attraction in London,Skipped the a Tower of London in 2004. Didn’t make that mistake in 2019. Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly gave an amazing tour. The history....  The torture....  The gore....  It’s a good time!  They also have the Crown Jewels and Henry VIII’s armor on display.  Just go!
"October 4, 2019",Haunting and compelling,"So much to see here. Hopefully you've read your British history before you get here, but if not, you will. Beautiful presentation of the Crown Jewels as well."
"September 9, 2019",Amazing jewels,"The highlight was the exhibit of the royal jewelry.  We skipped the prison, but people I know have liked that part of the tour.  The jewels were absolutely amazing----- not to be missed!  I was able to pick up some trinkets to bring home for everybody in the gift shop too."
"September 9, 2019",Early entrance to Tower of London.," The Tower of London is a fascinating experience. We purchased the early entrance tour and found it well worth the money. The primary benefit was to review the crown jewels before the long line started. Also, we were greeted by one of the yeoman wanders and got to witness the opening ceremony, which was interesting and entertaining. "
"September 9, 2019",A historical journey.,"If at all interested in British history,this is a must see. The layout of the castle is quite compact but it will still take 4 to 5 hours to wander through the buildings. The armory is especially interesting and kids really seem to enjoy it as well. The crown jewels are the most popular attraction but be prepared to wait in line for at least 30 minutes to get into this part of the tour. All in all a rewarding experience."
"September 9, 2019",History Buff Heaven!,"Every London tour guide will give you everything you want to know about the Tower, so here are just a few observations from a first-time visitor to England.First, it's a collection of towers and buildings inside a wall.  It's not just a single tower.  There's a lot to see and savor there; you could easily spend most of a day in there, but that's a big investment of time in what is usually a short/tight schedule.So, my recommendation is to get there before it opens and purchase your ticket either online prior or at the ticket counter there.  Go in, skip the Beefeater tour for now and go straight to the queue to see the Crown Jewels.  Trust me, it gets longer as the day goes on. [If you arrive in the afternoon in the summer, expect to spend well over an hour in line to see them.] The jewels are interesting and spectacular and displayed very well.  You MUST see them and they are included in your Tower ticket.After that, go back to the entrance gate and get into the next Beefeater tour.  The Beefeaters are selected from the military and live in the Tower.  They are very dedicated and thoroughly knowledgeable about British history.  Very interesting!During the day, little playlets spring up here and there, very nicely acted by folks in authentic garb.  They are designed to illustrate life as a prisoner there, the politics of the time, the differences in the classes in the 16th century, etc.  If you love history, you will want to follow the players around as they banter and bicker with each other, but it does eat up time.  You can wander as much as you want around the premises where some of the arguably most important events in Western history occurred!The inside of the Tower is not commercialized.  Because of that, they commendably don't have food franchises in there.  One tiny vendor sells sausage rolls, ice cream and soft drinks and the queue can be very long.  Do not arrive without having eaten if those choices don't appeal to you - or bring in some protein bars to snack on if you plan to be there a while!London has a thousand choices of sights to see, but I think the Tower has to rate in the top 5.If you arrive in the afternoon in the summer, expect to wait an   hour or more to see the Jewels."
"September 8, 2019",Amazing,"There are guides inside and they were good. The guy, forgot to get his name, was excellent 👍 I actually wanted to buy the costumes for kids inside. It was just too bulky to bring home. Maybe another time ❤️ "
"September 8, 2019",Arrive early to beat the crowds!,"Great visit.  Worth going early to beat the crowds- arrived at 8:30 and got in quickly when it opened at 9am.  Headed straight to the Crown Jewels which was a good move- got in quickly (the jewels are magnificent) and when I came out there was a long line already winding around.  There is so much history at the Tower of London...visited a few hours but really could have spent all day.  Take the free BeefEaters tour- presented by a royal guard, the tour is informative as well as humorous!"
"September 7, 2019",The Tower of London,"The Tower of London was one of the most interesting things I visited in London.  The history and architecture was amazing.  The Tower had several buildings inside of a moat.  Over the centuries, it was a treasury, a prison, and an armory - to name a few.  It had an area where you could see the Crown Jewels of England that were worn throughout the ages.  In addition, there were live guards outside that brought it to life."
"September 7, 2019",Tower of London definitely a good visit,"The whole place was just brilliant.  The history, the armor, the weapons and the jewels definitely wow. Loved the experience, and was just incredible to see all the history in this place the good and the bad. To walk in the same grounds that so many famous people have walked was awesome."
"September 7, 2019",Awesome but expensive,"Amazing experience at the Tower of London. Join a free tour with the hilarious tour guides, see the Crown Jewels and hear the amazing history. Leave A LOT of time to get your moneys worth from this visit... no fewer than 3 hours, but preferably 5-6. Be prepared for long (while moving lines). Took more than 45 min to get into the Crown Jewels. Be prepared for an expensive entrance fee if traveling as a family. Certainly a one time experience that was worth a nice day and 100 bucks."
"September 7, 2019",Tower of London,"Very majestic place with a big history. We love it very much. It was about three hours to see the buildings, jewellery and much more."
"September 16, 2019",A Must do!,"If you do one thing in London, do this!  Fascinating place with rich history.  Expect at least 2 hours and hope for nice weather!"
"September 16, 2019",Five Stars ⭐️ ,"Family trip to the Tower it was amazing. We caught the boat down the Thames from the London Eye. So much history, so many stories, Torture in the tower, story of the missing princes,  Anne Boylen, Crown Jewels, Armour collection, prisoners in the tower, animals in the tower. We spent 3.5 hours there but could easily have spent longer.  A few cafes/restaurants inside and a few gift shops. "
"October 3, 2019",Quite an impressive sight,"Well maintained and preserved.  Got to see the crown jewels and watching the guards do their ""thing"" was quite enjoyable."
"October 3, 2019",Tower Of London,"What a great History lesson we got by visiting the Tower of London.   This place was really amazing.    If you go, make time to see the Crown Jewels.....out of this world!"
"October 2, 2019",Absolutely loved it!,We absolutely loved it! Spent 4 hours walking around and joining a guided tour. Don’t miss out on mini-events described in the brochure! The Crown Jewels are simply stunning and well-worth a visit!
"October 2, 2019",Incredible history,"Pay to go inside, or spend a few hours around the perimeter, guided by signs posted giving you the history of each section of the Tower of London. Beautifully laid out and very informative whichever way you choose. "
"October 1, 2019",Spent the morning here,"We toured the Tower of London for about 4 hours and enjoyed our visit.  This is a self paced tour where you walk around the buildings and visit various areas of the space.  There are lots of steps to climb, but you are able to choose what you want to do.  My husband chose to climb the 110 steps up to the white tower, and I did not do that section of the tour.  There are many places to rest around the space.  If you have some family members who want to see everything, they could and you could rest.  There is a nice cafeteria area which is air conditioned and I waited there.  Of all the palaces and castles that we toured in London, this was my least favorite.  I am really not into weapons or hearing about battles.  However, the crown jewel exhibit was amazing. I would not miss that section of the Tower.  In that area, everyone rides on a conveyor belt past the crowns and other large jewels.  If you want to go in and see it again, that is fine.  Nothing is restricted to a one time viewing once you are within the Tower walls."
"October 1, 2019",Be sure to allot plenty of time,"Excellent Beefeater (Yeoman Warder) tour full of humor and history. Appreciated the tips for exploring the various places to see. Loved the Crown Jewels, which we visited early on in our day, which I would recommend as it does get busy. Did notice several people disrespecting the no taking photos in certain areas rule. Moving to wander around where so much has taken place and experience audio, video, children’s activity areas- quite a gamut to suit people’s interests. Great views around the battlements. Interesting to see  the girth of King Henry Vlll’s armour. An ice cream interlude was a nice pick me up in a several hours visit. Go early as you may linger longer than you anticipated. So interesting!"
"September 30, 2019",One of the best royal castle experiences in the world,"It seems like there is a castle/chateau/schloss every few miles in Europe but there are very few that offer an experience that is five-star.  The Tower of London, Hampton Court, Versailles, to name a few.  What separates The Tower of London from others and puts it above all the castles in the rest of the world is that it is largely intact; there is a short, free tour (Scott Kelly, our Yeoman Warder was EXCELLENT); it houses the kingdom's crown jewels to view in person; there are audio, video, virtual and children activities; the museum has a vast array of unusual artifacts; and the value is incredible because we spent five hours there and still feel like we could have spent more time."
"September 29, 2019",Don’t miss,We have been to London numerous times and our visit always includes the Tower we learn something new each time whether touring ourselves or joining one of the Yeoman’s guided tours So much history 
"September 29, 2019",Vacation,"One of my bucket list places.. and I wasn't disappointed. This experience was remarkable, especially if English history is of interest.  "
"September 28, 2019",Closing time,"We ran out of time, but went anyway. It was only about half hour - forty five minutes, but we were able to easily see the Crown Jewels and white tower.Worth a visit. "
"September 15, 2019",Good but expensive (unless you travel by train),We were just up for the day from Cambridge and made use of the 1/2 price offer when you travel by train. We followed a tour by a Yeoman Warder which was long enough to cover the basics yet allowed time to tour alone. The Royal treasures are spectacular and very impressive and the highlight of the day. The catering is only OK and the displays in the White tower a bit  boring  but it shows living history. 
"September 15, 2019",If you do one thing in London do the Tower!,"We visited the London tower recently with our children 11 & 12 who found it fascinating and fun. The tower was definitely one of our highlights of our London trip it was our favourite when we visited 14 years ago and still holds its charm. There is so much history in those walls and the staff and Beef Eater tour are very entertaining. A shout out to Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly who had the huge crowd gathered around him well entertained!! He definitely made the visit  it that much more interesting and fun.There is also interactive level in the tower for the kiddies with bow and arrow simulation, cannon firing to mention a few.. A very enjoyable day. 😊"
"September 15, 2019",The highlight of our London Visit,"I really enjoyed the tower, so much history in one place.  We were at the tower for about 3 hours but we took our time and wandered about on our own. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there was alot of walking and alot of stairs to deal with.  It was a bit crowded but enjoyed seeing the crown jewels.  Also enjoyed hearing the story of the ravens and watching them roam the grounds.  Oddly, it was a great place to get some pictures of the tower bridge and the modern building nearby.  If you get hungry, there are some great restaurants on the farside of the gift shop outside the tower.  We ate at a Pret A Manger which had decent food and good coffee but there was also a pasty shop, Subway, KFC and some ""sit down"" restaurants.       "
"September 15, 2019",Outstanding ,"Probably the best attraction in London Don’t miss the Yeoman Warden (Ex- Forces ) tour ..... all you will ever need to know about the Tower... and Free If you’re going to London don’t miss it  Can get busy so pick you time , afternoons seem to be better "
"September 15, 2019",Take a beefeater tour,"There's free tours throughout the day and they are brief (30 minutes?) but informative and fun.  You learn a bit about the history of the buildings and the famous people who lived or were imprisoned there, as well as those that still live there today. The line for the crown jewels go fast so don't be deterred, it's worth a walk through. "
"September 15, 2019",All day visit!,I only had a 2 days in London so the Tower of London was a must see on my list. I tried to site see as much but played it by ear. Luckily I made the Tower of London my first stop. I had no idea I would spend 4 hours there. I actually could have spent more time there but I wrapped it up to try and get some other sights in. The best part was the Jewels! Bling bling my eyes sparkled. Behind all that the history is always interesting and I am glad we made the visit. Please get the audio tour it is completely worth it. They also have gift shops through out the castle and stop and get ice cream there. It’s delicious! 
"September 14, 2019",Crown Jewels OMG!,Tower of London transports the visitor back in time! Came out of the visit understanding the roles and plights of Royals and not Royals. The Crown Jewels really emphasizes the chasm between the haves and have nots.  So amazing.  Highly recommended while visiting London
"September 14, 2019",BEEF EATER TOUR,"You will need to get to the tower in the morning to really enjoy all of it.  We got there in the afternoon and didn't get to see all of it, as it was closing.  Next time I will definitely go in the morning.  Standing in queue to see the Crown Jewels is worth it - a must see.  You will not be disappointed with the Beef Eater Tour - had a laugh and learned lots."
"September 14, 2019",A LONDON MUST SEE,I think the Tower of London was one of my favorite things to do the London. The beefeaters tour was great. They were really knowledgeable and entertaining. I loved the Crown Jewels. There is a diamond in a crown that is 500+ carats. No pics inside viewing the jewels and wear comfortable shoes because not only is there a lot of walking but the ground is uneven and makes your dogs bark sooner than normal.
"September 14, 2019",Amazing!,"The way the British have maintained and honored the history of their country is amazing.  This is a beautiful place to visit and, if you ask questions, the staff is happy to engage in a share of knowledge."
"September 13, 2019",Yeoman Warder tour is the best!,"This was the second time I’ve visited the Tower of London, and the wit, knowledge and delivery of the “Beefeaters” that give the tours is worth going for. So much history is crammed into that space, you can spend much more time beyond the one hour tour included with your admission. Whether it’s seeing the Crown Jewels, exploring White Tower, or making your way around the property and picking up nuggets of information at every turn, the Tower of London is a must-do when you are in town "
"September 13, 2019",London must stop,"It was very interesting to visit. Based on the website, it says to expect to visit for 90 minutes but we took 3 hours and we were not taking our time. Must wear comfortable shoes because their are many narrow stairs and walking. Once you enter a tower there is no exit other than going thru everything. I wish they offered a stroller parking spot because hauling our stroller up and down stairs was a lot of work. "
"September 13, 2019","A trip through history, the crown jewels are a must see","My husband and had an hour for the tour, but it's not enough, so plan about 2 hours to be able to really see everything in the Tower. It's quite interesting to see medieval fortresses from the inside. Nut my favorite part of it were the crown jewels, mesmerizing! Unfortunately no pictures are allowed inside (of course)"
"September 13, 2019",Finally made a visit,All the years been going to London and have never set foot inside.Fabulous venue. So much history. The Beefeaters are great in the tours and the Crown Jewels were amazing. So much to see. So much history and tradition and I’m sure we didn’t see it all. Great value for money and definitely worth a visit if your in our fabulous capit
"September 13, 2019",Great visit,Wonderful experience. Loved the Beefeater’s pride and dedication to the job.  Great even the second time round.
"September 13, 2019",Crown Jewels and PRICE ALERT!!,"I enjoyed the tower of London and all the history behind it.  I didn't know that it used to be a prison.  The crown jewels are there but you are unable to take pictures.  I don't want to have to buy a book to see the places I've been, I want to take pictures.  You stand in line...we waited for about an hour to get inside.  We went through the tour slowly and watched a short film.  Take the time to do tour.  However, it can be pricey.  What we did was we bought a year membership to the historic royal palaces for 52 pounds per person. Not only does the membership get you into the Tower of London but also Banqueting House, Kensington Palace, Hampton Court Palace (my fave), and Kew Palace.  Lots of extras included, too.  However, if we hadn't bought the membership, we would've only been to go to one place.  It's worth the extra money.  Oh!  You get discounts in gift shops and food places."
"September 12, 2019",Highlight of our trip,"The ""Beefeater's"" Tour is a must!  There is much more here than just the ""Crown Jewels"".  The stories told and the history is very entertaining."
"September 11, 2019",Fantastic ,It is really fantastic. You meet the past and the middle age. The crown's jewels are amazing. You have to visit when you are in London 
"September 3, 2019",Tower of London and Ceremony of the Keys,We did ceremony of the keys the first night we were in London.  It was fascinating.  You must purchase tickets on line really early or they get sold out.  It was such a nice evening out and with the Castle/Tower all lit up with lights and torches it was magnificent. They have locked the tower up every evening for over 500 years this way.  You get to see the guards march and wardens carry lanterns and keys.  Very interesting.   Get your tickets also on line with the tower for the first entrance of the day.  That way you won't have to wait to see the Crown Jewels.  There is a moving walk way going around all the jewels and you can get on and off and go back around when not busy.  They are so beautiful you will want to see them again and again.  It was a huge display.  Also do the beefeater tour with a warden around the grounds as they talk about everything so you know what you are looking at.  The cafe on the grounds is also quite good.  We are around noon and it wasn't too crowded. If I ever go back to London I would go back and see this again as we didn't get to see everything. We spent about 4 hours there.  
"September 3, 2019",Tower a must see,You can spend the day here or see the Crown Jewels and walk about at your leisure. There’s plenty of open space for little ones to be active and more history than you can absorb.
"September 3, 2019",Early Access to Tower of London and open ticket London Bridge,"Pay for the early access, jump the queue and get to the Crown Jewels early.  This was a good option for us and saved us heaps of time when you are under the pump to keep moving! Jewels were amazing!  Even more than you could expect, Best picture option is the big poster outside the Tower as no pictures can be taken in the vault!  The clear sight of Guards ceremonial unlocking of the gates for public access was also a bonus.  We stayed on at the Tower for an extra hour (you need 3 hours here). Tower Bridge did all the right things for us as well, we timed the bridge opening to allow access for a Cruiseliner and then again to let the tug back through.  Great tour!"
"September 3, 2019","One of my favorites in London for adults and adolescents (possibly children, as well)","Taking the Beefeater Tour (best to reserve in advance), I've always found this tour and grounds exceeded my expectations.   First, the Beefeater's who lead the tours are knowledgeable and humorous.  So many sights (i.e., the Crown Jewel's, place of many beheadings), to see and the Beefeaters are insightful and will answer our (oh, so many!) questions on the tour.   The armory and grounds have tell-abouts to complete the experience.    Up-to-date tour queries and jokes based on international goings-on.Give this tour 2-3 hours, partially with the Beefeater's tour guide and partially self-guided.  Amazing!"
"September 2, 2019",Must see sight,The Tower of London offers an exciting journey back in history. The Beefeater  also reenact the changing of the guards. Highly recommend this tour. 
"September 2, 2019",Awesome!,"Hearing about the ""Tower of London"" you think of just a tower, but it is much more.  We were surprised at how extensive the castle is and and had a great tour by one of the Beefeaters.  Yes the line is long, but don't miss the crown jewels.  What a unique view of British history and some amazing jewel uncrusted crowns and other regalia.Definitely worth your time."
"September 2, 2019",Stunning!,"Loved the Crown Jewels!  Depending on the time of day and what day you go, there could be a very long line, but we lucked out and were in within 15 min!  The rest of the tower so much history tied to it, you can spend hours looking through the entire place."
"September 1, 2019",Very cool and informative,"Lots to see here and quite interesting information.  Warning - LOTS of steps, but then, it is a castle.  Not many food choices - I didn't see any indoor options, just outside stalls.  Great ice cream though!"
"September 1, 2019",First trip to London,"We both loved it, a lot of stairs I mean a lot, white tower has 204.   But great history information, everyone was nice,  food ok, view of Thames River and large buildings around the area.   Raven everywhere, I went August 31st a Saturday and was not crowded, I read go to grown Jewels first, which we did, and I was so glad, as later in the day, line was long, but we had no line.   "
"September 1, 2019",Be sure to go early,"Arrive early for two reasons. First to see the queens keys to the tower delivered so the tower can be opened (this tradition is hundreds of years old). Second, there will not be a line for the crown jewels. Be sure and do the beefeater tour in the tower. They start at 10 am. See the crown jewels first thing at 9am before the beefeater your and you will miss the very long lines that develop rather quickly around 10am. Finally, don't miss seeing the tower. It's fully worth the time."
"August 31, 2019",The Tower Embodies England's History,"The Tower is one of the most iconic places to visit in London, but it also provides a sweeping history of England in one place.  Yes, there are always crowds, but it's worth it to set foot on this place which has been so significant for several thousand years.  We were fortunate to be able to also go into the chapel where many notable people are buried.  If you only have time to see a few places in London, see the Tower!"
"August 30, 2019",Bit Disappointed ,"I visited the Tower of London as an educational visit for my grandson. It was a bit disappointing to say the least. I was trying to fire in him my love of  history! Unfortunately this fell flat as the whole experience felt like a bit of a tourist experience rather than a visit to one of our most beloved historic monuments!  I visited this when I was 11 years old and it inspired me , gave me a real pride in my country and heritage; this failed to hit the mark with my grandson! This just bored  him and left me feeling that we have sold our soul to commerciality! Very disappointed as I had really bigged up the visit! He actually preferred the London Dungeon! Come on?"
"August 29, 2019",A Wonderful experience,"We visited the place in July 19. Online booking of tickets help since there are large queues at the ticket window. Recommend to start the tour of Tower of London early in the morning before the crowd starts . Since there is a big queue for the Crown Jewels viewing ,it is better to start  the tour with the Crown jewels and then explore the grounds of the Tower at leisure.  Later in the day there are serpentine queues for the Crown Jewels. The viewing takes about 3 hours . Do not miss the Ravens and the Traitors Gate which are a part of the Tower History."
"August 29, 2019",Fascinating ,A brilliant place for history lovers. The beefeaters are brilliant. There are audio cassettes and there are tours to take you to see Anne’s resting place.
"August 29, 2019",where is the ticket office?,"Has anyone bought online tickets that have to be ""redeemed"" at the Tower of London Redemption Center? I would like to see a picture of what that window/door looks like and where it is in relation to the entrance to the actual Tower tour."
"August 28, 2019",Make Sure You Plan for the Beefeater Tour,"The tour with the Beefeater was the highlight of my trip to the Tower of London. I caught the last tour of the day and the trip would not have been the same without it. my guide was Spike, and he was wonderful! Obviously very knowledgable, but also very funny, which made the tour that much more enjoyable. The complex is very large, so I wish I had left more time for my visit. The ticket price is very expensive, and it is of course very crowded but overall I enjoyed my time there. The crown jewels was not worth the wait in line as the crowd was so massive you could barely even see the jewels once inside."
"August 28, 2019",Great Tour,"This was a great tour. A word of advice is to get there early, and head directly to the the Crown Jewels. The queue for the Crown Jewels becomes quite long as the day progresses. The Tower of London itself is magnificent. It is a sight to see especially with the backdrop of modern day London. Lots of stairs to navigate so make sure you wear comfortable shoes. A great experience."
"August 28, 2019",London Tower,Get there early and start with The Crown Jewels before the lines get long and you can take your time looking. Take the tours with the Beefeaters you learn a lot of history. Lots of walking and steps...so worth it if you can climb steps and go through small stairways. My mom and I had a great time.
"August 26, 2019",Enjoyed,"We arrived right as they opened and did not have to wait in line. It was suggested that we see the crown jewels first as it is less crowded first thing.  This was so helpful!  We went there first, again no waiting!  Throughout the day as we continued our tour we saw the line becoming increasingly longer.  Do yourself a favor and see the jewels first when they open."
"August 26, 2019",A worthwhile stop in your London visit,"It takes a while to appreciate the sheer historical significance of this site.It is remarkable in so many ways- not the least of which is the beauty of the site.The tour was informative without being overbearing, it provided just the right amount of context to make the exploration of the different areas all the more enjoyable."
"September 7, 2019",Unbelievable Historical site,Visiting the Tower should be a must for anyone visiting London. Thanked the tour with the Yeoman Warder. It is one of the most enjoyable places and informative venues in London.
"September 6, 2019","Eat, Drink, Travel","This was my second visit to the Tower.  Although it is a tourist attraction, it is one everyone should go to.  The history, the jewels and more are very interesting.  It is more than just looking at ""items"", they explain the history that goes with them."
"September 6, 2019",A good look of London’s history,"Very educational tour. Good to know the history of this tower at the dark past, as this is where torture happens when someone committed treason. I enjoyed the armory. But so sad I was not able to visit and see The Crown Jewels as I don’t have much time. I suggest go a bit early, you have to que for at least 2hrs if you go in the afternoon"
"September 5, 2019",Heritage worth visiting,I am fascinated buildings and items within of this age are maintained to this high a standard. It was worth the time to walk through all open areas and imagine life without the surrounding city. 
"September 5, 2019",Excellent morning out,Great 2-3 hours outing. A lot to see. Crown jewels are amazing including Koh E Noor. Took the tour which was very interesting. There are restaurants and Paul Cafe around. Kids have a great time watching the guards.
"September 4, 2019",Fab few hours but us Brits should get discount,Loved the afternoon there and Scott Kelly (Yeoman Warden) submersed the group in tales of public executions and intrigue it was like we were going back in time. Great facts and delivered with aplomb and character. My one comment for the decision makers is allow British residence to show council tax document to get a discount off the £30 entrance fee. I know there are vouchers out there but you have to sell your social media details to the devil to get them!
"September 4, 2019",Crown Jewels worth getting in line early!,We paid attention to the Trip Advisor tips to arrive at the Tower of London entrance line (with our online tickets already printed) 30 minutes ahead of opening; then when straight to the Crown Jewel display. It was worth it! The Crown Jewels exhibition was worth it. Afterwards - we could make our way through the rest of the Tower of London at our leisure. The White Tower is a lot of stairs up (299?) with lots of armoury on display. The exit is a spiral staircase down 299 steps! The sign says no strollers - it really means no strollers! Also - keep in mind - there is no air conditioning! Exit from the Tower of London onto the walkway adjacent the Thames River and take in the Tower Bridge.
"September 3, 2019",Amazing!,"A must see! So much history, Beefeaters, the crows, the Crown Jewels are exquisite , Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard's graves are in the little chapel and so much more..Yes the line is long but moves quickly and well worth it! Make a day of it"
"September 3, 2019",Great historic site,Amazingly preserved site. Excellent display of the Crown Jewels. Great insight into the history of England and the brutality of the times.
"September 3, 2019",A Must See,"We arrived when it first opened to beat the crowds and we are glad we did.  The first place we went to was the Crown Jewels and we walked right in without waiting.  Two hours later there was a line of about 50-75 people waiting to go in.  We used the London Pass to avoid the ticket queue.  You must do the free Yeoman Warder tour to learn about the history of the Tower.  Our Beefeater, Spike, was very entertaining.  Make sure you visit the different towers and the museum.  Watch for the ravens, they like to pose for photos."
"August 26, 2019",Historical Gem in London,"We spent 3 hours here walking around the White Tower, the Bloody Tower, Traitor's Gate and the Crown Jewels.  It is worth brushing up on your English history before a visit. A couple of tips , buy tickets online in advance and arrive before opening to avoid a huge line up.  The jewels are incredible and so is the history of the Tower.  Enjoyed our visit very much. "
"August 25, 2019",It was Ok,"I visited at the insistence of friends that had visited. The place is nice and historic but the room where the “jewels “are under delivered in wow effort, it was just ok. I thought all Queen Elizabeth crowns were there and it’s only a few of them. I could have skipped this as none of it wowed me but that is just my personal experience. "
"August 25, 2019",Dream come true,I have been an Anglophile since I was twelve.To actually step into the very room the brother Princes were killed in is truly a dream come true. It is a must!
"August 25, 2019",You have to see this!!,"If you don't see anything else in London, you have to see this!!  amazing history with displays (both interactive and static displays).  Great architecture, amazing views and a decent cafe.  The lines to the crown jewels are REALLY long!  Most of the other displays have standard wait times, so nothing too long.  If you can, listen to/watch some of the demonstrations/talks that the people who work there give.  VERY interesting history!  If you fly through (and not see the crown jewels), you can probably get through it in about 1 1/2 hours.  If you enjoy history and read most of the display information (and see the crown jewels) you could be there at least 7-8 hours.  Definitely, worth the visit!"
"August 25, 2019",Tower tips,"The Tower of London is a great day out but you need to be prepared for long queues and lots of stairs to climb. Get there early to avoid the very long lines that build up to see the Crown Jewels. Also take a tour with one of the beef eater guides,these are always informative and entertaining. There are photo opportunities with actors in period costumes.Signage isn’t great to locate toilets, especially for ladies but they are there just not well signposted."
"August 23, 2019",Stunning,"Recommend good walking shoes and going to see the Crown Jewels first thing when they open at 10 am because the line get be very long.  There are no photos allowed of the Crown Jewels.  There is a movie clip from Queen Elizabeth's coronation.  Then you get to see the 3 largest diamonds in the world, the largest ruby and emerald and some of the largest pearls.The Tower has a rich history.  The Yeoman Warders are amazingly knowledgeable.  You should read about the Tower before you go and see it.  You can spend half a day at the Tower.  There is also an amazing view of Tower Bridge.  Some areas are not handicap accessible and you can't bring a stroller.  There are a lot of stairs in some parts of the Tower.  You can also see the Changing of the Guard.  Smaller scale than Buckingham Palace, easier to see."
"August 23, 2019",Must do whilst in London,"We stayed in London for 5 days and went on many tours and saw a lot of sights...hands down this was the best place we visited.We pre-booked our tickets in Australia and glad we did. No queues. Note: Arrive when the gates open, head straight to Crown Jewels to have a look otherwise you will be queuing for some time. After the crown jewels we followed the Yeoman warden on the 9.30am tour. Brilliant... So informative, fascinating yet witty. Don't skip doing this...only goes for 30 mins or so but you learn so much history. Make sure you give yourself at least 3 hours at the Tower. Such a great day."
"August 19, 2019",Awesome experience - lots to see and even more to learn,"We went to the Tower of London not knowing what to expect and got a whole lot more than we expected. We went on a tour and had the opportunity to see the opening ceremony - highly recommend this. If you can't do this, then use the London Pass or other mechanism to ""skip"" the long lines and at least get to the front in a shorter line. There is so much to see and there are free tours that you can join (check the website). The Crown Jewels are awesome - warning there is another line and if you are interested in seeing them, highly recommend going in as early as possible. The armor collection was fascinating and presented in such a way that you can't help learning about London's history. There are a number of things to watch: the ravens, the mesh wire sculptures representing gifts from other kingdoms, the Beefeaters, etc, We spent several hours here and it felt like we were only there for a few minutes. We will definitely go back because there is so much to see and learn."
"August 19, 2019",Don’t miss this!,"Even in the rain, we loved the ToL!  Definitely recommend to go first thing in the morning and head to the Crown Jewels right away. We waited in a very long queue to see them and felt a bit like herded sheep lol. The audio guide was great and allowed you to select the tour you wanted to follow depending upon how much time you have. If you only visit one place in London, it should be this!"
"August 19, 2019",Wonderful tour and experience ,The warders tour is awesome and the overall tour was well worth the price of admission. Would recomend booking in advance for groups to save a few £.
"July 28, 2019",Great museum for good weather,"The museum was very entertaining for my nieces (7 & 10), my brother and myself (30s), and our parents (70s).We arrived at 2pm and there was no line to get in.  It was crowded on the inside, but the interior courtyard is large so it was still easy to get around.  There were lines for some of the main exhibits on the inside, mainly for the crown jewels.  The crown jewels line moved fast though and was worth the wait.The free Yeomen Warders tour they give ever half hour or so are very entertaining.  I would plan to start with this tour and then go off and see all the exhibits after.  Give yourself 3 hours to be safe, if your are with kids you may need a little more time."
"July 27, 2019",Worth going to for a history lesson,"Went a on a Saturday in July. Need less to say, very crowded including tour groups. If you can stomach the crowds, it is worth going to. A Yeoman Warner tour (free with admission) was entertaining and informative. There is a lot to see here so read up ahead of time to pick what you want to see. Come early if you want to see the Crown Jewels, line was very long in the hot sun. We skipped it.The walk along the wall was interesting to give an overview of the place. The White tower museum has lots of arms and armor and also lots of steps.Would come back on a less crowded day to see the stuff we missed."
"July 27, 2019",Amazing! ,"My family and I went here during our two day stay in London and it’s was absolutely fabulous! We purchased the London Passes and were brought straight in with no wait at all! There was a line for the Crown Jewels but the conveyer belts in front of them kept the line moving swiftly. All of the staff was more than kind and there were even some historically dressed employees performing re-enactments throughout the castle. The grounds were not overly crowded, so there was plenty of room to walk around and sit and relax between walking through the grounds. Overall the rooms were very nice and the signs were translated to many languages as to accommodate many people from many different regions, which is more than I can say about other historic castles, such as Versailles in France. It definitely takes a few hours to see everything, but it is well worth it! I definitely recommend this castle and would 100% return! "
"July 25, 2019",Wished we had more time.,"We went as part of a full day tour with many other stops, so we really only had less than two hours. We waited in line for at least 30 minutes to see the crown jewels. I feel like we needed at least another hour or more to see everything. There is a lot of history to see here. Would definitely recommend a visit."
"July 25, 2019","The good, bad and ugly of England’s past","Only had a 2.5hr slot so we had to be choosy about what we went to - in truth you could spend the best part of a day exploring (which would make the price more palatable). Started with the tour which was well worth it (get close so you can hear clearly) - v knowledgeable and friendly guide. Then saw Crown Jewels (big queue but moved v quickly so we were in in minutes), the white tower armoury (cool weapons) and the torture instruments in the base of the tower. Fascinating stuff. My main improvement would be to bring in digital tickets (you HAVE to have a printed one) - as antiquated as the venue!!"
"July 25, 2019",Ravens!,"Enjoyed a guided tour of the Tower of London -- two highlights: seeing the famous Tower Ravens and the Crown Jewels. Imagine a diamond the size of my fist! The architecture is gorgeous, the museums fascinating. Well worth the visit. "
"July 25, 2019",Amazing,"We only spent 3 hours here, not enough time to fully immerse ourselves. Crown jewels exhibit was breathtaking "
"July 24, 2019",Really good,Very informative the people were so helpful and we all enjoyed the experience. Well worth a visit!!It got a little pushy in the Crown Jewels but that’s people who are pushy and not the attractions fault. 
"July 24, 2019",Don't book through Viator - book directly with location!,"We weren't able to get to the Tower of London on the day that I had I purchased our tickets for, so I called Viator to see if we could transfer to the next day. They told me they would have to hear from the property. I called the property and they said no problem just to tell Viator it was ok but after three phone calls and speaking to various ""customer service"" reps, Viator would not accept that. So, we lost the $105 we spent on tickets and never saw the Tower of London. London is a huge city that is difficult to navigate and the last tour runs at 5 so if you are stuck in traffic or you've had to alter plans due to an unforeseen circumstance, you are stuck. You are better off to buy them directly through the Tower of London for that day."
"July 23, 2019",Royalty and history at its best,Must must visit attraction. Cannot miss just for the Crown Jewels section. Royalty of England and its history shines through in all its glory.
"August 13, 2019",Have to see,Could have easily spent a full day at the Tower of London. The presentation was great and the knowledge of the staff was tops
"August 12, 2019",Fascinating,"Book online and arrive early to avoid queues. Once inside head for the Crown Jewels, again to avoid crowds. I would recommend the guided tour, which I believe are hourly. Our Beefeater guide Sean was brilliant. Knowledgeable and funny and with a sergeant major voice so all could hear him!The centuries old graffiti from past prisoners is fascinating. "
"August 12, 2019",Visiting London....DON'T MISS!!,My wife and I spent about 3 hours leisurely touring this incredible place. The armory and hall armor breath taking. Audio tour and Beefeaters Tours incredible. Highly recommend!!
"August 11, 2019",Amazing best attraction in London ,This was my favourite attraction in London. We purchased a 1 Day London pass and visited this as our first stop. Get there as it opens as the queues pile up quick! You don’t need to queue to get a ticket you just show your London pass and they scan it. Head straight to the Crown Jewels exhibition (marked as a purple crown on map) as the queues get enormous ! There is a free app to guide you around the place but it is also easy to follow on the free map they give you. Allow 2hrs to see it all. 
"August 11, 2019",Go early ,"After reading reviews we made sure we were there right at opening . No line ups and we went straight to the Crown jewels . Again, no line ups . We spent approximately three hours there and when we left there were lineups for the crown jewels - which are incredible - and to enter . Definitely worth seeing and you can avoid long lines by being early "
"August 11, 2019",Crown jewels,"when in London If you see any thing this is the site to see, the history, and the royal treasure is fantastic"
"August 10, 2019",Something to see ,"Spent a dreary fall afternoon wondering around the tower. Saw the English Crown Jewels, got to speak with a Yeoman Warder, see were Queen Anne Boleyn was executed, and the famous Royal Ravens. There is also the collection of arms and armour on display, statues of the menagerie that was kept on the grounds as well as others displays of happenings in that took place in and around the tower."
"August 10, 2019",100% cancellation penalties,Penalties are unenforceable in English Law so cancellation policy should say something like fees are non refundable. If you buy on line by Law you have a cooling off period 
"August 10, 2019",Great!,"Mandatory visit when in London and great view of the Thames. Also, great energy. I could ""feel"" history in every breath I've taken."
"August 8, 2019",Excellent tour,We visited the Tower of London during our recent stay in London and what a magnificent tourist site this is We could have spent many hours wandering around the expansive grounds but accomplished what we could whilst there - I do think you need to allow at least 2-4 hours to do this venue justice We joined the beefeater tour when we arrived and that was very well done and quite humorous as well.We also were keen to see the Crown Jewels and joined the long line ... however the line moves very quickly and within 25 minutes we were inside . well worth the wait to see the magnificent Crown Jewels and you also learn a little of the history as well The views of tower bridge are amazing from the tower walls and offer many photo opportunities A great place to visit and one for everyone’s to do list whilst in London
"August 19, 2019",A must see,The Tower of London is a must see for anyone visiting London. Lots of interesting history and who doesn’t want to see the Crown Jewels
"August 18, 2019",Lot's of history,"Tons of people come through here and they do a decent job of getting everyone in and out. Definitely recommend investing in renting the guide tablet with headphones so you know what you're looking at. Get there early, plan to spend 3-4 hours there, and if you really want to see the crown jewels, do those early because the line gets huge (hour wait) in the middle of the day."
"August 18, 2019",Fabulous,The tower was completely different than I thought it would be. So glad we went! Seeing the apartments brought history to life. We met beefeaters and saw the Crown Jewels. Fascinating way to spend 2-3 hours.
"August 18, 2019",It was good,I like how they had actors in the tower rooms it was entertaining. My personal favorite part was the crown jewels because of how the have every king and queens crowns. All around it wat good.
"August 17, 2019",Yeoman Warder Rob was awesome!,"Expected a self guided tour and were surprised how the guided Yeoman Warder provided such a descriptive overview of the grounds, the people and the history ins such a short time.  Don’t miss the guide. We were also pleased to become prisoners in the historical theater that we happened upon. Character actors divided us  prisoners  as heretics and/or traitors. We were then introduced to infamous prisoners and even witnessed a daring escape. We missed the crowned jewels as the line got even longer later in the afternoon. Seeing the Ravens accentuated the story. Worth the time. "
"August 17, 2019",Not disappointed!,I’ve waited years to get to see the Tower of London. The highlight was seeing the Crown Jewels! And it was interesting to be on the same piece of ground where Anne Boleyn and others were beheaded. Such a historical treasure that is a must when you are in London! 
"August 16, 2019",Fantastic! A MUST SEE,This was one of our favorite London Attractions! We went in the pouring rain and had such a great time we didn’t even notice.There is SO much to see! Well worth it!!!! A must on your trip to London!
"August 16, 2019",For those with young children beware.......,"We visited in midweek during July with my 6 year old and 5 year old. We arrived early to avoid the queues and headed straight for the crown jewels (this is a top tip - arrive early and make a beeline for the crown jewels avoiding everything thats in your path as you are free to visit the attractions in any order). While I enjoyed the visit and attractions, my children were a little bored, I dont think there's enough for young children. Perhaps a Beefeater tour tailored to young children would be a good addition to the offering. I loved the beefeater tour myself and would thoroughly recommend. I found the entrance quite expensive - we got one child in for free and still paid 80 pounds. Overall, worthwhile, but I got more out the visit than my children."
"August 15, 2019",SO interesting!,"Definitely buy tickets for this!! If you are into history or just great architecture, do this tour. The Beefeaters who lead the tours, are very informative and entertaining! Quite the personalities they have! It's like walking back in time. "
"August 13, 2019",A highlight of our trip,"We spent the day here and it wasn’t enough time to see everything! The Crown Jewels were so incredible that we walked through twice. We asked a staff member a question and he turned out to be an actor for an event. He asked if the kids wanted to join his gang and invited us to the event. This turned out to be a fun, interactive event that was also really informative. The actors were very engaging and at the end the kids received a reward. Afterwards, they invited the kids to join them for music and dancing. The information provided was so interesting that I did further research after we left, which to me, is the sign of a good tour."
"August 8, 2019","Great experience, highly recommend however ....","I would advise that as soon as you arrive, you immediately visit the crown jewels as the queues become ridiculous very early!I was excited about the Beefeater tour, however, these are not small group tours as I’d expected but instead 100s of people following a Beefeater from spot to spot which felt a little hustle & bustley! I would instead recommend the audio guide, which was £14 per family, and to walk around the Tower at your leisure.Finally, take your own food and drinks! A can of Pepsi cost £3.50!"
"August 8, 2019",So much history,"Spent half a day here today and could have spent longer. Went on a beefeater tour with Spike #402 he was fantastic. We learnt a lot. Go early and see the crown jewels first, we practically walked right in, later the line gets to over an hour long. If you pre book tickets you have to swap them at the group booking office before admission. Great day, great history, can see why it's number 1 in London."
"August 7, 2019",So much history!,"The Tower of London lives up to its expectations! The tour was full of information ranging from the plaques to the Beefeaters. The place is full of history and a must see for anyone interested in the history of London. Steve, Beefeater, was very friendly and funny when giving us a talk. The ravens aren’t as scary as people they think, they do not approach you unless you are approaching them, which you are encouraged to not do. Great exhibition of the Crown Jewels on display. Only disappointment was the little information regarding the story of the Princes in the Tower. On the whole a really good and insightful few hours at the Tower of London."
"August 7, 2019",Tower of London,"Going on a Saturday in Summer holidays I knew it would be busy but wow I think half of London was there. Beefeater Tour was informative but too many people so we opted to view the Crown Jewels. The queue was 30 minutes but well worth it. The queue after we came out was 1 hour, not ideal in the heat. We spent 3 hours in total and could have spent longer."
"August 7, 2019",Family Trip,"We got there a little before 9 and waited in line for the Tower of London to open. We went straight to the Crown Jewels upon opening. The line was virtually non-existent for the jewels. We then returned to the front for the yeoman tour. However, there were SO many people for the tour, it was hard to get close enough to hear him. We wound up dropping out of the tour by the second stop."
"August 7, 2019",Great place to see some royal stuff!!,You must get here early...they start queuing up by mid morning and there is not a lot of shade in the outside line! Totally worth visiting as you can see a large assortment of the Royal Crown Jewels! Bonus...the guards outside are a hoot!! 
"August 7, 2019",Fascinating look at London's history,"There is so much to see at the Tower of London. Do yourself a favour and join a guided tour - it's well worth doing to get a glimpse into the history of the tower and how it operates today. Be prepared for crowds and queues into the Crown Jewels by going earlier in the day, especially if you plan to go in peak season. I spent a few hours here exploring and really enjoyed the experience."
"August 6, 2019",Fantastic!,"This was a great place to spend a good portion of a day. There was lots to see and we tired before we ran out of things to see.  It's a great place for families!  There can be lots of climbing and going down stairs and some areas might be difficult to transverse, but there is something here for everyone to enjoy.  There are also places to get food and drinks when hungry. We actually had no idea how large and accessible the Tower of London was, and that it's actually a huge castle and beautiful grounds. A ""must see"" in London! "
"August 5, 2019",Yeoman’s Tour,"My 20 year old daughter and I found the Tower of London fascinating, although a bit gruesome.  The highlight was the Yeoman Warder’s Tour by Scott Kelley!  Even with quite a crowd around him, he projected his voice and kept everyone engaged.  We learned a lot!"
"August 5, 2019",Fantastic experience ,"What a great visit. The Tower of London was so much more than I expected. The Crown Jewels were spectacular. As many others have recommended, go there first. We visited on a Thursday and got there shortly after opening. We didn’t have a line at al to pick up online tickets that we purchased, we didn’t have any wait for the Crown Jewels or any other area. There was so much to see. The views from it some were wonderful. There are a lot of stairs, so be aware of that if that is a concern. "
"July 18, 2019",Ravenmaster was an excellent tour guide.,"We had Beefeater Mr. Chris Skaife, the Ravenmaster, as our tour guide. What absolute luck! He was so animated, informative, and fun. He wrote a great children's book sold in the shop there. We all learned a lot, had some laughs, and even got to see the Crown Jewels, which are not always on display. The moving carpet allowed us to circle around and take a closer look at the spectacular pieces a few times. Take the guided smaller tour by a Beefeater if you go - it is well worth it. Book early, and choose the earliest time to avoid the crowds and selling out. "
"July 18, 2019",A jewel of a visit,"What a lovely day to visit the Tower of London!!  Our main purpose in going was to see the Crown Jewels and we were not disappointed. The line appeared to be long when we arrived but as lines go, this one moved quickly.  In no time we were in the building and winding our way around to see the jewels. They were spectacular and worth every minute of waiting which ended up being only 15-20 minutes. We were allowed to stay as long as we liked and didn’t feel rushed at all. There were lots of people there but we didn’t feel crowded. One hint for the restrooms...the ones at the ticket booth cost money to enter while the ones inside cost nothing to use. The gift shops are nice but each have different items so if you see something that you want, buy it so you don’t have to backtrack.   Tower of London is a “must do” while visiting London."
"July 16, 2019","Entertaining tour, crown jewels and morbid history","We went to see the crown jewels but received much, much more.  The included guided tour by a Yeoman Warder was fantastic.  These are real soldiers that live on site.  They share much of the history of the tower.  We had no idea so many things happened here over history.  The crown jewels were beautiful but the tour overshadowed them.  We arrived early so it wasn't too crowded seeing the crown jewels.  Our bus driver gave us the tip to see the crown jewels first then join a tour at the entrance.   The display of military weapons may be the most interesting ever.  A must see while in London but plan to stay awhile."
"July 14, 2019",Tip - do not order tickets online,"We are visiting on a summer weekend, so it’s a busy day. We ordered our tickets online. However, we don’t have a printer, so we had to choose “collect at the office” (they don’t allow mobile vouchers at this time). We figured this would be quick. The line for people to pick up online tickets is longer and slower than the lines to just buy the tickets here on site. If you have access to a printer, buy online and print the tickets and you can avoid all the ticket lines. If you don’t have access to a printer, buy the tickets on-site. "
"July 14, 2019",Very entertaining ,"We had a tour guide and we had also read a couple books about the Tower of London so I can't say it'd be the same if you went unguided without any prior knowledge. But it was fascinating and my kids aged 10 and 8 loved it. There is talk of executions and torture and other gruesome acts so be sure your kids can stomach that without being upset. The Crown Jewels are worth the price of admission alone but arrive early and go straight there as that area gets very busy. I do recommend a guide if it's in the budget. They can tailor your tour to you. Toned down for kids and fully gruesome for the lovers of gore and everything in between. If you can't afford a tour or can't get one, the Yoemen or Beefeaters give complementary tours at set intervals throughout the day. They only have a couple of stops outside a few towers. Maybe 5 in total and get quite crowded but certainly an excellent alternative if you can't get a private/semi private guide."
"July 13, 2019",So expensive," A classic London tourist attraction. It's £30.30 per adult ..Inc a ""voluntary"" donation. Minus donation is £27.50.Women at the ticket office treats you like dirt. I think its a little audacious to then have further donation boxes around every corner. We were there middle of the week during school holidays. Swapped with school groups. "
"July 10, 2019",Stay waiting on Cruise,"After arriving early, waiting for the start of our cruise we took the tube from Heathrow tube stop to the Tower of London.  It is easy to get to but did have to change trains to get there. We purchased the tickets on line, saving both money and time. There was no queues and we walked in on arrival. We found the tour fascinating and enjoyed seeing the Crown Jewels; however the line to enter the building was slow moving. Also, no pictures were allowed in the vault and was enforced. We were able to see and exit accross from the London Bridge, giving us some great pictures."
"July 10, 2019",Avoid Monday mornings ,"Monday’s they open at 10am as appose to 9am so people forget this and queue up from 9am, so when the gates open your in the queue for hours just to get in - we initially got there at 10am on Monday and was told the wait time was over an hour to get in Tips 1. Go between Tue-Sat (opens at 9am) and be there 15-30 minute in advance to queue2. Pre book your ticket online from their website (it’s also cheaper than buying it there) 3. Head straight to the Crown Jewels as that is what has the longest queue once inside the premise. (no pictures allowed) 4. Once inside, Some sites inside do not allow the pram / stroller or is not practical with a pram / stroller as your required to take the stairs  (so have to leave the pram outside the door) "
"July 10, 2019",Get There Early,I loved visiting this place.  Such history!  But why is it called the Tower when it is more like a complex of towers and buildings?  I underestimated how long it would take me to explore.I didn't get to see the Queen's Jewels as I arrived in the afternoon and line for those was already several hours long.  I would suggest going to that building first when you arrive and doing tours/rest afterwards.  I did manage to make the climb up to top of the White Tower in the center to see a Norman church built there.  It was simple yet gorgeous and so worth the climb.Also make sure to buy your ticket from somewhere that gives you a skip the line option.  I don't think London Pass offers that.  I bought a voucher from travel stand outside tube station which I took straight to group tickets and got in quickly.  Several tour guides mention this place so check it out.  Also it was easy to reach via water taxi.  I took the Thames Clipper from Westminster Pier.  It was a lovely ride.Enjoy Your Trip!
"July 8, 2019","Fantastic, something for everyone!","Really, timing is everything. Just took our kids and it was an absolute zoo, but they loved it. We (my husband and I) have been during the Fall and Spring, and there were zero lines, so that is the hard part about summer vacation. However, there really is something for everyone and I think boys and girls of all ages will enjoy it! Note, we went earlier in the day and the lines were significantly even longer when we left for a late lunch. Eat on the tower side for lunch, we made the mistake of walking across the bridge after to look for lunch and avoid some of the crowd, but there weren’t nearly as many options."
"August 5, 2019",GIve yourself a full day,"Do not miss this, the Yeoman tour is fun and informative as are the other interactive tours. We didn't give ourselves enough time. To really get the most allow yourselves a full day. Andy was out Yeoman and he was brilliant, sorry Andy can't remember your last name. Can't recommend highly enough"
"August 5, 2019","Not a castle, but worth it!","London Tower is old. True! But apart from housing kings was also a prision and was built over the centuries. Dont expect a castle, BUT performers are all over the place telling the stories that happenned there. Walk around the wall and towers is cool. If you want to see the royal guards really close, this is the place. They are protecting the Royal Jewels that are exposed in this monument."
"August 4, 2019",Good History Lesson,Our family really enjoyed The Tower of London tour. There was a great deal of history to learn. The exhibits were well done. It paid off to get there early.
"August 3, 2019",Do the Yeoman Tour ,"We went just to see the Crown Jewels and ended up on the Yeoman tour.  Our guide was Scott Kelly, one of the youngest Beefeaters (#409) and by his own admission the most handsome. He was quite humorous (given the subject matter of The Tower) and knowledgeable.  Loved the tour and learning the history of The Tower. The grounds are easy to navigate as our the buildings. The ravens flying and squawking about are entertaining too."
"August 2, 2019",Come early,Come as early as you can and go all over the walls - so you can watch everything calmly. Next up - Crown Jewels. So in about 2 hours you will see everything before the arrival of the large masses of tourists.
"August 1, 2019",What a place!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when my wife told me we had to go here. Wow! I was impressed. Walking audio tour was great! Listening to the yeoman warders at various points throughout was great! My son got recruited into one of the skits they were doing, which you guessed it, was great! Royal Armoury was impressive. I would say the only thing that didn't blow me away was the crown jewels, but it was still good to see them. We spent probably 4 or 5 hours here and enjoyed all of it!"
"July 31, 2019",Amazing!!,Allow yourself a good 3 hours to visit the Tower of London.  It truly is a national treasure.  The tours and guides are amazing and there is so much history you will definitely learn a thing or two.  
"July 30, 2019",Worth a visit when in London but not for little children,"The title of the review is self explanatory. Let me put it this way. Do not take the children on the Beefeater tour (even though it is included in the entry ticket) for this place has one bloody history and the Beefeaters I suspect secretly enjoy recounting all that morbid history in graphic detail.  It seriously has one bloody history. It is therefore quite fitting that all the loot from the various nations including the Kohinoor from India and the Cullinan and the Star of Africa are displayed here in all its glory. As an aside, it definitely represents a very important part of the English history and is worth a visit."
"July 30, 2019",Must See!,"The Tower of London is a must see! You should plan on spending around 3 hours touring the grounds and plan for a lot of stairs if you want to see it all. Also, I highly recommend you getting there right when it opens as it get very busy in the afternoons and the line for the Crown Jewels can be extremely long. We went first thing in the morning and didn't have to wait at all!"
"July 29, 2019",An incredible look into history ,"As someone who likes attractions a bit more off the beaten path, I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed visiting. To avoid the crowds at the Crown Jewels we arrived about ten minutes before opening in the morning and were promptly let in. We got through without any line. The other parts of the Tower were fascinating and much less crowded as the day went on than the Crown Jewels (By mid morning the line to see them wrapped nearly around the whole courtyard!). There also appeared to be many family friendly aspects of the grounds as well. "
"July 23, 2019",It's Not a Tower,Just a bit of humor.  The Tower of London grounds is an interesting spot with a complex and varied history. It has been more than just a place where disfavored royals were imprisoned.  I recall watching The White Princess with young Edward V & his brother disappearing after being imprisoned by their Uncle. It was seriously moving (surprisingly so) when they pointed out the spot where a 150 or so years later workmen found the skeletons of two boys in a box under a staircase.
"July 23, 2019",A must visit ,"England is full of interesting history and the Tower of  London is a must visit. Viewing the crown jewels is worth the visit alone. And the tower bridge is right next to door, so include in your itinerary "
"July 23, 2019",Brilliant family day out,"Fun for all ages. We really enjoyed ourselves and you can take a picnic which helps cut down costs, Often do special kids events in holidays. We bought a Historical Royal Palaces card as one off payment gives access to other sites for a year and loved idea of popping into Tower to drool over Crown Jewels as often as we wanted. Watch out for queues in July and August and buy tickets online."
"July 22, 2019","Torture, Crown Jewels and More",A must see on a visit to London. Much more than a simple tower. It includes a medieval fortress that became the home to many an outlaw in their last days. It is currently the home of the Crown Jewels and their guardians.
"July 22, 2019",Crown Jewels the highlight.,"You can’t take pix of the Crown Jewels, but gotta love the bling. The Royal Guardsman were disciplined since it was hot as hell at the time, but they looked crisp."
"July 22, 2019",Great for London history ,TOL should be on the list for any history buff or first time visitor to London. Easy to get to and so much history. A great place to spend 2-4 hours. Lines are long during peak times.
"July 21, 2019",Booked the Yeoman Warders tour but explored the Tower on our own,"We were six people with four of them not having seen the Tower before. We booked the Yeoman Warder Tour but as you can see in the picture, several hundred London Tourists had the same idea, so we decided to explore the Tower and the Crown Jewels on our own."
"July 21, 2019",Tower of London is remarkable.  Historic.  ,If you are in London and you have never been to the TOL you must go!   It really brings all the history and stories of the Royalty of London to life.   Amazing preservation.    And you can also take a look at the crown jewels which not only shows  the jewels up close.  But also pictures of the Royal Family wearing the items.  Notes:   Buy tickets in advance.   And you must print them in advance.   They only take paper.  They do not accept electronic pdf.  Do the Beefeater tour.   The guides have great stories.  They are funny and it’s a great introduction to get started on your exploration.  The Crown Jewels que appears long but it moves along quite fast.  There is an ice cream booth next to the line.   So a good time for desert while waiting.   Wear shoes that will handle a lot of walking on cobblestones. They close at 530.  And last visitors let in at 5.   They are very strict of their rules.  Good luck and have fun!!

"July 21, 2019",U like history ?,Just love .. cant say anything more.. just love it..  well needed 100 words. SoIf are in london on vacation this need to be on the top of the list no mather what 🥰🥰🍺✈🤘🤘
"July 19, 2019",Insight into the mechanics,Thoroughly enjoyed this tour to witness the mechanics up close on the bridge's operational features. Excellent how incorporating modern features of glass floor above Thames to capture events below. One of the best gift souvenir shops we uncovered at the end of tour . Quick exit back to Hop on off bus tour stop. Worth the entry for sure
"June 25, 2019",Lousy cancellation plan.,"Tried to cancel one day ahead, no refunds. Travel companion was sick.  Lousy cancellation policy.  Out 100 pounds....."
"June 24, 2019",The White Tower and Crown Jewels were amazing,We arrived at 9:30 am on Sunday morning and waited in the group ticket line.  At 10 am they opened the ticket booths and the line moved quick.  They took our vouchers and gave us printed tickets.  The line to get into the tower gates was very long and it took another 25 minutes to get in.  Once in side you have to pay 5 pounds if you want audio guides.  We then waited another 20 minutes in another line for the crown jewels but it was worth it.  They were amazing to see and the flow of people moves well once inside.  The white tower was also amazing to see all the amour of past kings and other historical items.  The only thing we would do different is not go early in the morning since once we got outside the gates there we no lines any more.
"June 24, 2019",A great way to spend half a day!,"This was a very interesting place to visit. We took the free guided tour that was included in the price of our ticket and it was great! Our guide was funny and very passionate about his job! Learnt a lot about the history of the castle and heard some crazy stories. Would certainly recommend going to London Tower. Oh and make sure you go and see the Crown Jewels, they were unbelievable!"
"June 24, 2019",Great visit,"It was amazing to see the crown jewels!   The beefeaters were friendly and would answer any questions as well as allow pictures with them to be taken.  No pictures are allowed of the crown jewels, however can take plenty of the grounds and the guards and the beefeaters.  They had nice gift shops also.  There is a river cruise right about this also."
"June 23, 2019",Expensive and below average exhibitions ,"I bought my ticket online and was told to turn up at the ticket desk to collect it on the day, which was fine apart fromI waited for 15min in the ticket queue to be told to go to the group ticket office to collect (just put it on the sign!)The best advise I got on the day was from one of the Beefeaters at 9.45am who said join the queue to see the Crown Jewels as the queue gets very long. When I came out  it was 4 to 5 times the length as when I went in!The Beefeaters tours leave every half hour which is great but the size of the group is uncapped so you need good hearing to have a chance of understanding what they are saying.Apart from the Jewels and the Fusilier Museum the rest of the exhibits were below average. There are some great views of London from different aspects of the tower."
"June 23, 2019",Excellent,"Arrived just as it opened, long line even then. The Crown Jewels are here however it's a small collection and no photography allowed. It was interesting to see all the history. Glad we arrived early because it got very crowded when we left by 11am."
"June 23, 2019",Must see,"The Tower of London is a compound in the middle of London.  We took an early tour.  I highly recommend going early to avoid the crowds and see the beefeaters opening.  While the Crown Jewels section is small, it is very impressive.  This is the only section were pictures are not allowed.  There are multiple buildings to tour with paintings, weaponry, knights and some interactive games.  The ravens that live on property are very large. There are many things to see and plenty of photo opportunities."
"June 23, 2019",Favorite sight!,"This was one of our favorite sights in the UK!! So rich in history and so wonderfully preserved! We used the audio tour, which I would highly recommend unless you know your history very well! We learned alot and couldn't believe the collections of historical pieces here. Make sure you get there at least 30 minutes before opening and get your tickets ahead of time. Once inside, get your audio tour headphones and head directly to the crown jewels! If you wait, the queue will be VERY long. We saw the jewels without waiting and were finished quickly so we could spend the rest of our time in the other areas. Who wants to wait 2 hours in a queue?!"
"June 22, 2019",Annual family day out. The culture bit.,Bought tickets in advance. Was a beautiful day and thankfully no queuing to get in. Caught the tour for 11.30 with the beefeater. Far too many people gathered around to be able to hear. It needs to be kept in lower numbers. Beefeater Steve was  wet amusing when you could hear him. Halfway through wandered off a bit as just couldn’t make out what was being said. Lovely place to visit but needs more to control numbers do people benefit from the tours.
"June 22, 2019",Just ok,"Once you get it, find out how long the wait is to see the crown jewels. We originally were going to take a Beefeater tour but one of the Beefeaters told us it was only a 20 minutes wait to see the Jewels. So we skipped the tour and went to see the Jewels. Thank goodness. When we came out the line was a mile long. We then went back to the entrance and picked up a tour. Probably saved us two hours."
"July 8, 2019",Must See,This Building justifies the accolades it receives.Visited this building some years ago but the present layout of the exhibition areas is much better.Stayed in Citizen M hotel opposite therefore visited early & avoided the queues.Did Not do the Audio Tour.Beefeater talks worth listening to.View from Bedroom
"July 8, 2019",Must see if in London,"The Tower of London is a must!  We spent more than 4 hours exploring and still missed a couple of towers. The “Beefeaters” introduction is excellent. I would strongly recommend the audio tour.  The history is fantastic!  The Crown Jewels are spectacular!  If you only have time to visit a couple of sites while in London, I would make this the number one place to see."
"July 8, 2019",Tower IceCream,The Tower of London is well worth a visit - the queue can be long to get in but they process admissions pretty quickly.  You get a map of the entire layout and can go whereever you choose.  The Crown Jewels are absolutely amazing and so is the phenomenal array of Gold and China tableware.  The history is really interesting and the IceCream is delicious!!
"July 7, 2019",Loved the Tower - Hated the Lines!,"First the good.  Our family really enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London.  There is a ton to see and a great deal of history within the walls.  We went just after opening and immediately went to see the Crown Jewels and had only a 10-15 minute wait to get in.  We went on the Beefeater Tour and our guide was excellent.  Funny, informative and good for both adults and kids.  We only had about 3 hours and could have used another hour to really see everything.  Definitely a must visit sight for anyone coming to London.The bad.  This ticket does NOT allow you to bypass the entrance line.  It ONLY allows you to bypass the ticket line.  When we got there the ticket lines were not that long and I'm not sure that this really had any value to us.  The line to enter the Tower was probably 1/3 of a mile long.  My wife and son got in line as soon as we arrived while my daughter and I got in line to get our tickets.  By the time we got our tickets (20-30 minutes) they were almost to the entrance and then we got right in.  It might have been that we were there when the Tower opened.  The lines to enter did not seem quite as bad when we left in the early afternoon.  Also, the Beefeater Tour is great but its not a private tour.  Our tour had around 50-60 people.  The guide managed it all very well and made sure we all could see and hear him but don't think you're getting a special tour with this ticket.  Overall, everyone should visit the Tower of London.  It's a fantastic part of London's history.  But be prepared for long lines and be aware of what this ticket is and is not."
"July 6, 2019",Too crowded,"It was so below my expectations. The truth is what you see outside is what you get because its basically empty and way too crowded. Crown jewels and armor room are probably the best. Maybe I should have waited for the yeoman warder tour, because If you go on your own practically you dont get a clue of what the tower really was"
"July 2, 2019",The Tower of London,"This was my number 1 on the list for London and it did not disappoint. From the Crown Jewels. The Beefeaters, the ravens, the history of the place, it was wonderful. Do not miss this if you are going to London."
"July 2, 2019",Very Interesting!,There was so much to see it took the better part of the day so don't rush through.  And don't miss the Crown Jewels even if the line is long!  Jaw dropping!  
"July 2, 2019",Was I tired of museums?,Perhaps I was tired of museums and audio guides but I didn’t enjoy the Tower of London as much as I thought I might. This tour might be great for medieval history buffs or royal watchers with a fascination for the Crown Jewels but it didn’t grab my attention. 
"June 29, 2019",Landmark heavy on history,"The waiting lines may seem scary but they move rather quickly, just make sure you are waiting in the right one because the staff is not very helpful. Walking in this place you can feel the history, although I do feel they could have made a better presentation out of it. Wear comfortable shoes."
"June 26, 2019",History brought to Life,"A wonderful experience especially if part of a presentation by The Yeomen Warders. They bring the history, past and present, to life with their knowledge, devotion to duty and respect for those who have been and still part of history. "
"June 20, 2019",Brilliant trip - do not miss the Tower of London,"First off, don’t do it if you are thinking of skipping the Tower of London for _____ instead. It’s a wonderful combination of history, architecture, theater, drama, ravens, jewels, and armor. Main tip for going is to get there early! Start off with a coffee from a nearby shop and stand in line 15 minutes before opening. Once in, nab an audio tour and head quickly to the Crown Jewels exhibit. Do not get distracted on the way - zoom for the jewels exhibit and then take your time once in. 30 minutes after opening the wait for the jewels is long. An hour after opening and you might be in line for another hour.After that time it so you get the Beefeater tour. Drama, humor, and history done right. You can stroll the grounds and hit up the armory to your hearts content from there."
"June 20, 2019",Historic trip and fun for the whole family,"I visited with a friend and we had a great experience. Give yourself at least 2-3 hours to comfortably see all of the exhibits, the crown jewels, the museum, and time to explore the grounds on your own."
"June 19, 2019",A lot to see.,"Been there with a pre teen ans youngest. A lot to see. Nicely packaged in a comparably small place. A lot of history that can be seen but not really experienced. I'd call it a museum of a different kind. The crown Juwels are for sure the highlight. We've been outside of travel season and still had to line up for 20 min to get in. Almost no photography allowed anywhere. Very good because it's easy to navigate, decent restrooms and both river and tower bridge are close."
"June 19, 2019",Walked the London Bridge ,Popular tourist stop and a very neat walk across the bridge and constant traffic crossing Stood on both sides of the bridge and looked out over the water Tons of entertainment on either side of the bridge and during the day you can tourThe bridge doesn’t open like it perhaps once did for boats but apparently they need over a day of planning to make it happen 
"June 19, 2019",Loved it!,What an amazing place. We took the tour given by the Warders. What a great tour. Then we followed the map and seen everything. What a phenomenal palace! The Crown Jewels are a absolute must see. The line looks long but it goes very fast! Then we went to take a peek at the Ravens. I loved them! So much to do and see inside there!
"June 19, 2019",Our capital city’s greatest attraction,"Took the whole family to the Tower as part of my son’s 40th birthday celebration.   We had a great time as we had not visited for 28 years, a previous birthday.   The yeoman that did our tour of the tower , Jim,  was absolutely fantastic and made it funny and interesting.    The only downside for me was that as I was paying for eight it was pricey and they offer their prices with a donation which you do not have to do and I think it should be the other way round.   I personally did the 2 for 1 offer that you get when travelling by rail but you must print the vouchers and have your rail ticket, but it is by far the cheapest way.  Do your maths.   It’s a must do for a visitor to London.  Would have given it 5 stars but I found the pricing with the donation foremost very annoying."
"June 18, 2019",Awesome ,Super interesting place with tons of history. Seeing the beefeaters walking around as well as the palace guards was very cool. The highlight of the day were the crown jewels. They are some of the most amazing pieces of jewelry and diamonds I have ever seen. If you go to London you must go and see the crown jewels. It is interesting to see several billion dollars worth of jewelry in one place. The one negative is that you cannot take pictures once you are inside. I understand why but it would’ve been really cool to have pictures of such beautiful and historic jewelry.  The grounds are wonderfully kept as well. A definite must see.
"June 18, 2019",History,Beautiful felt like I was travelling  back in time. Historical and informative.The queen Victoria and king George exhibition tour was very interesting  learned a lot.
"June 17, 2019",Lots to see but in very palatable chunks. Make sure to go on a sunny day or your tour may be cancelled.,"From the Tower's Ravens to the many floors of historical collections, the Tower has much to see. The Museum exhibits are laid out in a way that you can take in as much or as little as you'd like - most of the various attractions within the tower save for the collections in the White Tower (or perhaps the lines for the crown jewels) won't take you too long to get through (unlike, for example, Windsor Castle - which you won't get much out at all of in less than 3 hours). Unfortunately the day we went it started raining five minutes into the tour and the guide cancelled the tour, much to the disappointment of the fifty or so guests in the tour Our guide said something about their costumes not getting wet or too many umbrellas to see the guide. As a result, we ended up exploring the Tower ourselves but still weren't overall disappointed in the attraction."
"June 16, 2019",Very Cool,"Very glad we visited the Tower.   They offer guided tours given by a Beefeater, the talks are funny and informative.  Check the schedule when you get there it it worth it and is included in your admission.  We did the audio tour as well ( separate fee) but the Beefeater tour was much better.   The crown jewels are a must see while you are there but it can get a bit crowded.  You can spend more time there than you think, give yourself plenty of time.  Great views of Tower Bridge from the Tower Courtyard.  "
"June 22, 2019",Absolutely fantastic! ,"Went with my two boys ages 3 & 6, & they both LOVED it! Friendly employees all around. There was a very kind gentleman who sat in an information booth around the middle of the grounds and gave my boys each a cute little button that said “I escaped the tower” (or something very close to that). So cute! And they thought they were hot stuff! There are also great views of The Shard and Tower Bridge from within & you can skip the ticket line with your London Pass. This was my absolute favorite thing in London!!! "
"June 21, 2019",Tower of London,Great place! Ideally you’ll need at least two hours at the tower... if I had the time I wild have stayed longer. The history is fascinating!
"June 21, 2019",This place worth to visit,"I been in London many times. This time finally decide visit Tower of London as well. I really saticfy with time I spent there. Very good was 45 min tour with guide. Guide was very professional, told many interesting facts about the history. After this guide tour we took time to look around our own and buildings, exebithions were more interesting. I honestly recomend to start visit of tower with this guide tour."
"June 21, 2019",So much amazing history!!,"I read many travel blogs in preparation for our visit to Tower of London, most of which said to plan to spend 3 hours or so. I felt like we could have planned an entire day! We arrived on a Sunday morning at 9:15am and were within the first 30 or so people in line, which quickly grew to hundreds. Upon entry, we went straight to the Crown Jewels, then doubled back for the Yeoman Warder guided tour. I do not remember his name, but he was fantastic! We will visit again on our next trip to London and plan to spend an entire day here. "
"June 21, 2019",What fun!,"This is a must see! So much happened here and so much is housed here. If you love British history, this is a great place to visit The guides are great and very informative and friendly."
"June 21, 2019",Vacation ,EXTREMELY crowded. Lots of school tours and bus company tours and all day we felt like we were being rushed. I would suggest low peak times.
"June 20, 2019",Absolutely fabulous ,"Worth the time. But get there early and see the crown jewels first. Then tour the rest. The audio tour was good, but if you can make time for the yarders tour. "
"June 20, 2019",Ravens everywhere,We had a lot of fun exploring this wonder.  We bought the London Pass and had front of the line access in the morning when we visited.  There are entertaining guided tours... but also fun to walk around and explore.
"June 20, 2019",Lots of stairs but worth the trip ,Don’t do this if you have poor mobility. There is a lot of walking up/down stairs. But the history is worth checking out as well as the Crown Jewels.
"June 20, 2019",All that it's built up to be...if you take the beefeater tour,"Everyone goes to see this, so you know it's a must-see. Allow at least 3-4 hours. We never got to see the crown jewels - perpetually a 1+hour wait in line... even at 4:45pm when they are nearing closure. Make sure to get there in time for a beefeater tour -- last one in the summer is 3:30pm, 2:30pm winter... and it MAKES the visit. They are so entertaining and knowledgeable!"
"June 16, 2019",Amazing,"I loved the beefeater's tour. If you are not that much into history, this tour will bring everything into place. The jewels are really once in a lifetime."
"June 16, 2019",So much to explore.,Definitely worth the admission fee. So much to see and explore. Don't miss out the crown jewels hall. So amazing!
"June 16, 2019",Must see,"Unfortunately we didn’t have enough time to do it properly. Bought tickets on Viator, go straight to group tickets counter. Definitely on the must see. I would go first thing in the morning and go straight to see the Crown Jewels and then do a Beefeeter tour (unfortunately we didn’t have time). Isn’t well suited for those with limited mobility "
"June 16, 2019",Great Day Out!,"We arrived fifteen minutes after it opened and went straight to see the Crown Jewels with no queues. Later in the day, the queue was massive! We enjoyed a tour with a Yeoman Warder and then set off to explore the rest of the castle. The chapel of St Peter ad Vincula was fascinating, then the wonderful displays of armour in the White Tower including the stunning chapel of St John the Evangelist. We loved the fun activities on the top floor where you could dress Henry VIII in his armour, shoot a bow & arrow, practise sword skills on horseback etc. Great fun!There is a display about imprisonment in the Beauchamp Tower, the tale of the two boy princes in the Bloody Tower, an exhibition on torture, the Fusilier Museum, the medieval palace and the battlements. While walking the wall, we passed through other towers with exhibitions of jewel-less crowns, the animals who lived at the tower, defence etc. Visiting the ravens was also very interesting. The New Armouries café was very nice for a simple lunch and had a generous military discount if you serve in the forces. There’s also a discount on entry for military, but not for anyone else so I ordered my ticket online in advance to save money while my husband bought his in person on the day to get his discount. We spent over five hours exploring and absolutely loved it. The toilets behind the Crown Jewels were the best loos, by the way! "
"June 16, 2019",Plan to spend the day,"There is so much to see, plan to spend the day, or at least several hours. Avoid weekends, seriously crowded"
"June 15, 2019",American mom and 12 year old son,Entertaining visit. Lots to see and set up so you climb stairs for different towers.  Good activity for my tween. Ate fish and chips outside the entrance. Tasty and quick for my son. We split one order and it was plenty. Catch the line for the  Crown Jewels early. It gets longer as the day progresses. 
"June 15, 2019",Europe 2019,"This was a definite must. It was only a 2 minute walk from our hotel and our daughter enjoyed this immensely. Two tips are to check the lines early...they can get very long very fast. Once inside, find your way to the Crown Jewels exhibit first, before the lines there get long..We got in almost immediately, but within 30-45 minutes of our finishing the line was an hour to get into this part of the location. Take your time and plan at least a half a day for this location. definitely worth the time."
"June 15, 2019",Great historic site,"Really enjoyed our visit, the displays of the knight armor in the White Tower are excellent. The Crown Jewels of course were stunning. (You can circle back in the room and view the Crown Jewels as many times as you’d like). We visited on Wednesday this week on a rainy overcast day so the wait for the Crown Jewels was under 15 minutes. View of the Tower Bridge from there are also beautiful. I would skip the free “Beefeater Tour” if it’s raining, since they bring you into the church instead of walking around and showing you the various buildings. Also loved that the guards were in their red uniforms and bearskin hats outside of the Crown Jewels building. (When we arrived they were in the grey uniforms.)"
"June 15, 2019","Amazing jewels, armor,  and the sovereign's relics.","My favorite part of our trip. Huge diamonds,  crowns, and suits of armor. Swords that fascinated our boys.  Steep stairs, ancient rooms.  Really great way to learn and experience history. "
"June 14, 2019",History Comes Alive,"We spent hours here and it's worth the price. There is so much British history in the walls and it is great to walk around and take it all in. The crown jewels are really interesting to see, but I recommend getting in line earlier in the day as the line gets longer later. There are plenty of exhibits about the various history and families in the castle. Some of the exhibits are updated and some are definitely older. You'll spend about three hours here taking it all in."
"June 5, 2019",The Crown Jewels,We visited Tower of London on a Tuesday and the crowds weren't to bad....there were quiet a few schools there on field trips.  You can spend a lot of time here going into each room.  We were on a bit of a time limit so we hit the highlights...including The Crown Jewels.  This exhibit is absolutely amazing!
"June 5, 2019",Nice Tower ,Get there early and it is worth it. We went at 930 on Saturday and it was wonderful. The dungeons are fun and the walk around the tower wall is neat. You go up some cool stairscases and see some interesting things. I enjoyed it. The crown jewels are pretty spectacular.  When we walked out around 1130 and it was a madhouse. I don't think it would have been much fun. 
"June 4, 2019",Lots of visitors on a Sunday,"Looooong line on Sunday for tickets and to enter. Once inside, go directly to the Crown Jewels or else you will end up in another looooong line as everyone ends up there. The Crown Jewels are amazing and worth the visit! The Beefeaters did some talks aroung the grounds but were hard for us to understand. Also, some people dressed in period costumes did talks as well, but were also difficult for us to hear and understand. We probably needed more time talking to folks in pubs to decipher the lingo."
"June 4, 2019",Family visit,"The first time I had ever done this tour. Went with my wife and grown up kids. What a fantastic experience. So interesting. Lots to see and learn, but the highlight for me had to be the beefeater tour. Absolutely hilarious. These guys made for a fantastic day. Would recommend to anyone."
"June 3, 2019",Yeoman tour educational and entertaining,"Purchased tickets online so entering was easy. Arrived prior to opening and entered in first wave of visitors, headed directly to Crown Jewels and walked right in. Took the tour with Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly, who was a wonderful guide. My teens and pre-teen thoroughly enjoyed the tour."
"June 3, 2019",What can you say about the Crown Jewels,"While the Crown Jewels are a highlight, getting a feel for how it was built and used throughout history was very enlightening.  A place that should be seen during a trip to London"
"June 3, 2019",Ye olde England,"It is difficult not to game of thrones and Vikings everything but what a gory past we have had. The armoury, the ravens and the Crown of Jewels all lead to another time. As the cannons were going off for Trump and his visit, we pondered the cruelty of the human race and if anything has actually changed. Amazing upkeep of this place and orderly way of navigation. Queues were too long for the Crown jewels though. Actors in full regalia. Just fabulous"
"June 3, 2019",Do Not Book with Tiqets online Company!!!!,"We bought tickets online & just as we were leaving the house our 11 year old started projectile vomiting!!! We rang the online company & they refused to refund or even exchange tickets for another day!!! So daylight robbery, terrible customer service and DO NOT use this company! The lady on the phone was rude & unhelpful!!! "
"June 3, 2019",Wouldn't Go Back,"The good: The beefeater walking tour was awesome! We got Beefeater Bill and he was informative, charming with an awesome sense of humor, probably the best tour guide I've had all my life. The bad: There are lots of lines to be on, you're in long lines for hours and you can only move one step at time. There's no getting out of it and the entire thing is quite claustrophobic. The line to see a replica of the crown jewels is at least an hour long, the other attractions are not that much better. It's like being in the Disneyland for history. Not my idea of a good time.At least it offers a pretty good view of Tower Bridge so there's the saving grace."
"June 2, 2019",Family Trip,"The tower is awesome. Heaps to see- even in the rain! The Crown Jewels however was a very long queue, but still worth seeing. All great stuff. The headphone and Yeoman Wardens are both great tours!"
"June 11, 2019",Loved it!,"We all enjoyed touring the Tower of London.  It was one of my daughter’s favorite sites we visited.  We also had a child in a stroller, and while it was possible to see most everything, the stroller definitely made it more difficult.  "
"June 10, 2019",Majestic,There a couple of tours in the tour which is a good way to learn the history of the place though they don't take you around as much. Explore by yourself and follow the map given with the entrance ticket. The white tour with Armoury is amazing. The crown jewels are absolutely dazzling and worth the wait (queue waiting time upto 1 hour sometimes). Walk along the ramparts all round the tower and you can enjoy good views of the tower bridge and the city sights. It takes about 4 hours all in so plan a trip with plenty of time. 
"June 10, 2019",Jovial and Fun Yeoman Guide,We had an excellent yeoman guide. I cannot remember his name. He was jovial and gave interesting snippets of history. He has a loud booming voice. No microphone is needed.
"June 14, 2019",A must see,"The guide staff are first rate! They have to meet many requirements in order to hold that position of honor to be a guide.Much to see with a lot of history, character and ghosts a plenty. Family jewels are here, but a bit underwhelming as you’re on a slow moving conveyor belt, so impossible to just stare and soak ii in."
"June 14, 2019",Great History,I've been here a few times now and love visiting. Tons of history and the Yeoman Warders do a great job telling the talea. This time was with John and he did an excellent job of telling the tales and moving our large group along. 
"June 13, 2019",Be there early. It’s worth it,We had booked the tickets online beforehand. Thus we good go into the Tower shortly after the official opening. We went to the Crown Jewels right away and could get in within 5 minutes. Thus we had plenty of time to everything extensively. Great experience!
"June 10, 2019",Castles and Crowns ,"Where else can you see nearly 1 thousand year old towers and the most beautiful cache of royal jewels, treasures, knight amour, swords and weapons?Highly recommend early tour to gain first entrance and avoid all the lines- visit the fearless raven who literally will get close enough to you to take a selfie with you."
"June 10, 2019",Amazing,"Very educational, especially for people who don’t know much about British history, you don’t even need a tour or audio guide. Unfortunately it’s very busy, mostly with American tourists who don’t want to nor care about reading about the tower or considerate of others who are, also many loud school children. Get in early for the crown jewels, line today was almost to traitors gate, and was raining quite heavily. A lot of the museum is outdoors, umbrellas and jackets necessary."
"June 10, 2019",The Yeoman Warder's are a Hoot!,"Great tour of a millennia old castle complex with a very rich history (and needless to say, it's a bloody - and not in a UK expletive sort of way).  The Yeoman Warder guides (who are actual service members) are most excellent - funny and with a wealth of knowledge, but don't cross them or they will make sure you behave properly - as a bunch of not so hapless tourists messing around with the Queen's Guard in front of the Jewel House soon found out!  Well deserved."
"June 9, 2019",Must see!,"We loved the Tower of London! We didn't buy the audio guide, but the way the complex is laid out, it is very easy to do a self-guided tour. We spent at least 2 hours looking at all of the exhibits and going in the buildings. Since I had bought the tickets online prior to going to England, we avoided waiting in line at the ticket booth. The Tube station is conveniently located across the street."
"June 9, 2019",Tower tour,Definitely try to get in on the tour with the Yeoman Warder (Beefeater)! Wealth of knowledge and humorous insights. Plenty to keep everyone interested and there are fairly good restaurants just off the river afterwards. 
"June 9, 2019",The only.1 ,Awesome one of the best day trips you can do anywhere in the world.Come see my city and enjoy the English culture .
"June 9, 2019",Fantastic History!!!,The Tower Of London is amazing if you are a lover of history.  Make sure you take a tour with one of the Beefeaters!  They grant you access to places you otherwise can’t go.  They are also so informative!  Incredibly interesting place!  Plus you get to see the Crown Jewels!  Amazing!
"June 12, 2019",See Crown Jewels early!,"We entered just after the Tower opened and took the first guided tour. Our Yeoman warder guide was great! We split just before the end of the tour and walked in to see the Crown Jewels. It was about 1030 when we entered the building and we had no wait. By the time we left the Tower around 1230, the line was well beyond the sign marking a 45 minute wait."
"June 12, 2019",A must visit location,"You cannot come to London and not visit the tower. Full of history, you can really get a feel for how the place was used in times gone by. Even if you are not really into it, you HAVE to see the Crown Jewels. The exhibition they have created as you go in is great - just get there early or be prepared to wait in line"
"June 12, 2019",Must see for the London visitor,"Before entering , take the walk around the Tower perimiter (about a mile) .It has historic plaques all along the route to give you the history oft the view of what you are looking at from a variety of angles .Then you are ready Togo in ...not cheap and it will be crowded ! ...but well worthwhile ."
"June 11, 2019",Interesting & old. ,Was a very interesting place.  Was glad we did it.  Learned a lot about the history.   Each part was fascinating 
"June 11, 2019",Great place to see!,Very interesting history attached to it and the crown jewels are cool! Go in the morning before it gets too crowded.
"June 11, 2019",Just. Wow. ,"Plan to spend the day. Really. I took the advise of another reviewer and we bought food at the Pret before entering. Once you go in, you can't leave and return again. There is so much history here! Do not miss the Beefeaters' tour. I wouldn't bother with a private tour, it doesn't seem worth it. this is not the place for you if you have mobility issues. Uneven surfaces, stairs, and the tours go at a good clip!"
"June 11, 2019",Fantastic tour and guide,"Recommend you take one of the guided tours, I think the last one is about 15:30. Well worth it, the guide was very entertaining and informative."
"May 29, 2019",Visiting here was lovely,"Start with purchasing tickets in advance. Take the tour with a guide, then explore all there is available. Some queues were long, but moved at a steady pace. Stairs can be tricky, just take your time. The Crown Jewels are breath-taking."
"May 29, 2019", Fascinating history inside those walls ,"The tower was what I expected.  Eerie, yet grand.  The Crown Jewels were as excessive and glitzy as the royal monarchy. "
"May 28, 2019",Amazing to see,By far one of the highlights of my trip. The Crown Jewels are something everyone should see. Amazing! The grounds are beautiful too. Well worth the time to tour it.
"May 28, 2019",Wonderful Time!,We had a fabulous time at the Tower!  Especially enjoyed the yeoman Warder tour— a very entertaining way to see the Tower and learn its history!  Lots for everyone in the family to see and do! 
"May 28, 2019",Must see historic site,"The Tower of London is probably the single most must see historical site in London. Centuries of history in one place. The crown jewels are kept here and the entertaining beef eater tour is very entertaining. So much to see here, so allow at least half a day."
"May 28, 2019",Awesome Tower of London,"So fun with all the guards, artifacts, cannons and crows. Had a good lunch at the restaurant. The many suits of armour were cool."
"May 27, 2019","History at its finest, worts and all! ","Great place to visit, so much history. Worth doing the tour £54 for a guided tour that takes around 1 hour & 1/2.  Definitely a must see whilst in London. "
"May 27, 2019",Fabulous,"We went in winter and it was the best, so few crowds and lots of hsiotory. Smalller than I remember but easy to navigate and see it all"
"May 27, 2019",Study Abroad,The Tower of London was absolutely beautiful! I would recommend going to see this historical monument to everyone. We witnessed the changing of the guards as well as seeing the Crown Jewels. The measures taken to ensure all were able to see everything was phenomenal.
"May 26, 2019",Almost a Thousand Years of History,"The ""Tower"" is almost indescribable. Today, it is surrounded by much larger buildings and the modern city; in the beginning, about 1066, it would have been, by far, the largest and tallest structure in the area. Even today it has a magical quality about it, looking unlike anything else you have ever seen.The history of the place is essentially the history of England. It has served as a royal palace, fortress, prison, and now, a tourist attraction. The buildings exude an ancient quality, with signs about to help you understand its great age. It is both beautiful and forbidding. My husband and I took a self-guided tour, which was perhaps not the best decision; if I had it to do again, I would go on a guided tour. I was primarily interested in the Tower's history, and therefore I enjoyed seeing the battlements, private rooms, armor collection, ravens, etc. We chose not to see the dungeons and instruments of torture; others might find them of interest.Separately, the Crown Jewels are truly amazing. I think it is best to view them in the context of the times from which each piece comes. They really are not to be viewed as objects of monetary value, but rather, as symbols of a ""time past"", with all the inherent historical baggage of the times. I believe that they give a better idea of the royal lines of England than anything else one might see in London. I believe you will be enlightened in every way by viewing them, and they should not be missed.The lines are long; everyone wants to see the ""Tower"". You will likely need three hours or more; just relax and soak it all in. After all, this is why you came to London in the first place, right?"
"June 8, 2019",London Tower,"A must see in London, the history is phenominal and the crown jewels and other items were breathtaking."
"June 8, 2019",One of my favorite tours in London,"The tower was fantastic. Definitely go on the Beefeater tour when you arrive. Very informative, and funny as well. The crown jewels can't be missed. So many interesting things to see. "
"June 7, 2019",History come alive ,Historic royal palaces really do go above and beyond to bring history alive. Their actors and guides are second to known with a rich knowledge of the spaces. 
"June 7, 2019",Good historical place,I only have one complaint. We bought our tickets on the golden bus tour hop on and off. We weren’t told we needed to exchange our receipt for a ticket. Would make it easier for visitors if they would just take that receipt at the door instead of making you exchange it. Enjoyed seeing the Crown Jewels.
"June 7, 2019",Icon of London you had to visit,This and the tower bridge are two of the best known landmarks in London. The 22 pounds it cost to visit was well worth it. You could spend the whole day there - although an hour of that time would be spent queuing up to see the amazing crown jewels! There are a lot of tourists there! The queue was about half a kilometre long the whole time we were there. But all in all a must see . There is also plenty of other historical things to see and the beefeaters tell a very good yarn.
"June 6, 2019",Tower of London,Loved this! Have been to London several times and never did this. Went early and headed for crowned jewels first before a line. Then went back to the front to join in on a free tour. That was awesome! So informative!  Really enjoyed this - five stars!!
"June 6, 2019",London’s Best Historical Site,"With its origins dating back to the 11th century and William the Conqueror, this place has seen a lot. Infamous for its executions and famous for its guarding of the Crown Jewels, the highlight for me was the walk around/through the garrisons. There you learned what life (and death) was like for this who lived, worked, and died there. Tip: I suggest you A) Buy your tickets in advanceB) Line up 30 mins before it opensC) Enter and go straight to the Crown Jewels. We walked right through with no crowd or line. Huge queues later in the day. D) Join a beefeater tour. These official guards are great guides. They share a 45 minute history of the Tower in a humorous and fun way. E) Explore the White Tower and walk along/through the garrisons. "
"June 6, 2019",A Must See,Very entertaining with a lot to see and learn about.  Really much of London's history starts here and allow a couple of hours.
"June 6, 2019",Lots to see,"Bought tickets online and picked up at will call - pretty easy process.  The line was super long when they first opened - we came back a few hours later and there was no line.  This was a really cool place to tour , so much to see.  They had people dressed in timely outfits and engaging in scenes - it was cool So much history and cool architecture.  There wasn’t a line to get in but once inside there is another line to see the Crown Jewels - that was insanely long. Decided not to wait in that since our time was limited in London.  Even without seeing those it was well worth the tour.  They do have a room with previous crowns with the jewels removed and those were pretty cool to see too.  You could go through the whole thing pretty quickly or spend hours there.  "
"June 5, 2019",Great spot,"Lovely spot to get some pictures and stroll along the river. You can get drinks to go and take your time enjoying all of the scenery around, just beautiful!"
"May 21, 2019",Gorgeous,Lots to walk through but its definitely worth the walk. There is so much history and so much to learn you could not get enough. Must not leave London without visiting!
"May 20, 2019",Beefeaters Tour,Highly recommend the free tour given by the Beefeaters informative and very informative. The Crown Jewels were interesting
"May 19, 2019",Day at the Tower,"Wonderful interesting place. Crown jewels, beefeaters & ravens. Give yourself a good 2-3 hours here-fascinating!"
"May 19, 2019",Tower of London,"Both kids (13 & 6) enjoyed this stop as part of a day tour. Crown Jewels, overly friendly ravens and a great view of the Tower Bridge were some highlights."
"May 19, 2019","Spent hours, could have spent days!","Words struggle to describe the history contained within the walls of the Tower of London, from the Crown Jewels, suits of armour and touture rooms. If you visit London you must visit the Tower."
"May 18, 2019",Interesting history,"We got tickets here through the concierge and were able to do the group tour with the Yeoman Warders. He was hilarious and you learn about so much history right where you are standing! The tour was an hour, but then you could go off on your own. I liked seeing the jewels, and the Royal Chapel. It is very interesting, but a little of a downer when you hear all that went on there. Would still recommend! There is a lot of food and vendors near by. It is all mostly outside though so dress warm! There are also guards inside, and the bridge is right around the corner. "
"May 18, 2019",A must,"If you go do not pass up the opportunity to take the FREE Beefeaters tour.  You won’t regret it.  They bring to life the history of the Tower of London.  After the tour we visited the Crown Jewels.  Guess we were lucky, because I read so many say there is such a long line.  We walked right to the doors and through mid day."
"May 16, 2019",Exceptional Tour at Tower of London and Crown Jewels,"This is a must see while in London.  You can make this a destination and actually visit via the bus tours that allow you to hop on/off at sights.  See history, let your jaw drop when you see the Crown Jewels..WOW."
"May 16, 2019",So much to see!,We went expecting to see the Crown Jewels but were able to experience much more.  Head to the the Crown Jewels upon arrival as the line will get long as the morning go by.  We enjoyed all the the Tower of London had to offer.
"May 16, 2019",Fascinating look at the home of British Royalty since 1066,"The Tower of London was a must-see visit for this former English Literature teacher. To walk where William the Conqueror walked was quite a thrill. To see the spot where Anne Boleyn lost her head was beyond my wildest dreams. Of course the Crown Jewels were impressive, as were all the suits of armor on display.  Simply walking the walls next to the Thames made for a wonderful experience. "
"June 2, 2019",Awesome ,Lots of tourist but it was awesome. Lots to see. Lot of walking. Lot of history. We loved the being there for several hours. 
"June 2, 2019","Amazing, great for any age ! London must-do","Second time here, simply amazing ! I don’t know how people visit here without doing the Yeoman (Beefeater) free tour. It’s informative, entertaining and memorable. This should be a must do when visiting the Tower. Be aware that holiday periods will attract long queues, especially for the Crown Jewels, we waited an hour to get in.  Nearest Tube is Tower Hill. This is a must do in London. Don’t miss it."
"June 2, 2019",Poor execution,"Was such a shame we paid 60 pound for two adults and didn’t even get to see the crown jeweles because the line was just too long. I think there is a missed opportunity at this place, there is just so much to see but so poorly executed. "
"June 2, 2019",Patience,Long lines may test your patience but the displays are worth it. The longest wait was for the crown jewels... but then I was able to view them 4 times as crowd thinned out inside. The yeoman warden tour was a hoot! 
"June 1, 2019",Fortress with glorious past,"The Tower of London was part of the places we planned to visit in London and turned out to be an excellent choice.We paid 31£ (5£ was the donation) and followed a Yeoman Warder which guided us in the Tower.Place of imprisonment and murders shows that kings and Princess have also hard lives.The Imperial State,The Chapel of St John Evangelist,The bloody Tower ,The Royal Armouries are few parts that worth to be visited.We needed about 4 hours to see it all."
"June 1, 2019",Tour worth your time & overall a must-visit if in London,"Like everyone says - the ""beefeater"" or Yeoman Warders tour is really worth your time.  The guides are actual Yeoman Warders - or guarders of the Queen - a very high honor within the Royal Military.  The YW live in the Tower of London - in a flat - and really have a passion for the history of the TOL.There is a lot to explore here, from the Crown Jewels to the war museum - we spent a little over 3 hours here touring around.  I would recommend getting the ""membership"" - it's ~82 pounds for a joint membership.  By visiting just the Kensington Palace and the TOL, it pays for itself.  Plus you get access to a few other Palaces around London (accessible by train/tube) and the Banqueting House."
"May 30, 2019",Tower of London visit,"It had been thirty years since my last visit here, so not much had changed...but my husband had not been.I loved the history story’s told by the Yeoman guard, but he did tend to waffle on a bit about the football too much!Once we toured the other parts of the museum, the line was too long to see the Crown Jewels and as it was raining quite heavily, we missed out on that part...a little disappointing actually!It is quite expensive, you think they would have worked out a better system to get to see the Jewels when it’s school holidays?"
"May 30, 2019",It didn’t disappoint ,"It’s the Crown Jewels, what else can I say? It’s a lot to see and there it also a lot of information available about the jewelry. There is lots about prisoners that have been in the Tower of London and the torture devices and how the devices where used. "
"May 29, 2019",Tower of London tour,Thoroughly enjoyed the Beefeater tour at the tower today led by Scott Kelly!! Very knowledgeable and entertaining.  The jewels were stunning and the grounds were pristine!! Such a fun and memorable day.
"May 29, 2019",One of my favorite places to visit,"I've been to the Tower a few times, and it never gets old! You simply must take one of the free guided tours. The guides are not only knowledgeable but are humorous as well. You will walk the same paths that so many famous historical figures walked. From the dungeons to medieval weapons and armor, to the crown jewels, you will see some awesome things on exhibit."
"May 8, 2019",This place was BREATHTAKING,"Everything I saw and experienced was better than expected: from walking around ancient bedrooms to visiting Anne Boleyn's resting place. But the Beefeater Tour was definitely the best of all! As a solo traveler I like to stroll around historical places and learn about how they were built, by whom, and its significance. Plus, the beefeaters have great sense of humor! Allow yourself 2-3 hours to visit all the buildings (especially the Crown Jewels, if you like big shiny diamonds worth more than your house) and take a late lunch at the café (which has food samples from famous markets around London). After you finish, you can admire Tower Bridge which is a very short walk away and take amazing pictures."
"May 7, 2019",Such history,What an amazing place so much to see the ravens really amazed me they decided to steal a young child’s lunch box from a school tour and literally open it and pull the lunch out ...very funny they are so smart. There are so many sections to see it will take a good 4-5 hours 
"May 7, 2019",Beautiful Colors of the Rainbow,"The crown jewels were so impressive, a true sight to behold.  You could just reach out to touch them, but Lord help you if you did.  So much security.  A woman's dream come true."
"May 7, 2019",Loved the Yeoman tour - lots to see!,"Really great experience - thought it was a bit pricey going in, but there’s so much there to experience, I came out feeling it was well worth it! The Tower of London remains a functional barracks to this day, and whilst tourists enjoy the grounds and the jewels well, it was wonderful to both interact with the highly knowledgeable Yeoman and see active soldiers on duty. The exhibits are all fascinating, and it’s quite the bastion of English history, with wonderfully creeping stories and such throughout!!"
"May 7, 2019",Not impressed with charity donation,"Amazing piece of British heritage, however I found it disgraceful that on ticket purchase you are NOT asked if you'd like to add a charity donation but you are asked for a total including it!I queried it and was told that I did not ha e to pay the charity sum but I think its appauling how visitors, are not asked!I'm also enraged that such an important piece of British history has become reliant on a charity! They house the Queen Jewells- surely she should pay for them to be protected!Absolute embarrassment to our country! "
"May 7, 2019",Again - a must visit in London,"Get here early, queues can be long. Join a free tour - it is fun, very informative. The queues to visit the Crown Jewels can also get very long so visit here first if the queues are short. The visit can take up to half a day."
"May 7, 2019",GO EARLY!,"The Beefeater Tour was very good, however, there was a large group assembled... between 40 and 50 people, so you had to stay close to hear everything.  You meet the Yeoman right after you walk through the gate.  There does not seem to be a limit to the crowd size.  He walks you around the grounds and gives you the history of the Tower and it's denizens with knowledge and wit.  The tour lasts about an hour.  We then got into a very long queue to see the crown jewels.   We should have done that first, because the line got longer and longer throughout the day.  It was an hour and a half wait, so bring water, snacks, etc.   You can easily spend 5 hours here."
"May 6, 2019",Strong imprint,"Visiting the Tower with all its history is quite a strong event. Expecially as you have a view towards the shard from one corner. The amount of time, and all that has evolved,between those thwo were built is mindblowing "
"May 6, 2019",Absolutely worth a visit!,"My husband, kids (13, 9) and I enjoyed this tour immensely.  You learn so much about the history of London when you do a tour with the distinguished (and incredibly funny) Beefeaters.  Plus, you get to see the Crown Jewels!  "
"May 6, 2019",A must see in London!,"We spent a week in London and the Tower of London was our favorite family activity! We arrived on a sunny Sunday morning around 11am and didn’t find the crowds until later in the afternoon. It’s worth spending several hours and I highly recommend a Beefeater tour, which is not only free but extremely interesting. Beefeater Dave was our wonderful guide. "
"April 6, 2019",Beefeater tour!,"Firstly, make sure you do the beefeater tour. Secondly, look for the BOGOF vouchers especially if you have come by public train. It is very expensive per person, but worth it for its amazing history."
"April 3, 2019",Must See Crown Jewels,Seeing the crown jewels is a must see experience.  The buildings and other exhibits in Tower of London are very interestiing and educational.
"March 31, 2019",Tower of London,Easy access using London underground and London pass. No ques. Seeped in history. Displays throughout very interesting and informative. Be prepared for walking around and in and out of buildings including stairs.Must be a place to visit while in London
"March 29, 2019",Crown Jewel for sure!,I have always read about the Tower of London but I’d never had an opportunity to visit until now.  I went as part of a day tour of London which worked out nicely since we could skip the ticket lines.  We spent several hours exploring the tower and it’s exhibits before heading into the Crown Jewels.  If only I could take pictures of the jewels....it was worth the trip nevertheless.  We caught a boat up the Thames after we finished.  It was the perfect end to our visit.  
"March 28, 2019",Interesting and well organized,"We bought our tickets online before we arrived in London and saved around 10% off the admission. Make sure you join the beefeater tours. I think they run every hour and on the half hour. They are fascinating and very informative. We arrived in the afternoon and the crowds were at a minimum, even for the crown jewels so in the off season, you don't have to arrive right as the attraction is opening to avoid the crowds. Plan on spending around 2-3 hours here. The exhibit in the white tower was informative but it was mostly about armour and defense strategies that were used. There are a lot of stairs to climb so be prepared for that. The exhibit on the torture methods was small; I was expecting a lot more given the history of the tower. The crown jewels are beautiful obviously but the highlight is definitely the beefeater tour so do not miss that!"
"March 26, 2019",Wow!,Great place to see. We didn’t do the tour with a Beefeater. The Crown Jewels were amazing! We were able to walk around at our own pace and enjoy the grounds.it was nice to see the famous ravens too. Nice coffee and gift shops are available.
"March 25, 2019",Off With Your Head,"this attraction brought home the real history of england!  hard to believe so many were kept or killed here.  the inside square, the grassy areas within the walls of the exterior have benches to rest.  the crown jewels are inside and they are gorgeous.   there are the beefeaters, the guards inside the tower and out.  and there are still the black crows that reside there every day from olden days.  they are huge. there is a guiotiene in the courtyard, no thank you i'll pass."
"March 25, 2019",Fascinating Place,"I was expecting a tower, not a whole fortress!  There was so much to see and do, too many things to mention in a review.  There is such variety that everyone will find things of interest, so don't miss!"
"March 22, 2019","Amazing place, highly recommended",Most visit place. My recommendation is to purchase tickets online and to print them. Get there early because later there are many school groups and entire place becomes crowdy
"March 19, 2019",Tower of London/Tour by Clive ,"Loved this historical site! It is packed with fascinating stories and truly made history come to life. We enjoyed a guide tour by Yeoman Warder Clive. He was incredible! Throughly knowledgeably, passionate, and hilarious to boot. This was one of my favorite stops in London. "
"May 16, 2019","A bit pricey, but it easily has enough entertainment for a large portion of the day","Approximately 30 pound per person seemed to be a high price initially, but the tower of London has a lot to offer in return. The guided tours are funny and informative. Lovers of old weaponry and armour will enjoy the exhibitions. There's a cafe with all kinds of food inside the tower, but it's fairly pricey. Not everything is accessible by wheelchair. For parents, it pays off to use a lightweight pushchair that can be carried up the stairs. We spent a good portion of the day in the tower, and children under 5 are enter for free. So, considering that this is such a historic sight, I'd say that the price was worth it."
"May 14, 2019",The core of England's history,"It is the core of England's history, a place not to be missed on a London tour. The jewels are incredibly beautiful. And their security is equally matched."
"May 14, 2019","History everywhere, chilling place to visit!","Well if you know the history of the Tower of London, it is pretty eerie to walk through those halls and towers.  There are very good historical summaries listed describing what you are viewing.  The crown jewels are also located here.  Again, we stopped here off of one of the hopper buses.  We used the London Pass and had zero line to tend with entering the site."
"May 12, 2019",Ceremony of the Keys,"Had the opportunity to experience the Ceremony of the Keys in addition to a tour.Quite a different experience touring during the evening hours. Even though the exhibits were not open, we had a delightful walk the other grounds with the yeomen warden who was excellent.The Ceremony of the Keys was very moving especially knowing that this has taken place every evening for the last some 600 years.I highly recommend a visit for those interested in history"
"May 12, 2019",Tower of London,"Very cool place to visit,  1000 years old and still standing in great condition.  Wait an hour to see crown jewels,  jusy a bunch of fancy hats, not work the wait.  The place is free with the London Pass"
"May 11, 2019",Good Place,"Nice place to visit, there are lots of things to see. It does get very busy there so the earlier you get in the better. I would say I queued for about 40 minutes to see the Crown Jewels but it was worth the wait. The ravens were particularly fun to see, they have a lot of personality. I didn't encounter too many staff but all the ones I did were very friendly and helpful."
"May 11, 2019","Amazing, just have a big breakfast before you go","Absolutely loved the experience here, did the beefeater tour with Shady and was glad we did, very entertaining. We also hired audio guides which were good, but I don’t know they truly enriched our experience. My only advice is to make sure you have a big breakfast before you go. There are snacks and a restaurant but, for us, we spent just short of 4 hrs walking up and down stairs, by the end we were exhausted and in need of a cold pint ;)"
"May 10, 2019",Fun to see the Crown Jewels,"By the time I got to London, I had seen A LOT of castles of various ages. The Tower did not disappoint. I wish the Ravens had been out and about, as they often are free to wander the grounds. In all it was an enlightening experience."
"May 9, 2019",Amazing Historical Experience and place.,We visited on the bank holiday weekend so it was very busy as we did not arrive until 1.30 the same time as the rain!  We started with the Beefeater tour. This was great our Beefeater was very humorous and informative. He takes you to the chapel explains the towers history and who is buried there to be physically . After the Beefeaters orientation you are free to explore on your own. There is a log to see. We were there three and a half hours and didn’t see everything. So it is probably best to do this tour in the morning so you have as much time as you want to take. We loved the White Tower with all the Armour and Swords there are a lot of steps to do all the floors so you do have to be physically fit. The queue for the Crown Jewels was quite long it took about 25 minutes . They were amazing. One of the most amazing things were the ravens they fly freely throughout the tower. My kids got some fabulous selfies with them so close!  It is a fabulous place but you do need a lot of time to do it justice.
"May 8, 2019",Excellent attraction,"I will highly recommend this attraction to all travellers. Excursion with befeaters were great. I have never been on such entertaining, funny and informative tour. It takes 45min. King krowns are spectacular, and because of moving path there are not queues.Scone and coffee in coffee where great. Everything were great, clean, entertaining and there were no queues!"
"May 26, 2019",Amazing Amazing,"We joined the guided tour by Beefeater Scott Kelly who was totally brilliant. His wealth of knowledge was fantastic as well as a great sense of humour & displayed his love for queen & country. Well done Scott, you made our visit perfect.The Tower was breathtaking, so beautiful & we learnt so much more than we could have imagined.It was a fantastic way to spend an afternoon & the grounds are so wonderfully maintained."
"May 26, 2019",Great,"It is so cool to visit and learn so much history.  It was not boring at all, the lines moved relatively quickly, and I got to see the Crown Jewels!  "
"May 26, 2019",Well done,"There is a lot of history here and the beefeaters do a great job of sharing history, telling stories and making the audience laugh. Definitely recommend the tour and then just wander around. Plan for several hours to half a day. Worth the trip."
"May 24, 2019",Very interesting ,Thoroughly enjoyed this visit and learning about the history. Ensure you join in on a beefeaters tour which run every half an hour and are free to join once you walk through the entrance.
"May 24, 2019",Every day is a school day!,"We went to the tower of London and joined a tour with the Yeoman guide-Clive, it lasted around an hour and was funny, informative and friendly. I felt I got so much more from it than I would have walking round on our own. The whole place is really quite impressive and even at the entry price which I would say is a little expensive (£60 for 2 adults) i felt we got our moneys worth. We were there maybe 2.5 hours and really enjoyed it."
"May 23, 2019",Must See,"From all the things I've seen in London, the Tower was my favorite! If you have a love for medieval castles, you'll have to see this one. It is also not just a castle, but a rather large group of towers and exhibition rooms. Loved it!"
"May 23, 2019",A London Must,"On our 12 day (self organized) tour of the UK we had to make time for the famous Tower of London.  If turned out to be the best attraction we saw in the London.  It's pricey to get in but well worth it.We did a walking tour in the morning, and made our way via Undergroud to Tower Hill.  We go there around 2pm which mean we had 3.5 hours to see the place.  So it's not just a tower, its a castle.  We probably could have used another hour, but we did manage to see the highlights.  You start out with about a 45 minute tour and overview from one of the Beefeaters.  It's really informative.  Lots of apartments and chambers as well as the crown jewels to see.  Well worth the $ and the time.  Don't miss it."
"May 23, 2019",must see this place,"so much history here in one place, you will not only see the history presented inside the tower, but also the beautiful buildings and gardens outside."
"May 22, 2019",VERY interesting and fun facts,Viator was an excellent company to do this with. Very informative and smooth process to see many of the sites in London
"May 22, 2019",Oh If the Walls Could Talk,Emposing structure which has plenty of secrets.  Just remember a queen lost her head in this structure.   
"March 7, 2019","A castle, crown jewels, and torture chambers- oh my!","One of the most historic sites in London - beautifully restored and maintained and home to the opulent (some might say gaudy) crown jewels. Diamonds apparently are forever. It's a wonderful place to spend half a day with dramatic scenes across the Thames and over to Tower Bridge.   Loaded with history, it's also a child friendly - with an interactive space on the top floor of the castle.  "
"March 1, 2019",Know before you go,"Read some great books on the Tower's history prior to my trip, which really brought to life what I was seeing. Highly recommend the Beefeater tour which is free with admission, Mr. Kelly was very informative and entertaining. Early morning seems to be the best time, as it gets more crowded later on."
"February 25, 2019",Fun day out!,"We had a lovely time there! At first your kids would probably think that this is just an educational place but no it isn't!We were there for about 3-4 hours and got through everything. We saw the Crown Jewels and had to queue for 30 mins so I would say to do it just before you go. There were lots of interactive activities for the children to do such as this electric arrow game, sword games and many more! They also had some tours for children which included dressing up in medieval clothing and having fun sword fights! There was a lot of useful information and models of objects.This is a good and fun place to take your children. "
"February 23, 2019",Excellent tour,"We were not sure what to expect going into the Tower of London- didn’t have much understanding of the history of London. The tour was included in the ticket price and it was excellent. Skip did a tremendous job- honestly one of the best tour guides I’ve ever had- enjoyed every minute. We spend over 4 hours touring around. This was so worth it. Highly recommend coming here vs St. Paul’s cathedral where we went in, looked around and decided it wasn’t worth the money (esp if you come back for a service then the church is free vs the 20 pound entrance fee- which is ridiculous for a church). Tower of London was totally worth it on the other hand. Loved this experience and our tour guide Skip- well done!"
"February 23, 2019",Amazing surprise,I was very excited to see the Crown Jewels. But this place is more than that. It is beatiful and full of history. I loved all the towers and the sculptures. Great view of the London Bridge. 
"February 23, 2019",The Tower of London,"Amazing and grandiose.  So much to learn and so much to see.  Lots of steps to climb but worthwhile.  We did not get to see the Crown Jewels because it was the end of the day and we had spent so much time within the Tower and then outside looking at the facade architecture and the seeing Beefeaters.  Definitely, a must to visit."
"February 19, 2019",Fabulous - a must-see historical gem,Recommended by friends to join the guided tour by the Beefeaters - so glad we listened to their advice! Beefeater John was fantastic. Very fun way of learning historical facts about the Tower which we would’ve missed. Made the whole visit even more interesting. Just a pity that sometimes we were at the back of the group and struggled to hear (due to other loud visitors). The Crown Jewels are an absolute must-see. Thoroughly enjoyed the tour and will definitely be returning for a second visit. Give yourself plenty of time - wish we’d have gone earlier to spend more time there. You need at least three hours to appreciate it all.
"February 17, 2019",Scott Kelly is an amazing Yeomen warder tour guide!,"Yeomen warder (Beefeater), Scott Kelly, was our 2pm tour guide and was so informative, creative, funny and a mesmerizing story teller!!  At the end of our tour, we found out we were only his 6th tour he has done and we were all shocked!!! He knew so much and truly appeared to love his job!!  He has been a beefeater only 6 months! Thank you for making our Tower of London tour so memorable and fun!!"
"February 14, 2019",Something one must do in life,"You haven't lived until you have heard the Beefeaters tell the story of the Tower. It is a little pricey and we have sat it out a few times, while out first-time travel companions, went on the tour. But we have done it 3 or 4 times, and have always loved it. Not to be missed for first-time visitors. Long lines in summer."
"February 6, 2019",Brilliant,"A must in London! Busy but worth the wait. Travel by tube, easiest route. Crown Jewels are amazing. A great day."
"April 26, 2019",Well worth the price of admission!,A lot of British history is contained this this medieval castle. You can see a smaller changing of the guard ceremony as well as see the Crown Jewels. 
"April 25, 2019",Old castle with rich history,"Spent a morning here and was told to look at the Crown Jewels first as the exhibit gets more crowded later. Interesting display of crowns, weapons of Royalty with a lot of precious stones on them. From the Tower you can also walk to the Tower Bridge which is a famous landmark across the Thames! "
"April 24, 2019",Great place to spend time & learn about history!,We got there around 10am and went straight to the Royal Crown Jewels to avoid the long lines (expect long lines after 11am....) We spent about 3 hrs at the Tower. Great place for kids too.  They had skids with characters on grounds for the kids.  Learned lot about history of the Tower and events.
"April 24, 2019",Expensive but worth it!,We visited with our two children who both loved seeing a place they have read about in history lessons at school. The Crown Jewels were very impressive (get there early to avoid the queues) and there was lots more to see. You can easily spend several hours there and it’s worth getting there early as it gets very busy.
"April 22, 2019",It’s a staple for a reason! ,"Great visit! We bought our tickets ahead of time and arrived when it opened. We were able to walk through and see almost everything before the girls were ready to go. The Crown Jewels are beautiful but they only have the crowns and ceremonial pieces. You won’t find jewelry, tiaras, etc. The displays in the towers were nicely done I liked how they used projections I the walls to tell the story.  Arriving early was great it was almost like we were the only ones there! "
"April 21, 2019",Great exhibit!!,"Very  nice and interesting to learn about the Royals, the jewels and the different rooms and places inside the Tower of London, really enjoyed this visit, highly recommended for everybody"
"April 21, 2019",A must do while in London,"We spent hours here. There is so much information and History, it’s hard to absorb. As I walked throughout the structure and the grounds, I couldn’t help but think of all those that previously walked in my steps. There are some precarious steps that are quite steep, narrow and winding. But there is plenty to see without exploring those areas. The Crown Jewels are beyond words... I have never seen jewels like those that adorn the Monarchy crowns.  Highly recommend exploring this huge part of England’s history."
"April 19, 2019",Yeoman Warder Scott Kelly Was Great,"My family and I took a tour with a big group and were lucky enough to have Scott Kelly as our Yeoman Warder tour guide! He works well with large groups and has a great sense of humor. He gave us such good information and we could see that he loves his job. After the tour, he loves taking photos so if want one in your album just ask! Scott Kelly was an amazing tour guide and we definitely recommend him!"
"April 19, 2019",3 Hours at Tower of London,"Such a historic and amazing site.  My husband, teens and I enjoyed our visit.  Bought tickets ahead of time and still waited about 20 minutes in very long, but well organized, line to get in.  (Monday at 9:30 before 10:00 am opening).  Yoeman's tour was very interesting and entertaining.  Didn't bother with the audio tour.  "
"April 19, 2019",Good day out,"Lots to see here so it takes a few hours. We done the free tour which I would recommend, was very interesting and informative. Crown jewels are a must see and the restaurant was reasonable. We saved money by getting the 2 for 1 admission with our train tickets"
"March 18, 2019",Great attraction,Today the Tower of London is really just a tourist attraction but a great one. Kings and queens lived here for centuries. Best advice is to get there early and head straight to the Crown Jewels. The lines get long soon. We walked straight in and it wasn’t crowded inside.
"March 18, 2019",BEWARE OF VIATOR,I am travelling to London with family and we decided to visit the Tower of London. I booked and paid for 4 tickets online via the trip advisor site. I suddenly realised I had booked the wrong date and so tried to transfer the date to the correct date. After an inordinate length of time and being passed to various people/departments I was told the date I actually wanted was fully booked and I would lose 100% of my ticket. Out of interest I tried the process again with the correct date and miraculously it would’ve accepted my booking. So in other words if you make a simple error they keep your moneyBEWARE
"March 13, 2019","Being American, we tend to think of our governments 200 plus years activity as rather long, but not so in England.","To appreciate The Tower of London one must know a bit of history, as the Tower has played a great roll in English history. The imprisonment of the two young princes, and their kiiing. The execution of Ann Bolyn, 2nd or 3rd wife of Henry VIII, by sword.  There is a brass plaque on the ground where this took place. The death of Mary, Queen of Scotts took place there, along with much political activity, and executions to change England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one, ""The Church of England"" with the various intrigues and wars which were based in religion. The Tower is most definatley a place to visit, also to see the Beefeater guards, in their spectacular uniforms...take time to visit and absorb the history of the place, in fact, study up on English History, and that will make your visit all the more meaningful."
"March 11, 2019",Visit and Do the Yeoman's Tour,"We recently visited the Tower of London with our nine-year-old son and made a point to take Yeoman Warder Andy's tour.  We are so glad we did!  We have been to the Tower before on several occasions and saw different rooms but we did not have such an in-depth understanding of the history and events at the Tour until we took the Yeoman Warder tour.  Because of that guided tour, we investigated buildings in the Tower we had never visited before and we learned a lot of interesting and informative history.  The Yeoman Warder tours last about an hour and should not be missed."
"March 10, 2019",Don't lose your head.,Great piece of history. Lovely architecture. Well thought out for tourists of any nationality. Superb collections to view including the Crown Jewels and the Ravens.Eating there can be expensive and long queues to suffer. 
"March 10, 2019",Fun Day,Lots to see!! I recommend to pay the 5 pounds for the tour recorder. Has a really great cafe and gift shops. You could really spend the day just looking at the Crown Jewels and the armory. Highly recommended  
"March 7, 2019",Oh If the Walls Could Talk,Emposing structure which has plenty of secrets.  Just remember a queen lost her head in this structure.   
"March 7, 2019","A castle, crown jewels, and torture chambers- oh my!","One of the most historic sites in London - beautifully restored and maintained and home to the opulent (some might say gaudy) crown jewels.

"February 25, 2019",Educative,It was a interesting experience. Built well and structured well.  A once visit good. Visited with young adults.
"January 26, 2019",Great experience,Another great sight to visit. The Beefeater tour is can not miss and get there early to visit the crown jewels. We arrived at 10:00 AM which is when it opens and went right to the crown jewels and it was empty. It took us three hours to get through the self tour. Very interesing
"January 25, 2019",Tower of London still amazing ,A visit to the Tower of London is a must if visiting London. The complex is large and offers many excellent views of the City and the River Thames. The Crown Jewels display is breathtaking. The White Tower has an extensive showing of armour and weapons. The on-site Cafe is excellent. Good tasty food and not to expensive. The famous Crows and Beefeaters add to the visit.
"January 23, 2019",Very rude staff ,"Shame shame shame that the employees don’t realise the impact of their behaviour and attitude on tourism in London. People at the gate were as cold as ice answering questions. One of the guards assigned for one area of the Tower of London wanted to call police on us because we wanted to enter the exhibit room 15 min before the closing time.... and the way he talked to us! Wow as we were pieces of dirt, meanwhile we paid £50 for our tickets what pay his salary. If he doesn’t want to do his job he should stay home and collect unemployment. I live in London but will never take any visitors there again as I don’t want to risk having a spoiled day. "
"January 21, 2019",Interesting,"If you pre-purchase tickets online, you collect them at the group ticket line up, however signage is poor and we wasted a good 40 minutes lining in the wrong queue. The escalator around the crown jewels kept people moving and was a great idea! The queue for seeing these was long but it did keep moving. Photographing the ravens kept us busy while lining up. There was much to see at the Tower, but it was very busy and we were over lining up and tired. Suggest you go early in the morning - it is a full day's outing. "
"January 18, 2019",Great tourist spot with history but arrive early in the day!,The Tower of London is a MUST for every American tourist when visiting London!  You can learn about a LOT of British history and see the crown jewels.  Take the tour first and let a Beefeater/Yoeman give you all facts.  Don't miss the dungeon.  It has a nice cafe for lunch.  But it takes several hours and it is a bit expensive so be sure to go early in the day and plan accordingly.  Don't forget your camera!
"January 17, 2019",Great tour,Great day out for the whole family. I could go here many times. The three hour tour by the guide a must to do. He catered for all ages of the group going around.If go by train. please but all day ticket and it then a 2 for 1 attraction
"January 14, 2019",Go EARLY and go STRAIGHT TO THE JEWELS to avoid INSANE queues!!!,"If you haven’t been to London since Instagram conquered the world, you need to know that tourism in London has become bonkers, with Disney-style queues at every tourist site. Tower of London is one of those places. During any holiday period (we were there between Christmas and New Years, but apparently this is also true all summer and most of the spring too!), the line to get into the Tower is unreal... and once you're inside, the line for the Crown Jewels needs to be seen to be believed. You can absolutely avoid both of these queues by planning ahead. Buy tickets in advance, and print them at home. These tickets are NOT timed-entry, and the Tower opens at 10am. That means you need to get there at 9:30am (the queue will have already formed by then!). When you get into the castle, resist the temptation to explore, linger, pose for photos etc.—plenty of time for that later! – and GO STRAIGHT TO THE CROWN JEWELS. Trust me on this. We went there right at 10am and we waited about 25 minutes on the Crown Jewels queue, which felt rather long considering we couldn’t have gotten there any earlier. By the time we came out, the queue had expanded to a two-hour wait, without exaggeration. They had costumed entertainers playing music for the people in the queue to prevent rioting. It was bonkers. We had four kids with us, so we were especially grateful that we had prioritized. (Several reviews claim that with children, you should go to the White Tower first. Yes, the White Tower has loads of awesome stuff for kids. But if you don’t go to the Jewels first, you will not see the jewels. Which are pretty impressive and unmissable for kids too. If you go to the Jewels first, you’ll see it all.) There’s a lot to see in the Tower and you can easily spend four hours here, especially with curious children—lots of hands-on exhibits, costumed actors interacting with visitors, etc. Don’t waste your time on line. Plan ahead!"
"January 11, 2019",Traveler,Excelent place. Ravens are inteteresting.The best is Crown Juwels exibition. They are really amazing. Also view on Tower Bridge is excelent
"January 9, 2019",Great introduction to London,"If you go on a busy morning, head straight to the crown jewels, and then hit the white tower, and finish with the beefeater tour to avoid the lines."
"January 6, 2019",Incredible experience,It is a spectacular and very large castle.  Go early because there is so much to see and long lines.  Just to enter to see the jewels of The Crown you do more than 30 minutes  but you won’t believe  what you will see: true jewels (except 1)
"May 5, 2019",Loved the History,"We absolutely loved the Tower of London, and ended up going back on a different trip.  This is SO much history.  We did the guided tour and that was amazing, we learned so very much about the history of England.  I actually think we will go back again a third time the next time we go to London as the kids will be older and it is just a good learning opportunity.  "
"May 4, 2019",Interesting walk tour,"The tower has shown a bit of European history, and what kind of things usually happened inside the building! You can read the explanations in Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Deutch, English and Korean. Some days you can pay to go into. It’s has a nice old architecture, which was made in 1070.  "
"May 4, 2019",The crown jewels are there!,"If you'd like to see the actual crown jewels worn by the past king and queens, this is the place to be. But be warned though, the line just to go inside the room for the jewels is about 20mins long. There are other rooms in the area but it was the most interesting. "
"May 4, 2019",Need a lot of time here,"We bought tickets online. You have to pick up your own line tickets. We waited 30 minutes to pick up the tickets only to be told to go to another counter - where we didn't have to wait at all! Our goal was to get in right a 9am when the got in - instead we got in almost 40 minutes later! It is BUSY at this place so we wanted to see things before the crowds all arrived. In this day with the technology that we have, I don't understand why the ticket can't just be downloaded to your mobile device. That needs to be improved on!!!Other than the ticket delay, we enjoyed our visit tho we didn't see everything here we wanted to. Once the crowds come in there are line ups to see every part. We went straight to the Crown Jewels, and did get in with probably only a 10 minute wait. (had we come in right at 9 we wouldn't have waited at all). After seeing the crown jewels we rushed over to get in on the 10am Beefeater tour. There was probably 100 people on the tour. They need to offer more tours in a day. Small kids end up being at the back because the walk slowest - so then they miss it magic of it. the Beefeater tour was good but not as memorable as when we were here many years ago."
"May 4, 2019",Must see piece of history!,Don’t leave London without visiting The Tower. So much history here.  Plan to spend at least half a day to look around and learn.  The Yeomans tour is included but gets very busy. I suggest paying extra for the audio tour to guide you around.
"May 3, 2019",Bigger Than Ben Hur!,"I never thought the Tower of London was so big! It's massive! We didn't get anywhere near seeing it all, but what we did see, was engaging, fascinating & made us so pleased we never lived in these times. The Yoe Men talks are brilliant & absolutely a must do - they are full of information & presented in a really engaging way. All the exhibits are well presented & easy to follow.The Crown Jewels were amazing.The gory history was eye opening.We are so glad we came here, and you will be too!"
"May 2, 2019",Historic palace,"I love British history, so when I knew my family was traveling to London, this was one of the places I needed to visit.  Learning more about the rich history of Henry VIII and his wives, Queen Mary (Bloody Mary) and getting to see the crown jewels was a sight to see."
"May 1, 2019",The Majesty of it all...........,"I initially did not know what to expect about visiting the Tower of London. I really was not prepared for the way I felt when my closest friend and I finished touring ""The Tower"". The beginning history of a nation is held inside these walls. We decided to walk the grounds & buildings without a guide as this would allow us to go at our own pace..Good Decision. The first thing that struck me was the architecture and how the craftsmen of that time did such precision design & stonework without the modern tools & design sensability of today...I would hear people say ""How did they do that without a crane"" It does truly boggle the mind when you stop to think about it.It is essentially a fortress on the river, but there was a community of life inside those walls. Kings, Queens, servants & soldiers shared a kind of spartan existense inside those walls. Life began there and life was taken there. Most of the rooms & halls now inside the internal buildings are filled with royal antiquity. There is so much to take in & digest. This is where touring on your own lets you stand, gaze and ponder The Majesty of it all.This is truly an English, if not, a World treasure that is more than worthy of investing your time to explore. A journey back in time that needs to be appreciated."
"May 1, 2019",Very interesting attraction,Combine the Visit with a visit in tower bridge . The architecture is unique and travels you back in time. 
"April 19, 2019",Must Visit,"I can't imagine going to London and not seeing the Tower of London (unless you've seen it before...maybe then it's okay). We bought tickets through Trip Advisor in advance (the skip the line ones), and followed advice from other reviews to get there when it opens first thing in the morning (9am). That was excellent advice, because we were one of the first admitted. The first thing we went to was to see the Crown Jewels, which were amazing. I'd recommend going there first if you're interested in seeing them and get there early. There weren't a ton of people when we went, so we were able to get on the conveyors more than once to get a good look. The White Tower and the other wards are also worth visiting - the property was used as a prison for a long time (700 years?), and the wards all have very interesting carvings in them from famous prisoners (Queen Elizabeth I was one of the many famous prisoners). The Beefeater tours appear to be worth it, though there were just too many people on them when we were there, which was discouraging. It doesn't appear that you have to sign up for the Beefeater tours - you just wait at the designated spot when they are about to start. "
"April 18, 2019",History revisited,"As the Tower of London tour includes the Crown Jewels, it is a must see. This was an afternoon stop on an all-day tour. Needless to say, we were a bit weary by the time we arrived on location. The facility could be an all day or half-day tour. There is that much to see and do. If it is a beautiful, sunny, warm day, expect crowds that will force you to wait to enter the exhibits. Fortunately, on my visit, there were no crowds although it was sunny and warm. I was able to view the Crown Jewels and walk around a bit. This is a definitely a great tour stop while visiting London."
"April 14, 2019",Family Fun!,"Great afternoon, lots of history and very interesting. The tour guides give a very enjoyable talk and tour."
"April 13, 2019",Must have in London,"Early in the morning already a very-very long quee, however we were extremly fast in Tower. Very nice staff, always helpful, always there to help. Tower itself very clean, good map, very interesting exhibitions. "
"April 28, 2019",Beefeaters are the star of the show!,The Beefeaters tour was the best part of the Tower of London.  The guides really brought the history alive for everyone.  The Crown Jewels were a spectacular sight to see.  I would highly recommend this attraction in London.
"April 13, 2019",Do not miss the crown jewels,"I went with my family and our entrance fees were covered by our London Pass so we didn't have to pay anything upon getting to Tower of London. We were there in time for the beefeater tour which was really entertaining and educational. We got to see the chapel, the white tower, and the crown jewels. It was a great experience and would definitely recommend it to first-timers in London like ourselves."
"April 13, 2019",Not to be missed,"The Tower of London was on my 'must do' list whist showing my young son the sights of London. It's a short walk from  Tower Hill tube stop. We had booked in advance and had pre printed tickets so no queuing. First stop - Crown Jewels. I liked the fact that they had made the queuing interactive so once inside, you learned along the way.  The jewels do not disappoint; there is a clever travelator for viewing the most prestigious ones so everyone gets a clear line of sight and there is no congestion. The White Tower and its contents are  breathtaking.There are a lot of steps everywhere with some very narrow spiral staircases. The Yeoman Wardours are well worth listening to as they bring the history of the tower alive. There is so much to learn and see- thoroughly recommend."
"April 10, 2019",All that glitters is good,On a trip to the Tower with an Italian student she mentioned the Crown Jewels and how she would love to see them. Little did she know she was about to walk past them. The whole visit was so good especially to see her reactions to the whole experience. A place to revisit me thinks.
"April 10, 2019",Great way to spend the day!,"We didn't have a lot of time in London, so one of the stops we had to make was at the Tower of London.  The is a large property with with lots of buildings to explore. This is also where you can view the Crown Jewels, and the Tower Bridge is just beyond the exit to the Tower of London.   Lots of fun to visit and explore.  "
"April 8, 2019",Do the Beefeater tour,"There is lots to see here, it would take a full day to read/see/do everything. Or try to cram it into 2-3 hours. Definitely do the Beefeater tour for some very interesting history facts but also for the jokes. Can recommend Scot Kelly's jokes anyway! Beefeaters, if there's a big crowd and it's windy, it's hard to hear everything, a mic would be great. Top floor of the Tower has new interactive displays, great for children."
"April 8, 2019",We lost our day in the queues ,"We were really looking forward to our visit around the Tower. After visiting St Paul’s, Hampton Court and the Houses of Parliament, our expectations were high but we were soon to be disappointed. The queue to see the Crown Jewels stretched around every corner. There were so many people on site, we couldn’t see the detail of the rooms we entered  or the information boards. There should be a daily tour time so everybody can get the best of the experience or don’t sell as many tickets. It’s an important piece of British history and for the price of the ticket you don’t get value for money. "
"January 3, 2019",Beefeaters are the Best,"The Beefeater tour was the highlight of the trip. Such incredible history. I wish they would let you take pictures of the Crown Jewels but judging by all the people that had been beheaded there previously, I decided to not risk getting caught. "
"December 31, 2018",Disappointing!,"I hadn't been here since i was a child and was very excited to revisit in my late 40s. What a disappointing day! Tickets queues took 45 minutes (you have to have a paper ticket and can't access using any electronic ticket or app! Really? Catch up, guys!) After queuing for 45 mins, I bought a ticket and was told the Crown Jewels had a 2 hour queue (that was okay, as I didn't want to see them) But why wait til I get to the front of the queue to tell me? Have somebody at the end of the queue telling you that so you have the choice as to whether to leave befpre ypu start (once you've queued for 45 mins  you feel committed to continue!) Once in, you then had to join another queue for the audio tour (headphones)  which was what I wanted to do. But I just couldn't cope with another 30 minute queue, so I didn't bother. The queues for every 'attraction' we're 30+minutes and here's the main reason why I found this day so disappointing...there is very little to see?!?! Who knew?! In the Prison attraction, there's some graffiti, 3 torture methods and Sir Walter Raleigh's study. That's it! And you queue 3 times for that A/V put 1.5 hours). I was also surprised by one of the Yeomans I spoke to...patronising, bigging up his part and showing off in front of all the people within earshot. I asked a simple question about where something was. I didn't need the 3 minute over dramatic, overly loud speech...just answer the question, mate! Dear people who run thr Tower of London, go and visit Hampton Court or Alcatraz to see how a historical tourist attraction should be done!"
"December 28, 2018",Jewels Everywhere ,I cant find a word beyond exquisite to describe these rocks. A must see. The grounds are also very interesting. 
"December 24, 2018","Finally, at our 6th visit to London we went to see the Queens Jewelry","Most beautiful place is the Salt Tower with the inscriptions and the view: Towerbridge and the river. you need a few hours to see it all. Had a great laugh in the safe where we went to see the jewellery. Very big door...... You have to stand on a passenger conveyor, moving band.... so nice > at least the windows stayed clean and you can go as often as you like. There is a lot of gold, crockery, things to decorate a table that can feed a country, so big. But very nice to see with ones own eyes the extravaganza of the royal family. and the crowns are impressive, big, glittering and very gold. Shame we weren't allowed to take pictures, but they are on the internet, so no worries, we will get them in the album anyway. "
"December 21, 2018",Great place to learn more about the history of England,"When we arrive at the Tower of London, we were in time for a guided tour and the person giving the tour was joyful, funny and told many stories and jokes to make the trip more enjoyable. The place is worth going!"
"December 20, 2018",Must see!,Fascinating place. Best know for the for the crown jewels and beheadings but so much more. Amazing collection of old armor and weapons of all types.  You will even see a part of the original Wall of London there. Would go back again.
"December 13, 2018","Don't miss it, but you won't need all day.","Although this is a historical and 'not to miss' experience, it doesn't knock your socks off as much as other activities in the city.We prepaid for tickets and audio.  Don't waste your money on the audio - unless you want to make a whole day of it, and we didn't.  Yes, get a photo with the Beefeater guides - they are very accommodating, but their tours are crowded and they DO NOT use any voice amplification so unless you are very close to them, you really can't hear them.  My advice is to tour yourself by following what is in the tour book you probably bought before leaving for London. Go to see the Crown Jewels, for sure, and the armor and then just roam about the grounds and walls."
"December 11, 2018",Fabulous place to visit!  Not great for wheelchairs,"This is a fabulous place to visit.  The Crown Jewels are so well displayed and at least for us a quick visit--gorgeous.  The sit-down restaurant where I was marooned in my wheelchair while my wife and daughter (15) went up all the towers which are not accessible, was great.  Big big room and lots of tables with lots of great coffee in winter for you and good menu.  Staff are wonderful, helpful and friendly.  Loved it all.  My daughter found it a highlight of London"
"December 11, 2018",Great Historical Palace to get up close ,"On the river Thames, easy to get to. Tower Hill station follow the directions to the Tower. The view hits you as you get out or station. Good place to get photos. Join a free guided tour by the Yeoman Wardens. They are knowledgeable and fun. You get around at your own pace after the tour.  Don't miss the Crown Jewels. My favorite is the Medieval Palace. "
"December 11, 2018",Loved it,This is a place you should put on you list. Make sure you take the tour and see the Royal Jewels. Your get a history lesson and don’ trip when you enter the Church
"December 9, 2018",Worth a visit (2-3 hours),"Was told great things about this tour and it lived up. The beefeater’s guided tour (free) was the highlight along with the Crown Jewels. No need to buy any audio guides, just get the entrance ticket ahead of time and go."
"December 4, 2018",Fabulous Jewels,"The Crown Jewel exhibit was wonderful; the amount of wealth displayed in those cases was staggering.  The torture exhibit was also quite informative.  Even though the lines were long, they moved quickly and orderly."
"December 3, 2018",Go early and enjoy the grounds alone!,"My wife and I arrived to the Tower shortly after it opened for the day, and it was amazing how few people were there. A castle with as much history as this I would have assumed would be busy at all hours of the day. We had a solid 30-45 minutes of roaming the grounds nearly alone and contemplating what life must have been like during the days the Tower was in use. The Yeoman Warder tour is a MUST. You'll get about an hour long tour with lovely historical tidbits about the tower and the grounds from one of the beefeaters who lives there. Crowned jewel tip: go to the tower early and then bee-line it to the crowned jewels. I've heard that the line merely to enter the building where the jewels are kept can sometimes be an hour or more, but first thing in the morning, we strolled right in and were able to view the jewels in languid peace and quiet with only 20-30 others nearby."
"November 27, 2018",Big Thumbs Up from NYC!!!,"Of course, the big tourist draw at The Tower of London are the Crown Jewels, which are amazing, but there is so much more to experience.  For all the castles, fortresses, draw bridges, prisoner experiences, etc., we have each experienced through movies (and maybe Disney parks), it’s all here, some dating  back to the 11th Century.  The Tower of London is a remarkable journey back in time! "
"November 27, 2018",Excellent as usual,The Beefeater guides make this attraction perfect.  I love this place. Perfect for kids. Buy the Mission London book and have kids check off the details at the sites.
"November 26, 2018",Very good historical visit,We visited the Tower of London recently and found it to be an excellent visitors attraction full of history and very informative.
"November 26, 2018",Interesting place,"We visited with our 8 and 4 year old while sightseeing in London. They’d both been studying shut Fawkes at school so we thought they’d like to see the place where he was held. They loved it! There was a lot more to do then we expected. The kids particularly enjoyed the interactive elements in the white tower. The jewels were obviously a highlight - we went there first to avoid the queues.All of the staff were friendly, professional and knowledgable. You could tell that they had a military background.The cafe was lovely. I highly recommend trying some of the cakes. They seemed a little overpriced but were definitely worth it. Overall, it was an interesting and enjoyable day."
"November 22, 2018",Great place,I thought it was pricey (26£) but it’s really expansive. The general tour route is the perimeter so you keep getting new views of the city and interior. The Crown Jewels are pretty cool to see. At 18£ it would be 5 stars 😉
"November 22, 2018",Awesome is too small a word to define the experience ,Reached the Tower of London at 2.15 pm...had bought the ticket online which turned out to be cheaper compared to the price if you stood at the ticket counterGot to know the ticket included a free tour...Was happy to be a part of the Yeoman Warder Tour which began at 2.30 pm...our Beefeater guide Dan was hilarious all the wayHe kept us entertained throughout the one hour plus informed us about all the detailsWitnessed the password change march ceremony handled by the guards of the towerApart from all the Crown Jewels stored here I also got a chance to see the Kohinoor diamond from India studded in the Royal crown weighing approx 105.6 Carats...was awaiting a chance to get to see it for a really long time and it just did not disappoint...it truly is a beauty Definitely worth a visit once your in LondonHighly recommended !!!!I would myself come again if i ever get a chance
"November 18, 2018",History comes alive,"If you are into history, skulduggery, kings and queens, castles, this is a great place to visit.  You can walk around the outside of the tower of if you want to brave the crowds, venture inside where the Crown jewels are held.  "
"November 6, 2018",Crown Jewels,"Great couple of hours, we went there specifically for the crown jewels and armory. The place is packed with interesting history."
"November 5, 2018",Extensive complex of buildings with rich history,"This is a vast collection of historic buildings with masses of history.  I recommend paying the extra 5 pounds to get the audio guide, it was definitely worth it."
"November 4, 2018",Wonderful History,"The Yeoman, Clive, made all the difference in learning about the history of the Tower. Humorous, yet factual, timeline of the use of the buildings,  providing a great hour long tour. And the Crown Jewels laid out in their splendor! Wow, beautiful!"
"November 4, 2018",Crown jewels!,Can't go to London without seeing the Tower of London. We went on a weekday and encountered student groups. We heard about the history and saw the amazing crown jewels. Wow...
"October 28, 2018",Half Term Family Day Out,"My husband, our 9 year old daughter and I visited the Tower of London today for a special half term day out. It has been the most awesome day.We took advantage of a Beefeater led guided tour. Our guide (Yeoman Warden Amanda Clarke) was superb. Delivering a warm, knowledgeable and fascinating insight into the Towers history. I feel honoured to have had her as our guide given that she is only one of two female Yeoman Wardens, in the history of the Tower.We spent over 5 hours wandering around the Tower, taking in the many displays and exhibitions. The highlight however has to be the Crown Jewels. Given their popularity there were queues to see them, but the attraction is so well managed, we never felt like we were waiting in line for any great length of time. Once inside, face to face with the crowns and regalia was completely worth any sense of waiting.  I would highly recommend this London attraction as a family day out."
"October 25, 2018",History of English Kings,Very well conservated place with many atractions how was reallity life throughtout many centuries. Some interactions about they defend the premisses from attacks.
"October 24, 2018",Must See while in London!,"First matter of importance..this place shuts down at 5:30pm. My husband and I saved this event for later in the day and then had to sprint through to see what we wanted. They do let you use your ticket for any day so there is some flexibility there. That being said, the things we did see were amazing. Must see the crown jewels! The architecture of the Tower alone is amazing. Full of history and plenty to see! There are also shops and food nearby. Also and epic picture sport for the Tower Bridge."
"October 24, 2018",Great time spent,"Steve was a wonderful tour guide, very knowledgeable. I was happy to spend a little bit of time in this beautiful, historic landmark. "
"October 23, 2018",Worth a visit,"Not my first visit but wanted to take my son. As always well kept, clean and plenty of Beefeaters to help us!. Role plays going in for entertainment. A good time to go is the morning before the crowds as you have enough time to see everything. "
"October 23, 2018",Must visit in London,One of the place you cannot miss when visiting London. Lot of history and things to be seen. Great experience for both my daughters that enjoyed every single moment 
"October 22, 2018",So enjoyed our trip to the Tower!,"As a big fan of Tudor England, going to the Tower of London to see where Anne Boleyn was hung was of huge interest.  Took one of the complimentary tours, which was really informative.  Highly recommend if visiting London."
"October 21, 2018",Return Visit After Many Years....The Tower Has Really Stepped Up Its Game!!,"At the end of a 2 week cruise around the British Isles, we spent a couple of days in London visiting some old favorites.  We have been impressed overall how much the interpretation at the Royal Palaces has improved, and the Tower is no exception.  We were there on a breezy day, a little chilly at the end of Sept.  It was great to be back and stroll the grounds leisurely.  In particular we recommend the Medieval Palace Exhibit as it has some wonderful restored rooms presented as they were with all the trimmings....we walked a portion of the wall after on of these and it presented a gorgeous view of the Thames and of the houses where the Yeoman Warders live.  Our daughter was the only one who got the audioguide and she pronounced it as unnecessary.  In particular we loved the costumed interpreters strolling around....stop and engage them if you are not too shy, it makes the visit come alive.  I had a fine conversation with Sir Walter on his and my views of women's rights in Tudor England!"
"October 21, 2018",Most entertaining and informative,"Ward Yeoman Jason Woodcock is the most interactive, informative and energetic tour guide I have had in years. Audience participation, cheeky comedy, and truth about the Tower of London and it's impact on history are included in in the this hour-ish long trip around the points of interest as it relates to people who were tried, convicted, imprisoned, and executed either on Tower Hill or Tower Green.Recommendation for this site is get there early to see the Crown Just... absolutely stunning...and then take the tour....the start every thirty minutes....just keep your head, and everything will be fine!"
"October 17, 2018",Never disappointing...,"We had the occasion to revisit the Tower of London after a gap of many years when the girls were younger and somewhat less interested in this magnificent historic 900 yr. old castle and fortress on the banks of the River Thames. Now as mature adults it is easy to see how engaged you can be  to be caught up in the stories and fables that went on inside those dark walls and dungeons of famous and infamous prisoners and royals alike. Once a palace, prison, armory and museum it has seen many venues over time.The beefeater entertained us accordingly with an hour tour of the castle with compelling, some gruesome,  stories of went on inside the walls and who had lived there. Among the most famous being Henry V111 and his many wives, some of who hanged there.A beautiful chapel is on site as well of course the Crown Jewels which provide an array of priceless crowns and artifacts worn by various royalty over the centuries. The ravens ever presence at the tower  keep the superstition going that if the ravens leave the monarchy and the tower will fall. So the ravens are well fed.Always a marvelous ""take in"" and a worth while visit as you are cast back in time and try to imagine what it was like to live in those somewhat barbaric and unforsaken times,behind those thick, strong dark walls ..prisoner or royalty alike.Go and see for yourself... you will be fascinated at this wonderful piece of history an iconic piece of London that has stood so well preserved despite the ravages of war."
"October 15, 2018",Do not miss the opportunity to visit this amazing piece of history,"I had not been to the Tower of London in over twenty years. The history of the Tower and the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula within the walls is unbelievable. To walk the Tower and the inner courtyard where kings and queens lived for hundreds of years is unbelievable. If you only have time to visit one landmark within the city, make this the one you choose."
"October 15, 2018",Great visit.  Great guides,Worth seeing.  Excellent history to see.  Crown jewels crowded but the crowd moved good.  Worth the visit for sure
"October 14, 2018",It's a guy thing - except for the jewels,It was a pretty interesting place to see.  I think guys like it better because of the armour and weapons.  I like the jewels - incredible to see.  A definite if you have time.
"October 14, 2018",Rainy day at Tower of London,"England has a long Royal history. Tower of London is like a small village with its own community. Amazing architecture, medival palace, crown jewels, prisoner execution place, chapel. Learn the line of Kings who stay in the Palace. Extravagant  life style. We visited on a rainy day and not many shelter area. Remind all london visiting friends to put a small umbrella on your bag at all time. If you have a London pass will be able to enter without queuing. You can purchase online. A good deal for you to enjoy your london sightseeing in a discounted price. Enjoy your trip! Dont miss it. "
"October 12, 2018",Family visit to the Tower of London ,We visited the Tower of London as a family and had an amazing time. It was such a great learning experience for our 8 and 11 year old girls and for us! We had been here before without children and would recommend it as a top sight in London for any visitor. 
"October 10, 2018",MUST-VISIT,"One of my favorite (if not favorite) tour of all-time. The ""tower"" has tremendous history. Take the live tour delivered by a beef eater guard. Visit the dungeon, the crown jewels, the prisoner water entrance, see where heads were removed from people's bodies, visit the chapel, and visit the white tower with all the armor. Henry VIII's ""form-fitting"" armor is a must. Walk around and give yourself about 2-3 hours to check out all the sights. Walk over to the tower bridge after visiting. Walk along the Thames. It's a great place - Must-do!"
"August 4, 2018",Beefeaters Rock,"Went first thing in the morning with our small Rick Steve’s tour group. We were told to go straight to the Crown Jewels and then go back to join a Beefeater tour. That’s what we did. Line for the jewels was minimal, but by the time we exited it was backed up to the sign saying it was 45 min wait. Then circled back to the meeting spot for the beefeater tour. Great tour with enough beheading to keep our teen boys interested. After that we went upstairs along the top of the wall. Great spot for pictures with the bridge in the background. "
"August 4, 2018",Great visit first thing in the morning,"We arrived just before opening and went straight to the front of the line as I had purchased tickets beforehand online. After entering, we went straight to the crown jewels and had them all to ourselves for quite a long time. Later, we saw thousands standing in line outside in the hot sun.After the crown jewels, we took a beefeater tour which was absolutely fantastic! Great stories, great history, great laughs! Thoroughly enjoyed all our time there."
"August 1, 2018",If there is one tourist trap to go to...,"This would be my pick. If you MUST see the crown jewels, note the queue is LONG and continues inside the building. Advised to join a free tour with one of the Beefeaters... knowledgeable and ammusing. I read you can reenter on the same day but we didnt try..."
"July 30, 2018",A London highlight,"This is one of those obvious tourist top ten locations, and it's well worth a visit. I'd been before, years ago, but this time I took my son and a friend from Paris. We were able to get into the Crown Jewels and the armoured pretty easily, and loved the Crown Jewels. It was a hot day and we were able to move around without any problems to find cooler places. It's always going to be busy, but it covers a huge area and there's something if interest to see wherever you go. We booked in advance online and that worked well."
"July 28, 2018",Worth a visit but be prepared for the queues,"Such a great day out with plenty of information and history to take in, but be prepared for the queues. We arrived approx 1pm to kss the morning crowd and waited until the very end of the day to see the Crown Jewels as the line to enter was sooo long and stayed that way for hours. Because we waited until almost closing time we were only inline for about 20 mins. Most were waiting for at least and hour and half in the sun. Other than that some of the other smaller attractions are crowded but well worth a visit. Just take your patience for the day. "
"July 27, 2018",Great,Full of history. Great attraction. I could have spent all day here. There was so much to see. The free tours given by the beefeaters are informative and fun!
"July 25, 2018","If you only see a few things in London, make this one of them","This is a very intriguing medieval castle with two outer walls, a moat, a lion pit,  torture chambers, a chapel, crown jewels, and nicely maintained.  The beafeater tour is included in your entry ticket and is informative and helpful. It starts just inside the entrance gate to the left every 20 to 30 minutes. Sit close to the front in the chapel or it's hard to hear the guide talk.  After that, you can freely wander the castle and explore. The guard changes periodically and there is a bit of a show to see by the big clock. The crown jewels are interesting and the huge line moves fast. This was good entertainment for a few hours,  took us maybe 3 hours to see it all and get a snack. Taxis are available right out front if you are not on one of the buses. I would definitely do this again and suggest it to a friend."
"July 22, 2018",great afternoon,"Loved taking the tour by the Yeoman, funny, informative, made the visit to this great touring site even better.  Then stopped and talked to a guard in one  of the buildings, asked one question, and we were off to another set of great stories!  "
"July 21, 2018",Great Site to Visit for the Whole Family,"My tween enjoyed this as much as her parents!  Arrive early and head to see the Crown Jewels first if you want to see them.  The line for this one attraction really builds quickly.  The Beefeater tour was very informative.  The cafe offers fairly priced, yummy food."
"July 20, 2018",Brilliant Beefeater-Led tour of The Tower!,"Didn't know what to expect but would recommend this one during a London visit. Take a Beefeater tour(they're free and run every 30mins)to start your visit, quite simply brilliant! Plenty to see in addition to the beefeater tour, and the Cafe/Restaurant on site offers good food and drink choices."
"November 18, 2018",Great,"The Tower And The crown jewels are so beautiful. We love London. When a man is tired of London, he is tired of live. "
"November 16, 2018",Great history,"One of my favorite places to visit. I enjoyed walking around and soaking in the centuries. It is well kept, the period actors were great and friendly. Be patient when looking at the crown jewels, the lines get long but move steadily. "
"November 14, 2018",A must see,One of the top ten of must see if only in London for a very limited time. Don't miss the jewel room.
"November 12, 2018",An absolute must,"Fantastic place to visit. Allow alot of time for the day, as there are lots of extra rooms and areas to see at your own leisure outside of the tour times"
"November 9, 2018",Read for Pro-Tips: The Heart of England...Of Course See It.,"The history of this place and the crown jewels make this your first stop when visiting London.  Here are your pro-tips.  The facility is large and there are some uneven walks.  And a few steep stairs.  Take comfortable shoes.  Take your camera...grab a raven picture.  It's crazy busy, so plan your timing for off-peak as much as possible.  The beefeaters offer free tours and they are worth your time.  Plan two hours for a visit and do not forget to take pictures.  This place is special."
"November 8, 2018",Go EARLY!,We went on a Wednesday morning (around 10 am) with no waiting..from buying tickets to going through the security procedure. Consider visiting the Crown Jewels first because the line is very long to get into the building. The audible tour is very good...it allows you to take your time and linger at certain sites. The Yeoman Waders (Beefeaters) tour is included with your admission....but they do not limit the number of people on the walking tour so we had a very large group of people so at times it was difficult to hear what he was saying...if you can stay close to your guide. 
"November 7, 2018",What a great historic adventure.,"We visited the Tower of London on our recent trip to the UK, and were more than impressed. There is so much to see & do here. We did a tour with a Beefeater Yeoman. He was so knowledgeable and the stories he told were so interesting, touched with humour and suitable for all ages.There is plenty here for the history buff as well as the interested onlooker, but be sure to give yourself plenty of time, because there is loads to see. My advice is to arrive early.The Crown Jewels are just magnificent as is the display of weaponry through the ages. The memorial at the site of Anne Boleyn's execution is quite thought provoking and beautiful. The ravens and their story, make interesting listening as does the visit to Traitor's Gate.If after all these tales of blood & gore you are hungry, the cafeteria is well stoked with comfortable tables & chairs and caters for all diets.My advice: The Tower of London: Don't miss it !"
"November 6, 2018",Beefeater Yeoman and Crown Jewels,Purchase tickets in advance on line and pick up at the group will call window. This saves you a fair number of pounds. Arrive early and take the free tour with the Yeoman. They are spirited and funny and provide a great overview of the Tower of London. If  there are crowds head straight fo the Crown Jewels and then go back to the start and join a Yeoman tour. You will get a lot more out of the Beefeaters tour than roaming around by yourself.
"November 6, 2018",History excellence,"The amazing collection of the history of the English monarchs great architecture, beautiful art collection."
"November 6, 2018",Well worth a visit,"We visited the tower today and a great day was had by us all. We joined the 13.30 tour, guided by Yeoman Spike Abbott, it was an informative and engaging tour. Spike was extremely knowledgeable and keen to share the tower's history, all of which was delivered with good humour. We were lucky enough to chat to Spike after the tour, where he was happy to answer our many questions. His passion and dedication was infectious. If you're lucky enough to join a tour hosted by Yeoman 402 you are guaranteed a great time."
"August 25, 2018",Great Views,"This is a quick trip but definitely worth it! You get some great shots of the city and when inside, you also can see all the other bridges (photos of the them) from around the world. "
"August 23, 2018",Crown jewels and other royal treasures,"Buy tickets online ahead of time and go early to beat the crowd.  Start with the Crown Jewel (again, beat the crowd). That’s the one that gets busiest. Join the yeoman tour that starts at the moat by the entrance. The yeoman tour was entertaining and informative. If going to Tower Bridge, go to the Tower of London first."
"August 22, 2018","""Off with their heads""","A fabulous day out. Bought my tickets online so slightly easier to go in, however ticket line wasn't too long at 11am. Beefeaters/Yeoman were obviously amazing with the tourists for photos and very helpful. Answering questions without hesitation. The Bearskin soldiers were also there rigid selves... exactly as they should be. Wearing all that on a hot day without fuss.. yes they are trained but treat them with respect. The crown jewels are beautiful and loved the travellator to go past them. Kept the flow going. Shame that didn't carry in past the other items displayed. We spent a good 4 hours there. Thoroughly enjoyed it... won't say too much though as don't want to ruin your trip."
"August 22, 2018",Guided Tour by Yeoman of the Guard,An entertaining and very informative tour by Clive. Packed with historical facts and amusing stories that kept the large crowd’s attention for an hour. The tour was free and leaves every half hour from the entrance. Well worth joining- thank you Clive!
"August 21, 2018",Excellent must see,"The tour is fantastic. Must do Beefeaters tour. If your going to see multiple palaces, look into getting into the Royal Castle Society. "
"August 20, 2018",family day out!,"we spent 6 hours and just left because kids were tired, not bored! great historic place, nice cafe and great facilities. Strongly reccommend. loads of history + the crown jewels. put on the comfiest footware available, you will need it!"
"August 20, 2018",Valuable time spent here,Our 13 yr old was totally awed by the Tower of London and all its history. We loved it too and enjoyed the easy pace we could go from area to area. We took the River cruise to the pier and that trip was wonderful. 
"August 19, 2018",Must see!,About a 55 minute guided tour. We really enjoyed our “Beef Eater” named Spike...very informative and very entertaining! Got to hear some interesting British history before viewing the royal jewels🇬🇧. We were then able to walk the grounds on our own till closing time. 
"August 19, 2018","Fun and educational, a great visit for young and old","My niece, grand children and I enjoyed a wonderful half day at the Tower of London. Our beefeater guide was very knowledgeable and fun, sharing many historical tidbits. We would have loved to spend more time there, but had a different activity planned for the afternoon. We arrived at 9:30AM and enjoyed a guided tour with a beefeater, then visited the crown jewels before exploring on our own. Nimble feet are required for climbing up and down many steps."
"August 17, 2018",Absolutely excellent!!,"We used our LNER train tickets to get 2for 1 admission, this makes a trip fantastic value for money.We joined a tour by one of the Beefeaters called Mark, well from the very start he was hilarious, he made the history of the Tower very interesting and is a fantastic asset to this establishment. The whole tour and visit was excellent and well worth a visit."
"October 9, 2018",UK history,"I loved this place. It is full of history. Visiting in October is quite pleasant. Weather was great and not too crowded. We arrived early and there was no wait for the Crown Jewels. We also saw exhibitions on torture, the ravens and the guided tour. However, as a non-native speaker, I found the guided tour a little difficult to understand. I would recommend the audio tour if you have trouble understanding accented English."
"October 9, 2018",Holy crap this place is cool,With deep history seated in the foundations of England monarchy this place blew us away. It’s hard to believe the age of this venue and the extent to which it helped form today’s world. The free tour was worth the wait when we first arrived - highly recommend taking the time to be on one of these tours. All the stories from monarchs to ravens to the zoo provided a great sense of the importance of the Tower. The Crown Jewels exhibit was stunning - but would have been nice to take pictures. Overall a very memorable attraction.
"October 6, 2018",Rich History,I was plesently surprised by this attraction.  I honestly had no idea about what this was before gaining admission through our London Pass.  There are guided tours which I highly recommend that tell you the history of the Tower leading into the tower.  Then end of the guided tour will leave you in the cathedral where the public is halted from admission until the tour is over (around 45 mins).  From there you can use the audio guide to explore on your own.  The main attraction is the crown jewels which can queue very quickly.  The lines move steadily but make sure you don't miss out on that!  I highly recommend this attraction seeing as it plays a huge part in history.
"October 6, 2018",Well organized interesting historical site,Nice free guided tours - full of humor and history. Impressive presentation of Crown Jewels. After the visit you can walk over the Tower Bridge to the south bank of Thames river
"October 4, 2018",Excellant part of history,The tower of London is a excellent part of history to see. The crown jewels were the best part. The rest is a typical castle and tower similar to what you see around Britain.
"October 2, 2018",Who goes to London and doesn't visit the jewels?,"Not saying you can't go through life without doing so, but I wouldn't recommend London without recommending the Tower of London and the Crown Jewels. You're seeing a part of past and present intertwined, all the time marveling at the majesty of it all. From the craftsmanship of the jewels to the construction of the buildings. Also very striking to see such and old and historic landmark in the midst of a modern and vibrant metropolis. I recommend you visit. "
"September 30, 2018","Must see in London, skip torture areas with small kids","The Tower of London is a must see on most lists, and I'd agree.  Watch the lines to see the Crown Jewels.  They can get really long, although they ebb and flow throughout the day, I'd opt to do those early or near the end of the day.  The line moves faster than the signs say.  I'd also take the time to see the video of the coronation in the Crown Jewels area even though the line continues to move.  Step out of line, sit down and take 5 minutes to watch.  It gives a lot of context for what you will see shortly.  It makes it more real, especially for kids.  Also, if you have small kids, you may want to skip the Bloody Tower.  There are enough jails and references to prisoners without it.  Be sure to walk the tower walls along the outside for a great view of the Thames and the Tower Bridge.  "
"September 25, 2018",What fun- The Beefeatets,This would have been just another typical historical outing if not for the Beefeaters!  They brought the history of the tower to life and with humor.  This was my first tour upon arriving and much jet lagged so didn’t linger and read up or explore other areas.  Certainly a not to miss site but only if you take the tour with the Beefeater!
"September 23, 2018",Off With Their Heads,I felt like I was stepping back in time when I entered this complex of Roman to modern historical buildings.  There’s so much to see here that it would be well worth doing a two-day tour.  The Tower ravens and the Beefeaters were added bonuses that I hadn’t anticipated seeing.  
"September 20, 2018",My fave place in England ,"Haven't been in 25 years and finally had the opportunity to take my family. Well worth it, despite the large crowds. We purchased our tickets on line (don't forget to print out as you must bring the paper copy) and got a decent discount. Our favourite part was the different towers and walking along the battlements. The kids were fascinated with the Beefeaters and it was apparent that they were a wealth of information. Loved the history and traditions associated to the Tower.We didn't see the crown jewels; the queue was insane. All in all the history is fascinating and a must-see in London."
"August 15, 2018",My 3rd visit to the Tower of London and still fascinating!!,"The crown jewels were breath taking! The Beefeaters took us back in history showing their role and their function in the castle, wish we could visit their pub! The folk law of the Ravens and interesting twist to the history of the Tower! This is a must see in your bucket list!! "
"August 15, 2018","As Always, Worth Visiting","I’ve been to London a few times and even lived here in college, yet the Tower never ceases to entertain and enlighten me. Brought our teens here first off on arriving and got the AUDIO TOUR which was totally worth it. (Beefeaters are great but huge crowds make them hard to engage with/hear.) Absolutely do the audio and send your teens on their ways. Somewhat long line on a Monday into White Tower, but mostly sane otherwise. (We we’re in the nabe again today’s and we’re surprised that at 11 AM line was looong but moving.) The kids liked the Bloody Tower best. Of course. "
"August 14, 2018",The Yeoman of the Tower are the BEST guides,"I love listening to the guides here.  They are so funny, so informative!  The white tower is so incredible with displays.  Of course, the crown jewels are worth a look - but NO PHOTOS!  I highly recommend this stop.  "
"August 14, 2018",Warden Tour with Spike,"Just enjoyed the Warden tour with Spike. His talk about the history of the Tower was informative and amusing. We were taken around the inner walls and shown The Traitors Gate, The White Tower. The tour  ended in the church of St Peters where many of the traitors headless bodies were buried. Thoroughly recommend these tours. "
"August 13, 2018",Coped with crowds ,"It was extremely busy being a Sunday in August. Line was almost around the block but moved fast once open. If you can, get your ticket online and take a printout so you dont have to wait in ticket line. Arrive early also. Once inside, do the crown jewels first to avoid the ever increasing line. Enjoyable."
"August 12, 2018",Multigenerational group loved it. ,Our group ranged from 11 to 80 years old. There was something of interest for everyone. We did this as an added ticket to the Big Bus tour and it was perfect. 
"August 9, 2018",Step back in time...,"The Tower of London is one of my favorite places to visit in London. There's so much history there, and the Beefeaters are not just knowledgable, they're also entertaining. Our 10 yr old daughter had a great time working on the puzzle/mystery that they set up for families, and also really enjoyed the hands-on exhibits in the top floor of the castle. And of course, you can't go to the Tower without seeing the fabulous Crown Jewels! The one ""negative"" I'd say is the on-site cafe; the food was a little pricey, and not very good. If you can, probably best to eat elsewhere."
"August 8, 2018",It was a lifelong dream to see this...,"I love history, especially English history, and going to the Tower of London thrilled me. This is a beautiful, fascinating place, full of secrets, life, and death. Seeing Traitor's Gate gave me goosebumps, likewise the execution site on Tower Hill. Since I was quite young I have loved to read information about British kings and queens, and knowing I was walking in the footsteps of many of them took my breath away. Seeing the Queen's Jewels, the ancient armor in the White Tower, just feeling the ambience of the old buildings (some 800 years old--amazing!) left me speechless. There were places to eat, benches to sit and rest, but so much to see we could have easily spent several more hours there. Easy to get to from the Tube. I highly recommend seeing this if you're in London! (There are some tours you can sign up for once you're there, but we wanted to do it on our own.)"
"August 7, 2018",Great experience,This was amazing.  My ultimate goal was to see the Crown Jewels and boy was it fantastic.  A must see for anyone.
"August 5, 2018",Fascinating history & those Crown Jewels!!!,"Wonderful historical setting and the museum of armor is really worth seeing!  Be sure to take the free tour by the Warders (those guys in the Beefeater outfits.)  Funny, informative and really, really interesting.  The Crown Jewels are incredible as is the overall experience!"
"September 18, 2018",Amazing,"I loved the Tower of London. It was so beautiful and interesting. There was so much to see and do. If I had more time, I could definitely spend hours and hours there. The Crown Jewels were definitely a highlight. "
"September 14, 2018",Great tour!,Loved this guided tour with the Beefeater!  Enjoyed hearing historical perspectives. Saw all key sites as a group and then took time to see the Crown Jewels as well 
"September 8, 2018",Amazing Tour,"We absolutely enjoyed our tour of the Tower of London. We started in the moat with a Beefeater learning about the their history and the Tower of London’s history. How amazing this place is and so informative and intriguing. I never knew all of this English history, and we just loved learning and visually taking it all in. The Crown Jewels were magnificent. This tour was one of the highlights of our visit to London. Don’t hesitate to take this tour. We went on a Monday and the lines were very short and we easily went through it all in less that 3 hours. Don’t miss the first hour of the tour with a distinguished Beefeatter, he was so humorous and impressive. I did not know that a Beefeater or Yeoman Warder must meet the highest of standards. They must have served for at least 22 years in the armed services, be a former warrant officer or senior non commissioned plus hold the long service and good conduct medal. Amazing men and yes a few women of these high standards share a wealth of knowledge with grace and dignity. It was truly outstanding."
"September 8, 2018",Tower of London,A Must see! A Great view of a famous landmark! Memorial of the crew who built the bridge was touching!
"September 5, 2018",There are only 3 great world professional world tours and this is one of them,"If you have never ever visited London before or you have never ever been to the Tower of London this is a must see. It is one of the oldest castles or fortresses in the UK the Romans built on this site when the conquered Britain.The price at first seems high, but what you get is a world beating tour by one of the Beefeaters who served in the British Army who knows about the history of the British Isles. Part of your cost is tour around the tower by one of the Queens own Beefeaters who will inform you all that is needed to know about the Tower. So the cost includes a professional tour not many places in the world will offer this and by one of the Queens own guards. They are funny and informative about the Towers history and you could say they are the guardians of the Tower of London. The River Thames flows by with many a tale about the river and it deeds. One of the most famous British Monaches (Henry Eighth) lived and used the Tower of London mostly for beheading the queens of Brtain. Sir Walter Raleigh was kept in the Tower of London. The Bristish Crown Jewels are on show and if you like your Jewellery you will want to see the British Crown Jewels.The castle is home to the Rook and must stay within the Tower. Children will love the walls the Towers and the buildings and visting the Armoury, which houses one of the biggest military unformas, but more medievel. It is a nice family visit. You can see the Royal Mint within the Grounds. The tour is just out of this World and a must see to understand Londons and Bristish history.Its is worth the money not many places in world give you a great insight to a countries history.David"
"September 4, 2018",Must visit! ,If you are visiting London for a few days you MUST visit the Tower of London. It’s story is both frightening and amazing. I recommend starting your visit by a free tour with a beefeater as they give you interesting stories about this ancient castle. You can complete your visit by your own afterwards. Arrive early as this attraction is quite busy starting noon. 
"September 4, 2018",Must-see in London,"From the Crown Jewels to the Bloody Tower, this site is so packed with history it will take you hours to see it all. . . and I suggest you do.Be prepared for crowds, and lines for the two places mentioned above; the good news being they move steadily."
"September 2, 2018",Buy tickets online,"We bought our tickets online from the Tower of London website to get the best price. They do offer a discount for those 60 and older. Arrive before opening and go directly to entrance line. We took others advice and did the Crown Jewels first, no crowds plenty of time to look at everything. White Tower was also a favorite. Stop and take a moment to read the displays they are very informative."
"September 2, 2018",how can you not enjoy the beefeater guides?,The beefeater guides are great---they get everyone into it. There is a moving sidewalk type thing for the crown jewels--as a woman I would have liked to have tarried there a bit longer than it allowed. The rest of the tour is very good. Sometimes there are people in medieval dress on the grounds to demonstrate some things for you. I bought tickets before arriving so no waiting in line. 
"August 30, 2018",Terrific Take,By the end of our journey we weren’t sure we felt like venturing through another museum on a warm day but were so glad we did! The best part is the terrific wit and historical knowledge from the Beefeater guides who live on site. Although a huge group it is still possible to follow and hear. The Royal jewel collection is spectacular but the highlight is definitely following the Beefeaters!
"August 29, 2018",Tower of London ( Beefeater Spike),"Myself & my family visited today, absolutely fantastic day out , what made the day was without doubt beefeater spike , his knowledge humour & the way he had the approximately 100 strong tour listening in silence one minute then falling about laughing the next was amazing Absolute credit to the tower spike 👍🏻"
"August 29, 2018",So much to learn!,"Our visit to the Tower of London was one of our trip's high points.  We learned a lot and it was neat to see the crown jewels!  I recommend getting there early - we had no line to get in and a short line to see the crown jewels, but a couple hours later the line for the crown jewels was quite long."
"August 29, 2018",Interesting!,"We’re told that it’s the #1 must see in London so off we went. It was raining when we went and it would have been more fun for sure if it wasn’t. Nevertheless, it was interesting. It was great to be surrounded with so much history and beauty at the same time."
"August 29, 2018",Historical Goldmine that never fails to amaze!,"As a history fan, this is easily one of my favourite buildings in the world! The amount of history in this one building is astonishing!!! Even if you are not a fan of history, you cannot possibly visit here and be bored. There is so much to see from the royal armouries to the Crown Jewels.I have been twice now and still want to go again. There is quite a lot to see so allow plenty of time to visit everywhere. Unfortunately, there is usually one or two areas closed off for renovations but with a building this old, it cannot be avoided.From a price perspective, check the 2for1 offers. There is usually a National Rail offer. Even if you do not have a valid train ticket for that day, simply head to the nearest rail station and buy their cheapest single way ticket. My partner and I did this and got a single train fare for £4 which allowed us to do the 2for1 and save around £20.Please do visit this place! Britain's history is amazing and this one building holds so much of it."
"August 28, 2018",Pinnacle of our visit,"We took the tube to the Tower of London from our location in Paddington. There were not huge crowds at the ticket office, but once inside, tons of people. The priority was to see the Crown Jewels and there was a huge line (at about 11:00 am on a weekday) but the line seemed to move quickly and there was good people watching while we waited. Inside the Tower of London, there were many artifacts on the walls as well as a chronology of historical events that make the Tower such an interesting place to visit. No photos are allowed inside. There was a conveyor sidewalk when you finally reach the Crown Jewels so you can't just stand there for hours (and drool!). I finished one side of the conveyor and then jumped on the other side so I could view every aspect of the jewels. They were magnificent and well worth the wait. From there, we took in part of the live theatre in the Last Days of Anne Boleyn and were drawn to the accompanying musicians. We toured the Fusilier Museum and viewed the history of this Royal Regiment from 1685 until present day. There's a fairly large food court where a variety of hot and cold refreshments are available.  I got the Fish and Chips and they were excellent and a good value. We continued to walk around and found our way to the Torture Dungeon to visit the ancient tools of punishment.  The London Bridge is close by and a nice fellow from Australia offered to take our photo with the Bridge behind us.  Nice. We would have liked to have taken the free guided tour but ran out of time and energy. I bought the Tower of London Book so can read all about it. This is a quintessential sight to see if you are in London. Highly recommend, but if you can avoid the mass of fellow tourists, that would be the best way to experience it. You can get a wi-fi headset if you want to know all the details."
"August 27, 2018",Highlight of our trip!!!,"My family of 4 (2 young teens) LOVED the Tower or London.  A definite highlight of our trip!  Our Beefeater/Warden was excellent and we all learned so much!  We got there at opening and did the crown jewels first - no line!  Then we went for the 10am Beefeater tour, and while we started out with 40-50 people in our group a lot wandered off as we moved from place to place.  Hint: don't wander off!  I wish every tour guide was this fascinating and funny!!!!  Plus, the Tower itself is just really cool. "
"August 27, 2018",Stunning!,"Hours upon hours could be spent here, viewing the crown jewels, art collection, armory, architecture, and more.As with St. Paul's Cathedral and Windsor Castle, order your tickets in advance from your hotel's concierge to avoid waiting in very long  queues."
"August 27, 2018",Must See Tower of London,"If you can only visit one historic site in London you have to make it the Tower of London especially if you have kids. It's an amazing place with tons of very interesting history.  The Yeoman Warder tour is absolutely a must. These warders are extremely interesting, knowledgeable and FUNNY.  The Crown Jewels are amazing. Get there early before the long lines in the summer."
"August 27, 2018",History preserved,This is always a favourite when we are in London.  So much history and the tours make it come alive.  Just walking through this amazing group of buildings is breathtaking.
"August 26, 2018",Spike Beefeater 402,We took the Thames River Cruise from Westminster Pier to the Tower of London. We were very fortunate to have Spike as our tour guide. He shared the often gruesome history of the Tower and made it so interesting. The 55 minute tour flew by. We highly recommend visiting and taking the tour with the yeoman warder. You will be very pleased if Spike is your guide.
"July 19, 2018","Great value, tons of history, not to be missed","Take your time and try to see it all. It's very guest friendly and rich with history. The Crown of Jewels and White Hall are the 2 musts, if you're short on time."
"July 19, 2018",Must See! (and part of the London Pass),"If you are going to spend a few days in London, make sure you get the London Pass.  It makes all of these sites very affordable.  As a history teacher, I tried to hit up all aspects of London's past, and the Tower of London was near the top of my list.Arrive early if you are there during peak tourist season.  The crowds become almost obnoxiously oppressive near mid-day, and with climbing in and out of small areas (esp. twisting stairs) can be overwhelming.  Go to the crown jewels immediately, as the line is slow, and the sooner you can get into the cattle corrals the better :)  The people mover that they have installed inside near the usual spots that tourists linger helps the process along, and if you want to get a better view, you can always get off and start again.Try and meet up with one of the costumed interpreters as they are giving a tour, as their breadth of their information is quite impressive.  Most of them seemed to have a good sense of humour too!If your legs are still functioning and your thighs aren't screaming, it's only a short walk to the tower bridge after you are down with the Tower of London.  The 400+ stairs up to the top are a nice way to continue the workout :)"
"July 19, 2018",Amazing Experience ,"Book in advance on line to save money but even if you pay full price £29 for adults it is still excellent value for money. One of the best attractions I’ve visited - could easily have stayed for a whole day, especially because the weather was glorious during our visit. Do head for the Crown Jewels experience as early in the day as you can to avoid long queues though and definitely take advantage of the Yeoman Guard’s tour. Will definitely be visiting again!"
"July 16, 2018",good history lesson and a reminder of when British ruled the world ,very good day out for the whole family alot to take in but every child must visit as these days they have no idea how powerful we were once.  also very  entertaining not a boring history lesson.  
"July 15, 2018",Disappointed on second visit,"We'd been to the Tower back in 2000 and did the small group tour with the Yeoman Warder guide. Did the same thing this time but didn't get the full experience. They took us into the church and told us about the bloody history, but said that due to the heat, they were not doing full tours. I guess people were fainting and there had been 3 heart attacks. Understandable, but would have been nice if they told us this upon entrance, since we paid for the special tour. Bummer for our teen who'd never been."
"July 14, 2018",Crown jewels and lots to explore!,"The Tower of London is an amazing fortress with lots to explore!  Most people make a b-line for the crown jewels, and that was definitely the way to go.  We arrived at the tower shortly after it opened, and the line to view the jewels were already over 30 minutes long!  So we joined the crowds and got in the line.  We waited outside for about 20 minutes, and then another 15 or so inside the building, where there were at least interesting things to see.  The crown jewels are viewed via moving sidewalks, which is great because it keeps people from standing at the jewel cases for extended periods of time.  Be sure to go on both sides of the jewels, and go through as many times as you would like. We also explored the White Tower, which I think is the most tower at the Tower of London.  It has a lot of suits of amour, and an amazing metal dragon.  It's 200 steps up, and a long walk down a spiral staircase, but it is worth the trip.  You could easily spend a full day exploring the Tower of London.  there are several small towers to explore, and a walk along the fortress walls is a must."
"July 14, 2018",Excellent must see,Highlight of the Tower of London is the Crown Jewels Even more amazing in person.  You can’t take pictures inside the Crown Jewels area but captured a lot of other memories in history through out the rest of the tour.Highly recommend this as a must see in any trip to London.There is a line usually to see the jewels but it moves quick quickly. Worth the trip.
"July 14, 2018","Get there early, do the beefeater tour!","The beefeater tour does not start before 10 even though it opens at 9, so my best suggestion would be to do the crown jewels first, then the beefeater tour. It's included in your ticket. Our yeoman, Spike I believe his name was, was absolutely fantastic, delivering the history of the tower with dedication and lots of humour. They must have vocal training to be able to speak over the planes frequently flying in the airspace above London. The other parts of the tower are well suited for adults and children alike, but there are quite a few steps in the white tower. Unsure about accessibility options there. Booking online is cheaper than buying on site, and you don't have to do it at any time in advance."
"July 14, 2018",A MUST visit when in London!,This is where all the action was way back in the day. There is so much history here. The Beefeaters give a great tour. We spent two hours here and wished we had a little more time.
"July 13, 2018",Get there early!,"By getting in line about a half hour before they opened, we were able to get to the Crown Jewels right away, which is EXTREMELY worth it, as within 20 minutes there is a line that wraps around and takes over an hour. Buying tickets online saves a few pounds.Also, big recommendation that you go to whatever theatrical performance they are producing at the time. We saw a show about the last days of Anne Boleyn's life and it was PHENOMENAL. 35 minute, free show outdoors with music and wonderful performers."
"July 13, 2018",Huge Place ! ,Make sure wear a comfortable walkin shoes as its kinda huge place. Many tower inside that have different history like bloody tower etc. In the crown jewels tower you can’t take photos and often have long queue takes less 20mins to wait. Along the area have some guards which you can take photo together :) I dont see shops inside that you can buy some water or snacks. Only one icecream kiosk with two handsome crew 😂. So make sure before you go in you have energy already or eat first. Inside some area to seat as well as toilet. So far worth to visit and outside have the nice view of the London Bridge. 
"July 13, 2018",Almost one thousand years of history in the heart of London,"It is a magic place full of intriguing stories of torture and death of important and not so important characters in England History. It is also a place where you can admire the jewells of the Crown. It is important to watch some videos on the web or read something about the place before going there, it’ll enhance your experience during your visit. Do not miss the oportunity to see this place."
"July 11, 2018",History everywhere,"We didn't really plan ahead too much when visiting the tower, so ended up doing so on an unusually hot summer day. We didn't get there at the right time to join a tour, so we wandered around the tower at our own pace, occasionally listening in to any passing tour groups to pick up little tid-bits of information.This is a truly amazing landmark/museum. So much history packed into such a small place. The only disappointment was how long it takes to get through to the crown jewels. Be prepared to wait for quite a long time outside before you can make your way into the exhibition space. For us on this day, that meant a long wait in the sun.Once inside you get to explore the collection at your own pace, with no set time for you to move through, really allowing you to make the experience as thorough or as brief as you want it to be.This was one of those things that was great to do as an iconic tourist attraction, but I'm not sure I would find value in going through again. Though I do recommend it to those who have the time."
"July 11, 2018",Do the Beefeater tour,"We happened upon the tower without a plan and purchased entry. It was a great experience. You must do the included  Beefeater tour (it meets at the entrance every half hour I believe)!  We had Dave and he was AMAZING!! I have a feeling they are all really good. So much history I could have spent much longer inside but we ran right up against closing time so be sure you give yourself plenty of time to explore after the tour. We went at 3 and that day it closed at 5:30 and we did the beefeater tour (1 hour), Crown Jewels, very fast white tower and very very fast through the torture tower before we ran out of time. "
"July 10, 2018",so much history,Much history in the Tower of London. If you are a fan of English history stopping by the tower is a must. 
"July 9, 2018",Wonderful historic place with a gruesome past!,"An iconic piece of English history well worth the visit. Whilst the crown jewels are staggering there is so much more to the Tower of London. The history, the stories, the armoury and the old chapel is beautiful. We found going early to be there when it opened was well worth it to see the opening and miss the crowds."
"July 7, 2018",Highlight of our trip,Took the Yeoman Warder tour and it was a memorable experience.  Everyone enjoyed the attraction including my 11 year old.  
"July 5, 2018",Beautiful and very interesting,"Had 1 day in London, asked cabbie where to go, he said Tower of London, he was right. Pomp and ceremony, beef eaters and stories, Crown Jewels. History galore, meusem and lunch on site. A visit to remember. Thanks cabbie"
"July 3, 2018",Good history lesson,"This is a good London history lesson. It was interesting to see the torture devices as well as the castle defenses. It’s a lot of walking, so bring comfortable shoes! "
"June 30, 2018",Beefeaters Galore!,"The Tower of London has a lot of great history but was very crowded and not easy to get to by the Tube. We joined the Beefeater tour, which is about 60 minutes. He covered a lot of interesting historical facts; all the Beefeaters were willing to take photos. Buy your ticket online to avoid lines."
"June 30, 2018","Great, but don’t waste time on the tour","The Tower and the wonderful jewellery is a must to see and explore! Get the headphones so you can walk around this amazing place, but don’t waste your time on the guided tour! Take the tube to Tower of London and it an easy walk! "
"June 30, 2018",Great attraction.,Entry to this attraction was covered by the London Pass. We arrived at about 12:30pm and were surprised that we could walk straight in without queuing!There were quite a lot of people especially groups of junior school children on the day. They obviously cater for school children with special guides and lessons.It is difficult to see everything in detail so grab a map of the complex and plan your time. You could spend at least half a day here!The Crown Jewels and the torture room are the most popular and you may have to queue for half an hour at each. The White Castle and the Crown Jewels were my favourite part of the visit - also the mint.
"June 27, 2018",Great old building but too busy,Expensive tickets and even more expensive on your time to see anything like the dungeons or Crown Jewels. We gave up due to the heat and left. I am sure if you can catch a quieter day following the beef eater around would be great fun.
"June 27, 2018",The Crown Jewels are beautiful and easy to see.,Go early in the day as the lines to buy tickets and to get into the tower can be long.  The grounds of the castle are not crowded.  Usually there is a line to see the Crown Jewels but it goes quickly.  The jewels are outstanding!  They also explain who/when the various crowns are worn.  There are places to buy food.  Do not forget to see the ravens!  Some will be flying around in the castle and some will be in their homes.
"June 27, 2018",Be ready to walk to see it all,"Huge placeBe ready to walk if you want to see and cover it allIf lucky you might also get to see the massive ravens they breed there and you would be in awe of them seeing them croak with all their might. They are still fed 180 gms of meat and blood soaked biscuits as part of their diet.Too many things to see and capture on the camera.Must see the crown jewels, the objects used to torture prisoners, the beautiful grass covered moat, the tower walkaway and the museum housing the weapons and armorsBe prepared to spend a couple of hours to see it all and then one can relax at the cafes just outside the tower and soak it all in"
"June 27, 2018",Tower Bridge,"Douring my stay in london I visit a famouse London Bridge - Tower Bridge, was great experience that i saw there."
"June 25, 2018",A MUST for history buffs.,"The first day you are in London learn about the Underground ( or Tube)  Buy an Oyster Card at your first station. Use it to enter and exit all tube stations and buses. 4 to 5 million people a day use the tube.  It is confusing at first, but study maps and it works.  Train run as often as 2-3 minutes at time.Buy your ticket a day or more ahead from a City information Center. You save some $, and you do not have to wait in line when you get there. The place gets busy so I recommend being there at least 15 minutes before it opens at 9 AM. Tower Hill Tube stop on the Circle route is easy to get you there.Inside the Tower go to the moat and join an hour long Beefeater lead tour.  You will learn most about the tower history. You may want to go see the Crown Jewels first, depending on time.Lines get long for Jewels later in the day. Pavement a little uneven in spots so watch your steps.  We were there about 4 hours. That is a minimum to see and understand the place. "
"June 24, 2018",A must visit,We spent about 4 hours here and found it immensely interesting.Highly recommended. The queue was non existent. Also buying tickets online is much cheaper than buying on site.
"June 24, 2018",The tower,"The tower  of London  was  much better  than  we expected.  Just  walking through  the  courtyard one  can  feel  the  history. The Beefeaters, the crown  jewels, the places where moats once were. It is a definite  MUST for any visitor  to  England!!!!"
"June 24, 2018",Lots of History!,"My biggest tips: 1. Buy tickets in advance to skip the long lines. 2. Take the free ""Beefeater"" guided tours that happen every 30 minutes; it's highly entertaining, and you'll see more and learn more than you would otherwise."
"June 24, 2018",Power to the Tower,Visited the Tower of London on a package deal from buy a gift that incorporated a river cruise on the Thames as well.We started off by going round the wall and the exhibitions along the way. The rooms are all very historic with good information about there past.The Beefeater tour was great he was very funny in his delivery but also very knowledgable.The White Tower was really good with loads to look at and if you have children the last room as lots of interactive things for them to try.The Crown Jewels are well worth the queue to get in. 
"June 22, 2018",Simply Wow!,"This was our 8th visit to London however our 1st to the Tower of London. First of all we were surprised at the size of the place. In every corner there was something to see, hear and learn. The condition of the castle was excellent, having been undergoing continual renovation for years. We thought 2 hours would have us ready to leave so we made arrangements to meet others however we could easily have spent 2 more hours there. We highly recommend it."
"June 21, 2018",So Much History,"We visited the Tower of London primarily to see the Crown Jewels.  We visited the Jewels and then joined a tour with one of the Beefeaters.  The history shared during the initial explanation of the property itself is unbelievable, but once you begin visiting the exhibits you actually realize how our ancestors were forced to defend their property and their Country.  This is a definite must see."
"June 20, 2018","WOW, Lot of History","beheadings, Crown jewels, lot of history. There is a lot to take in. You could spend the whole day here and we spent little more than half. Get there the moment it opens and go straight to the crown jewels. Do not pass go. This is a must if you do not want to wait in the long lines. Also you must take the tour if you want to see the graves of Anne Boleyn, Thomas Moore, Lady Jane grey. They are inside the Abbey on the grounds and only accessible with a tour. When you go into the armory upstairs they have the armor of Henry VIII. Very cool. Enjoy    "
"May 30, 2018",Families first visit to The Tower ,"We took our family to London and wanted to give them a ""taste"" of the depth of the history of the city. We choose the Tower as a key stop. The Beefeater your is totally worth it and necessary. Really helps to put the place in perspective.  Loved the Crown Jewels and the wonderful moving carpet in front of them. Genius idea. So many nooks and crannies to explore. The Tower of London is a must do. "
"May 30, 2018",Yeoman warder talk was superb,"We decided to be tourists in the city we visit so often,  one of the sites we wanted to visit was The Tower of London, primarily to have a Yeoman warder tour.We arrived just as one tour was starting (they are every half hour), and were advised to visit the Crown Jewels then as it would be very busy later, good advice and glad we followed it!“Our” yeoman warder was Clive, there were over 60 people in our tour and he kept all entertained, imparting historical knowledge in a fun and amusing way for an hour.The rest of the castle was interesting to mooch about and it was a morning well spent."
"May 28, 2018",Magnificent Exhibits,We could see the various crowns and exhibits on display.A must see for all tourist visiting London.Also the view of London Bridge from the tower of London
"May 27, 2018",a Fabulous place to visit.,"There is so much to see at the Tower of London, you could spend a whole day here and not see everything.  The most important thing to see here, however, is the exhibit of the Crown Jewels.  There is THE most beautiful display of jewelry held by the Royal Family throughout the history of the family.  It is definitely a ""don't miss"" if you are visiting London."
"May 23, 2018",Great time at the Tower,We spent about 2.5 hours at the Tower.  We took our time walking through to see everything.  The Crown Jewels exhibit was extraordinary and is worth a visit just to see this.  Lots of stairs and walking involved here so dress comfortably. There was a cafe and ice cream stand for a light meal or snack.  
"May 22, 2018",A must to see in London,A great tour by the first lady Beefeater and I was blown aware at the history behind the Tower and it's famous towers. A nust by all visitors to London
"May 21, 2018",Closing the gate ,My colleagues and I were treated to a really cool experience. We go tot see the whole ceremony for closing the gate.  The Beefeater was incredibly charming and quite funny learned a lot of history. Would recommend as a cool tourist experience. 
"May 18, 2018",Tower ,"Lots of interesting history here. Get there early, plan on a line. Ex-etc to spend at least 3 hours to tour the tower. It is worth the time I believe."
"May 14, 2018",Marvellous ,"Me and my husband visited the tower of London and I can honestly say it was well worth the money. We went on the tour,our yeoman was spike and he was brilliant. The crown jewels are excellent. The only downside was the Bloody Tower was closed but other than that would highly recommend a visit "
"May 11, 2018",Excellent ,We visited recently and joined the Beefeater tour. Spike was very informative and humorous. Amazing to see Anne Boleyn’s resting place in the beautiful chapel.
"June 20, 2018",Tower of london,What an awesome place full of history.. take the yeoman tour.  It was brilliant the yeoman we had was a hoot and by God did he know his stuff. 
"June 20, 2018",Excellent!,The tower grounds are amazing...so much to see. We didn’t get the “London pass” so I had to get the tickets there. It was not a problem. Waited maybe 10 minutes then went straight through the gate. They offer tours every 1/2 hour I believe but it only takes you around the outside. We opted to wander and it was lovely. Spent maybe 2-2.5 hours touring.  
"June 19, 2018",Beautiful day for tour,Took a tour today with a private guide. Great way to do it so you get great explanations of what we saw and the history behind it. Bathrooms were clean. 
"June 15, 2018",Interesting and entertaining Yeoman tour,"We went in the late afternoon, about 2:45 or 3 pm, and at that time there was no queue, and we felt we had plenty of time to see everything. I think it might be a little cheaper to buy online. The history and grounds were amazing but the best part was Billy Beefeater’s tour (included in the ticket price). "
"June 14, 2018",Stunning Crown Jewels,"There's so much history in it. We had a guided tour but I wish I got the audio tour as well. The Crown Jewels was absolutely beautiful. It's definitely worth spending a whole day there. One complaint wass too crowded. We're there in May, around the same time as the wedding of Harry and Megan. Needless to say, million other people were there too to watch the wedding, plus sightseeing. And that translated into over crowding everywhere."
"June 12, 2018",Amazing must do in London!,"Steeped in history, this is a must do for all ages when travelling to London. We purchased our tickets on the day just after opening time and were luck to have no crowds or delays to contend with. We opted for an audio tour, but could have easily joined one of the Yeoman (or woman!) on their tour. An easy walk around all areas of the tower, with a few stairs thrown in, but nothing too hectic. We spent 4 hours here, but you could easily spend a full day immersed in the history of London. "
"May 6, 2018",Amazing history - be sure to have plenty of time,"Really enjoyable, so much to see.  Was quite expensive for a family (75pound) Unfortunately we visited on a very cold, raining and windy day (we were running out of days to go).  A lot of stairs as expected, but manageable, and a fair amount of walking, both inside and outdoors.  Many areas to view and fascinating history of course.  Extremely long queue to view the Crown Jewels so be prepared to wait."
"May 3, 2018",A brilliant place to revisit,"We hadn't been to the Tower of London for about 25 years so thought it was about time to revisit. The day was a great success. The Crown Jewels were displayed very well and the ""Beefeater"" guards were informative and enthusiastic. There were other highlights as well including the Armoury. The site was very busy with groups of adults and school children from this country and abroad but there was never any overcrowding or queuing. The food was also good"
"May 1, 2018",History ,"Had a wonderful day, the history was amazing. Leave plenty of time as there is a lot to see here. Definitely a must see on your visit to London."
"April 30, 2018",Tower of London - Great History!,"We definitely enjoyed the tour of the Tower of London, i highly suggest doing the tour with the guide, there is so much more information provided that you would not know by just walking around on your own!We purchased our tickets before (to skip the line) and i would definitely suggest it."
"April 26, 2018",Beefeater Tour!,"If you go to the Tower of London, here is my advice. Get your tickets online before you go. If you are traveling and don't have access to a printer then have your tickets held for pick-up. It's super easy and will save you a ton of time waiting in the ticket line.Also, get there right when it opens and head straight for the royal jewels. We arrived 10 minutes after the Tower opened and walked straight into the jewel room without a minute of wait time.Finally, make sure you take the free (with admission) Beefeater tour. Not only is it educational, but very entertaining. We've done this twice now and both times it has been a highlight of seeing the Tower."
"April 24, 2018",Want to go again!,"We enjoyed the Tower of London as part of a day tour of London. We got to meet & greet a Beefeater Guard, see the Crown Jewels and wander around the site. Would love to return and see even more!! "
"April 18, 2018","A must do ""Londony"" activity","You travel to London, you want to do the classic London things- you've got to do the Tower of London! The history of London seems to to start here, incredibly old history and the oldest buildings that you can follow the footsteps of almost a 1000 years of history through! Of course the crown jewels are cool but what I enjoyed the most is hearing the stories and taking my mind back in time with them."
"April 15, 2018",Don't miss this!!,This is a must see experience for all ages.   And men and eomen...  boys and girls.... from cannons to jewels.
"April 14, 2018",Great slice of history,No trip to London would be complete without a trip to the Tower of London. There is lots to see and do here. If you love history you will love this. So interetsting. This was my second visit and still learnt new things. 
"April 11, 2018",Choose the right time to visit,Do not visit if it's likely to rain.-- Guided tours (best part) are cancelled if it rains heavily.Do not visit at the weekend.-- Too busy to be enjoyable.Do not visit on a public holiday (or few days either side of a public holiday).-- So busy it feels like a theme park for tourists and not a historic place.If using a voucher - always check small print before planning a trip.-- 2 for 1 offers are not valid for extending periods of time and during the summer.Visiting during quieter times when the weather's good is important at this site. Wait for good conditions.
"April 11, 2018","The Jewels,","An interesting piece of history and a must see for history buffs, coming from the US and hearing about 10th century history at a place occupied since then, pretty interesting. The Jewels were interesting too, grand and imposing in their purple velvet! The commentary on the Beefeater tour was the highlight very much informative and inclusive, anyone visiting must take the tour. The restaurant inside the establishment was pretty good too, with a good choice of self serve foods at reasonable rates. Only negative was the want of enogh Washrooms and the locations for them."
"April 9, 2018",Amazing ,"I actually had my doubts about this one, but we stayed there for hours and it was fascinating. I recommend starting with the free 30- to 45-minute tour led by a Beefeater - it’s a great orientation with an overview of the layout and history. It seems like they run continuously through the day and they start near the entrance. "
"April 7, 2018",best free tour,there is a free tour offered once inside the tower which is led by a “beefeater”. our guide was Laurence and he was very funny and knowledgeable. the best tour of our trip to london!
"April 6, 2018",A no miss in London,"This is a no miss place in London, SO BRITISH and SO FULL of HISTORY, is a place you and your family will enjoy .  The most important?  the Crown Jewels...    A good tip of an amazing experience, take the Public Transportation Boat, from Westminister piers to the Tower Pier, it will cost you 6.5 Pounds only, you will enjoy the river, and then land in the Tower for a great visit...   Just fantastic.  For families, buy the special Family Ticket, is the most convenient option."
"April 3, 2018",You can't enjoy due to over crowding,"We booked in advance online and arrived to a big queue. We got in and went left to a small room about coin making. There were staff stood in these places but do not control the flow of people and so it was crammed in there, to the point that you cannot actually look at anything, we saw some coins, couldn't read anything and were pushed to the point of leaving and heading to something else. We left and joined the queue to the torture bit, we thought this was going to be worth the 20 minute queue and we love all that gory stuff but we get inside and come to the first room, great 3 different torture instruments on to the next room, oh wait there is no other room. We waited over 20 minutes to get into ONE ROOM.We headed to go and see the crown jewels but the queue must have been at the least a 40 minute - 1 hour wait in the pouring rain! We decided to knock this on the head too.We went to the toilet and couldn't take anymore and decided to leave. I spent £50 for us to be there all of about 35 minutes!If you want people to enjoy the tower of London you need to restrict how many people you let in! It isn't fair that people cant enjoy what they've spent their good money on because you let in as many people that turn up to the door! I've contacted their facebook page to see if there is anyway of getting a refund as we expected to spend at least a few hours there seeing everything but had to change our plans and spend more money elsewhere!"
"April 3, 2018",See the crown jewels,"The Tower is near the Tower Bridge and the Tower Hotel. It is a favorite destination of tourists. It is an official U.K. palace, and is also the very first castle of the monarchy (I believe), built by the new Norman king, William the Conquerer, after his 1066 A.D. invasion. The Britons kept adding to it. It also has a dastardly history, as Anne Boleyn, Thomas More and Sir Walter Raleigh were both imprisoned here. It was a first-class prison for the finest traitors, but they often met their deaths on the grounds. (There is a memorial where they believe they were beheaded.) The crown jewels are kept here and you can visit them. Sadly, the Queen does not allow you to photograph them. The gift shops are the best. The ""tour guides"" are highly trained and are usually ex-military. Only the best can be ""Beefeaters"" (palace guards) -- and you can meet the first two female Beefeaters. The grounds have an army barracks, and soldiers are on-site in their traditional garb. You can watch them guard and march -- and do not get in their way, as they have official duties. The jewels are kept in a series of room guarded with high-tech security and safe doors. The most charming part are the official ravens -- they, about 8 or 9, are usually very big and hungry. They are sleek and black and a kind of royalty themselves."
"April 2, 2018",English heritage rip off,"So you can buy tickets online for £22.70 but then you have to queue up when you get there to collect them, why you can't download a ticket onto your phone is beyond me. When we eventually got in the queue to get to see the Crown Jewels was huge and to be perfectly honest we didn't fancy standing around in the drizzle for however long it would take to get to see them. We queued for fifteen minutes to see the torture tower, two exhibits, if you're interested in means of torture go to the London dungeons. So after two and a half hours of queuing, not seeing very much and feeling totally ripped off we left. The philosophy seems to be get as many people in as we can and get their cash. Save yourself a heap of money and hours of your life you won't get back and give it a miss."
"April 2, 2018",Excellent tour by Yeoman Warder Jason Woodcock,"We have taken the tour of the Tower of London several times before.  This time we had an excellent guide - animated and informative - Yeoman Warder Jason Woodcock.  His presentation lasted about one hour then you are free to visit the crown jewels, the White Tower and the Torture Chamber on your own.Admission was included with the London Pass.  Without the London Pass, adult admission is £22.70.  We had one of the first guided tours in the morning.  It can get very crowded.  There were lots of school groups the day we visited."
"April 1, 2018",Amazing place to visit-Must do!,"I’ve visited London on many an occasion but I’ve never been to The Tower of London. We visited today with my 2 young girls 8 and 5 and I have to say it’s the best tourist attraction in The City!  So much to do and see, lots to explore and worth every penny of the entrance fee. special mention to Yeoman Warder Lawrence who gave us a tour and was highly entertaining, enagaging and incredibly informative-i would recommend a Yeoman led tour to everyone. "
"April 1, 2018",3 to 4 hours easily can be spent here,"We went through pretty quickly as we had lots on our agenda. The history, armour crown jewels were amazing. Wish we had time to see all the other towers in here. Kids loved it. We did end up seeing the 62nd celebration of the Queen's coronation because of the day we visited here!"
"June 11, 2018",Great historical site with plenty of British history,"The Tower of London consists of a number of individual buildings each with its own story to tell. The Beefeater tour guides are terrific and tell very colorful stories of the Tower and those who were here. Allow a good three hours to see the majority of the site and expect to be waiting in long lines (queues) for a while.  The wait for the Crown Jewels looked worse then it was as it moves quickly. If you plan ahead, buy tickets online and print at home to save 15%. There’s a reasonably priced cafe on site and lavatories in multiple locations so the visit can be low stress if you’re not in a rush. "
"June 10, 2018",Steeped with History,"We visited this site at the insistence of my twenty-something Goddaughter, who had studied this building in Secondary School.   We were not disappointed.   Viewed the various sections of site, and learned about the multi-century history.   There can be long lines to enter due to security screening, so build that in your time there.  Easy to get there via the tube."
"June 9, 2018",Amazing sense of history, I was blown away by the sense of history at the tower to be able to walk where people walked hundreds of years ago was incredible you will really enjoy your visit here the crown jewels for beautiful 
"June 7, 2018",Pretty interesting,"If you are here in the off season, you will probably have a great time. The history of the place is amazing, but in the most hectic time it is unbearable. "
"June 6, 2018",First time at the Tower of London,"I’ve visited London many times but had never been to the Tower. We enjoyed it a lot and found the directions helpful and the displays were fascinating. Also loved the live outdoor theatre with musicians and singing depicting the execution of Anne Boleyn, which was an added bonus to bring the Tower to life. Ate a healthy lunch in the restaurant. "
"June 4, 2018",Learn about England’s History,The Tower has a tremendous amount of history. Suggest you take one of the free guided tours. The Beefeaters give you so much detail it really adds to the experience. Have to go look at the largest diamond in the world. It’s over 500 karat. 
"June 3, 2018",Amazing fortress,"I thought the Tower of London only head the Queen's jewels. Boy was I mistaken when I got there (due to lack of research). I paid for the tickets beforehand. The lines aren't long to get tickets, but I avoided all that. Once in the tower you can wait for a tour to hear all the historic stories, join a tour, or walk around by yourself. It is beneficial to go with a tour, the guides are great storytellers and keep you interested in the history of each area. After the tour, we walked around seeing the Crown Jewels, medals of honor, and walking through the towers seeing those histories and interactive modules. During the day there are also plays that occur. You can sit with some ice cream that is sold to take a break from walking up stairs and watch the show. I would recommend setting at least 4 hours aside if you like history and want to see all the tower has to offer."
"May 31, 2018",Fantastic for British history fans,"If you love British history like I do, this is a must-see stop. The architecture of the buildings is fantastic, three queens were executed here (and their remains are within the chapel), the crown jewels are here, and a guided tour with a yeoman warder is a must-do. To see it all, you definitely need four or five hours. The views of the Tower Bridge from this location are fantastic.After touring the Tower, there are river cruises along the Thames right outside the exit to finish off your day in this part of the city."
"May 31, 2018","The jewels, the armour, the ravens, the tower - it's a big day out!","We had a lovely afternoon out here, exploring the buildings and displays (especially the armour, human and horse!), checking out the royal bling, and visiting with the tower ravens. Due to the size of the site there was no need to pre-book, and while some parts got crowded on and off we only backed out of one place that was just too packed (the so-called ""Bl**dy Tower"", which earned it's name in a whole new way when people tried to tour the narrow, small roomed, multistepped display with huge prams! Just don't.).  Overall on a weekday afternoon we felt the lines were manageable. Some tips...Maps - Print off a site map before you visit, especially if you will not be doing a tour or not buying an audio guide. We could not find any free maps to the site once inside (except for the audio guide orientation map which some people left on benches), and we found some of the signage hard to follow, had trouble finding things, and wasted a bit of time as a result. Crown Jewels - There was a changing of the guard type display near the Crown Jewels building - as we had already seen similar at Windsor, we took that opportunity to get into the queue while it was shorter. Once in, while you follow a predetermined route around the displays, do not be afraid to loop back around individual cabinets or sections to look again, and if you are feeling rushed and space allows, just step back and let people go by while you have your fill of gold and jewels. Ravens - Keep an eye our for the ravens but don't get too close or you'll just spook them and irritate everyone who's trying to take photos of them. Make a point of visiting their enclosures and learning their names!Shopping - Be aware that there are five themed gift shops, so if you plan on buying souvenirs, grab what you like as you find it in case you don't see it at the next one, and visit specific ones for specific items (I went to the Ravens Shop near their cages to find raven specific items). Note that the Tower of London is listed in 1001 Historical sites you must see before you die, and we visited it using our annual Historic Royal Palaces pass for 2 (which we purchased to enter a range of Palaces (including Kensington, Hampton Court, the Banqueting Room - see separate reviews)."
"May 31, 2018",If you love history.... or sparkly things- this is a cracking day out.,"A thousand years (and more) of history on display here, and winter, in term time, seems to be the perfect opportunity for a visit since there are no crowds, no queues and you can linger looking at the Crown Jewels for as long as you like with no hassle.Take one of the wonderfully non-PC tours with the Yeoman Warders, they are hugely entertaining and our guide (Spike) was very funny."
"February 15, 2018",History books coming to life!,"1) You MUST do the Beefeater tour. 2) You MUST allow yourself enough time to walk around slowly, read everything, take it all in and ask questions.  3) This was the highlight of our week.  This is the thing you can't skip.  If you have only one day, pick it over the Palace.  It's just FASCINATING.  "
"February 15, 2018",BEEF EATER!,Had a blast checking this place out. Wasn't our original plan but found out westminster abby was closing early so we went here instead. SO MUCH HISTORY here. Had no idea how great it was. We could have easily spent 2 more hours just checking stuff out. Clive the Beef Eater was a great help. Took us into the chapel  when it was too cold and gave us an overview of everything. You really need to check this out.
"February 14, 2018",Of Course It's Excellent,"You have to go!  You must.  The Crown Jewels along made it worth it.  Such an evocative place; even among summer crowds, you can feel the history of the place.  I was a little nervous about the signs posted all over the White Tower warning you about all of the stairs and the fact that after a certain point, there was no way out but up.  However, I didn't find it to be claustrophobic or strenuous in the least.  So, if you've got mobility issues to consider, don't let the warnings scare you away!  It's worth a look around.    Definitely plan to visit the Tower Bridge afterword; you're in the perfect spot for a great photo.  "
"February 13, 2018",Great experience! ,"This visit was well worth the time and money. Awesome guide - made the whole experience fun and informative! The history you learn here is awesome. Crown jewels were just icing on the cake. Exhibits are very well done. Overall as an experience, it was one of my favourites in London. Highly recommend! "
"February 12, 2018",Good place,"Visited the tower of London in January 2018. At the entrance you will be handed over a map which contains the places and directions you need to take. It's pretty self explanatory. Ensure that you have sufficient time at hand to cover all places as I only had an hour with me (as the tower closed down at 5pm owing to winter in the country). The jewels are a must see! All the jewels that have been accumulated, including the famous Kohinoor and Cullinan diamonds are on display here. Photography inside is strictly prohibited."
"February 11, 2018",Barbaric Political Intrigue!  Don't Miss It!,"First time visitors to London  --  DO NOT MISS THE TOWER!  History!  Ravens!  Great fancy costumes!  Decapitaion!  It's all there for the history buff, the architecture buff, or those just fascinated with Man's inhumanity to his fellow Man (and Woman!).  I took the self-guided audio tour, which was worth the money.  The guided tours seem great, too, but I arrived at the wrong time to catch one.  Plenty of pubs nearby to quench your thirst when you're done."
"January 30, 2018",Heritage for sale,"We got as far as the price boards for admission.TWENTY EIGHT POUNDS EACH!SEVENTY POUNDS FOR A COUPLE AND THREE CHILDREN!FIFTY POUNDS FOR A COUPLE AND TWO CHILDREN!Well, I don't know about you, but I am just a working man on a day trip to the capital city.I simply can not afford these prices.A lot of our heritage (here I mean ALL of us) is locked up behind the Tower walls.If you want to see it.........PAY UP!"
"January 29, 2018",Must do!! ,Tower of London is a must do while visiting. Definitely do the Beefeater tour. It is only 45 minutes and it gives a lot of history. Visit the Crown Jewels while you are there! 
"January 26, 2018",History,"Visit to the Tower of London was most amazing choice I have made while deciding what to see during my stay in London. I vote the Tower of London the first thing to see, or if you can see only one thing than it has to be this. "
"January 25, 2018",A History Lesson you won't soon forget!,"This is a must thing to do when in London - especially if you have a family. We bought our tickets online and went to will call to pick them up - we got our tickets and were starting the guided tour in a total of five minutes! Our guide (one of the Beefeaters) was excellent - extremely knowledgeable and funny, which kept everyone listening to what he had to say. The tour is part of the ticket price, but it's optional to take. The great thing is that you get a 45-60 minute introduction to the different areas and stories of the castle, then you get to go explore on your own. We were there about 2 1/2 hours, and could have been there longer. Once you're done go to the river side of the castle and walk across the Tower Bridge."
"March 24, 2018",Eerie and SO COOL!!,The Beefeater was AWESOME!!!!  Loved his stories and the history he lives to share.  I would go back just to relive the stories and see the jewels.  It was unforgettable and a MUST SEE!
"March 23, 2018",Excellent Day Out,"Having watched the tours of the Tower on the Internet, the tour in person was great still. Our guide was Yeoman Sergeant Rob Fuller, a solid Ex Navy Chap, with great whit and humour, keeping your attention all the way through, this stunning site.  It was busy, but saw everything I wanted, great insight into both national and international history.  "
"March 13, 2018",Surprised,I had a free Day in London and thought I’d walk to get a picture of the tower. I ended up paying for the tour of the grounds and really enjoyed it. It was a bit pricey but the tour was interesting and seeing the Crown Jewels was cool. I would recommend this as a destination if you have time in London.
"March 4, 2018",You have to go,"I had not visited the Tower since I was 7 years old, and was very favorably impressed.  I went on a cold day around 3:30pm during poor weather....and it was the perfect timing.  There was hardly anyone there, so I could go through the crown jewels twice with zero waiting.  I also enjoyed the armory in the Tower itself, and strolled along the walls, stopped by the chapel, and visited the old mint.  All this in what felt like a very leisurely 1.5 hours.  Super enjoyable to wander the grounds and enjoy the views over the Tower Bridge, etc."
"March 4, 2018",Beefeater tour,"Knowledgable tour guides, amazing sites, terrific stories. We had an amazing talk in the chapel, the queens buried there and the reasons why. Well worth a visit. Don’t forget the 2 for 1 vouchers online!"
"March 3, 2018",Something you shouldn't miss,"Such a place to visit. Honestly, I was going to skip this place during my visit in London, yet I visited since I had free time in between my plans. I am so glad I visited. Amazing architectures gives you to experience London's historical atmosphere. The place was bigger than I expected and very stunning to see. View of the Tower Bridge from this place is another scene you can definitely enjoy. Make sure you give yourself enough time (i.e. about 2-3 hours) to tour this place and also check out the place from outside after the sunset."
"February 28, 2018",The jewel of London.,"A visit to the Tower is a must. Located at the heart of London, you can take a 15 minute cruise from Westminster to reach it. It is almost 1000 years old and has rarities including the awe-inspiring royal jewels. I am sure you might not have seemed so much of gold and gem jewellery earlier. But it closes at 4.30 and you need at least 2 and a half hours to fully get a feel of it. So reach there in time. The entire staff here is Anglo-Saxon. No coloured or black people."
"February 24, 2018",Go.  And make sure you do the tours.,"Second time visiting, still haven't nearly covered everything this amazing place to offer.  This time went for one of the tours by the Yeoman Warders which starts at the moat every half hour and ends in the chapel where Anne Boleyn is buried.  Do it.  They have a fantastic and detailed command of the history of the place and will deliver it each according to their own personal, highly entertaining and memorable idiom.  These folks tell a cracking yarn!  I've seen video of one of them holding forth and it was one of the funniest speeches I have ever seen.  YW Anderson today was no less talented - by turns hilarious, gory and tear-jerking, always genuinely interesting and informative.  There are interactive re-enactments in the grounds, random 'prisoners' roaming around who are happy to be waylaid and questioned, and the Warders throughout, inside the buildings and out, all of them super-friendly, entertaining, evidently in love with their jobs and and  extremely knowledgeable about everything from Jack Ketch to the eye-watering ablutory arrangements in the White Tower.  Impressive collection of weapons and armour, interactive exhibits for kids of any age, even delicious food in the cafe. This is a brilliant day out."
"February 20, 2018",A must see,"We visited the Tower of London with the tour, but is unnecessary to do so. A wonderful place to see the crown jewels, and walk around."
"February 18, 2018",What a Glorious Place Indeed,Great place for walking around and taking in the scenery.  Admission is included with the London Pass.  Worth it to see the Crown Jewels.  Many buildings here right beside one another to investigate.  London is so beautiful and truly the best place to visit in the world.  Had a memorable time.
"January 24, 2018",LONDON TRIP 2016,"The whole experience was simply fantastic. everyone in London is so friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. the tower of London is a must see. your a bit overwhelmed but at the same time excited. I visited this in April 2016. ( so i would suggest visiting in April. and I did not visit in 2017)"
"January 22, 2018",Fascinating experience for kids - GO EARLY!,"First thing - if you aren't in line before 1100 for the Crown Jewels then think about going a different day - we got there at 1045, stood in line for 10 minutes and went through in a non-hurried, non-rushed manner - even got to circle back on the moving walkway to view the jewels from both sides - by the time we came out at 1145-ish, the line had, without exaggeration, multiplied by 10! It was already spilling into the courtyard. Go early, do the jewels first. then take the kids on the Beefeater Tour - my boys (13 and 9) loved all the bloody stories! It is a fun, informative tour."
"January 19, 2018",Australians visiting family in UK,Very good. The Beefeater (Yeoman) free tour is a must. Our guy was great. Very informative and entertaining. Used the 2 for 1 entry you get with a rail ticket. It was very quiet the day we went. 
"January 19, 2018",Simply Fantastic,Allow ample time to get around this gem. It's been 22 years since I last visited and still in awe! Couldn't find the dress up for a photo opportunity for the kids as had done in years gone by
"January 18, 2018",Fascinating,"The only reason that this review is getting 4 stars instead of 5, is the fact that everything started closing around 3:30, before the wife and I had a chance to see everything. The amount of history at the castle was incredible... They have a nice Jewelry exhibit, museum of British military regiments and show the old living quarters of those who once called it home. There is a small reserve of UK soldiers patrolling the grounds. You will see them standing posts and marching about. Dont get too close. You can also wait and go along with a tour guide (in costume) to walk you across the entire premises, giving you historical knowledge along the way. The wife and I opted not to go this route, because it would have taken too long... Other than that, if you visit in January, be prepared for the cold. Would definitely visit again. "
"January 18, 2018",favorite landmark London,Get there early because it gets packed.  Make sure you join a tour given by a beefeater.  The Crown Jewels are beautiful!
"January 16, 2018",Fantastic!,Amazing history in a wonderful setting. Must do the guided tour with yeoman Warder! Set aside at least 2-3 hours to see it properly.
"January 15, 2018",January 2018 visit,"Yes, it was quite chilly this week when we visited, but - hey - it’s London in January! Always love this stop in London. What was great this time was the chapel tour with Spike. He was great!"
"January 13, 2018",Tower of jewels and batels,"Visited with hole family. Their first time, kids with 7.LOVED every detail! From the historicalAspect to the gran jewels safe showing!Amazing!"
"January 13, 2018",London Walks Tower of London,This is the second time we went to the tower of London with London Walks and we really enjoyed it.  Both times we learned new things and it is just a neat place to see and hear the history.
"September 21, 2017",A Must See In London,"There is so much to see here.  Allow yourself plenty of time to explore this interesting place.  We took the tour included with our ticket and it was well worth it.  Spike, our guide, offered a wealth of information as well as shared his humor.  He was terrific!  We then had time to explore on our own.  You will learn a great deal and enjoy your time here.  Don't miss it!"
"September 20, 2017",Amazing Gens and History,"I expected to be blown away by the Crown Jewels.  The Keepers were also most helpful to this tourist.  But the amount of history I absorbed was incredible.  The Tower is a large complex and includes a Regimental Museum, the Jewels, multiple towers including the prison towers and even the Café is a good place to eat.  Please do not be fooled into believing this is a small single turret place.  I took 3/4 of a day to do it justice and in September there were no real lines.  Of course I was in line for the opening.  this is on the London Pass."
"September 18, 2017",Dark History,My third visit to England and my second to the Tower of London...what an insight into England's bloody history! Such splendid guides who make each execution and each victim's torture come alive....not to be missed.
"September 15, 2017",Humbling,"In the United States, we consider buildings 200 years old to be special, yet in England you can stand on the very ground that William the Conquerer stood on a thousand years ago! You can sit on the grass where the scaffolding was erected to behead Anne Boleyn and you hear the eerie caw of the ravens throughout the complex.  There's also the sharp contrast of standing in the tower grounds and seeing the Shard - an  ultimate 21st century building  "
"September 13, 2017",Worth the money,"I booked tickets off the internet but couldn't get them to print from home. No problem, as long as I had the confirmation the person at the group sales window was able to print them off the morning we visited. Arrive early and go directly to the crown jewels. No waiting when we got there, but by 11:00 there was a wait. Absolutely take the Yeoman Guards guided tour which is included in the price of your ticket. As you listen to the guard you imagine what life was like back then. Also by taking this tour you are allowed into the chapel. People were trying to enter but were turned away because they weren't with the Yeoman guard group. It is a beautiful place and so much history. We debated about visiting this landmark, but we are sure glad we did!"
"September 10, 2017",Don't Bother if the Weather is Bad,"What an awful waste of time this was.  I really wanted to see this so I passed up the opportunity to see other places in London to go to this attraction and I was sorely disappointed.I got there just after 1pm and the weather was a bit cold and rainy, but Brits should be used to this. There was a sign saying the next tour started in 10 minutes so I decided to wait that there were not too many people there.  Well they don't limit the number of people in a group so by the time the tour started there was lots of people and I was near the back so I couldn't see the guide and could barely hear.  He said something about starting inside cause of the weather and then we all started walking.  I could not see the guide, but luckily there was a tall person with bright green coat in my group that I could follow.  We walked forever past all kinds of things were other groups were stopped and getting a tour until we ended up at the chapel.  We all crowded into the chapel and the group was so big that there were not enough seats for everyone, so many of us had to stand.  The guide spoke for about 20 minutes about the chapel and then said ""you've been the best group ever"" That was it, no tour of anything else in the whole complex, just the chapel.  I've been told the tours are normally an hour and I saw other groups outside.  So disappointed."
"September 10, 2017",Must visit,Tower of London encapsulates so much of English history it's almost impossible to imagine a visit to London without coming here. Beefeaters tour was excellent. Plus u get really good photos of tower bridge which is nearby. Don forgot to hop over to nearby borough market for a bite after.
"August 31, 2017",Makes history real,A very cool place to visit that makes history not feel so old and boring. We did the Beefeaters tour with Spike - we was funny and make everything easy to understand and interesting. There was also a humorous reenactment that was fun to watch.
"August 30, 2017",Interesting place in the history of England,"Visit on a clear and warm day to get  a feel of the place by sitting at the yard, and taking in the feel of it by watching enactments of some events."
"August 29, 2017",Beefeater 402 is a top fella ,My wife has been telling me for 2 years that we need to go to the Tower of London  now I'm a scouser but sorry folks my loyalties lie up north.....way up north. So to go to the home of the Hammer of Scots...Proud Edward boooooo was not right but go we did and we where shown around by Beefeater 402 Spike Abbott...2 words HILARIOUSLY EDUCATIONAL. In this day and age its unpolite to insult other nations BUT Yeoman Abbott your hammer hit the nail on the head when you spoke about words our American friends won't understand....HISTORY from the start he had us all eating out of his hand a spot on tour. Pity the chapel on the tower green wasnt open for our tour but the rest of the Tower and its buildings where open and where amazing....even longshanks' bed chamber.Well worth a visit go on a guided tour first though!!!!
"November 12, 2017",A Must See,"Definitely worth a visit especially on your first trip to London. I would give anywhere from 2-4 hours depending how quickly you navigate all the rooms, gift shops, etc... The Crown Jewels are a must, we waited about 30 minutes in line and by the time we were finished the line was double the size.  We started off with the free Yeoman guide which can be entertaining, but the group was so large we ended up doing the self guided audio tour which may actually give more information and lets you spend more time in all the rooms as you tour the Tower."
"November 8, 2017",Take the Guided Tour,"We bought  tickets as part of the Original Bus Tour package, and joined a tour by one of the warders at the entrance.  These guys are ex-military, with service at the Tower as an honor.    They entertain with great stories about the history of the Tower.  The Tower itself has various exhibits of weaponry, armor, and the Tower during WW1 and WW2."
"November 7, 2017",Spend a few hours and take a tour.,This was my second time to the Tower of London and I enjoyed both times.  It is so interesting so take your time to take it all in.  It is good to get as much information as possible so take a guided tour.
"November 6, 2017",Very interesting couple of hours spent in London,"The Tower of London is something you should not miss out on doing.   We joined a tour with one of the Yeomen of the Guard, that was the best thing we did.   Spike was his name and he was so very interesting and entertaining.  He was a great story teller and his tour went for an hour.  We learnt so much about the Tower and it's history.   After the tour we went and looked at the Crown Jewels   We also saw the Ravens in the gardens.   We loved this place so much.   You must take the time to visit it."
"November 1, 2017",Educational and Fun,I thought this place was so interesting! Lots to see and beautiful view of the Bridge. They even do reenactments which were rather entertaining. 
"October 31, 2017",sister in laws,"This was so interesting to see the head of Crown Jewels and learn the history. The Ravens stole everyone just looking and having photos with them, so funny. Watched the guards for a lengthy time very interesting"
"October 30, 2017",Cheers to Beefeater402 Spike Abbott,My wife and I spent the day at the Tower of London.  We were greeted by Yeoman Warder Spike Abbott for a guided tour of the Tower.  Spike was so detailed and fun!  We could not have had a better day!  Thank you @spike_abbottMark and Ginger LeVang
"October 27, 2017",Really Enjoyed This Historic Gem,Recommend you see the Tower of London Crown Jewels and Castle Grounds were great.The Armory was very interestingDefinitely take the tour with the Beefeater -- Loads of fun for everyone
"October 26, 2017",A London must - the Yeomen Guards make the day!,"I've been here twice and both times it has been fantastic! The Yeomen Guards do a tour that honestly makes the day and I would recommend doing. They are fabulous to listen to and bring the history of the Tower to life - I think the name of the guard doing our tour was Laurence (I'm not sure though) and I cannot remember the other guards name from our first tour but both were so interesting. There is so much to see there and the crown jewels are a must see! I've been with my boyfriend as a young couple, as well as with family - including a young teenager - so it really is a day out for everyone.We've been to nearly all the London attractions but this is by far one of the best."
"October 26, 2017",Great stronghold,"We visited the Tower of London in October in a Friday afternoon. The queue was quite small, we bought the tickets and enter the stronghold in no time. The entrance fee is quite overpriced for what it offers, i.e. 24.8 GBP, however at the tickets office they will charge you a small donation, without asking first if you are willing to pay for it. Just tell that you do not want to donate any if you like so.The stronghold is well preserved and there are free guided tours at certain hours. You can visit a small coins museum, the crown jewels, an infantry museum, and the white tower with certain weapons and armors. You can have fun spending couple of hours visiting the stronghold and learn about its history, however you may be disappointed if you expect in great collections of art items, pictures, weapons or armory. Also the furniture is quite poor.I recommend the visit, although the entrance fees is overpriced."
"December 30, 2017",The Ravens are HUGE!,"Great history, wonderful gift shop, amazing crown jewels, great tours and the ravens are enormous and a must see!"
"December 29, 2017",A must not miss destination if you're at all interested in history,"The Beefeater tour was the best part...they're engaging and passionate about sharing what they know with visitors. Even with rain / sleet, it was well worth the visit. The White Tour housed armor from through the centuries. "
"December 27, 2017",Fun for All!,Highly recommend visiting the Tower of London and taking the free Beefeater tour. Extremely entertaining at the same time informative. Even the young ones will stay entertained with the Beefeaters. The Crown Jewels was very impressive as well as the additional collections spread throughout the property. While this tower served a purpose many years ago it still houses 150 residents that include the Beefeaters who are decorated ex-military. While the ticket price is a little steep it is worth the visit. 
"December 24, 2017",not so much fun for disabled.,"Great Place,, with lots of history that lifts you up in a historical vortex,So many stuff happened here, and so many people, high and low, passed trough here."
"December 20, 2017",Love the history ,"25 years since my last visit but was girlfriends first .Time I got another large helping of English history something we really excel at.Well worth making use of the 2for1 offer by taking the train in to London if your visiting from out of town like us.‘Spike’ our Yeoman guard tour guide was great, funny and informative. These ‘beefeater ‘ tours are an absolute must for any visitor , plus  the outstanding jewel house what’s not to love"
"December 16, 2017",Just Go,"The tower is amazing. You should go and don't miss this opportunity to see things you will have never imagine seeing in your life. How long there? like 4 hours no rush. Bring a jacket, some rooms are cold and some places of the tower are breeze. Just Go!"
"October 24, 2017",My favorite place in London,"I don't care how many times I go to The Tower, it never disappoints. I just love running around it. It's essentially a castle in the middle of London. While the crown jewels are impressive, it's the tower itself that holds all the appeal for me. Go!"
"October 22, 2017","Expensive, overcrowded, bland",The Tower of London is pretty much always heaving with so many people and you must queue for a very long time to get into the individual exhibition parts within the structure itself. I really loathed it and regretted paying £40 for two people to enter.
"October 21, 2017",Unbelievable history at your fingertips!,"I was unable to visit the first time I was in London 20 years ago so this visit it was my top must-do. My husband and I arrived on a Saturday about 9:15am for a 9am open. The ticket and security lines were extremely short and we headed to the crown jewels first as had been suggested. There was no crowd there and we spent plenty of time being overwhelmed with them. We doubled back to take the 10am Yeoman Warder tour and had Spike as our guide. Spike was enthusiastic, patriotic and funny, he was the ultimate guide around the grounds---do not miss these included Beefeater tours when you plan your visit (It wouldn't be the same without it). After the tour we spent a ton of time wandering through the dungeon, Bloody Tower and several hours spent in the White Tower where we were blown away at the history and artifacts inside. I had no idea the White Tower contained so much. The ToL and the Yeoman Warder tours are a do-not-miss when in London."
"October 12, 2017",Join the Yeoman Warder Tour!!!,"One of the best sights to visit in London.  What made it special is the Yeoman Warder tour.  They start on the hour and half hour; you wait in the moat area for the Yeoman Warder.  Ours was a boisterous, bearded Yeoman Warder and he was fantastic.  The tour is only an hour and I wish it was longer.  Best of all, the tour is free, included in your ticket admission.  So be sure to take advantage and join a tour. Tower of London is quite a large area so you can easily spend 4-5 hours there.  The longest wait was the line to see the Royal Jewelry but the line moved quickly so not so bad.  The armory display is really cool; my teenage son enjoyed that a lot.  We had lunch in their cafe restaurant and quite surprisingly, it was quite good.  "
"August 17, 2017",Living history!,A stunning place full of history. The Crown Jewels are on display and they alone are worth the price of admission. 
"August 16, 2017",7 Days in London,"Just one of the many wonderful sites to see in London, it didnt overly work for me personally but the Crown Jewell's were a sight to see and its a short distance to many other London attractions."
"August 16, 2017",Wonderful and includes a free Beefeaters' tour too!,"We arrived soon after it opened and went directly to the jewels as recommended by Rick Steves and tripadvisor.  What a great move, no lines!  We then went on the 10:30 Beefeater tour and by the time we got back to the jewels building it was packed.  We were also lucky enough to watch the changing of the guards in front of the jewels - it was terrific!"
"August 13, 2017",It takes a full day to see it all.,There is so much here. Arrive early and plan to spend the day wandering around and taking it all in. Get to the Crown Jewels early and don't be set off by the long lines. The cue moves quickly.
"August 12, 2017",Always worth a visit,"It just isn't the same without the free tour from one of the Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters). They bring life to the history with more than a little cheek along the way, and are the only way to get to see the Chapel St. Peter ad Vincula. Just don't annoy them - these guys have done 20+ years in the armed forces and know how to handle idiots :) "
"August 11, 2017",Tower of London,Our guide made this tour. He was so knowledgeable and funny. Many of the guides use social media so you might find yourself in a group photo on Twitter or Insta Gram. My 14 year old daughter loved the time we spent at the Tower of London and we saw a raven up close. 
"August 7, 2017",Must Do,"The Tower is not to be missed if you have any interest in history. Expect a crowd, but it is worth it. Set aside ample time to really learn and enjoy."
"August 5, 2017",Entire family had a good time,Go first thing in the morning if travelling in the morning.  Go to the Crown Jewels first thing as it gets very busy by noon.   
"August 4, 2017",Interesting must see in London but get there early!,"The Tower of London is a must see site full of history!  Too best avoid the crowds, I recommend arriving when it first opens. Go straight way to see the Crown Jewels and you can walk on in.  Beautiful building and grounds!"
"August 3, 2017",Highlight of the trip, I found the Tower of London to be very interesting and a step back in time. Definitely worth a visit. Make sure to check out the black  ravens.
"December 5, 2017",A 'must see' attraction,"Arrived just after it opened for the day, we chose the audio-guided tour (you pay extra for it and can be booked in advance) lots of information and really informative, with extra bits about different areas which you can choose to listen too or not as you wish.  The Yeoman Warder ‘Beefeater’ also do tours if you'd prefer, there a stand giving the time of the next tour.If you love history, then you must visit the Tower of London it just ooozes history from almost every stone.  It was very enjoyable wandering through the building and grounds listening to all the stories. The Crown Jewels were beautiful, and looked like they would be heavy to wear.  After, before leaving we had a cream tea in the café with a cup of tea to warm us up - very yummy and proper Cornish clotted cream.Definitely recommend this as a place to visit."
"November 26, 2017",Crown Jewels are a substantial and extensive historical exhibit.,"Although admission is a little pricey, the Crown Jewels are a crowd-pleaser. The grounds inside the castle walls are a pleasant respite from the noise of the city of London. The Crown Jewels are worth a look, there are dozens of precious Crowns and Royal items on display. They make it worth a visit."
"November 20, 2017",Well worth it,"Such a classic experience.  We bought our tickets online and therefore skipped to the front of the line.  The audio tour was really informative and kept our young daughter engaged.  The Crown Jewels are amazing, but dont miss the ""reanactment"" of the attacks against the Tower.  Lots of fun. "
"November 12, 2017",Allow Time to Explore!!!,There is so much to see and do at the Tower that you can spend the better part of a day exploring all the sights.  Be sure and take the Beefeater's guided tour.  It is well worth it!  There is a nice café for lunch or tea.
"October 8, 2017",Must Visit in London!,"Definitely worth it to pay to visit the Tower of London. It’s huge and there is so much to see, including the Crown Jewels! Great for families and people of all ages, full of history and well-displayed. Highly recommend."
"October 4, 2017",A lot of history in one place,"The Tower of London is much bigger than I imagined. Photos I have seen were usually just of the ""White Tower"". There are actually 13 towers built of a period of hundreds of years. If I had known this little fact I would have allowed more time for the visit.Anyway, our English cousins advised taking the ""Beef Eater"" tour. I was a bit puzzled that this tour did not appear anywhere on the ticket price list, but there's a reason - it's extra, but it's free! I highly recommend starting with the ""Beef Eater"" tour which is guided by a real person. Not only will you learn a lot more of the history of the tower but you have the opportunity to ask questions.If you're a history buff, then touring the tower is a must do event. The buildings are incredibly well maintained - especially when you consider that construction began more than 1,000 years ago. One of the buildings even contains a selection of the crown jewels. These are not replicas - they're the real thing!Finally, there are public toilets on the site, and these are, thankfully, totally modern and impeccably clean.I strongly recommend this tour."
"October 2, 2017",Great for kids!,The beefeater guards/guides were very entertaining and great with the kids.  It was worth seeing the Crown Jewels. 
"September 25, 2017",Fun at the Tower,"Had a great day. Lots to keep you busy for the whole day. We began with an hour tour learning about the history of the towers, the Yeoman was very engaging for both adults and children, then went round all the buildings and got involved with the outdoor theatre that gives you even more insight. I would very much go again."
"September 24, 2017",Give a few hours for this site,"Lovely afternoon to walk around and see the history. A little difficult to get to all the areas if using wheelchair.  Try to catch a free tour outside with Beefeaters or inside at the chapel.  Always good to get a tour as you miss so much otherwise.  As always, try to watch a program about the places in England to be aware of so much more in advance."
"September 23, 2017",Interesting Experience!,This is a really interesting location to see. I especially enjoyed viewing the Crown Jewels! Ordered tickets online ahead of our visit. 
"January 11, 2018",Lots to see and do,This attraction was well worth the time. You can take a tour or go on your own. It is easy to spend a few hours here. The Ravens are amazing. Check out the jewels. Easy to get around and lots to see and do.
"January 5, 2018",Take your time!,"Really enjoyed our visit here despite a blistering cold wind. The Yeoman Warder ""tour"" is a great novelty, but isn't actually much of a tour. In hindsight, we would have gotten the audio guide for a self-guided tour and allowed much more time to visit all the outbuildings. We were a bit rushed and there's so much to see! Café onsite was a bit frenetic but had lots of good options. "
"January 5, 2018",Wish I had more time,Loved Tower of London.  So much history and stories.  Definitely something to do again.  All of the employees are so delightful and friendly.  The audio guided tour is excellent  LOTS of walking!  
"January 4, 2018",Lots of History,This place has so much history!  This place blew my mind thinking of all the Queens that were beheaded in the courtyard.  Try to spend atleast two hours here so you can see the whole thing.
"January 4, 2018","A must visit, lots to see","We loved this place, lots to see. So many towers to go through, one tower had actors performing it was very interesting. Plus you must go to see the crown jewels, lovely once in a lifetime type of thing. Lots of history, very educational."
"January 4, 2018",Well it is everything you expect!  Amazing venue,"It was April, and with the weather crisp, this was still an amazing tour.  We arrived, and were able to get in quite quickly, and found that in about 3 hours, you could do it justice.  All the rooms are amazing, the crown jewels quite stunning and the white tower itself quite cool.  The Line of Kings is neat."
"January 1, 2018",Worth the visit,A place which you can spend half a day. This is the place you should visit if you like history. A nice place but be prepared for the walking and stairs. 
"December 31, 2017",Must see with teens in London,I think all 5 boys thought this was the best place we visited.  Plan on at least 3 hours.  Take your time but beware the ravens.
"December 31, 2017","Yeoman Warder Laurence, best guide ever. ","We came specifically for this tour and were not disappointed. Informative, funny, fast moving and Laurence (forgive me if I spelt your name wrong sir) was the best. It's a must do for anyone visiting. "
"December 30, 2017",A must ,"Highly priced tickets and lots of turists, still a must. Tickets are easy to buy though. Reserve enough time to see jewels and armours. Special activities in the garden. "
"August 29, 2017",Crown Jewels,Keep in mind this is included in the London pass. I made the mistake of buying tickets for this specifically and the London. The Welcome center was able to refund my more money for the specific tickets
"August 24, 2017","Great fun, do the tour! ","This is a fascinating place to visit, whoever you are. However if you've never been before or even for a few years, do go on the free tour. Spike was our guide of the day and all the family had a great time. Lots of ""Horrible Histories"" style stories to keep the kids happy and a few wry nods and jokes to keep the grown ups chuckling. This really brings the whole experience to life. Booking online is quite a bit cheaper, and you can even do that the same day as long as you can print off the voucher. A great family day out!"
"August 23, 2017",Go early to avoid the crowds,"Pro-tip if you want to avoid the throngs at the ToL: go to the Tower of London early. It opens some mornings at 9am. Go straight to the Crown Jewels exhibition and you will have the place practically to yourself. We had no wait at all, and were able to comfortably see the jewels at our own pace. Then, go on the hilarious Beefeater Tour at 10am. By the time we were leaving (around noon), the whole place was packed and the lines for the Tower were outside the building and were quite long. "
"August 22, 2017",What has happened to this historic site,"I am british and have visited The Tower of London before but i have to say this will be my last time, what an earth has happened to the history that was once there? all that is there now are the crown jewels and a few things shown on the screens in indivudual rooms. Yeoman Warders had the most appauling attitude towards us and the cafe people really didnt want to answer questions on the food, it was just all to much trouble. All of the history that was contained in this building has gone its all about making money. Made me ashamed to be british. Dont waste your money folks go and do something else instead..........WHO EVER IS RUNNING THIS NOW NEEDS SACKING"
"August 19, 2017",Glorified violence and propaganda as well as dull - will never go again,"I can honestly say I was truly underwhelmed/bored by the whole experience. The Yeoman Warder had a prickly disposition and a wry sense of humour - though with the large crowd and his rapid verbal pace, I could neither understand nor keep up. He took particular relish with the story of executions, beheadings and a severed head sewn back on - though peculiar & interesting, it's in questionable taste to glorify this for amusement/whatever sick purposes one has by getting a kick out of the macabre. Very touristy - waiting in the queue would've been worth it had there been anything of actual substance inside the towers. I didn't appreciate seeing all the artillery and drab slabs of information in microscopic text (talk about the lack of visual aesthetic) and got the vibe the British were somehow advocating/proud of their efforts in the war (when is that ever a good thing?). The crown jewels were not much to behold either. 1 star goes to the novelty moving travelator - it was the best part despite feeling like I was in a sausage/cattle factory. I truly regret wasting my time here (even more than the hole burnt in my hip pocket from the admission fee)."
"August 18, 2017",One of the highlights of our trip,You can not come to London and not  visit the Tower of London.  Arrive as close to opening as possible and head straight to the crown Jewels so you avoid the lineups later in the day and then head back to the beginning.  Do not miss the entertaining Beefeaters story telling who will take you along on a historical journey as well as share funny antidotes.  Thoroughly enjoyed checking everything out.  We spent almost 6 hours here and worth every minute.
"August 18, 2017",Buy your tickets online and have a great time,"To avoid the line, buy tickets on the web, pick up, and walk right in. The Tower was my favorite touristy thing to do in London. "
"August 18, 2017",Lots to see and good value,we bought our tickets in advance so cost for family to get in was very good compared to similar prestige locations. Team there were very good from the guides to the Yeomen... they have loud voices!! Obviously the Crown Jewels are fascinating but lots more to see and simply look at and imagine a thousand years of history... its all well presented and informative and not too commercial!!  
"August 18, 2017",History at its best!,"I wanted to visit the Tower of London ever since taking some English Civilization classes back in college and our professor got me so interested in English history and especially in the Tudor era. We reached the Tower and I was a bit scared by the long queue, but it moved really fast. Do not miss the Yeoman Warder guided tour! They start every 30 minutes on the left hand side right after the entrance and last about an hour. Clive, our guide, was so amusing, entertaining and offered so many valuable information about the Tower and its rich history. It is definitely the best way to take in all that the Tower has to offer and the only way in which you can step inside the Chapel St. Peter ad Vincula."
"August 18, 2017",Don't miss!,"I hadn't thought I was interested in visiting the Tower of London, but my husband talked me into it. So glad he did. Fascinating place! Be sure to join one of the tours led by a Beefeater (dressed in traditional uniform). They're very entertaining and full of information. Don't miss seeing the Crown Jewels, either. Most of all, allow plenty of time for walking around and absorbing the centuries of history here."
"August 2, 2017",Awesome experience - Yeomen Warder tour is hilarious,"Thumbs up: The Yeomen Warder free tours that run every 20 minutes or so are hilarious and informative. The Crown Jewels display is very well down and the jewels themselves are spectacular.Thumbs down: As with most London attractions, entry fees are steep. The Crown Jewels display get very busy at times.Top tip: Arrive early and head straight for the Crown Jewels so you can take your time viewing them. Then head back to the start to join the Yeomen Warder tour.Conclusion: A fantastic experience and truly felt worthy of its price of admission due to the great displays and free walking tour."
"July 31, 2017",Crown Jewels the best part,"Arrived at opening and were able to see the jewels twice with no line. Teens found the tower tour a bit boring as it's basically an armory museum. Audio tour included a small bit about the wives of Henry VIII killed here but would have liked more details on other infamous prisoners, including William Wallace. Beefeater tour great and entertaining for all. Definitely a must do when in London.  "
"July 30, 2017",Tower Of London,"I visited the Tower of London on our family vacation last July. It was amazing, the main reason to go was to see the crown jewels. There were long lines, but it took us about 45 minutes to get into the vault area. I was just awe struck at how much gold I was looking at. There were other areas to see in the fortress, but we just wanted to see the jewels. I had purchased the London Pass before our trip. We caught the city river cruise boat at the London Eye, (boat cruise was included with the London Pass) and took it all the way down to the tower bridge to see the jewels."
"July 27, 2017",Top spot to visit in London,We enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London. We went on a busy Holiday weekend and had planned for about 2 hours to tour the entire grounds. We did not get to see the Crowned Jewels as the line was long and we only had limited time. I would plan for at least 3 hours if you want to see everything this attraction has to offer.
"July 26, 2017",Go here to see the change of guards instead of Buckingham Palace!,"We went here in the late afternoon, and although we did not have much time to walk around before closing time, we managed to see the changing of the guards. Unlike Buckingham Palace, you can get much closer to the guards here -- so close that as the guards being relieved of duty walked away, the told one tourist to ""Move away from the Queen's Guards!"" while giving the lady a bit of a gentle shove -- which my sons thought was so cool. Also nice to see the crown jewels, the tower of terror, and the armory building. "
"July 26, 2017",The Beefeater makes the trip!,"Great tour at the Tower of London led by a true Beefeater. Even on a hot July day, he was able to find shade to make the tour enjoyable. We learned a lot of history and enjoyed our tour around the grounds."
"July 25, 2017",Fascinating historical must see.,Recommend buying tickets online and arriving early.  We arrived at opening and had no wait for the Crown Jewels.  Yeoman tour fun interesting and highly recommend.  You line up at a meeting point just inside the entrance. We had a large group however had no trouble hearing or following along as they are expert tour guides allow at least 3 - 4 hours to get the most out of the visit.
"July 24, 2017",Family day out,"Get your tickets online before your visit, it's cheaper and easier. With children you find easy way to do everything. You can bring your buggy and park it inside. Great place to know about Monarchy History of GB. Your tickets are valid for all day long."
"July 23, 2017",A must see,Go early in the morning.  We were there by 9:00--opens at 9:30.  We had a London Pass and just had to get in line at the gate.  You don't have to go to the ticket booths to 'exchange' your pass for a ticket.  Go to the Crown Jewels first then tour the grounds and other buildings.  We did the Crown Jewels then walked back down to the entrance and joined the next Beefeater's Tour.  They are funny and very interesting.  The tours start at the entrance and finish in the chapel--1 hour.  The audio guides are decent but rather dry.  Following along where the listening sites are is not always clear.  
"July 21, 2017",Beefeater's Tour and Crown Jewels the bomb!,Tour guide opens your eyes to the history and brutality of how England was ruled by dictators for centuries. Crown Jewels to torture chambers..you will see luxury and slavery life styles. The Beefeater tour guides provide insight and humor to a medieval era where heads were removed at the whim of the king or queen. Do this tour!!!
"July 4, 2017",A Walk Through History,"I highly suggest getting the London Pass before visiting London.  With the pass, you get in a special line and get into the Tower quicker.  The first thing we visited was the Crown Jewels.  Luckily, we were one of the first ones in the building and got to spend time with the jewels and wasn't rushed.  I highly suggest getting a tour by one of the Beefeaters.  The Beefeaters has so much history about the Tower and took time to answer questions.  Spike was a wonderful guide.  The views of the Tower Bridge and the River Thames are wonderful from the Tower Walls.  This is a must see in London."
"July 2, 2017",The highlight of any London trip,"I doubt anyone would possibly consider skipping the fabled Tower while visiting London for any tourism-related purpose. Expect to spend at least 3-4 hours there, plus another hour for an optional Yeoman tour and, alas, some extra time for the ticket line (the latter can be severely decreased by booking online). "
"July 1, 2017",Great story telling ,Make sure to wait for the beef eater guide just inside the gate for the guided tour and storytelling.   Ours was great making storytelling of chopping kings and queens heads off funny.  If there is such a thing.   Lunch was ok at the one place to grab a bite.  Don't get turned off by the long line to see Crown Jewels.  It goes quickly.  We were backed up to the lunch place still only took 20-25 minutes 
"June 29, 2017",Go!,"The Tower of London is a must see for your visit to London. Definitely take the tour with the Beefeaters because they give you a real sense of the history of the tower (and they're funny and personable). They'll walk you through the key areas (traitors gate, the chapel, etc.) and tell great stories. You can spend the rest of the time exploring and meeting the ravens at your own pace. Two-three hours will allow you to see almost everything and there are great views of London Bridge. From the tube stop at Tower Hill, it's only a five minute easy walk to the ticket booth."
"June 28, 2017",Loved it ,"This was worth very penny to get in. The Crown Jewels were magnificent, worth getting the audio tour as it improved the experience."
"June 26, 2017",Very interesting ! Nice display of the crown jewels too,We had a very interesting visit to the Tower of London. You get insight in the horrors of the history of the Tower. There is also the crown jewels on display. Very interesting. You get to see them up close. It is a incredible to see all the crowns and other things in reality.
"June 26, 2017","AVOID PRE-BOOKING, but an absolute MUST SEE!","We spend 4 1/2 hours in the Tower of London, and were absolutely immersed in everything. TIP 1: Get there AS SOON as it opens, to avoid the lines. GO STRAIGHT TO THE CROWN JEWELS, and DEFINITELY do a Yeowman Warders tour. Our Warder, Clive, was so knowledgeable, humorous and informative... to captivate such a large crowd, and keep engaged and entertained is an absolute credit to him!TIP 2: AVOID PRE-BOOKING. You cannot get into the venue with your e-ticket, you have to exchange it for a proper ticket at an additional counter... This line (even at 9am in the morning) was 3x longer than the general ticket booths. Although advertised as 'avoiding the line'... you're not. Rather false advertising."
"June 24, 2017", Best tour,"Definitely take the Beefeater tour. Great experience, ends in their private chapel. We had Spike and he explains the history with so much personality. Answers questions amd engages the crowd. Lots of fun. "
"June 22, 2017",This is why it's my favorite tourist attraction in the world,"The Tower of London has such fascinating history, and the best way to hear about it is with a Beefeater tour.  Our guide, Mr. Anderson, was informative and funny at the same time, which made everyone (including our teens) enthralled with what he was saying about the blood and gore of executions, dark connections to nursery rhymes, and Royal dramas. I didn't want our tour to end - I could've followed him around all day!  I love the juxtaposition of dark history with the stunning Crown jewels (worth the wait) in a castle right in the middle of the city!"
"June 21, 2017",truly enjoyed the breadth of opportunities to go back into the experience,"Lovely exhibits and great support staff.  Enjoyed ourselves very much, especially looking at the artillery and reading stories"
"July 17, 2017",History within arms reach,"Just waiting at the ticket box you can't help but be in awe of the imposing structures known as The Tower of London. Once inside you can feel and touch centuries of history oozing from every brick and stone. This isn't a purpose built attraction, it was once the real life residence of Kings and Queens. A free tour with a Yeoman Warden as your guide is a must. Explore the White Castle and see the armour once worn by nobles and probably some who were ignoble. The queue to see the crown jewels was very long and as it was an unseasonably hot day we decided to give them a miss much to our disappointment. Allow plenty of time when visiting. Great day out. "
"July 17, 2017",Billy Beefeater was just magnificent,"Wow. Just wow. Our guide, Billy Beefeater, was funny, entertaining and knowledgeable. You can visit London and the Tower of London without the tour. But, why would you. The tour was wonderful. THANK YOU !!!"
"July 16, 2017",Family Vacation ,We enjoyed the white tower and the Crown Jewels. It gave you a good explanation of the British Monarchy.  You can spend a few hours. We had the London Pass so we went went in quickly. 
"July 10, 2017",Excellent - don't miss the Yeoman Warders tour,"To be honest, I was there to see the Koh-i-noor diamond, but what we got was a grand tour by one of the Yeoman Warders. We were told ""just do the Yeoman tour and the Jewels"" - you've see it all! They were right .. spent three wonderful hours there! Definitely on my ""to recommend"" list!"
"July 8, 2017",Of Course You Must Visit,"We took the Yeoman's tour (aka: Queen's Guard, aka: Beefeaters). They are all former British Military and live on premise. ""Shandy"" was our tour guide but I've heard positive things about all of them. Engaging and humorous even on a very hot, summer afternoon. Fascinating history about how people were buried within the tower site. The Crown Jewels and the history behind them should be on your agenda as well. We went into the White Tower built in the 11th century. It's really a museum to British armaments throughout history. What really fascinated me in the White Tower was St. John's Chapel, built into the 2nd floor by the Normans. Just didn't expect it and its history is interesting (to wonks anyway). The food at the Tower Café was good and we walked the ramparts. Well worth the learning you'll receive."
"July 7, 2017",Landmark of London. A lot of History. Must see. White Tower is my favorite.,"Buy online tickets and go early because it's get crowded. The headsets work perfectly and without them you miss a lot of important information.  You may need 4 hours or more to see everything. The best in my opinion is the White Tower where there is  armory and games and be prepared to walk up a lot of stairs. The Crown Jewels exposition has long lines and it goes smooth. We learnt about the History of the Tower of London over the time, the animals imported, the life of kings, the insurrection, troops training, execution of spies, etc. We missed the torture chambers."
"July 7, 2017",STILL THE BEST,"When in London, there are few experiences or places that can evoke such history and images of both death and life, medieval style , as the Tower of London does. As a complex, it is as beautiful as it is imposing. There is for Susan and myself, no other historical property in London that delivers so much value for money as this venue does. Plan to get in with a 2 for 1 entry of course, and plan to enjoy at least a half day here. Do see the Crown Jewels and do a Yeoman Warder tour if you can. The whole of it all should be seen, as it is not a cheaper entry. Get in before 2 pm in that they will close off sections at about 3:30, leaving you with just the glorious central White Tower to see and tour. This is of course the best part of the visit and is the place where so much history unfolded, you cant avoid the sensation of seeing these things of memory and lessons past pop into reality before your eyes. It is an exciting place to see and photograph, and even the areas around the complex by Tower Bridge and the Thames are wonderful to hang around at. The Ceremony of the Keys is awesome and having seen it 4 or 5 times, I am sad to see they put it online for tickets over the mail in requests of the recent past. This has put us all on a ridiculous waiting list of 2 years, so good luck seeing it now.  The Tower is a must see and do item, one can never tire of it."
"July 5, 2017",Love it,"Get there early to really enjoy it without the crowd. Beefeater tour is free and great, but it is crowded in the summer. "
"July 5, 2017",Go early ,"What a great day. Go early or at least within the first hour. Take the tour, it's included. Don't get too close to the ravens and of course, the jewels are stunning. "
"July 4, 2017",Beefeater tour is awesome ,"Tower of London was one of our favorite things we did in London.  If you do nothing else, definitely take the Beefeater tour.  They are very good; both informative and entertaining.  Also, see the Crown Jewels.  We followed the advice of Rick Steves to get to the Tower in the morning at opening.  Then go right to the Crown Jewels.  See the rest of it later, and take the Beefeater tour later.  I think the Beefeater tours go every 30 minutes or an hour.  We had no line for the Crown Jewels by getting there early.  We noted a VERY long line a few hours later while taking the Beefeater tour.I didn't realize until we returned home that I had missed some exhibits and areas that we could have seen.  I had purchased a book from the gift shop which enlightened me to this fact.  Therefore, take your time and try to figure out everything there is to see.  I wish I had looked through my book more thoroughly at the time I purchased it, so I would have figured that out.  Nonetheless, it was a fulfilling visit that I enjoyed very much."
"June 18, 2017",History and fun,"Our 2 kids loved the Tower of London (aged 9 and 7).  We ended up staying 3.5 hours which I didn't expectWe bought a Historic Royal Palace membership on the day , gets you access to 6 palaces , and if you do 2 then it is worth it + you get priority queuing.  TOL was not overly busy even though we went around 2pm and it was just after the large crowds had gathered for the 21 gun salute for Queens BirthdayHighlights for us were White Tower, Crown Jewels , and taking part in a humourous re-enactment ensembleNote in some areas you aren't allowed to film or take photos eg Crown Jewels But all in all, it was an interesting , educational and fun outing for the family"
"June 17, 2017",Beautiful gem in the city,"Neat place to see , especially with kids. There are many storytellers throughput the property and cool things to see"
"June 14, 2017",Great Tour,"If you go to the Tower, and you should, be sure to go on a guided tour. The guide was entertaining and informative. I was traveling with my college-aged daughter and she liked it as much as I did and she's not a lover of history like her mother. "
"June 13, 2017",Awesome!,Love this place! Got here right as it opened so it wasn't crowded. There's lots of stairs and climbing so if you're not up to lots of activity it probably isn't for you 
"June 13, 2017",Fun,"My son and I had a ball at the Tower of London. We joined the Garrison tour..so much fun, saw the amazing crown jewels and so much more. Must do in London."
"June 12, 2017","Tower of London, an amazing sight to see.","If you do nothing else in London, you have to see the Tower of London. This is an amazing fortification that far exceeded any perception that we had of the structure. Upon entering, there is an opportunity to rent a handheld audio/video player to assist you on your travels through the different rooms and dungeons of the castle. This player will provide you the history of each room and it's purpose. The Tower of London  contains the crown jewels which are on exhibit. This is a spectacular sight to see. It took us approximately three hours to make our way through all of the different rooms and exhibits that are contained within the Tower of London. This is an amazing piece of history which we hope to visit again if we return to London."
"June 11, 2017",amazing,Loved this visit to see the history and learn more about England's long history. Crown jewels were gorgeous
"June 10, 2017",Tower tour very informative,"We took the tower  Yeoman Warder ‘Beefeater’ tour offered complementary.  It was very informative, and really very enjoyable.  The tour only offered outside views of the tower buildings, but the tour Yeoman was very informative, and told some very interesting stories.  "
"June 8, 2017",Must go!,I would definitely go here.. The tours by the local guards is a must. Typically every 30 mins.. You can spend 3-4 hours here easily! Get there early in morning.. Around 9 and then do the tower bridge near by. Or Thames River cruises.
"June 7, 2017",Fascinating look at almost 1000 years of history,"So much has happened here throughout history, and you are right in the middle of it. SOme of the history of the Tower is gruesome, with two of Henry VIII's wives among those executed there. But re's also the Crown Jewels and plenty of other sights to see. Make sure you do a yeoman tour, which is included in the entry fee."
"May 21, 2017",Great Guide!,"We were lucky enough to happen to be put in a group with the world famous Billy Beefeater as our guide. Easily one of the most entertaining personalities at any attraction anywhere! Look him up on Wikipedia. Even if you have one of the ""regular"" yoeman warders as your guide, this tour is exceptional. A thousand years of fascinating history inside a medieval fortress. Add to that, the Crown Jewels. Leave yourself a half a day at least."
"May 20, 2017","London's best historic 'must see' site, brilliant guided tour","For me if I could only visit one historic site in London for a fabulous entertaining stunning day out it would be the Tower of London! I have been several times over the years and always love it and today was no exception. We enjoyed a brilliantly entertaining guided tour (for an hour and included in the admission price) with the very charismatic Yeoman Watts which was both hilarious at times whilst he also conveyed some horrific stories with due respect. Please don't miss the guided tour if you are visiting! So much to see, you could easily spend a day here, but can also cover the key sites in a couple of hours if you are pressed for time.  Such a great location.  We then finished off our day by then moving on to the nearby Sky Garden at the top of the 'Walkie Talkie' building which was about 5 minutes walk away (we had reserved our places for this online).  This had fabulous views over the Tower of London, the Shard and St Paul's."
"May 20, 2017",Impressive historical building,Definitely a place you have to see when in London. We walked all over the place and got to see a lot during the couple of hours we were there - anything less and you really don't appreciate the history. The jewels are impressive and we were lucky enough to avoid any kind of lines. Unfortunately it was a rainy day and so the Beefeater tours were shortened to the abbreviated version.   Great place and a must see. 
"May 17, 2017",Such an wonderful building,This time we only had the time to see the building from outside - but still so beautitul - we will be back at a later time to investigate more
"May 16, 2017","Brilliant,Don't miss this one",I've always wanted to do this tour but never got round to it.We were on an open top bus run and arrived about 2.25pm.we had prepaid so missed the queue at the entrance.The tour is taken by Beefeaters who are very knowledgeable on the history and the talks are interesting with dates names etc and also funny with the mickey being taken out of the people on the tour.Its all ligh hearted stuff.It lasted about an hour and covers th periods from its first uses up to the present day.Groups ate made up of about 30 people.
"May 14, 2017","If you have time for only one site to see, this is the one","We got there early and spent about 4 hours at the Tower of London.  I suggest you see the Crown Jewels first before that section gets crowded. Afterwards, I was hesitant at first but my wife suggested we take the Beefeater tour.  It was great!  Engrossing facts and history of the Tower and England with lots of humor. We saw many, many sites and attractions in London and we both agreed that this was our favorite site during our 5 day visit."
"May 14, 2017",Highly recommend to start the day,"My mom and I are in London from Canada and used our London Pass today. We started with the Tower of London because we had read that the lines could get long. We took the tube from King's Cross, where we are staying, right to the tower. There was clear signage that made it extremely easy to get to the entrance of the tower. We did not have to wait in a single line and found there were not very many people there when we arrived around 9:30 am this Saturday. We headed straight to see the Crown Jewels as we had also read that this usually has a long line. We were able to enter right away. It was a little frustrating inside as there is supposed to be no photography but a family that was near us kept pushing their way around and taking photos. This was not the fault of anyone else though. It seemed to be getting busier as we were leaving about an hour and a half later. "
"May 13, 2017",This was a must-see destination,We got in early as it opened and went straight to the Crown Jewels. We normally don't last more than 90 to 120 minutes at a destination but spend a full three hours at the Tower. Loved it. Lot's of history and great information. We went on the free tour and loved the insights about the Tower. 
"May 12, 2017",Interesting,A lot of history. Good visuals of items from history. My 13 year old nephew really enjoyed it as I did.
"May 11, 2017",A must see in London,"I love English history so the tower was a must see. We did the Beef Eater tour and it was amazing, even if you are not a British history nut you will enjoy this experience."
"May 8, 2017",must see,"You have to go to the Tower at least once.  Kids enjoyed it.  Very crowded on the day we went, long lines and couldn't get close enough to the Yeoman to hear the tour - which is usually excellent.  Buy tickets ahead of time or prepare to stand in line. "
"May 7, 2017",Pleasant Go-At-Your-Pace Attraction,"My wife and I arrived to the Tower with concerns that it would be excessively crowded. It was not (Thursday afternoon). We used Rick Steve's London book for a self guided tour. The location is gorgeous. While some attractions were more historic or beautiful, this is a must see location for the combination of interesting information, historical significance, and great views. "
"May 6, 2017",Such a fantastic place!,"This is a must see attraction in London! I suggest going in the morning as soon as it opens to beat the crowds. I also HIGHLY suggest joining the Yeoman Warder's tours. They operate every hour, are free, and are absolutely fantastic!"
"May 6, 2017",Buy tickets online. Go straight to the Crown Jewels.,"Go early. Buy a ticket online, print it out, and avoid the long lines in buying a ticket. If you want an audio guide, you can reserve that online as well. Do it to avoid the long lines. Once you enter, go straight to the Crown Jewels because the lines here can get really long."
"May 4, 2017",The Yeoman Warders are great tour guides,"This is a must do attraction in London.  Definitely join a tour by a Yeoman Warder, and keep an eye out for the ravens."
"May 2, 2017",Trip down London history,"We (me and my son) had a great time at the tower. When we got in we listend to the wards who learnt us a lot about the history of the tower and the other buildings, with great humor. The crown jewels and the castle ravens makes it a great visit. "
"April 30, 2017",Amazing ,"Highly recommended the audio tour, then the beefeater tour, both excellent, would suggest get there early, do the crown jewels first!  Or you are going to que alot!  Then do beefeater or audio tour, but do both, and then go a second day to see all the stuff you could not fit in on the first!  Amazing place!  Totally happy with our visit, and not stupidly expensive!  worth every penny "
"April 29, 2017",A wonderful place to visit,If you're going to London a stop at the tower is a must. I think most people know what the Tower of London is so here are some tips for a good visit:-Go midweek when the crowds will be smaller. -Go early and allocate at least half of the day. There is a lot to see.-Go see the Crown Jewels FIRST before the queue gets too big. -After the Crown Jewels go back to the moat at the entrance and take the Beefeater tour that leaves every 30 mins until half 3. The tour lasts about an hour and it will give you some great info about the tour. It's free. While on the tour pick the places you want to go back to see in detail. - Think about bringing a packed lunch to save money as the cafes can be expensive. 
"April 28, 2017",Amazing history!,"Spent 3 hours here and totally worth it! Beefeater tour amazing with James woodcock! He was entertaining, informative and made the history easy to understand. So much to see here !"
"April 27, 2017",Filled with history,"There's lots to see and do. Little boys will love the armours, knights and weapons and little girls the crown jewels! For grown-ups there's lots of interesting facts and even without taking a tour one can get a good overview."
"April 27, 2017",History and fun,My young boys really enjoyed it as they imagined what it would be like to live 400 years ago.  The armor was a higlight and we enjoyed the reenactment of the 4 groups who attempted to breach the walls.
"April 23, 2017","Gory tales, history and heritage","Take the tube to Tower Hill and the ticket booths are a short walk away. If you can, take a tour with one of the Beefeaters in their distinctive tunics and hear their absorbing tales of the past. It concludes in the historic chapel, which is the last resting place of three of Henry VIIIs wives who were executed at The Tower, Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey.The ancient central tower houses armour and weaponry, but the biggest attraction must be the Crown Jewels belonging to the monarch and including the crown, orb and sceptre used in the Coronation ceremony since the 1600s. Expect to have to queue, but the line moves quickly and once you reach the exhibits themselves you can spend as long as you wish viewing them.Expensive, particularly the new café. For economy take a picnic. The admission is still good value and the attraction is well worth a visit. Expect to spend at least 3 hours to see it all.If this review was helpful, please be kind enough to click the button below."
"April 17, 2017",Awesome tour!,The history is amazing.  The Crown Jewels alone are worth the price of admission.  Recommend getting a Historical London Palace pass to save time waiting to buy aticket.  The Beefeater tour is a must!
"April 14, 2017",Fun History,"This was an interesting site, full of history and intrigue. It is easy to leisurely stroll through and choose which areas to visit. Plan on about two hours to see it. I followed a Rick Steves tourbook recommendation and it was perfect. Purchased our tickets in advance on the website to avoid the lines, and arrived early. Start at the crown Jewels and then head back to catch a Yeoman Warder tour which is both entertaining and insightful. After that, view the other sites where the crowds aren't as large."
"April 13, 2017",Great Tour,"Always take a Yeoman Warder tour first as soon as you get into the grounds.  Very knowledgeable folks and super entertaining.  After they give you the lay of the land during a 1 hour tour, you can explore on your own to areas like the armor room, the Tower Jewels, etc.  Even the café is good."
"April 13, 2017",A Must See for All,Make time to tour Tower of London as the history of the place will blow you away. Self guided tour or a tour with a Yeoman are both outstanding. Everyone should see the Crowne Jewels in their lifetime.
"April 12, 2017",Beware,"An astonishing and truly fascinating place to visit, but...We hadn't prebooked, arrived at about 11am and queued for around 45 minutes to buy the tickets.We were aware of several people who had prebooked, had also queued for 45 minutes only to be told at the ticket booth that they should have queued somewhere else! This really wasn't made  clear. So, make sure you're in the right queue!The tickets are advertised at the ticket booth as costing £28 per person. But, if you read the small print on the board (and it is small) this includes a voluntary donation of £3.20. What the donation was for, or its purpose wasn't obvious. The default charge is £28, so if you do not wish to make a donation ask to pay £24.80.The queue to see the Crown Jewels was at least 60 minutes, throughout the day. Having queued for 45 minutes to buy the tickets, we didn't want to queue for a further hour.In short, a great day out but visit out of school holiday time, if you can."
"April 12, 2017",Do not buy advance tixs ,"The line to redeem my ""priority pass"", purchased as part of Viator's 3 palaces package is far longer than the line to get individual tickets.  What a waste of precious time!  The reason that I paid for these tickets was to save time.  It's looking to be over an hour to redeem this pass.  I got here at 9:30.  I'm sure that the Tower will be worth it, but I regret buying ""priority"" passes.  Color me angry. "
"April 11, 2017",Great attraction - Tips before you go,"1. Buy tickets in advance online (don't forget to pick them up at the Group Ticket area). If you need to buy your tickets in person, then buy them at the Welcome Center if the lines are long at the Individual Ticket area.2. When buying tickets, elect to NOT donate to the British Monarchy.  This brings the purchase price down by 7-8 British pounds3. Arriving within one hour of the place opening = minimum lines and crowds.  Highly recommend.4. Visit the Crown Jewels first early in the morning = minimum lines and crowds.5. If you only have a couple of hours to visit, then visit the Crown Jewels, White Tower, Ravens, Torture at the Tower, and the Scaffold Site.6. A Beefeaters/Yeoman tour is including in the admission.  It starts every 30 minutes and lasts for 1 hour.  If you have time, then do the tour.  We skipped it because each tour had at least 50 people, and we couldn't hear the Yeoman."
"April 10, 2017",A Must See When Visiting London,"My partner and I were in London last week and went to the Tower.  It was his first time to London and my second time to both London and the Tower.  Even after having already visited the Tower previously, I was still just as fascinated and learned new things.  Our Yoman (Beefeater), Clive, was entertaining, knowledgeable, and took his time to make sure he answered any questions from the group.  The Tower has so much history.  We went to the chapel, saw the guard standing watch in front of the Queens house (she still maintains a residence there as well), saw the ravens on the lawn, went to see the Queen's Jewels, which was an amazing collection of artifacts.  A truly fascinating experience that helps to understand the pride behind the British culture."
"February 7, 2017",Two hours may not be enough,"The two hours may not be enough to explore all of the grounds but it's enough to make your feet hurt for the walking. Worth it though, definitely catch the guided tours leaving from the entrance every 30 minutes, they take less than an hour and you can stay after the tour to ask questions, should there be any unanswered. "
"February 5, 2017",Great,So worth a visit i traveled with my 6 year old so avoided some of the scarier things but still fantastic a lot of steps in parts but it is to be expected. Fantastic views and heaps of history completely loved it
"February 4, 2017",Superb day out,This is great value for money. The Beefeater guided tour is a must. Our guide Kevin was hilarious! There is so much to see and do make sure you plan a full day to see this site in its entirety. The onsite cafe had good choice and the food was reasonably priced. Make sure you dress warm in winter most of the day will be outside or in non heated areas.
"January 29, 2017","If you pick one thing to do, this is it!!",We had a great time at the Tower of London. History buffs will absolutely love it. We could have spent all day here. Our beefeater (Spike) was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. This was our favorite thing we did in London.
"January 28, 2017","Lots of lovely shiny things to see, but lots of history to absorb too","Lots of lovely shiny things to see, but lots of history to absorb too.  Picture with Beefeaters and ravens - then the gift shop!"
"January 22, 2017",Fabulous experience ,Highly entertaining and informative. Our guide Jason Wilcock made the experience enjoyable. Worth the visit 
"January 20, 2017","History buffs unite! Especially if you relish the love, murder & betrayal of the royals","The Tower of London was a central location for all of the scandal, murder & promiscuity of the royals & thus, a must-see if you really want to experience London. The entrance fee does sound steep, but it's worth it if you are a history buff...and if you aren't, The Tower of London just might make you one.We went on a cold November day so there were no lines & we could move about the Tower as we liked. We paid for the headsets - $4 - well worth it. When you are done there, take a stroll across the Tower Bridge & then cross back & walk a few minutes to Katherine's Dock for a nice lunch."
"January 14, 2017",What an amazing place,If you're into history or architecture (or jewels) this is a must see!  Definitely wait for a yeoman tour. Their knowledge and presentation are amazing.  We had the good fortune of meeting Yeoman Spike and his wife Lisa  at a pub when he was off duty.  He made our trip to London so special!  These men are the true jewel of the Tower!  Make sure you view the history of the Crown Jewels before seeing them.  Especially note the Cullinan diamond. I had to go back through the Crown Jewel exhibit after my first tour because these diamonds were so big and clear that I completely missed them! the first time.
"January 14, 2017",You have to go !,The Tower is an amazing experience -   suggest you get there early and do the Crown Jewels first - the queue at the end of the day was very very long. We ate at the restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised  at the food choices and the quality. 
"January 11, 2017",Not to be missed,"You really can't go to London and not come to the Tower of London, I love this place. The history, the Crown Jewels etc. I really enjoyed the audio guide and if you are a history buff I'd definitely recommend the guide!"
"January 10, 2017",Female Yoeman Warder,"On a recent trip to London with a friend, I took the tour of the Tower of London again.  While always interesting, this time the tour was given by the only female Yoeman Warder.  What a treat.  "
"January 9, 2017",Amazing access to medieval castle!,"This place is huge! You walk inside a medieval castle, the streets the walls the rooms! It beautiful! Here you can see the crown jewels! And you get a chance to take a closer look at a English guard. you can be about 2 yards away and take a photo. This would take a good 4 hours to explore every nook and cranny. Great picture opportunity. And free guided tours available with tickets! "
"January 8, 2017",A must see in London,"We had advanced tickets so thought we'd just waltz in, but the security line was more than a block long. But here's a HOT TIP, if you have advance tickets go around to the back to the Traders Gate entrance and you'll breeze right in. The line for the Crown Jewels was an hour long so one or two people held our place while others toured various buildings. Worth the wait. The jewels are amazing and the three foot wide gold punch bowl was worth it alone. Good place to bring kids."
"January 7, 2017",What a great step back in time,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London, made even more special by our ""Beefeater"" guide Dave. He made the experience real and had a wonderful sense of humour. So much history in one place and so many different exhibits to experience."
"January 6, 2017",Amazing historical site ,"Visited the Tower of London on Thursday 6th January and it wasn't too busy. I used my 2-4-1 train ticket offer so it only cost £25 for 2. Started with a free tour at 11am with a fantastic, knowledgeable Yeoman. I was very impressed with his information about the Tower and it made my visit more worthwhile. Then after the 1 hour tour I  spent the next 3 hours taking my time visiting everywhere else in the grounds of the castle. Towards the end of the day I picked up another free tour by another professional,  male staff member in the White Tower which lasted 40 minutes and was great too. There were no queues anywhere, so I think I fell lucky. The toilets on site were great, the grounds immaculate and the cafe had great coffee/cake  (did find the cafe extremely cold).  Highly recommended if you are visiting London. I think the Tower of London is more suitable for older children. As an adult attraction it is fantastic."
"January 6, 2017",Informative-Historical,"Definitely worth a visit, large structure - may take 2 to 2 1/2 hours to see everything, crown jewels located here."
"January 4, 2017",buy tickets from London Transit tourist office,"We went to the Tower during Christmas holidays. The crowds were horrendous. 30-45 minutes to get in, 60 minute wait once we were in to see the Crown jewels.TIP: You can buy a ticket in advance from a London Transit tourist office (in train stations). This allows you to skip the ticket line (BOTH the line to buy tickets the same day, AND the line to pick up tickets if you bought them on-line or through a third party). Even better, our family ticket was a few pounds cheaper than the regular price. You do, however, still have to stand in the long entrance queue. Was it worthwhile? Yes - the Yeoman's tours are great (funny, informative), the jewels one of those 'gotta see' things, the armoury a delight for kids, Edward's apartments a fascinating look into 13th (14th?) century life, and amazing views of Tower Bridge."
"January 3, 2017",Terrific Tower!,"We went between Christmas and New Year which is a very busy time. Best advice is pre-purchase tickets (the dates have 90 days flexibility) and go there at opening time. Skip the audio guides and anything else and go straight to the Crown Jewels. We were in within minutes! The line later in the day was crazy and taking over 1 and a half hours to get in. After the Crown Jewels, double back to near the entry and go on the free Yeoman guard tour. We all loved it. Our guard Bob was informative, engaging and funny. Even my teenagers thought it was fantastic!  After the tour we went to the White tower, still not so busy as most people were in the line for the  Crown Jewels. After that we explored at our leisure and had a nice lunch in the cafe. Definitely a must see attraction!"
"January 2, 2017",Crown jewels was the highlight,"Aim to go in the morning- it was very crowded during our visit.  There were many queues for ticketing and the crown jewels, and the buildings closed early, around 3 or 330pm."
"January 2, 2017",Tower of London,Always love coming here. So much history. So much to see. Amazing Ravens. The Yeoman Warder tour is so interesting and it is obvious they love there job.
"June 6, 2017",Must do the Beef Eater tour!,Lawrence was outstanding. The beef eater tour packs in a ton of history in a fun and entertaining trip around the tower.
"June 3, 2017",Yeoman Warder tour is a must!,"Recounting informative history intertwined with humor, James Woodcock, our Yeoman Warder guide, captured everyone's undivided attention.  He spoke loud enough for the large crowd to be able to hear.  I highly recommend this tour."
"June 2, 2017",NEEDS MORE INTERACTIVE ACTIVITIES,"Quite disappointing. Apart from the Crown Jewels I found this average. The Yeoman Warder tour is half an hour of informative historical information about the Tower, but there's little else in the way of information boards, or interactive things such as picking up a phone receiver and learning a bit about history. "
"June 1, 2017",A definite must see in London,The beefeater tours run every half hour and do not cost any extra.  They are funny and full of great information.  It makes the history of this iconic London location come alive to hear their stories.
"May 28, 2017",A great historical site,The Tower of London was excellent. Join a guided walking tour (no cost) for a great historical tale along the way. The Crown Jewels were amazing to see as were the other displays. It has been well maintained and has cafes and plenty of bathrooms. This attraction was included on the London Pass so no additional cost.
"May 26, 2017",Jeff h,This is a must do for tourist the Crown Jewels are incredible the value of the jewelry itself is unimaginable the tour we took was very informative and took us through every part of the complex I highly recommend this to anyone the guards and the beefeaters just made it that much more exciting
"May 26, 2017",Interesting place!,"We loved seeing this historic place!  I have to say the highlight was the play put on by employees, who were dressed in period costume!  Not only was it great fun but the audience got a history lesson to boot!  The actors were wonderful and it we are really glad we watched it the whole way through!"
"May 26, 2017",Fun and interesting,"Delve into British history and see for yourself.Get the Yeoman Warder tour, it is free with admission. The yeomen are experts on the history and make the it fun, ""we'll be-heading this way folks"" Give the place adequate time, 4 hours is good but I could have stayed there all day, we went through the moving walkway at the Crown Jewels 4 times.One of the best things you can in London, don't miss  it and it is best to get there early"
"May 26, 2017",Learning about the Yeoman Warders,"Lawrence, a Yeoman Warder at the Tower of London created a memorable experience for us and the other visitors this afternoon.  His extensive knowledge, effective crowd management and audience engagement created a historic experience we will long remember.  We were particuarly impressed with the story of the Yeoman Warders at the Tower, something very new to us.  Thank you Lawrence for your attention to detail and a quality experience for Tower visitors."
"May 22, 2017",A shame that you can't take photos of the Crown Jewels.,A fascinating historical site that has interesting buildings and information throughout. Unfortunately photos are not allowed when observing the Crown Jewels. They would rather you buy books than take photos.
"March 16, 2017","Crown jewels and lots of history, worth the trip!","Get here early enough to do a full tour either with audio guide or Beefeater (best), we got there a little too late in the day, about 2:30 so didn't get through the whole audio tour after seeing the crown jewels-- they close at 4:30pm (in February when we went.) Crown jewels were spectacular, and it is amazing to walk some of those historical hallways and see the old carved graffiti in the tower walls! "
"March 4, 2017",Great place,"What a great place. There is so much to see, Crown Jewels, the armory, and the animal sculptures. There is a lot to see at least 2 hours. "
"April 9, 2017",If you love history GO,"Spent about half a day here. So much to see, the crown jewels, the torture chamber, the views of tower bridge. It's a lot larger than I expected. The beefeaters retelling stories of Tower are very interesting.  "
"April 4, 2017",Must see while in London,Billy the Beefeater was entertaining.  It rained the day we went so he took us to the Chapel and told us the history and was thouroughly enjoyable.  He cracked a few jokes and answered historical questions.  Every member of the staff was knowledgeable and eager to speak in depth about the history and culture.   
"March 31, 2017",Take a Beefeater tour,What a thoroughly enjoyable place it is. You can spend a day here and still not take it all in. It is steeped in history having served the Kings & Queens of England since 1066. The crown jewels and all of the Queens regalia are stored here and you have to see them to believe them. My tip would be to do a free Beefeater tour to learn more about the goings on here. Incredibly fascinating.
"March 4, 2017","Well worth a visit , History is Fun ","Our first time on a social visit to the city , this was recommended, and well worth it at a cost of £25 per adult .On a cold Sat morning in Feb , there for the 10 am tour (that's a must with the Beefeaters) and was a real highlight of our short weekend stay . Beefeater Dave made this tour real 'Fun' and a great history lesson .  Next time taking the kids ""Be early or book your tickets in advance , cause even in Feb the queues are long at 0900hrs on a cold Sat morning ."
"March 2, 2017",London Tower Day Out,"What a amazing day out with my family at such an historic place, I enjoyed showing my family from Australia around and I am so looking forward to going again this year to show my granddaughter some of the history of the Tower."
"March 1, 2017",Very Interesting,"We had not pre-booked the Tower of London on our recent trip however there was only a small queue at the ticket office and we decided to go ahead.  We were greeted by a very lovely ticket saleswoman who did not simply usher us through but had a good chat with us.  If you are going to this attraction when the weather is not great be sure to take a coat as you will need to walk outside to get to see all different parts of the castle but otherwise the majority of things to see are inside so a perfect attraction for whatever the weather.The attraction costs £25 per adult but it does not disappoint.  You can join a guided tour but we chose to go around the grounds self guided.  We did not buy the tour book which was an additional £4.99 but as soon as we got in we wished we had, it would have provided us with a little more information about the history.There was a queue to see the crown jewels but this moved very quickly and it was amazing to see them up close. This attraction suits all ages and there are activities going on throughout the day to entertain the children.Only downside I would say is we did not think that the food in the cafe was that great and a little expensive but it is probably what is expected.  Still worth 5/5 as an excellent attraction.  It kept us busy for hours.  "
"February 22, 2017",A must see,"The Beefeater ""Spike"" made this Tour a very interesting experience! He was great at supplying some good stories from the past and early history of the Tower of London. Very nice to be updated of (fractions of) of English history! Our teenager enjoyed him as well!We came at 10am and made it to jewels before the big rush later in the day."
"February 19, 2017",Crown Jewels and Beheadings,"Tower of London is a fascinating combination of glamour and demise. The crown jewels are overwhelmingly gorgeous, while the tales of where people ate their last meal or lost their heads brought visitors back to a darker age. I first went to the Tower when I was 13, and the 2nd time when I was 20. I really enjoyed it both times!"
"February 15, 2017","A ""Can't Miss"" Attraction","It's not news to anyone visiting the city, that the Tower of London is a ""can't miss"" attraction for all ages.  We took the tour, and even though I have visited there before, found it informative and fun!  The Crown Jewels exhibit had been reworked since my last visit and is extremely well done.  Tip -- arrive early and go straight to the Crown Jewels exhibit.  We waited about 20 minutes rather than an hour or two queue later in the day."
"February 12, 2017",We need a daily visit card ,"Every time we visit London tower we find something new, we pay attention to different things and admire all over again the history and  side stories that appear. I I guess there's never enough, try to come for at least  hours."
"February 7, 2017",History at its best,Tower of London is great to visit for someone who loves to know the history and again more knowledge about the country. They showcase good number of crowns as well. It's a huge place so have atleast an hour or two booked for this place.
"March 31, 2017",Would go again!,"Allow at least 4 hours if you like to take it all in.  To make the best use of time, arrive as early as possible, as it gets crowded.  We started just before 11am, next time, I'd aim for 9-9:30am.  A few photos from the approach to the Tower prior to the ticket area is enough, more interesting things inside.  Having the audio tour was helpful.  Rather than using the map for the audio tour, also use the Tower of London official map because it shows the entrance to the wall walks.  Like with anything in London, it's best if you have an action plan before getting there.  After clearing the two stone entrance gates and getting audio (hit 99), keep straight until you see the Traitor's Gate (audio tour 1) on the right.  Then we turned left and past ruin of Roman era wall towards the White Tower.  At this point, we went to see the Crown Jewels (audio 4) tour (as it tends to be busiest).  No photos allowed inside but well worth the tour.  At this point, we probably should have done a Yeoman Warder tour, but somehow it just didn't register.  So we continued on with audio tour (3) to the Scaffold site and Beauchamp tower, well worth the tour.  We might have done the audio (2) but instead went into the White Tower to see ""tons"" of armor, suits of armor, horses armor etc.  Look for the King Henry the VIII armor (you'll know why when you see it).  Lunch at the restaurant there was very good, with selection of hot and pre made sandwiches which they put into panini press.  Yummy!  Restrooms are few and far between in the Tower, and unfortunately, a few that we passed were closed, plus we had at least 2 school outings going on, so it was a bit of a wait.  Advice: take care of business when you pass one, or risk walking 1/3 way around the white tower to get there later.  We accidentally got into the Norman exhibit at the end, so the timeline was backwards.  Oops.  I liked the historical perspective.  The only thing we didn't do is the wall walk.  We got up there, but went clockwise and I think it goes further in the counterclockwise direction, or maybe we went up the wrong stairs.  Highly recommend."
"March 26, 2017","This is a ""do not miss attraction!""","This was one of the highlights of our trip. When you get there, go see the Crown Jewels first. Then, take the tour through the White Tower (they only had 3 of these the day we were there).  Then, go back to the front and go on a tour with the Yeoman Warder. They start every 30 minutes throughout the day and it was the only way to get into the chapel. Tons of history!"
"March 26, 2017",Awesome Afternoon,"I'm just going to contectualise this by saying I love the medieval history of London so I'm probably a little biased, but the whole Tower of London experience was awesome!We went on a beautiful sunny afternoon and managed to sneak in just as one of the Beef Eaters (the guide/guard) named Spike was starting the tour. The guided tour lasted about 30 mins and went into the history both the buildings themselves and the happenings within the buildings during the first half of the second century. Spike was a fantastic speaker and we learnt a lot!After that we spent a good few hours having a look at all the other parts of the tower; the Crown Jewels and history of the monarchy, armory (weapons and armor from the year 1000 to now), the history of the soldiers themselves during the multiple wars fought in and by London (again between 1000-now) and simply taking in the views and reveling in the knowledge that everything around us was pretty much the same as it was 1000 years ago.It's a little pricey as far as tours go but I'd highly recommend putting aside a few hours and seeing it!"
"March 23, 2017",Absolutely brilliant!,"In the over 20 years I have been living in or visiting London I have never been here. In fact, I avoided it as I thought it would be gruesome or some-such. I arrived early, went straight to the Crown Jewels before the crowds arrived and then took a Yeomen of the Guard tour and just wandered through the whole place. It was endlessly fascinating and I'm so pleased I finally took the plunge. I spent an astonishing six hours within the walls. The ravens are supermodels and the Yeoman tour was fascinating and hilarious. A definite must-see in London!"
"March 20, 2017",Classic London Attraction,"I attended a tour led by a Yeoman Warder and found it very enjoyable. I wish I could remember his name, but all I can really remember is that he was bald and very entertaining (I know that is basically useless information, sorry). I highly recommend going on a tour with a YW because it greatly enhanced my experience of the Tower of London. I learned so much more than if I had just walked around reading plaques.I didn't have to wait too long to see the crown jewels as I went in  February but I can imagine that the line can be ridiculously long in the summer. I'd recommend going early in the morning to avoid the line.A great attraction for all tourists. It's good for families, history buffs, and those that just love British culture."
"March 19, 2017",Online tickets ,"We bought our tickets online having seen the terrific queues to buy tickets and missing out in the past. we queued to get in to then be told our paper tickets (which were printed at home) must be taken to the ticket office & exchanged, before we can enter. This was a source of frustration for us and many other tourists. Luckily we were early but I heard some other poor people being turned away as we left when the queue was very long. Buying tickets in advance becomes pointless when you need to wait to get them anyway. "
"March 18, 2017",Must See Attraction,"Adult £25 at the entrance but £20 when purchased on line. The £5 you save, spend it on the self guided audio, which gives you the history of the tower. Admission includes access to the royal jewels and tower of London. To avoid the long lines, it is highly recommended that you arrive at  entrance when it opens. Expect 3-4 hour visit. Great cafe. Staff are friendly!"
"January 1, 2017",Not recommended,"I don't recommend teenagers like me to go there unless you like history because i found it quite boring and the ticket fees are quite expensive so you would be wasting your money if you are not into history. The only place in the Tower of London i find worth seeing is the Crown Jewels.Ethan, 13y.o."
"January 1, 2017",Tradition is awe inspiring.,Signed up for tour via Viator and did first morning. Experienced the opening of tower and the tradition of beef eaters. Caught the Crown Jewels before it became crowded. Lovely experience and grounds.
"December 26, 2016",A must see,A piece of British history that should not be missed. We've been many times over the years and it never disappoints. It's very organized and updated now compared to our first visit over 25 years ago. Do some reading about this landmark before you go. The stories that go with this should not be lost.
"December 25, 2016",Tower of London - History and gore!,"As a family of 4 we recently visited the the Tower of London and had a very entertaining trip around this famous historic attraction. Close to local Tubes and buses the sight is easy to access and ticket purchase quick and easy. As its winter the number of visitors was low which made entry and walking around pleasurable. We had a great Beefeater tour guide (RSM Dave) who made the morning very enjoyable and recommend you follow one of these complimentary guides. History and gore is the basis of this visit, so off with his/her head and torture by the rack is the name of the game. English blood letting at its best!"
"December 20, 2016",Overcast day however what a fabulous site to see,Wow my husband and I had a great day checking out this beautiful historic icon. From every angle there is something to wow about. A must see for all ages . 
"December 13, 2016",The Crown Jewels!!,"A historic and entertaining way to spend the afternoon. Take the complementary tour by the Yeoman Wardens (Beefeaters), it's very informative and fun. It's an hour of great history and information.The highlight for me were the Crown Jewels. Completely over-the-top breathtakingly beautiful. Britain is known for pomp and circumstances and this exhibit brings that to life.Definitely worth your time. "
"December 12, 2016",Rude staff. Very unprofessional,"Was greeted by a very rude member of staff who accused us of looking""guilty"" without elaborating on her point she proceeded to have a rude attitude towards us simply because we are young people. She was very unprofessional & therefore I think she sets a bad example for the Tower of London. Her whole attitude was appalling & even said ""this is actually me being nice"". A very aggressive and rude member of staff."
"December 11, 2016",Not worth the money,"I have been waiting for 5 years before having the opportunity to get inside the Tower of London and I have to say/ what a disappointment.The castle has been completely transformed into a museum, and there is not atmosphere at all. Going around with a pushchair has been a nightmare and we had to carry the baby for the whole visit inside the castle as no more than 1 pushchair/ wheelchair is allowed in at one time. Go to Dover Castle instead, much cheaper and absolutely amazing!"
"December 4, 2016",Get there early and take a Yeoman tour!,We got there very early thanks to jet lag. The place was empty and we got to spend a lot of time in the Crown Jewels area checking out Kohinoor and the other incredible diamonds. Next we went for the Yeoman tour and our tour guide was simply amazing .. wonderful guy with lots of historical knowledge to share all mixed with a great sense of humor. Highly recommend the tour!
"December 1, 2016",Rare gem,We bought tickets for Tower of London as part of our Big Bus tour - was well worth it! Got an insight into historical London and got to see the Crown Jewels - it's well worth the wait (massive lines).Would recommend this attraction to family and friends.
"August 25, 2016",Walk through history,We visited in the morning and went straight to the Crown Jewels while everyone else was lined up for a beefeater tour. There was no line and  we were able to enjoy the exhibit without crowds. Within a half hour the line to get in was an hour long! Give yourself a good half day to spend at the tower to see everything there is there.
"August 24, 2016",Very Interesting,"Loved our visit to the Tower, very interesting !!!... The line to the Jewels is very long. The Museum is very nice, but take comfortable shoes, theres a lot of stairs going up and down. "
"August 23, 2016",Meet the Raven Master,"Tower of London was a great experience.  Get in line for the Crown Jewels early or when there seems to be a lull.  There is a lot of living history here in the form of costumed actors playing the parts of knights, staged fights etc.  Be sure to find the Raven Master and learn the story of the Ravens.  This was one of our favorite stops in London."
"August 22, 2016",Too much queuing ,"Far too much queuing for very little to see, exhibits placed in doorways making progress slow, didn't get to see crown jewels as would of been waiting for more than 2 hours, more child orientated exhibits although the white tower was interesting it definitely not worth the entrance fee!. "
"August 21, 2016","Beautiful Day, Ruined by ""Mercy""","My husband and I had spent an amazing, beautiful,perfect day at The Tower of London...until closing time.As we were leaving, he developed a horrible cramp in his hip and had to sit down. Immediately, a ""resident guard"" named Mercy, rushed over to tell us that we had to leave. We explained why he had to sit for a moment, but he didn't care...at all....telling us that he couldn't go home until we left....What? I tried to stall him by asking for a picture, but that didn't work....As my husband and I slowly made our way to the exit, my husband asked about the very young guards...and if their guns were real.""Mercy"", being a total, complete, disrespectful moron says...quote, ""Of course they're military. They're infantry. We don't give guns to anyone and everyone like you Americans do. That's the problem with you Americans...everyone has a gun"".Wow......"
"August 21, 2016",Yeoman tour of the Tower of London,"We took the yeoman tour when visiting the Tower of London. You do not have to pay extra for this tour, but it is very popular and often crowded. Our guide was Jason Woodcock. He was an excellent guide, interesting and very informative, and full of humour! We really enjoyed our tour with him. Thanks to his booming voice, everyone could hear his insightful commentaries, even though our tour was quite crowded. If you take this tour, allow a minimum of 2 hours to visit the Tower. "
"August 20, 2016",Must visit ,"Of the tourist attractions I visited in London, this was definitely among the most worthwhile. The history of this place is amazing. Make sure you get on a guided tour, I could honestly say that the tour guide I had was one of, if not the best I have experienced. They are very passionate and really bring it all to life. "
"August 16, 2016","Nice introduction into the history of London, a must visit","Very well setup, but of course extremely touristy. It gives you a very nice introduction of the history of London. "
"August 15, 2016",Stand in the site of so much history.,"Definitely take the tour, every room has a unique and large amount of history.  The crown jewels are amazing to see in person, they took my breath away.  "
"August 14, 2016",Bursting with History,"This is probably the oldest building in the world that I've been in. It's hard to picture all the history that took place at the Tower of London. The Crown Jewels, the Ravens, the Beefeaters are a sight to see."
"September 9, 2016",My Favorite Attraction in London!!1,Make sure you take to tour with the Beefeater Guard. It is very informative telling about the horrible things that happened here hundreds of years ago yet the guards/guides are so funny and entertaining as well. The crown jewels are there at the Tower. If you are interested in seeing the jewels with no crowds try to get there early and head to see them before taking a tour. Also go hungry because they have an amazing and delicious cafe for baked items as well as lunch. Highly recommend eating there.
"September 9, 2016",Take a trip to the past,"Honestly, I know it's one of London's biggest attractions.. But for good reason, it's fantastic!Read up on some history, and the Tower of London is a who's who of London's heritage.A few tips- do get a tour from the beefeaters, makes it very entertaining, and they'll point out things you'd normally miss- try and catch the last tours to avoid heavy clouds.. The last beefeater yoman tour is at 3:30.. We went on the 3:15 tour and it was perfect.. After the tour was done, the crowds had thinned and you kind of felt you had most of the castle to yourself, and had time to see the other attractions.- bring a lite snack, find a park bench and make yourself a little picnic.. We did, and it was the perfect way to take a rest, enjoy the sights, and the beautiful grounds before catching some of the big highlights- do check out the crown jewels, and tour the inside of the white tower.. Both are worthwhile.Happy touring!    "
"September 8, 2016",A must see in London,"Fascinating place. It was nice that they sold student tickets as a lot of the attractions don't do that. Well worth the money. There are tours by the beefeaters every half an hour. They deliver an interesting and informative tour of the tower and our tour was delivered by a Yeoman Warder called Spike I think. He was excellent and kept the tour light and funny. Your ticket includes a free tour by the beefeaters, entrance in to see the crown jewels and to other areas such as the white tower and the tower walls. It is a very interesting place, not too expensive for the tickets and a must see in London. One of the best tours in the city"
"September 6, 2016",Must for all visitors,"Join the hour tour, it was an excellent overview of the Tower history.  Guide made the tour interesting for all ages,  Jewels shouldn't be missed.  Wonderful way to get acquainted with London history.  Note: This is for able bodied visitors.  We were traveling with an older relative who had trouble with small stairs.  "
"September 4, 2016",Interesting,"Huge medieval citadel, interesting clown jewels. Best as part of London Tour,  expensive otherwise. Must do. "
"September 3, 2016",Tower of London - yeoman John Donald,Wasn't expecting a lot but it was included in the price of admission. He made the price absolutely worth it. He's very funny. I'm sure they (the Yeomen) all are. Don't miss out on the tour. Make sure you visit the cafe upstairs - quiet and nice sandwiches. And walk along the walls - great views. 
"September 2, 2016",British History is amazing....,Visit this part of British history is an awful experience. Theres nothing like see it with your own eyes. 👍🏻
"August 29, 2016",Steeped in history.,We were lucky to miss all queues and were able to take our time around the whole place. Full of history and a lot to take in. Look out for the graffiti! Very eerie! 
"August 28, 2016","Fantastic Experience, Pleasant Surprise","My friend had told us to go here and we ended up spending 5 hours.  We took our hop-on-hop-off bus to the location and just bought tickets there. Definitely pay for the audio guide and if you have kids get the kids tour for them.  Was a lovely day and the area is so large you don't feel any crowds. The only line, which took a 1/2 hour, was to see the crown jewels.  If you love history and all that comes with it definitely spend a day here."
"August 25, 2016",Excellent experience,"This was an excellent visit! I recommend the tour with a Yeoman guard. Jim was fun to listen to and very thorough in his knowledge. It is well worth the cost of admission, the time, and your attention. "
"September 27, 2016",Amazing tour,"If you go make sure you take the Yeoman Warder guided tour. It was amusing, informative, and one of the best tours I have gone on. I would recommend arriving at the end of the day to avoid the crowds. We caught the last tour at 3:30pm and we were able to enjoy the crown jewels following our tour without too many people. It was more than enough time for us, but it was also my second time visiting.  "
"September 25, 2016","Excellent tour, beautiful views ","We visited The Tower of London towards the end of the day on a Tuesday and the crowds were very minimal, no line for tickets and went on a beefeater tour straight away. We were led by Sandy (?) who was wonderfully engaging. Great tour to start your visit to the tower. Seeing the Crown Jewels were a highlight and stunning in person. The tower is well presented and provides amazing views over other London landmarks such as Tower Bridge. A must in London "
"September 22, 2016",interesting and Entertaining,"Lots to see and do at the Tower of London.   We took the free tour and our guide (Yeoman Warder) was entertaining / funny and very informative.You can spend several hours here as there are different parts to see including the Crown Jewels, the tower itself and walking around the perimeter of the fortressOnly negative part was the cafe as we ate lunch there but was disappointed with the food"
"September 19, 2016",Awesome must see while visiting London!,"We recently had the opportunity to visit the Tower of London and enjoy the Beefeater tour of the grounds. Our guide, Yeoman Mark Anderson was fantastic. His extensive knowledge of the local history mixed with a friendly personality and sharp wit made for an awesome experience. The entire facility is amazing, from the armory in the White Tower to the Chapel and of course, the Crown Jewels. The buildings hold tremendous history and tell there own stories of both good and bad periods of Britain's past.  If you visit London, a visit to the Tower is an absolute necessity!"
"September 18, 2016",A Must Visit,"Not only is the Tower amazing, but the layout, the guides, the maps, the tours... it's so well organized and efficient and detailed.  The audioguides were fantastic, and I spent 4 hours wandering the complex without every losing interest (or getting lost). A tremendous font of history, culture, religion... anyone who is Anglo must visit- so much of our nation's history is tied up in this one area. Tip: get there early right when it opens.  It gets more and more crowded as the day goes, but at 9am it was the best!Second tip: listen to the Beefeaters.  They are amazing men with great storytelling ability.  You will be glad you did!"
"September 17, 2016","Amazing, make sure you do the Yeoman Warder Tour","An amazing place to wander around. The Crown Jewels are just spectacular, although be prepared for a very long wait. The queue was long but well worth the wait. The shops have the usual souvenirs as well as some beautiful although over my budget items. The ravens are great and well worth a visit. I cannot recommend highly enough a Yeoman Warder Tour. If you are lucky enough to get Billy the Beefeater you will be in for a treat. He is funny, informative and highly entertaining and I could quite happily listen to him for hours, make sure you bring your best smile as he takes photo's of you to put up on twitter! "
"September 13, 2016",Played a major  role  in English  History,"Even if  you  are  not  a follower  of  English history, walking  past  the Traitors  Gate as you  enter  the  Tower  of  London  is bound  to  have  some  affect on you. Reflect  on the number  of  people  who  entered  through  the  gate  and died  there. The  huge ravens  strutting  around  the  grounds, the presence  of  Beefeaters  and Queen's  guards helps set the  tone. The  Tower  was originally  a  castle, which  became  a  jail. It was built  in  the  9th  century  but  has been  well  preserved.Be sure  to  take  a tour  with  one of  the  Beefeaters. Their knowledge  of  history  makes  the  Tower  come  alive  and  embellishes what  you  already  know. While  the  price  of  entry  is a bit steep $34.USD, there  is  no  extra  charge  for  the  tour. Make  sure  to  visit  Beauchamp  Tower  where  many  were  held  before  they  were  executed. Anne  Boleyn  stayed  here. There  is  graffiti  on the  walls  left  by prisoners. They  have  created  a  circular  ring listing  those  who  lost  their  head  outside  Beauchamp  Tower. It used  to be just a stone  spot  marked by a sign  The  chapel  can  be  visited  only  on a  Beefeaters  tour. I was told  to  join  in with  a  tour  if I  wanted  to  go  inside. I wanted  to  spend  extra  time  looking  at  the  Crown  Jewels  so I  stepped  off the  conveyor  walkway  used to  shuttle  people  past  the  jewels  and took a  second  ride  on the  other  side.There  is  an entire  building  filled  with  armor, weapons  and stories  about  those  who  lived  in  the  Tower rooms. You  can  spend  a long  time  in this  building  alone. I think  you  have  to plan  on at least  2-3 hours  at the   Tower  of  London. I believe  that  admission  might  be  part  of  the  London  Pass. Since  I was  here on a bus  tour, I didn't  research  that. This  is  my  second  trip  here and  felt  like  I  learned  more  on this  trip. It is  a  very  important  piece  of  English  history."
"September 12, 2016","History, Beauty and Ravens","This is a beautiful introduction for foreign visitors to the rich history of Britain and the monarchy. Situated along the Thames a stone's throw from Tower Bridge, the Tower of London is a series of towers, many of which are connected through a perimeter wall. Do plan to spend at least a couple of hours to ensure you have the chance to visit several of the structures.  Tours are offered by yeoman warders regularly throughout the day and should not be missed. The Crown Jewels were worth seeing, but I loved that many of the structures were open to the public. One can walk virtually the entire perimeter along the wall encompassing the compound. There is a raven master and several ravens maintained on the grounds, often visible to the public. If you plan far enough in advance (a very long time in advance) you may be able to obtain tickets to the key ceremony, which is held at the end of the day when the tower grounds are locked and night guard is posted. Several yeoman warders (aka Beefeaters) have Twitter accounts where they share gorgeous pictures of the grounds. One of my favorite places in London! A word of caution, be prepared for significant crowds during local school holidays!"
"September 12, 2016",Must for History Buffs in London,"This is a must stop for anyone interested in medieval london. The White Tower in the middle is almost 1000 years old. The Crown Jewels are here and the exhibit that houses them has recently been redesigned to be much more interesting. Its full though like everyday, so do yourself a favor an order at ticket online so you don't have to wait so long in the lines. And skip the beef eater tours which actually run to like 100 people and just do the audio tour. Totally worth it. "
"September 12, 2016",Tower Of LOndon,"Get to the tower nice and early. Don't just go off when you go through the gates wait at the beefeater free guided tour. The tell you what the building are and what happened the also tell you a few secrets that you wont hear just wondering around alone, Our tour guide, Clive, informed us well and contained comedy. After the tour find somewhere to eat then go exploring you need about 4 hours in the tour, including the tour, to have a good look."
"October 12, 2016","Go for the History, stay for Beefeater Dave!","This was my favourite attraction in London. I very highly recommend taking one of the free guides by a Yeoman Warder. If you're lucky, you'll have one by Beefeater Dave! The guide was informative, hilarious, and fun! Afterwards make sure the have enough time to see the rest, it's definitely worth it."
"October 12, 2016",Great YeOman Warder tour,"This is an iconic London attraction. We did the Yeoman Warder tour which departs just inside the main entrance in the moat. Yeoman Warder Jason Woodcock was brilliant and I think one of the best guides I have encountered anywhere in the world. He was knowledgeable and funny, dastardly and gritty. He made hearing the gruesome history of the tower entertaining and informative. His wit was spot on and lightened the mood when history nasties engulfed us. I came away feeling I had seen a first class show and I wanted more. I was disappointed though in the crown jewels exhibit. Not in the displays but after having such a colourful guided tour around the tower the jewels felt lacking (which is why I'm giving this 4 instead of 5. Fyi YW J Woodcock deserves 5****** out of 5). The armouries were interesting but again having an amazing guide bringing it all to life would make it all so much more exciting....especially for kids. I will definitely return, it needs a full day to take in all it's horrible atrocities."
"October 11, 2016",Doesn't live up to the hype,"Maybe we didn't enjoy this as much because we were at the end of our stay and we were exhausted but I was not overly impressed. The Crown Jewels were cool but you don't get to view them for long, it seemed like they could have done more with the torture tower and the other exhibits. The Yeoman tour was nice, you should be respectful of these men, they aren't just tour guides! This is an honor position for the men who served in the military. "
"August 14, 2016","You go to the Tower if you go to London, PERIOD.","A must if you go to London! The Beefeaters are part of the pleasure. Ours was extraordinary. Funny, loaded with anecdotes and great historic facts. Of course the Crown Jewels were exquisites. We were there early afternoon and did not have to wait that long, perhaps 20 minutes. There is also a great Fish & Chips just before entering the tower if you are hungry for a quick bite! Melted right into your mouth :) We also bought a few things at the Gift Shop. The way we got there was with the cruise, and we left with the Original Bus Tour. Convenient, and also two different ways of approaching the landmark. "
"August 14, 2016",Weekend at London,Very interesting historical site. Well kept.The Crown Jewels is the main event.A must see in London. 
"August 12, 2016",A wonderful historic place to visit,"Definatly well worth a visit, the beefeater tour is a must to appreciate everything there is to see. I would recommend pre booking to avoid the queues"
"August 10, 2016",A well done historical site,"This is a very well done--if expensive--historical site to visit.  I highly recommend the extra pounds for the audio tour.  You can pick and choose what you se and listen to, and we learned so much more from the tour. We bought our tickets online which saved us standing in line and it was cheaper. We also arrived at opening on a Sunday morning.  Our nearly 3 hours there were quite pleasant; the only line was for the crown jewels (and it went pretty fast).  My teenagers (14 and 16) enjoyed it and so did my mother.  It was good for all generations.  The displays and narration are well done, the exhibits are well organized, and crowd flow is managed. I recommend it. "
"August 8, 2016",Relive history,"Loved seeing so much of history in one place.  Did an overview of the Tower of London by taking a tour with London Walks.  They talk about the building get of the tower and all the history that has occurred here, highlighting the places where the prices in the towers bodies were found, where Anne Bolyen and others lost their heads, where the prisoners were kept, and the Famous Ravens.  They leave you to see the crown jewels and continue on your own."
"August 4, 2016",Great experience ,I went with a group of friends and family to the Ceremony of the Keys. The guard who walked us through it was very knowledgeable. The whole ceremony only takes about 30 minutes but definitely well worth it. Would recommend booking this well in advance as it books out quickly and they don't allow very many people on this tour.
"August 3, 2016",Love the audio tour,"Purchasing the audio tour guide was worth it. Loved doing the tower at our own pace.  There are group tours by a live tour guide, but it can be very busy and loud.   So hearing the guide can be difficult.  Easy to spend 2 or more hours.  Go 1st thing in the morning to see exhibits and avoid the crowds. "
"August 2, 2016",Amazing History and Diversity of Activites,"Returning here after several years, so that my mother could visit as well.  We arrived here shortly after it opened.  We made a beeline to the crown jewels, which was definitely a great idea.  We were able to walk around them a couple times due to the lack of crowd.  Following our visit there, we returned to near the entrance to take the Yeoman Warder tour.  The tour was information and entertaining.  We had a large group of people from around the world in the tour from South Africa to the Americas, and all were included.  Definitely made for a memorable visit.  Following the tour we went through a couple of the exhibits.  I wish we had a bit more time to visit, but wanted to get a few more things in today.An amazing feature of the Tower to me is the diversity of activities.  There seems to be something for every age and every interest."
"July 31, 2016",Yeoman Clive and his 1 hour tour,"If you get a chance to have a guided tour while at the tour, definitely try to find Yeoman Clive! He conducted our tour of the Tower at 10 am. He was very informative, loud, engaging, and patient with an unruly, over-questioning child.  Mad props to Clive and the other yeomen who are former military and the queen's body guard!"
"July 30, 2016",A rich history lesson ,"Well worth the visit! The Tower of London dates back to 1050 and is a world heritage listed site. Loved the Yeoman (Beef Eater) tour! You can just join one as they start every 30 minutes. The Yeoman is a serving member of the military and an excellent history buff- delivering a pretty entertaining romp through the history of the tower, its grounds and the mayhem, beheadings and murder that occurred over centuries of successive kings and queens vying for power and riches. The Crown Jewels are housed here and yes they are real and incredible! You won't be disappointed spending 2-3 hours here. "
"October 5, 2016",Incredible Experience,Really enjoyed the tower of london.  It was beautiful and historical.  I loved seeing the crown jewels and exploring all of the grounds.  Must see when visiting London!
"October 5, 2016",A must see spot in London,"Royal History, the Crown Jewels, historic armaments, the ravens, and the Beefeaters are the major highlights."
"October 4, 2016",Fantastic Place to Visit on Your Travels,"This was on my list of must-see's for London and I loved it. Probably a good idea to go earlier in the day if you're walking a lot, I could feel the cobblestones through my shoes on my already tired feet. Otherwise, lots to see here such as the historical points and of course the Crown Jewels. There were even some reenactments while we were there. ALSO, if you're a Tudor history fan like me and want to see Anne Boleyn's final resting place inside of St Peter's ad Vincula Chapel, you need to be on the Yeoman's tour. Otherwise you have to wait until 4:30."
"October 3, 2016",A Step Back in Time,"This was our second visit to the tower and once again enjoyed it thoroughly.  The exhibits range from the Crown Jewels to the Armoury.  But the highlight for me was just knowing that we were walking through the very place, that so much of England's history had taken place in.  We didn't take advantage of the tours offered by the Yeomen Beefeaters this time but they are highly recommended.On a practical note, do arrive early.  We got there at 9:30 and basically walked right through the ticket line but when departing several hours later the lines were lengthy.  Much of your time is spent outdoors walking between towers so the weather can be a factor for your visit.  Also the cobblestones can be difficult to walk on and slippery when wet so wear comfortable shoes.And lastly, if you travel by train from any other part of GB or from Gatwick or Luton airport (but not from Heathrow) you can get 2 for 1 vouchers for this and many other attractions which save you a great deal of money.  The vouchers must be downloaded in advance.  Check the rail website for links."
"October 3, 2016",Amazing history,What an experience to know that you are walking the same walkways that were walked centuries ago. An absolute MUST SEE when in London.
"October 2, 2016",Bucket list ,"Wasn't sure what to expect as not fussed on tour groups, the guide assigned to us was very entertaining and knowledgeable and made it easy to handle. An amazing piece of history still standing and a home for the beefeater's and their families. So glad we went there and just soaked up the history. Crown jewels exhibit was brilliant. So easy to book, on line the day before."
"October 2, 2016",Boring,"Long queues but was not worth it. There isn't much to see. Walking the wall was the best part. If you have loads of time in London you may go but if you have limited time - avoid it, you can spend your time at much more interesting sights."
"November 30, 2016",I saw a ghost in the tower!!!,"When i was a child, we visited here. It was dark, scarey and i could hear the cries of the tourchered prisoners, and i saw a very spookey man walking through the corridors. This is a must see...but look out.....you never know what you'll find creeping around the corner."
"November 28, 2016",Follow the Beefeater ,"Come here and come early - before all the other tourists get up.Just inside the ticket office you should queue up and wait for the next Beefeater tour. Their stories about the buildings, ancient royal adultery, executions, coin productions, knights, cannons, guns, jewelry and of course their own way of living at The Tower is intriguing. Just outside or from the tower walls you have an excellent view of Tower Bridge. "
"November 27, 2016",Fantastic heritage site full of history,"A fabulous venue to learn about British history through the ages.  Great military history and Crown Jewels and, of course, the Ravens "
"November 24, 2016",Lots to learn and definitely worth seeing!,"I arrived at the Tower of London just in time for the Yeomen Warder tour. The tour makes the trip super worth it since the Yeoman Warder is able to explain the history thoroughly and with lots of humor. I really enjoyed listening to the story about Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, and there is a monument that shows where she and many others were executed (which was quite interesting...). The White Tower also had a tour and it went over the use of the tower and how it changed throughout the years with different kings. The crown jewels were very beautiful and I spent a while in the exhibit. Many of the royal gifts and crowns were shown. There was also an exhibit about the minting of coins in the tower, and it was interesting since there were many interactive parts that helped you understand the coin-making process. I enjoyed the walk around the border of the tower the most. Each tower had a display of different artifacts and I liked looking at the facts about the royal menagerie. In total, it took me from 12:00-4:20 or so to finish seeing all the places (including the tours, which took up about 2 hours of the time there). Be ready to walk up some stairs and bring good walking shoes. 10/10 would recommend. Also be sure to go up on a tower and get pictures of the London Bridge. It's a clear view and you can get artsy pictures!"
"November 24, 2016",Great attraction!,This is a must see in London and a great way to spend a few hours.  Everything was very well done and very informative. You can also take a free tours and designated times.
"November 21, 2016",Good experience ,Kids find it boring after a while but there were short performance from time to time while we were there. Lots of stairs so pram wasn't a good choice.
"November 19, 2016",Great experience with kids,We got the tickets in situ without long lines or difficulties and the tour is well organized giving us a chance to know a lot of the history and construction of the bridge
"November 19, 2016",Great day out,Excellent day out at the Tower. 1. Get there before 10:30.2. Buy tickets in advance and save on the entrance fee.3. Make sure you have a yeomans tour.  They start just inside the main gate and are well worth any small delay while waiting for the tour to start. (they are included in the ticket price).
"November 18, 2016",So much to see,"Although we went early to the Tower to buy tickets and gain entry it was still busy with lots of school groups. However, we didn't have to queue to see anything - we didn't have to queue even to see the Crown Jewels. We used the guide book to navigate our way around the Tower. The lay out of the exhibits was excellent and flowed well. A word of caution - you need to be fit to navigate many of the exhibits."
"November 16, 2016",Historical place ,"A great place to explore and learn about history of England. The guards' tours are exceptionally fantastic with the right amount of British humour.  It might sound rather expensive at about 22 £ but if you buy a membership for about 40£ you get free access to 5 royal palaces, including Banqueting palace in London. Or you can try to find slightly cheaper tickets online. Make sure to allocate a long time to this excursion because there are many things to see and several different tours to take part in. You can spend a whole day there and have a picnic in the moat!  "
"July 28, 2016",The Guided Tour is Excellent,"I was lucky enough to enter the Tower of London grounds just a few moments before a free guided tour began.  My guide spoke loudly, knew how to lead a large group, and told a story of the Tower of London in an entertaining manner.Women seem intrigued by the Crown Jewels.  I found them uninteresting, but it may be worth waiting in the long line just so you won't feel that you've missed anything.I liked the White Tower, which had many displays of arms and armor."
"July 27, 2016",Give yourself plenty of time,"We went as a part of a morning tour which was great to get your lay of the land, but we found ourselves wishing we had more time.  The beefeater's intro is short and good.  They tend to point you towards the crown jewels, which was neat to see (and like the fact they have a conveyor belt to keep the gawkers moving along), but we wish we would have hit the white tower up front as there were so many levels and a lot to take in."
"July 27, 2016",Just as good second time!,Visited this attraction only yesterday having been here 14 years ago. It was just as enjoyable this time with two of our children. Fantastic tour guide Dave the Beefeater was our guide and as before the Beefeaters make great tour guides of the tower. Big number of visitors but no queuing. So much history to digest. We spent approximately three hours at the Tower of London as it was a beautiful day a must see when in London!
"July 22, 2016",Excellent ,"Started off with a Yeoman Warder tour where we were guided around for about an hour by the excellent Jaise. It was an entertaining and informative tour and left us in the middle of the tower grounds just outside the Chapel. Continued on with the arms exhibition inside The White Tower, then on the the Crown Jewels and finally ended it with a bit of a walk on the walls. I'm not much for jewels but the arms display was impressive - don't miss it, and don't miss the Yeoman Warder tour either. Definitely one of the more interesting things to do in London. "
"July 22, 2016",Amazing,It was the best guided tour ever. Beefeater Dave was so witty and his stories were amazing. It took me through the ages of English history. I would do it again.
"July 21, 2016","Brilliant, audio tour a must for overseas visitors",Terrific visit for three hours across all aspects of the site. Great learning experience and fascinating history. Audio tour is a must for overseas visitors who are not familiar with the history of this place. Great value for money.
"July 18, 2016",Wow,"I was alarmed when I saw the length of the line to see the Crown Jewels but the line moved very quickly and I enjoyed a great, unhurried view of the jewels. They've done a great job of displaying these so you get a good look. I also visited the torture tower and this was interesting but my reason for visiting was to see the jewels. The gift shop had some fun stuff and this is adjacent to the city cruises boat stop so I took that to get back to the Westminster area. "
"July 16, 2016",Fantastic,"A great place with a fantastic architecture. The audio tour is very well organised, super informative and enjoyable. The queue for the crown jewels was huge but moving fast. Don't be afraid, it is really worth the 30 minutes wait. A must see in London with a fantastic view on Tower bridge"
"July 11, 2016",Spend a day,"We absolutely loved the Tower! Go early please it's busy! We did the Yeoman tour to start, it's only an hour, but will give you the full detail of what you need to know. We were then free to go and see everything at our own pace. We wanted to see the jewels and joined a fairly fast moving queue but by time we came out the queue had extended to around 3 hour wait! Go early!!!!! The queue for the bloody tower was similar!  Great ice cream and fabulous staff. It's definitely a day trip, don't plan to be seeing anything else.  We didn't do this but would definitely recommend that you can take the Thames Clipper from Embankment to Tower Hill. Bit of a change from the Tube! "
"July 8, 2016",Plan to spend some time here!,"We went later in the afternoon and instantly regretted that we didn't set more time aside for this attraction. I would suggest immediately going to the Crown Jewels when you get there, especially if the line isn't too long. They have timers near the ticket booths telling you approximately how long the wait is to see the jewels. They are astonishing, as we would all expect them to be. No picture could ever do them justice. The history of the Tower is great and you should set aside time to go on one of the short guided tours to get the quick dose of history before you explore. The amount of history contained in this one place is ridiculous. Just standing in the middle of the courtyard and looking at the clear display of historic architectural styles was fantastic. I would probably pay the ticket price again if I go back to London just to explore this place more!"
"June 17, 2016",Great day at the Tower of London,"Funny, entertaining and informative tour with Yeoman Warder Dave Phillips. Tower of London was excellent."
"June 16, 2016","Get a wonderful tour of history from a real Beefeater (no, not the gin)","Dont miss this tour.  Two hours are not enough.  First surprise to me: The Tower of London is not really a tower so much as it is a fortress.  Second: Filled with important English history (several lost their heads becoming part of said history). Third: Beefeaters (Yeomen Warders of Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London) who live at the Tower and are the ceremonial guardians of the Tower, act as your very informative free tour guides.  Spike was our guide and he was excellent, delivering history with humor.  Fourth:  As if the Tower and grounds are not enough, the Queen keeps her Jewels there and they are on display!  The only negative:  no picture taking of the jewels."
"June 12, 2016","Go Early, Go Early, Go Early",We got there right as they opened and made a beeline for the crown jewels and good thing! We waited 20min to get into see the crown jewels and by the time we got out the line was easily over an hour if not more. Its well worth it to get up and go early.Very cool and lots of things going on well worth the price if you can stay for a bit and see everything!
"June 5, 2016",Bring Out the Crown Jewels!,I was very exited to see the many crowns of the kings and queens over the years. I was not exited to wait in the 45 minute queue to see the crowns. Always visit the tower first thing in the morning for short lines.
"June 5, 2016",Tower of London,After quite a queue to enter it laws very interesting. The history is fascinating and the beefeater are interesting to speak with. You really need a couple of visits as there is a lot to see.
"June 5, 2016",Loved it!,"Seeing the crown jewels is the best part, I recommend going at opening, it does get quite crowded.  I would do the jewels first thing as there is a line for them as well."
"June 2, 2016",So Much Fun!!!,My whole family loved The Tower! Our BeefEater guide was hilarious and all the employees obviously LOVE their jobs. Many of the workers not only answered any of my curious questions but added in more info. They are very knowledgeable and eager to share if you only ask. We were there mid-April and the weather was fine. I would recommend eating right before you visit and bringing a snack. They have a restaurant but it was a little pricey. 
"June 2, 2016",Cant get enough of this place.,Get there early or get your tickets online. Once inside make sure you get an audio tour and find a Yoeman who is giving a talk. They do this every 15 mins or so. They all over the place. Dont go expecting it will take an hour or so its an all day experience.  Take your time and look at everything and ask questions.
"June 2, 2016",This is an awesome place especially with a family,"You need to go to this place as a top tourist spot in London. You will not be disappointed. There is so much history here and if you've studied any English history, this place holds many interesting artifacts "
"May 28, 2016",So much history,"I'm a lover of the British history, so this was an exciting and enriching tour. I went to the Tower of London by myself, took my time going through every part and learning more about its history. The outside was simply beautiful and the inside transported me through time, despite the reconstruction after the fire that affected it, it was well conserved and maintained and held so much history. Unfortunately I didn't know that only the guided tour could go inside the chapel, where some history figures such as Anne Boleyn are buried, and I missed the last guided tour so I couldn't go in, so I advise to take the guided tour if you're interested in visiting the chapel. I also advise you to bring a rain coat or umbrella, England's wheather can catch you off guard. "
"November 11, 2016",Fascinating,"Try to get there as close to opening as possible and go straight to see the Crown Jewels then head back for a free ""Beefeater Tour"".  The tours are fun and informative."
"November 8, 2016",Disappointing Visit,"£25 on the door to get in, minimum information provided on the exhibits and a moving walkway pass the Crown Jewels all lead to a slightly disappointing experience at the tower.A place such as this which is steeped in history should be brimming with interesting artifacts and detailed history. Instead you get large rooms with very little in them and single line sentences to explain what they are.And if you fancy marvelling at the crown jewels then be prepared to keep going around and around on the moving walkway as you are not allowed to stop and stare at the magnificent creations on display.The best piece of advice with this place is to get on one of the Yeoman Wanders tours. They are informative, engaging and funny. They are worth the entry fee into the Tower but you will be going around in a large group. We are glad we visited but we will not be heading back any time soon."
"November 6, 2016",A must see - espcially the crown jewels!,"The lines were long, but we were able to bypass them by going to the 2nd entrance at the rear right of the square. There is so much to see here you won't want to miss it but don't miss seeing the Crown Jewels as well as the torture chambers."
"November 6, 2016",You have to see the Crown Jewels!!,"This place was very beautiful with a lot of history. We only spent 1.5 hours here and spent most of that time looking at the Crown Jewels, so I'd say that it does take at least 2 hours to really see all the buildings...and 3 hours is best as is recommended [at a very leisurely pace]. But, even if you're short for time, the Crown Jewels were worth seeing. We went in the late afternoon towards closing time, so there weren't crowds. At night, the Tower of London lights up - along with the Tower Bridge - so it's a great place for evening photos!"
"November 5, 2016",Crown Jewels and Torture!,"The Tower of London was a really cool place to visit. You can go through the rooms and read about some of the people that were held prisoner in the tower, see the crows that they keep on the grounds, see the armory as well as the crown jewels. The one downfall is that there are a huge number of people there at all times so it can be crowded and difficult to read things. It was very neat though! It is right next to the Tower Bridge as well so you can get a good view from the tower and walk there after."
"October 30, 2016",Amazing History,Tower of London was quite impressive. Having arrived in late September there were no long lines for tickets or entrance. The Yeoman Warder tours are exceptional and included with ticket price. DO NOT MISS these! The Crown Jewels are also quite impressive and worth seeing. I would recommend going to the Crown Jewels first as this can become somewhat crowded and then taking the Yeoman Warder tour. There are various reenactors mostly leading school groups but if you have the chance maintain a respectful distance and listen to them. There are two Queen's Royal Guardsmen stationed outside the Jewel House. They are quite easy to photograph but please be respectful. These young men and women are soldiers and are actively serving guard duty and have worked hard and sacrificed much for this service. The White Tower artifacts of armor and weaponry are fantastic! A trip to The Tower of London should be a top choice of things to do.
"October 25, 2016",Summer visit to London,"One of the ""must see"" tourist sites in London. Approaching from metropolitan London is a bit of an anticlimax as it is unimpressive among modern skyscrapers. But to go inside the walls is to be transported to the 11th century. Lots to see and do inside, so allow at least 4 hours inside to see the Fusilier's museum, the Traitor's gate, walk the walls, and of course, the Crown Jewels. We were there on a lovely summer day, so there was a bit of a crowd, but highly recommend taking one of the tours guided by uniformed yeomen. These folk are friendly, knowledgeable, and quite funny (on purpose). "
"October 20, 2016",Amazing Visit,"Not only do you have all the history of Kings and Queens and ne'er do wells who were imprisoned here but it is an incredible look back at the human rights allowed/not allowed people in those days.After getting all the history you can take, go look at the crown jewels. It is hard to believe the stones in some of those pieces!! HArder still to believe they are actually allowed to leave the Tower security! LOL"
"October 19, 2016",Watch out for the £4:50 charity donation.,"This was the best value and most enjoyable of the attractions get day out. It had it all humour, tragedy and historic. Watch out for the £4:50 they add to the entrance fee without asking or telling you."
"July 8, 2016","Not great for disabled, but a worthy stop.","The Tower of London offers terrific history of not only the place but England in general. I took my wheelchair-bound mom through and around parts of it, but be warned -- it is really  not suitable for those who can't walk. It is very hilly and bumpy, making it a challenge to push a chair. She waited while I visit a few parts on my own, and those were amazing in detail and content."
"July 4, 2016",Fun and interesting - thank you Spike,"Visited here this weekend with my partner and decided to join in one of the 'Beefeater' guided tours. Our guide Spike was brilliant! Very engaging, entertaining and full of knowledge regards the history of the Tower. The tour its-self was very enjoyable, I learnt lots of fascinating facts and I think it is a great way to be shown around by someone who knows what they're talking about. The tour lasted about 50 mins, and took you to some of the most interesting parts of the tower - perhaps those parts you would ordinarily just walk past!  This then gave you plenty of time afterwards to have a look around yourself, and visit some of the places you learnt about on the tour. There are so many different things to see and do here - something for people of all ages. I would definitely recommend a visit if in London, and I would most certainly recommend a guided tour! Oh, and the crown jewels - they're worth a look too!"
"July 4, 2016",Mandatory attraction when visiting London,"We visited as part of the London Pass.  If you have several days and have stamina it's a good value.  Most attractions in this area so you can walk.  The Tower of London is mandatory for any visitor - individual, young kids or older.  Armor, jewelry, executions, torture and other sections.  Of special interest to Henry 8th buffs and fans (like me) of Philippa Gregory's novels of Henry's time (and wives)."
"July 3, 2016",Even better the second time!,"I visited here by myself over three years ago. This time I came with my adult daughter, who enjoyed it immensely. Our tour guide beefeater Dave was perfect -- booming voice, witty and cutting humor. During this visit, I actually climbed to the top of the wall, where my daughter and I enjoyed the views and got a better sense of how the entire complex is built. Always love seeing the crown jewels, though daughter brought up a good point -- couldn't they be sold and the money put to better use? Just a thought."
"July 3, 2016",Tick this off your bucket list!,"Let's face it, the Tower is one of those places you have to see in you go to London.  It's got history, the crown jewels, interesting tour guides, and a decent cafe to boot.  Yes it's touristy but not as bad if you go late in the afternoon, like 2:30 or 3 pm, mid week, maybe?  You can do this in about three hours."
"July 2, 2016",Free Beefeater Tower of London Tour,"Beefeater Dave gave the most amazing tour! He is knowledgeable, funny, articulate, smart and hugely entertaining!! He made a potentially miserable experience (the Tower of London is very crowded!) into the best experience we had during our entire trip. Hunt this man down and go on his tour! You will not regret it!"
"July 2, 2016",Must see tour,"This was one of the last tours we did in London because I was not sure whether it was worth the time.  We were going to do a London Walks tour but arrived too late.  Not a problem since the Tower Beefeater guards do hourly tours.  John was our yoeman and he was fabulous for setting the mood, gave us good history, humor and sense of both awe and adventure.  We spent another hour walking around on our own including the tour of the Crown Jewels.  Well worth a trip out of your way.  Stop by St. Paul's, a reasonable walk on your way back to the center of town"
"October 17, 2016",Lots of history and things to see,"When we planned our trip to London, we didn't want to visit any of the large museums because we only had a few days to explore the city. We did make seeing the Tower of London a priority as it had a lot of history relevant to London and the medieval period. Unfortunately, we did get there kind of late, so we didn't get to see everything because it did close kind of early. Definitely make time to see this spot though."
"June 30, 2016",Exhilarating experience! ,"I can't rave enough about this tourist destination. Do not miss it!  We enjoyed four hours there and wish we had more time.  When you arrive, be sure to go on a tour with one of the warders. Our yeoman made history come alive and engaged the entire audience with his humor and compelling stories. We loved Jake!  We also loved seeing the jewels and while we waited in a long line, the line moved quickly and the Crown Jewels were worth the time. Later, we caught a live reenactment of history by four actors playing knights and rebellious forces. So much fun!  The gift shops are great and the grounds are lovely. After our visit, we both felt so excited to revisit our studies of British history!"
"June 29, 2016",Fun with teens,"This is written from our 13 yo point of view: I was totally not wanting to go to the Tower of London and when I stepped off the Metro I groaned...loudly. My parents drug me kicking and screaming and after rolling my eyes twice, my mom made me go on the Beefeater tour AND do the audio tour. I tried not to giggle when the Beefeater started talking but he was really funny. Ok so that was not bad. He took us on a tour and told us some neat stories so then I wondered what the purpose of the audiotours was. So that still gave me complaining power. After the Beefeater Tour we went to the crown jewels and we stood in line which moved slowly until some person told us we could walk around freely even though it was still in one direction. We learned about coronation and saw the world largest punch bowl and ladle (according to me). Ok so the jewels were cool but they looked heavy, can't wear them out. I laughed because my mom couldn't take pictures in the building. Awesome! After the jewels we listened to 2 audiotour entries which were actually different than the Beefeater Tour...so mom was right. Then on to lunch. Since I am becoming vegetarian, I actually found some food in the cafe which was pretty good. My mom had bangers and mash and dad had fish and chips. We were all stuffed. Once lunch was done we went to the Amory and saw where all of suits of armor were. It seemed endless but neat to look at. There are stairs...all over the place. The entire place has lots of cool buildings to walk through. Spoiler Alert: the Beegeaters live there. A week after going to the Tower I told someone that it was my favorite part of London...my mom almost passed out. "
"June 25, 2016",Lots to see!,"The White Tower was built in 1078 AD.Just knowing that it has been around for that long is absolutely amazing!Walk along the wall, see the royal jewels, walk the grounds, it's all so cool. "
"May 27, 2016",A must see in London!,"Absolutely loved our visit here. We took the yeoman warder tour which was excellent, and also explored on our own. It was every thing we hoped it would be, oozing in history and gore. The Crown Jewels are also not to be missed! We stopped in the restaurant on the premises for lunch and also enjoyed that. The food was hot and fresh, and the staff was very friendly."
"May 27, 2016",Must-See in London,"This was my second visit to of London and HAD to make a return visit to the Tower of London.  Although we purchased a London Pass which gave us free entry to this and many other top locations and ""Fast Pass"" options to many venues, including the Tower of London, we didn't need the Fast Pass entry as we were at the front of the line when the venue opened.  It didn't take long for the lines to grow so we were glad we read the schedule wrong and thought it opened half an hour earlier than it did!  The coffee shop across from the entry shack gave us a welcome rest before queuing up.  (More about the London Pass in another review.).  This is definitely one site to visit early in the day.  We spent 3 + hours there and could have easily spent more.  There is a very informative and humorous  tour you could take from one of the Beefeaters.  We did this tour the first time we were at the TOL a number of years ago but we had two couples with us who were there for the first time, so this time, we bypassed the official tour, bought a guide book and headed off on our own.  TIP:  Avoid the tourist traps at the entrance of the venue.  You can easily go back to those later.  Go right to see the Crown Jewels before those lines get out of control.  Knowing where we were going and what we wanted to see saved us loads of time we would otherwise have spent in lineups.  The chapel was closed when we went to go see it, but our hubbies, who we lost shortly after entering the TOL (we went right, they went left) said they were able to walk right in.  We were able to leisurely tour through 90% of the buildings during the time we spent there and came away with a new appreciation for the history of this magnificent venue.  Being a Tudor-aholic, this is my favorite stop in London and I'm sure it will be yours too!  "
"May 18, 2016",A must see,"Even if you are not a history buff the average sight see'er will find this place incredible. The suits of armour, weapons and other historical artifacts from Henry VIII and before are well preserved and worth spending time studying. The Crown Jewels are spectacular."
"May 18, 2016",A great day out,A UNESCO World Heritage Site - a great day out. Follow a beefeater as he takes you on a tour. Be dazzled by the diamonds and other precious stones set in the Crown Jewels. Find out about the history - learn of those kept in the tower and of their fates! And keep an eye out for the famous Ravens!  
"May 17, 2016",Take your walking shoes; ask for Beefeater Spike!,"Our guide was Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) Spike. He displayed exactly the right mix of humor and dignity. If there's any way for you to plan in advance, make sure that you get your tour of the Tower of London with Beefeater Spike. For those who only want to see the Crown Jewels, just go and see the Crown Jewels. The rest of the tour, complete with a thousand years of British history, was truly awe-inspiring for an American who country is less than 250 years old."
"May 16, 2016",Absolutely loved it!,"With my boyfriend we went to visit the Tower of London and I think it is a wonderful experience.. I really reccomend taking A Yeoman Warder tour, which is free and starts every half an hour i think.. It is very interesting and you learn a lot about the history of the Tower.. our guide was Spike and he was great, very interesting and informative, we loved it!"
"May 10, 2016",Modern City...Ancient City,"The Tower provides a perfect example of how ancient London actually is.  It is somewhat startling to see this ancient castle sitting in the middle of modern London walking out of the Tower Hill Underground station!  If you are a British history buff or just want to gain a bit more understanding about London's history this is a must see attraction. Go early in the morning, the ticket booths open at 9:00am, to avoid the crowds. We spent about 3 to 4 hours touring the Tower and by late morning it was starting to get crowded.  No matter how many times I visit London the Tower will also be on my list to see!"
"April 27, 2016",No trip to London is complete without it.,"This contains so much of the history of london and England that you cannot miss it.  Leave plenty of time because there is a lot to do and see, not just the crown jewels, which are amazing of course.  There are towers to tour, and a beefeater tour which is very entertaining.  It is better to do on a nicer day if possible since a lot is outside.  And of course the view of Tower bridge is the best  "
"April 24, 2016",Excellent guided tour,"We came on a busy Saturday arriving at 10am and immediately joined a Yeoman Warder guided tour. This was both full of bloody tales and in great humour. Beefeater Dave showed us some of the main sites and then left us to our own devices with a site map to enjoy the rest of the attraction. It was a little cold and occasionally spotting with rain which made me think that, although there is quite a lot indoors, it might not be so good on a rainy day. The tour was around one hour and we spent another hour on our own looking at the crown jewels, the armouries and walking round the walls. An enjoyable historical morning."
"April 23, 2016","History, murder and mayhem","Absolutely one of the most exciting and wonderful places to visit. We went to every exhibit, watched the re-enactments (fabulous actors, great voices), saw the amazing Crown Jewels and the Ravens!  Don't miss it. Make sure you wear sturdy shoes as cobblestones aren't easy to walk on. "
"April 22, 2016",Best in London!,"Simply loved the Tower of London!  We were on a family trip - 5 of us in total, two boys aged 10 and 11.  We could have stayed for hours upon hours!  The Beefeater Tour is fantastic and not to be missed!  Thank you Billy Beefeater!!"
"April 20, 2016",Must See Attraction,"If you see only one thing in London, this should be it.  Our family of 4 started our day here.  The crowds to get large by late morning so if you make you way there early in the day and see the crown jewels first you will be very happy."
"April 19, 2016",A must see!," I did tour as a single person.  Allow at least 2-3 hours to see everything.  Highly suggest using London Walks as a tour guide and getting a discount entrance into Tower of London.  I have been twice over the last 2 years.  First time was by myself, second with London Walks.  London Walks tour was by far the best and later I was able too walk around at my own speed to take in the history.  "
"April 15, 2016",must see,Like their own brochures indicate the Tower of London was the epicenter of London long ago and still remains an important stronghold securing the Crown Jewels of England. 
"April 12, 2016",Twilight Tour was a highlight,"Toured around the Tower complex during the day, taking both the guided tour with a Yeoman Warder followed by self guided tour with the audio guide.  Enjoyed it all.  But then came back for the Twilight Tour and that was the icing on the cake.  Small group (out day time tour group had to be close to 100 people, this was only about  30), very personable guide, heard some wonderful stories.  Included some of the ""Creepy"" stories you'd expect but the guide wasn't trying for shock value, it was clear that he truly wanted to engage people.  It is only available on Sunday evenings and does cost extra, but it was it."
"April 7, 2016",Amazing history,"What a great  experience.Magnificent collections of all you can imagine. Weapons, jewlery, and crafts. It was so inspiring that I will comeback next time i m in London. Highy recommended."
"April 6, 2016",A must visit,One of the most important historic sites in the city and a must visit.To understand the full history of the city you should first visit this place.There are always lots of people but be patient and enjoy.
"April 4, 2016",So much interesting history,"We visited on a beautiful sunny day. We saw a live play (watching Jacobites trying to escape) and saw the Crown Jewels, which are marvelous. This is a must see city castle. The yeomen were very nice and accommodating for photos. I loved sharing this experience with my children as I had when I was little. "
"March 30, 2016",Historical,"Every time I visit the Tower, there is always something new that catches my eye. It's a site full of historical information."
"March 28, 2016",Take the Yeoman Warders Guided Tour!,"Must do when in London!!! It is great for people of all ages. I particularly loved seeing the Crown Jewels exhibit. When you go, make sure to take the Yeoman Warders tour. They are very knowledgeable and have a fascinating history. It is way better then just listening to an audio tour. As an FYI- they are not tour guides, they are highly trained and respected military members who have each served more then 20 years, so treat them accordingly.  "
"January 23, 2016",London Pass Helps!,"The lines were not bad, but the London pass does help you bypass the crowd. Yeoman's tour is an excellent way to hit the highlights. In the Crown Jewels, if you want to linger, best to step out of line and let the crowd eddy past."
"January 10, 2016",An interesting visit at a castle,"Whether you are interested in jewelry (crown's jewels), knights and Armour or the architecture of a castle building and the history behind it, the tower of London provides an interesting attraction whilst at London and does not disappoint. Arrive early to avoid the crowd and join the free walking tour for a great introduction into the tower of London. I was lucky to be able to have a humorous knowledgeable and engaging guide. Next up go to the busiest attraction the crown jewels before the crowds start to increase. Although the crown jewels didn't excite me as much as I thought it would, others may find the jewels very interesting.Check out the remaining areas of the castle in the order that interests you the most based on the introductory walking tour that you attended."
"January 9, 2016",Crown jewels and the yeoman warders are great,"Steeped in history, a must-see place on any trip to London. The trip to the Tower of London is made even better by talking to the yeoman warders throughout the tower. They have great knowledge and background and very willing to share their history with the place, the history of the pieces, the buildings and so on.  If you join one of the bigger groups they take around, they're very witty as well"
"January 7, 2016",great place to visit,"Good and informative place to go to learn some things about the history of London.Didnt join the beef eater tour, and roamed around on our own. Informative plaques to tell the story."
"January 5, 2016",Never before have I been so scared....,"...to carry a butter knife.I visited around October 2014, I was unemployed and saved up as a special treat.Whilst waiting to pay at the gates, I did experience some of the ignorant masses who probably read the red top tabloids, as they said screamed out in frustration (due to it being a very busy weekend) ""Why do we have to pay to visit one of the Royal Palaces, don't we pay Her [Queen Elizabeth II] enough as it is?""...needless to say I had bit my tongue as it clearly said on the ticket office windows that The Tower is not financed fully by The Crown and in is held in trust by the charity ""Royal Historical Palaces"".Once I bought my ticket I presented myself to the entrance of the Tower and had to undergo the usual security measures you might expect at the airport, and on the waiting signs it has a large ""no knives"" picture and I was panicking as I had a packed lunch and inside it was a butter knife to spread my soft cheese on crackers. Need not have worried as they let me pass with a warning not threaten a raven with it.The Tower has many regular guided tours free of charge starting at the gatehouse, and show you the famous spots within the Tower and it's courtyard - depending on the Yeoman Warden this tour will either be made by sarcastic humour [good for those who already know some of the Tower's history as some jokes only have full value with that prior knowledge], some like to ham up the performances to make it more exciting - especially at the spot for execution.This tour depending on group size and warden can take about 45 - 60 minutes going from gate house, Mint Street, Traitors Gate and the Royal Chapel.The Crown Jewels is obviously the main draw for some for the Tower, so expect very long queues, especially during school holiday periods and weekends. The jewels and the history of the Queen's Coronation is details in many small plinths/sections which can be viewed either by walking past or standing on a moving travellator. At the end is the full regalia with the Imperial Crown of State and other symbols of Royal power.[Note: before viewing, check the Royal Calendar or Government Website in case you happen to visit on the ""State Opening of Parliament"" as on these days the Crown, Sceptre, Orb and other symbol will be missing or replaced with replicas]In the Main Keep you will find the Armoury with examples of various weapons potentially used in the numerous battles the Crown would have had over the centuries, with a long gallery of horses and effigies of all the Kings in the Royal Succession. (Queens didn't usually mount up for battle, with there being so few Queens in the Royal Lineage, not surprising really)There are a number of gift shops around the Tower with the largest being in the basement of the The Keep, as well as a small restaurant/café in the old stables."
"January 1, 2016",Simply a must see,"You can't go to London and not see the Tower. Don't bother booking a tour. The Yeoman Warder's offer free tours, and are much better. Ask at the entrance where to meet (usually just inside the main gate). These guys are amazing, truly dedicated to protecting the crown, and all have over 22 years of military service. Enjoy!"
"January 1, 2016",A bit pricey but worth it,"As with all things in London, this attraction isn't cheap. I believe it cost me around $60. Still, it's a must-see! The grounds are unbelievable and to be able to see King Henry's Throne and the crown jewels in person is an experience you won't forget. "
"December 28, 2015",Fascinating place!,"So much history all over London but this place is catnip for anyone interested in Tudor history. THIS is where so much happened; so many people imprisoned & executed here. The tour guides (beefeaters) are very good although I think they ""embellish"" a bit for the tourists.Can't recommend it enough!!January was a great time to visit due to LESS CROWDS."
"December 26, 2015",Crown Jewels and Suits of Armour ... Definitely the Highlight!,Viewing the Crown Jewels and the suits of armour was definitely a hit for the whole family. The kids enjoyed learning the history of the kings and queens over the ages. Walking around the top of the outer wall gave a great perspective of the entire place!
"December 25, 2015",Definitely should be on the list,Definitely worth a visit for the history and the sights.  For us (family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers) the highlights were a) the guide who made it interesting and fun for both adults and the children b) the crown jewels and c) the walk on the walls for great views and photos of Tower Bridge.
"October 13, 2015",Go early to the Tower and avoid the queues,All I expected and more - so clean.  Best time to go is early so we didn't have to queue anywhere. Don't need audio guides as map and information extremely helpful.
"October 7, 2015",So many layers of history all in one place.,"Plan to give this amazing place a full day. There is so much to take in and enjoy. The school groups had the right idea, bring lunch (or plan to eat in the nice cafe), rest up on a bench and keep going. There is something for everyone, from the beautiful jewels presented along with their symbolism, to the grim and grisly stories associated with the prison. We were able to take our time, wait a few if there were groups, and study everything in as much or little depth as we wished."
"October 6, 2015",Heads will Roll  - but there's more,Beyond the morbidly fascinating history that everyone knows  - the beheading ordered by Henry VIII of his wives #2 Anne Boleyn and and #4 Catherine Howard - there are so many other important historical events that happened on this site. It helps to read up      so you have some understanding of how and why this magnificent set of buildings (including a chapel) have morphed over the centuries. (check wikipedia - so easy and fast) If you don't like history or don't see it's application then better to visit Harrods.
"October 2, 2015",Give yourself plenty of time,The Tower of London was really great and I only wish we allocated more time for it. We did an audio tour which was worth it but took quite a bit of time. I would say half a day or so would allow you to see everything. The Royal Jewels exhibit was entertaining and I'm really glad none of them were in use during our trip. Same with the torture devices ha! 
"October 1, 2015",Buy the London Pass first!,"There's over 7000 reviews already...I'll just say the Tower is awesome but not worth the full price £24.50...but before you visit...BUY THE LONDON PASS!!!!! I only bought the 1 Day pass for £49($77ish), not cheap, but worth it!  Get it at the Tourist Information desk at the airport or the booth near Leicester SquareThe CHUN P Power-Cardio-One Day Tour of London:£20 10am-11am Westminster Abbey£18 11:15am-12:15pm Churchill War Rooms...5 minute walk away from Westminster£18 Thames River Cruise...5 minute walk to the dock, grab a quick take away lunch at Tesco, which will be on your left. Eat on the boat while trying to admire the Thames's not-so-great scenery...£24.50 1:30-3:30 Tower of London...have a coffee or tea break afterwards.£9 4:00pm-Close Tower Bridge...this doesn't take long to visit, maybe 30-45 minutes.£89.50 TOTALTotal Savings £89.50 - £49 = £40.50($62ish)That's what makes this attraction worth the money...at almost half price! :) If you have more time and for a bit more £££££ you could buy the 2 or 3 day pass to see Windsor Castle(£19.20) and Kensington Palace(£17.50) for more savings."
"September 20, 2015",great time out!,"A must do!! The price almost scared us off as we weren't super interested but we're so glad we did!! Interesting and so much to see, great that all the tours are involved, the Yeoman tour specifically is fantastic! Genius way to see the crown jewels too, on a moving escalator, amazing! We ate at the cafe and had a sandwich, wouldn't recommend it perhaps try somewhere else or bring your own!"
"September 20, 2015",Tower of London Tour--Very Interesting,"What a great opportunity to see some old British history.  The entry fee included a free tour by one of the Yeoman Warders.  These are retired military who actually live at the Tower along with their families and who are very knowledgeable about the history of the Tower.  I can't remember our Yeoman's name, but he was very knowledgeable, informative, and entertaining.  Definitely worth seeing when in London!"
"September 17, 2015",Lots to see. Definitely do the free guided tour.,"We started off with a free guided tour. Our Warder was fantastic. Genuinely nice man, and very funny. Lots of interesting facts and stories. The Crown Jewels were well worth going to see, and the other exhibits in there. There are lots of boys toys to see in the white tower (lots of armour etc) and that was a bit lost on me. We didn't have a lot of time there, only 2 hours as we got there around 3 and stayed until closing. Could have spent all day there. We did the Tower of London through the London City pass so was worth doing that otherwise I might have found it a bit pricey. Nice view of tower bridge from the wall. We got there by boat (run by city cruises which was also included in London City pass) and dropped us off right outside which was brilliant."
"September 2, 2015",Excellent organisation of crowds of visitors,"It is worth the high price. If you compare with what you pay in a restaurant, you can stay here for hours and see a lot. Most astonishing for me was, that the Tower of London is like a small village. Interesting to see some of the buildings, the crown jewells etc. If it is too expensive for you, just walk around the Tower, pass the Tower Bridge and get an impression of the former power of the Kings and queens of England."
"September 1, 2015",Get your history lessons started here!,"The tower of London was a very interesting trip as it is full of history and lots to learn. The highlight of the tour is the crown jewels but there is lots more to this attraction. We joined a tour guide who took us to the Chapel and explained to us everything about the Tower grounds. The guides were friendly and would be more than happy to help with any queries. You can go and see the crown jewels in the main tower, the armory in the white tower, the place where traitors were dealt with in the bloody tower and you can walk around the grounds. You may even catch a glimpse of the ravens that are kept on the grounds."
"November 18, 2015","Long lines, interesting visit","It's a must see  when visiting London. However, bring your patience cap, because the line for the crown jewels is looooooong, and unless you have the London pass, the line at the main entrance can take a while as well."
"November 12, 2015",Interesting and where else can you see the amazing Royal Jewels!,"The Tower of London is a very busy attraction but the space is large so not claustrophobic. We used the audio self-guide which was OK – it was difficult to follow the map and understand where you were at any point in time – all things considered,  we would have preferred paying for a professional guide. Seeing the Royal jewels was a highlight, more interesting that we had anticipated it would be."
"November 9, 2015",Boring and expensive ,"If you fancy an over priced, boring day out then the tower is for you. I took my partners family who arrived from Russia and to be honest even for people who don't speak English it's very dissapointing. The staff most of the time were either talking to each other or the feeling that they were stand offish. Walking around looking at empty buildings. And also the main attraction apart from the jewels was supposed to be the blood tower. When you come to the tower you think of the torture etc that individuals went through. Let me say it lacked any imagination. The jewels were very pretty but still not worth 20 pound each for a ticket. If your a tourist you'll pay silly money thinking your visiting the centre point of london. Please save your money. Go and see something else. The tower lacks imagination. The staff are none existent. There is no feel of a story there.  To add the comedy effect they have added wire models of animals to the place. ???I suggest going to Aston hall for the candle lit Christmas. "
"November 8, 2015",A Lot of History Packed Inside Those Walls,"The Tower of London is probably the one historical attraction in London that is a must see for tourists.  To get the most out of your visit, you'll probably need to do at least one of the tours that are offered.  The recorded self guided tours are ok, but they really don't give you a feel for the history.Upon arriving at the Tower of London on a rainy Sunday morning, we were told the Yeoman Warder's tours had been cancelled due to the wet weather.  (It's London, go figure.)  So, we started out with the self guided audio tour.  After taking in the most of the sights, we decided on taking the guided tour of White Tower.  The guide was interesting, funny and kept the tour moving.  The highlight of the White Tower tour may have been the guide's explanation of the Tower's plumbing/toilet system.  We then moved to the back of the line for the Crown Jewel exhibit.  Although the line outside the building was at least 200 yards long, it moved quickly and we were viewing the Jewels  around 15 minutes later.  As we took one last look around the yards of the Tower, we noticed a Yeoman Warder's tour making a stop in the courtyard.  We had obviously missed the first stops and we hadn't thought much about it after being told the tours were cancelled.  But, we joined in with the large tour group and were glad we did.  The Yeoman Warder leading the tour was everything you would want in a guide, someone full of facts and historical information, and just full enough of himself to be entertaining.  Even the zingers he threw at tourists from the other Commonwealth countries and us rebellious yanks made for good laughs."
"November 3, 2015",One of my favorites!,"This is one of my favorite places to visit in London.  From the impressive view of the outside to all the buildings inside.  We bought our tickets online, to avoid waiting in line there.  It wasn't too busy in October, so seeing the crown jewels wasn't a wait.  "
"November 2, 2015",THIS PLACE IS AMAZING,I never went to the Tower of London on my first trip to London and so this time I made sure I didn't miss it and it was the first place to visit on arrival and it didn't disappoint. It was great. If there is one thing you need to do in London it's to visit the Tower of London.
"October 28, 2015",Worth the time to see!,"We took the self guided tour with audio handsets. I think that the guided tour by one of the Beefeaters would have been better and more informative, but it was still so cool! It was alot larger than I expected and there were alot of stairs so I got a good workout. There are amazing views of the London Bridge from the towers."
"October 26, 2015",Getting to be very crowded-but well worth the trip,"I had been to Tower of London 3 times and the best way to see it is on your own (not on a tour) so that you have a whole day to really experience it.  I took my 8 year old son and spent the better part of 5-6 hours there which allowed us to see all of the museum areas as well as listen to the Beefeaters tell their tales of the outside grounds.  We have gotten 2 very good Beefeaters who were very funny and they actually seemed to enjoy the tourists as much as we enjoyed them.  If you find that you can not hear the tour guide then maybe wait to get with another group to see if better. You can find them about every 15 minutes. The crown jewels are a must but the other museum have spectacular displays of weapons, armor and other artifacts that are so interesting to young boys and I rather enjoyed it too.  We also took this tour with one of the day long best of London tours that incorporated a lot of London in one day.  This allowed us to go into the Tower of London prior to actual opening to the public and we got to see the crown jewels right away with no wait.  The downside to this is that you only scratch the surface of all that the tower of London has to offer and you don't get to see much more than the crown jewels.  The Tower of London is a must see if you go to London but is best seen on your own time frame."
"October 20, 2015",MUST DO IN LONDON!,"Tour to this place is excelent to learn about medieval bloody London. If your are going, you should do the tour guided by a Royal Guard (Befeatter), it is an experience you will never forget, they are all excelent Showmans. This time we did the tour with Dave Phillips and he was excellent.One free tour and this are the two things you should do if you only have one day in London, afterwards you can keep adding things."
"October 20, 2015",Not for the wheelchair user,"Tough going, mainly cobbled and where there were fairly flat pavestones they were covered with obstacles. Access without queuing round the back for the crown jewels. Disabled toilet available if you can get to it over the cobbles. Most other things not accessible. A simple wooden walkway would make a huge difference to wheelchairs."
"March 24, 2016",Go early and reap the rewards!,"Spectacular visit when tight for time. We arrived at 9am, when doors open. Bee line to The Crown Jewels and were first visitors!  Had the jewels to ourselves for a bit and within an hour the place was packed.  Take the yeoman Warder tour:  worth it despite the out-of-date jokes (ribbing wives and the like).  Tours start at 10, all the more to see the jewels at 9!  Astonishing spot if you relish history!  Loved it!!"
"March 15, 2016",The Crown Jewels,"A must visit for anyone who has an interest in English history and or the Monarchy.  The name is misleading as visiting the Tower of London is actually more like visiting an enclosed village with a number of historical sites, shops and cafes situated within. Highlights for me were the crown jewels (amazing and very well displayed), the white tower, and the place that Anne Boleyn (Henry VIII's second wife) was beheaded.  Also the traitors gate which has featured in many historical dramas from the Tudor period of history and the tower ravens were very interesting."
"March 12, 2016",Incredible,There is so much to do in London but this is definitely worth going to.  Be sure to wear comfortable shoes (luckily I did) as you will have to stand in line quite a bit but it is so worth it.  So much history here!   
"March 7, 2016",A Historian's Dream Come True,"I have dreamt of going to the Tower of London since I was 10 years old. Now, mid-20's, I was nervous that the site would not live up to my standards as a history nerd and frequent traveller. I was so relieved and pleased to be proven wrong! Began with a guided tour by Yeoman Spike, who was enthusiastic, highly knowledgeable, friendly, and spoke loudly enough for his crowd of 40 or so. After an hour under his charge (though I would have gladly kept him around all day), the introduction and walk about was done and I wandered off to visit the Crown Jewels, the White Tower, and to walk along the ramparts. It's really quite amazing how free you are to wander this historic place. You'll need a very minimum of two hours to do the site justice.To arrive, take the tube to Tower Hill and follow the signs, you can't miss it. Buy your ticket online for a slight discount and to skip the lines - with a printed voucher (or on a tablet as I did) you can go straight to the group tickets line and pick it up. Then down to the draw bridge entrance where the (free, with ticket) Yeoman guided tours begin (if you're so inclined, which you should be!).A must-see of London."
"March 7, 2016",A few tips for enjoying one of the world's iconic places,"The Tower of London at £24.50 is one of the more expensive attractions in London and definitely one you would want to include if you've purchased a London Pass. With the pass you get avoid the lineups at the ticket wicket and go directly to the entrance. Also if you take Hop on Hop Off bus that's included in a one day London Pass you get a great view of the Tower of London as you drive across the Tower Bridge from Southwark.The other alternative is to buy your ticket online which will save a few pounds. Make sure to do it far enough in advance that it can be mailed to you, otherwise you'll waste time in line picking it up at the ticket office. The last alternative is to simply show up and buy a ticket at full price, but expect to queue up. Approaching the Tower of London from the Hop On Hop Off bus stop you get this great contrast between the new and the old with The Shard, the tallest building in Western Europe in view behind the Tower.I wish I could give some good advice on the best time of year or day to visit the Tower of London, but things have changed dramatically in the last few years with the explosion of Chinese tourists. While there are going to be a lot fewer visitors in the winter months, in all likelihood the tower will be inundated almost anytime you visit. Usually getting there at opening time (9:00  Tuesday-Saturday, 10:00 Sunday and Monday) is the best advice. Lot's of people suggest immediately rushing off to see the Crown jewels, but unless it's totally insane, that seems too much like a Disneyworld ploy.Once you are inside there are more choices to be made. You can a) just explore the place on your own - not recommended b) join a free guided tour led by a Yeoman Warder - that's a Beefeater to most of us or c) rent an audioguide for £4. The guided tours last one hour and are definitely not to be missed. The Yeoman or in at least one case Yeowoman, are funny, irreverent and informative. You'll definitely hear things you won't hear on the audiotour. However, there is one huge caveat - the number of people on the tour is not restricted so that sometimes the crowds are so big that it is next to impossible to hear the guide unless you are aggressively prepared to elbow your way to the front. My best advice is to go to the collection point for the next tour, which is right after you enter, and see how many people are waiting. If the number on the tour is twenty or less, go for it, but more than that will be problematic. The guided tour does not include the Crown jewels or the White Tower so you can do those after the tour. Even if you decide to skip the tour make darned sure you get that obligatory picture with a Yeoman.What's the big deal about the Tower of London anyway? Well think of William the Conqueror, Richard the Lion-Hearted, bad old King John, Henry III, the boy king who reigned for fifty-six years, Edward I (aka Longshanks, the Hammer of the Scots and anyone else who got in his way), Henry VII the winner of the War of the Roses and of course, perhaps most famous of all, Henry VIII. These were the winners, but lot of bad things went down here as well. Two kings, Henry VI and Edward V as well his little brother were murdered here. Anne Boleyn, Catharine Howard and Lady Jane Grey all lost their heads inside these walls. The list of famous prisoners is legion - numerous Scottish kings, William Wallace of Braveheart fame, three saints including Thomas More, Thomas Cranmer, Sir Walter Raleigh, Guy Fawkes, Samuel Pepys, William Penn, the future first prime minister Sir Robert Walpole and even Queen Elizabeth I. And it wasn't just a prison in olden times. In the 20th century Irish patriot Roger Casement was imprisoned after the Easter Rebellion, numerous WWII German spies were shot here and Rudolf Hess was brought here after defecting from Hitler in 1941. Among the last of the prisoners held in the Tower of London were the infamous criminals, the Kray twins, held not for being murderous thugs, but for dodging the draft.I mean if there was ever a place where the saying, ""If only these walls could speak"" was appropriate it would be here. And actually, in a sense the walls do speak through the graffiti that has been scratched into them by hundreds of unfortunate souls.The audio guide provides five distinct tours including the Norman era, the Medieval times and the tower as a place of punishment and execution. However, even before beginning the audio tour you are bound to notice that the outer walls of the Tower of London facing the Thames is maybe the best spot in the city to get a good shot of the Tower Bridge, arguably the most recognizable bridge in the world. The conquest of England by the Normans is arguably the most important turning point in British history. Never again would England undergo such a transformation, despite efforts by the Spanish, the French and the Germans over the centuries (although in the interests of accuracy the Dutch kind of did it through the back door in 1688). Prior to William's conquest England had been a regular doormat for the Celts, the Danes, the Saxons, the Norwegians, the Scots, the Angles, the Jutes and of course, the Romans. The English were the Toronto Maple Leafs of fighting forces. Anyone could beat them.William decided to change that and it started right here in the Tower of London with the construction of the White Tower, which I suspect most people confuse with actually being the Tower of London, when it's only one part, albeit the most recognizable one. Nobody had ever built such a huge fortress in England before and it became an immediate symbol of dominance and strength. Note in the photo attached the wooden stairs that go to a second story entrance. These could be removed if the place was attacked. The medieval portion of the audio our focuses on the reigns of Henry III and his son Edward I who between them ruled England for almost a century. The two preferred apartments in the outer portion of the tower to William's White Tower and today you can see a replica of Edward's throne from whence he dispensed justice and presided over the development of English Common Law.This is but a sample of the many things to be seen in the Tower of London including Henry VIII's suit of armour, the spot where two of Henry's wives were beheaded, the infamous rack used to torture prisoners and of course the Crown jewels. Don't even think of passing up the Tower of London on a visit to this great city."
"February 22, 2016",Great history trip with young children!,Visited for the 3rd time and this time with my young daughter. She absolutely enjoyed the experience especially the Young Explorers bit whereby they get a small booklet and they have to talk to the different characters around the Tower of London to answer several questions. Fun filled activity and at the end they earn a small prize. 
"February 16, 2016",Got to see Dave,Very nice place. You will see the queen's juwelry and henric the v th clothing....The nicest thing is too take Dave's tour. It is a real standup comedy show from one of the queen's officers. Real english humour.
"February 16, 2016",Worth a visit,"This place is certainly worth a visit, especially for first timers to London. The crown jewels being the highlight. "
"February 1, 2016",Beautiful!,"Loved this castle, great place to visit!  Honeymoon vacation to London and had to visit this castle.  Tour was great but hate that we couldn't take pictures inside some of the buildings.  Great outdoor space for taking pictures of the city.  Must visit if you're in London."
"January 25, 2016",Great step back in time,"Highly recommend the yeoman's tour - entertaining and informative  - and very worthwhile. The Crown Jewels exhibit was a bit of a let down after the long (approx 40 minute) queue. Also don't bother with the dungeon visit - we also queued for about 15 minutes and there were only 3 exhibits - the rack, the scold and one other (i can't remember). It is worth going to see the armoury - amazing to see Henry VIII's armour etc. "
"September 1, 2015",A landmark of British history,The Tower provides one with a good sense of the history of Britain. A veritable panorama of past kings and queens. The crown jewels exhibition i found to be a bit dark but still worth the vist. Dont buy food from the stalls nearby.......over priced and nasty. Take refreshments with you or look for retail outlets surrounding the tower one street away.
"September 1, 2015",Best Historical Place of London,"Early arrival to get in line/que is key for this attraction. Check the schedule for entry time for your particular date. We arrived about 45 minutes prior to opening time, and noticed that several tour buses arrived with 15 minutes of opening time. Simply the last thing that you would want for your visit to the Tower of  London. While waiting for entry review the layout of this historical landmark. I advise to head directly to the Hall of the Royal Jewels and Coronation Items, this area fills quickly."
"August 30, 2015",Far too busy,"We visited the Tower of London in August. I appreciate it is one of the busiest attractions in London but it was so busy you couldn't get a chance to see anything! We arrived at about 2 and we were prepared to stay until closing as there are so many things to see. After being at the tower about 30minutes it was obvious it was going to be a complete waste of time. So many people where there that you had to fight your way past people to see anything. We completely ruled out looking at the Crown Jewels as the line for it was ridiculous, but we partly expected this. We ended up missing loads of places out as it was just a nightmare. We also had two incidents where the staffs customer service was just completely rude. One being in the cafe and another being at one of the ice cream stands.We knew it was going to be busy but it turned out to be a complete waste of money. And the service we received was really poor. I don't know if it would be much better during the rest of the year as I think London is full of tourists all year round. But when we went in August it was just a nightmare. "
"August 26, 2015",Fantastic Tour! Yeoman Warder Merry was fantastic!,"We went early and bought a standard ticket. The Yeoman warders do a free Tour and tell you about the history of the Tower, all the beheading's and the Crown Jewels. Not need to pay extra for tour guides."
"August 25, 2015",Definitely worth seeing! Pre buy your tickets online!!!,"Definitely pre-purchase tickets online!!!! Huge time saver! We arrived there right when they opened, walked right in, you could see the cattle line barriers set up for waiting periods (outside and inside). There's a sign that indicated the estimated wait time from certain points in the line. Don't miss the Beefeater Tour (every hour). Informative!"
"August 14, 2015",Get there early!!!,"Get there before it opens to get in line - and once it opens, go directly to the crown jewels, otherwise you could wait 2 hours to see them!  Also make sure to take advantage of the tour (in good weather) or presentation (in bad weather) - that was the best part for us."
"August 13, 2015",Enjoyable day out,"I took my god daughter to the Tower of London, she is 11 years old and she loved it and it took me back to my childhood, as she was not born in the uk she was fascinated by it all and loved the history behind it, loved the bloody tower and of course the seeing the Crown Jewels, the whole afternoon was enjoyable and no queuing to get in, only £32 for both of us. I think it was value for money."
"August 13, 2015",They have a family headset for family with 11 year olds and under,"We rented ""family"" tour headset which was not widely advertised.  They have a different setting on the same headset that turns it into kids friendly tour.  I have 12 year old and 8 year old.  I did adult tour in the past, but even for me, I liked the kids version better.  We were there in the middle of August and got there around 11am.  Crown Jewel line was so long that we gave up going there.  (We recently went to Rosenberg Castle in Copenhagen and saw Danish Crown Jewel there with no line so we did not line up and wait that long to see something similar).  Armors in White Castle was worth seeing.  My 8 year old hates museums, but he actually enjoyed all the history and the tour.  Highly recommend it!"
"August 12, 2015","Packed With History, The Tower of London Really Satisfies",Liked:  The Beefeaters-led tour.  A tour of the upper floor of the tower.  The Crown Jewels.  The armor (especially Henry VIII's).  Traitor's Gate.  The Royal Mint.Did not like:  The memorial to the people who were executed on-site.  Our meal in the restaurant to the east of the White Tower.
"August 6, 2015",Everyone Knows My Name,"This truly is one of the most famous buildings in the world; who hasn't heard its powerful name. Built by our ‘conqueror’ William (who had a rightful claim to the throne of England so could hardly be a 'conqueror'), it was built as one  White Tower in 1066 William stamped his authority on England by building numerous castles; it is perfectly placed on the River Thames and acted as both gateway and fortress to the capital city of London. From here, if you don’t spend all day marvelling at the White Tower and its numerous extensions over the years,the visitor is perfectly poised to visit Tower Bridge, the South Bank and other great London  attractions. The Tower of London claims to be the most complete example of an 11th century fortress palace remaining in EuropeThe list of people imprisoned here is impressive and includes, and you could get to the Tower by 4 main routes•	attempted assassination of the monarch•	assisting foreign enemies •	speaking against the monarch •	or, considered serious at the time, counterfeiting coinsThe partial list is a who’s who of key historical figuresBishop Ranulf Flambard – (the first prisoner 1232)King Baliol of Scotland (1296)William Wallace (1305)King Henry VI 1465The Two Princes - Edward V and his brother Richard, Duke of York (1483)Sir Thomas More (1535)Thomas Cromwell (1540)Guy Fawkes  (1606)Sir Walter Raleigh William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury (1645)1780, prisoner, Henry Laurens (the only American – 1780)Rudolf HessThe Kray Twins 1952If tha is not enough then there is always the Crown Jewels – or especially interesting but little known to tourist The Ceremony of The Keys, a ritual carried out nightly for at least 700 years"
"August 6, 2015","Moving walkways, did they use those for beheading?",The Tower of London has taken on a bit of a Disney-eque style.  The displays are obviously set for tourists and the moving walkway at the Crown Jewels was the giveaway that this is just another tourist stop.
"August 5, 2015",Worth the visit,"Very interesting venue. Best if you arrive early and head straight to the Crown Jewels. By noon the queue to see the jewels appears insufferably long, as you have to wait in the hot sun.  They had a great idea at the jewels themselves: a moving sidewalk to keep the flow moving. Interesting knights armor and weapons. Suggest 2-3 hours there. And don't miss the minor attraction just outside the tower; the All Hallows' church. The tower bridge was a gimmick, but the Thames River cruise just outside the tower was convenient. One more thing: the railroad has a 2 for 1 deal into the tower if you take the train into town, or just buy 2 train tickets for 5 pounds total . It will save you the cost of one admission into the tower."
"July 25, 2015",Get there at 9am or be prepared for crowds.,"It's a great attraction, and you could spend all day there, but the crowds get overwhelming, so get there when it opens.while visiting last July, I asked the Yeoman when is the best time to get here? His reply was ""December"".  Otherwise he said, get here when it opens at 9."
"July 21, 2015",Step back in time and finish up in Bling City,Join a Beefeater Tour - every 30 minutes. They give you some very interesting facts - god only knows how they remember every beheading... We left the tour after and hour and went on our own little walk about before joining the 25 minute queue for the Crown Jewels - this was very quiet compare to other days. Felt like a magpie in the Crown Jewels. You walk into a vault - 3 feet deep safe door. There are diamonds and gems the size of grapes and plums. De Beers can't even value the priceless collection some of which dates back to the 1600's. You could easily spend the day walking around. Cost of attraction was £24.50 at the site but you can probably get it cheaper on some discount websites. 
"July 19, 2015",Costly Boring ripoff !,"Went on a Sunday. Way to busy, too much walking, torture chamber is farcical ! Don't get me wrong the main tower is full of great armor & so on but to me it just showed what shear wealth Kings & Queens lived in comparison to their people of the time.The queue for the Crown jewels was at least an hr & half long so didn't bother.In summary £35 for 1 adult & 1 child to wonder round an overrated attraction , forget it.If you are really into the Towers history buy a book !"
"July 17, 2015",Fascinating & Engaging,"Going to the Tower of London was a great experience. Though lots of people go there just to witness the crown jewels, there is a whole lot more to see and learn about than just that. There are tours that are complimentary with the entrance ticket, which were really great. Though the tour was fascinating, we ended up breaking off the group because of the many, many people going on the tour who made it hard to hear the otherwise loud man's voice. The crown jewels were absolutely intriguing, with a certain mystery to them. It was a really pity that they didn't allow photographs, because I bet a lot of people - like me - would have loved to share these photos with there friends and share their experiences. There are also many interesting buildings inside the province to explore. If you plan on going, you also have to plan on spending your whole day. That should be fine, though, because of the many cafés. You must go!"
"July 15, 2015",Dont miss this!,"I thought it was a tower...it was a whole city.   Took all day t see it all   It was fantastic--what history!   Don't go to London without seeing this.   Be prepared for a lot of steps.   And don't miss the Yeoman tour, it is awesome!"
"July 15, 2015",Beautiful ,"What an amazing historical place! So much to take in! The beautiful buildings and Crown Jewels make this worth visiting. It is very busy so you need to be prepared to queue for the Crown Jewels, but it is worth the wait!!!! It is easy to spend 4 hours here."
"July 14, 2015",One big queue,The queue to see the crown jewells was massive - waiting times of at least an hour and a half judging by the speed it was moving and the main tower was also very busy.  Poor value for money as we couldn't return again on the same ticket to see the crown jewells at a quieter time.
"July 13, 2015",History with humour,"If you're a history buff the Tower is a must. It was the palace built by William the Conqueror after the battle of Hastings in 1066. Seems William was a little concerned for his safety being a Normand amongst all those Saxons and all. Historically, it has it's place in history but the best part of the Tower if it's actual history rather than the displays (although seeing where Anne Boleyn was actually beheaded or where her remains are interred brings history to life not to mention seeing the crown jewels). However, if you go, make sure you take the live tour and not the headphone option. The tour guides are member of the beefeaters (Yeomen Warders) and have, not only an incredible amount of information, but an absolutely wicked sense of humour. Our guide had us between smiling and chuckling to hysterics. British humour is dry and his one liners were worth the whole tour. I recorded a few of his stops but in hind site should have recorded each one. After the tour we listened to another guide to see if we were just lucky and he was equally funny. Can't say enough about someone bringing history to life with information and anecdotes in such an amusing fashion. It was the live tour that caused me to give the Tower a 5 rather than a 3 rating.History buffs, a must, for the rest, worth the experience. Who knows the tour might even turn you into a history buff."
"December 23, 2015",Tour the castle / fortress from 1050 AD,"So much early London history is here, it's a must-see.  Get a picture with the Beefeaters too - very cool story behind their job."
"December 11, 2015",Amazing History - Take Your Time,Lots to see and lots of walking - but worth every step.  We didn't do the guided tour but heard good things.  We did rent the handheld tour device but stopped using after a few times.  Take your time and plan for a few hours.  One of those places you can visit multiple times and always see new things.
"December 10, 2015",Nice place to take pictures,Beautiful castle next to Tower Bridge (so you can visit both attractions at the same time). You can see a fake guard-changing ceremony here too if the one in Buckingham Palace is too crowded.
"December 8, 2015",Fantastic,"I have visited Tower of London several times, but it is as interesting every time. I love the guided walking tours with the beefeaters, they certainly do tell the history of the Tower (which is not too nice) with a great sense of humour and in a fantastic way. When you visit, make sure you have at least two hours to spend in there - cause you will need it, there is so much to look at."
"December 2, 2015",Henry VIII Armor -- count me in!!,"Great family friendly attraction. We bought our tickets online, brought our confirmation printout to the group sales window to pick up the actual tickets and we were good to go.We also grabbed a few audio guides for a little extra. The Audio guides were actually pretty good...more fun to listen to than most I've heard. Also, the views of the bridge are great from the fortress wall! I also recommend getting there early - they close a little early (4:30pm)."
"December 1, 2015",Highlight of our trip!,"Go on the Yeomen Warders' tour! You will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not! The Yeomen Warders run a tour every 30 minutes and last about 1 hour. They give you the rundown of each area and explain the history of the tower. At the same time, they also give you an explanation of what the Yeomen Warders are. You can totally wander the tower without the tour, but you won't really have the full understanding of each section of the tower. The tour clarifies it and gives you the true history. The history is one part interesting and another part extremely dark. We accidentally wandered into the tour as it was starting right when we entered. Best accident ever. Aside from the tour and tower, this place is well worth the price as you can spend a couple hours here. There are also some nice views of the city from onto the tower walls. You also have a pretty good view of the Tower Bridge. "
"November 27, 2015",The Tower of “Splendour”!,"Our first visit to the Tower of London had been in 2013. It was such enjoyable experience that during our most recent visit to London, earlier this year, we decided to go to the Tower of London again.We travelled via the tube from Paddington to Tower Hill Underground Station and then walked down the hill to the main entrance to the Tower. As we had London Passes, we were able to bypass the long queues at the ticket office and the entrance and gain express admission.It was mid-morning when we entered the Tower grounds and the crowds were not too bad.Rather than take a tour led by one of the Yeoman Wardens, we guided ourselves. We began by doing the long walk along and through the wall. This was followed by a visit to the Jewel Tower to see the Crown Jewels. Fortunately the queue to get in was relatively short. The Crown Jewels were as to be expected, absolutely splendid!After this, it was off up the very steep, temporary staircase, into the White Tower. Here, we saw the marvellous displays of weaponry and suits of armour. There was so much to see, spread over several floors, in the White Tower, that we could have spent half of the day, in there, alone.Later it was out into the tower grounds to see the execution site and the tower’s resident ravens. As we were about to leave, we made one last stop at one of the several souvenir shops, on the grounds, to purchase some mementos of this visit to the wonderful Tower of London.When, at sometime in the future, we make another visit to London, we will more than likely make yet another visit to the Tower. There are just so many fascinating things to see!It is worth noting that the longer we stayed at the Tower, the greater the crowd within the tower grounds became. By the time that we left, during the mid-afternoon, there was a massive queue at the entrance waiting to gain admission. We therefore recommend that it is best to get to the Tower, as early as possible in the day, to avoid the worst of the crowds."
"November 22, 2015",Another London Must See,A lot of medieval history and the crown jewels were beautiful.  The history of England and its Kings was very interesting.  
"November 19, 2015",Excellent on a rainy day in November,"No lines, lots of time to look at the jewels. The drab, rainy English weather helped to imagine the not-too-cheerful history of the ToL. We had only 2,5 hours, but could have easily stayed 30-40 minutes more. Excellent view of London Bridge (i.e. photo opp)"
"November 19, 2015",See the Crown Jewels and have a tour,Very interesting group tour is included with admission. Very funny and lots of history.  Quick line to see the Crown Jewels. 
"July 13, 2015",Don't do it if you are short on time,I was really excited after seeing a documentary on the tower but it was pretty disappointed. We paid for no line tickets and there was no line. The only cool thing was the crown jewels room. Don't think its worth the money
"July 12, 2015",A great afternoon with kids,This was one of the best days - our son loved the whole experience and we did too. Lots and lots of stairs in all directions do be prepared for that. The site does not have lifts that we could see. 
"July 11, 2015",Tower Of London,Its another classic building of London. Must visit if you are going for 1st time. For all types of crowd. No Entry fee.
"July 11, 2015",On a crowded summers day we visited the Crown Jewels,"The Tower of London is one of the United Kingdoms World Heritage Sites.  Renowned for it Beefeaters, the keepers of the Tower, its ravens, and its association with the execution of notable and less notable persons; it is today the repository of the Crown Jewels.  Sponsored by diamond merchants De Beers, there is a magnificent multimedia presentation that precedes an exhibition of the swords, orbs, scepters and crowns that are the symbols of office of the British monarchy.  Less well known is its role as the warehouse of the royal armory, and while paintings of Henry the Eighth depict him as a large man, his suit of armor confirms both his size and majesty.  The tours conducted by the Beefeaters are fascinating and entertaining, as for many the Tower of London remains their place of residence and worship.Visitors to London should not miss the opportunity to visit this World Heritage Site."
"July 8, 2015",Watch your change,Ticket counter peoples will cheat you. Count your change! When I disputed the amount after realizing the error and they refused to refund me the difference until I demanded a supervisor come to sort it out and take it up with agent
"July 4, 2015",A must see on a trip to London,"A great place to spend the day. So much history in one place, for the most part, just as it was hundreds of years ago. They have free tours that start periodically, throughout the day that last around an hour, I thought was perfect. They also have smaller tours that you can pay. So much to do and see in this same area. Tower Hill, Tower Bridge, and down the road is the Parliament and Big Ben. All easily  accessible with the underground."
"June 30, 2015",History. And then some.,"What's not to like? Nearly a 1000 years of history and it's still standing, entertaining millions of visitors per year, organised and looking good plus not missing a beat.Do the Yeoman Warders tour - every half hour and included in your entry price. These guys are the real deal - informative, humourous and staunchly Royal; as they should be. Most seem to have beards too, but I'm not sure if that's a pre-requisite for the job.Dependent on the Yeoman you have leading your tour, you could also end up on Twitter in the panoramic picture he takes of his audience. Though to be fair he does give you the option to opt out of the photo, should you choose (or need) to.Make sure you also take advantage of the additional tours and events that are occurring on the day of your visit; they'll be included in your entry fee too.There is so much to see and do, and you can easily spend an entire day (or more) here. We were there for four hours and barely scratched the surface- and I've been on a number of previous occasions too.The ""Crown Jewels"" experience involves a lot of queuing and to be honest until you get to the artifacts themselves, is fairly boring and non-descript, wandering through semi darkened corridors in expectation. But when you get to the main event and see  the crowns, staffs, and other Royal goodies, they are amazing. And they are the real thing (no fake pastiche crap here - that Imperial Crown was on the Queen of England's head three weeks ago at the Opening of Parliament) and they're all, obviously, heavily guarded. Don't let those unassuming ""guides"" scattered around the place fool you. The usual problem with major tourist attractions is the interminable queues for lacklustre, and frankly mediocre, food and drink at extortionate prices. Not so at the Tower of London. We went into one of the bigger cafes and not only was it designed to process as many customers in the quickest way possible, without it feeling like a cattle market, it also offered just enough choice of food and drink that catered to the majority of its punters. Yes, of course you're going to get Jemima wanting a pea shoot salad, which obviously isn't available, but in that case maybe she should have bought her own as there are no restrictions in having your own picnic within the grounds.The food isn't cheap - c'mon, you're in London at one of the oldest and most entertaining buildings in the UK, of course it's not going to be cheap - but it's also not eye wateringly expensive, unlike some of the more mediocre attractions e.g Madame Tussauds. Additionally, you can also get a return pass and eat outside of the venue should you choose to. But it isn't going to be any cheaper at the ""Traditional Fish & Chips"" places scattered around the area. They're neither ""Traditional"" or cheap.Go to the Tower of London when you're in town and if you're a Tesco customer then you can use their Clubcard deals to get in for about a quarter of the door price. Also if you travel by rail, then you can get two for one entry deals, although you do need to get a voucher from the rail company that sold you your ticket before you arrive.Remember, this is a Royal Palace, one of five in London and also a charity. Go along and learn about the UK's great and good, although most visitors' want to know more about death, torture and the various beheadings and prisoner escapes (and they do cater well for such thirst) but whatever your interest you won't be disappointed.And if you do attend and come out disappointed, then history is obviously not for you. And finally, the bridge you can see is NOT London Bridge. It's Tower Bridge. There are many clues all around you to indicate this. Pay attention."
"June 27, 2015",Little bang for the buck,"Not sure what other reviews liked so much about the Tower of London. I stood in line for at least 20 min to buy the ticket, and it appeared there were only about 7 people in front of me.Got in just in time for the Beefeater tour. It was a large group and he did an excellent job briefly introducing some of the structures inside the tower walls. Once on my own, I was irritated that in order to get the audio tour, I had to pay an additional 4 pounds. For a 22 pound entry fee, I thought they could include the audio tour for free. I opted to forego the audio tour.Now on my own, I looked around for where to start. Took the first flight of stairs to the first 'sight'.  Over the next two hours, I wandered over most of the place--can't really tell you what I saw except a bunch of empty rooms few of which had much explanation about them that I could read.As with Hampton Court, it seemed to assume you were pretty well versed in your history of England. I don't know much, but probably more than the average American. It would have been most helpful if the map they give you on entry had a brief history of the tower, and the kings/eras who lived there.Part of the problem (as with Hampton Court) is that these places evolve over time. A new king comes along and adds on or renovates, or uses the structure for different purposes which further confuses what you are seeing. It would have really been nice to have a suggested tour route the loosely followed the chronology of the kings who dwelled there.For those who love armaments, they had a VERY large display along with lots of suits of armor.Crown Jewels were pretty spectacular and line moved fairly fast, but it was still a 20 min wait to glide down a 20 yard moving sidewalk.I went in what I thought was THE tower where Mary Queen of Scots was held, but I don't recall seeing any plaque that mentioned it.  It all just seemed like a lot of jumbled empty rooms.I spent the remaining two hours of the afternoon at the FREE Museum of London. Should have skipped the Tower and spent all day at Museum of London or Victoria & Albert Museum.In general, I found London's free attractions (walking around outside Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, St. James Park, Hyde Park where birds and squirrels eat out of your hand, strolling along the Thames, Victoria & Albert Museum, Imperial War Museum, Museum of London) far exceeded the typical London (pricey) sights like Tower of London.One final consideration: most of London's tourist attractions don't open until 10 and close at 5. Many of them require 3-4 hours to visit, and if you hope to go to more than one in a day, they'd better be close together. Even going a few miles across London (via bus, foot, or rail) can easily take 30+ minutes so seeing two sights in one day is a challenge. Plan and choose carefully.Other details about Tower of London:-LOTS of stairs-Free toilet-Audio Tour not included in ticket price-Picnicking IS allowed on the grounds-Allow 3+ hours to see it all (but be sure you REALLY want to see it--maybe those who forked over the extra 4 pounds for the audio tour got more out of it)-Beefeater tour is well worth it. Tours run every 30 minutes on the hour and half hour.-Brush up on history of English kings before visiting."
"June 23, 2015",Amazing ,The Tower of London is one of the most amazing things you can do in England. This is a great place to go with kids of all ages. The tower is well kept and definitely has something that will keep even the older kids interested. The tower offers great views of London at the top and is a great expirence that your family will never forget. 
"June 18, 2015","Must see for castle, history and artifacts fans","Tower of London is a historical complex which houses, among others, the British crown jewels, the over 1000 years old White Tower and the place of execution of Anne Boleyn and a few other historical personas. It's a place filled with hundreds, if not thousands, of stories so rich, that you can just feel them in the air. There are a few tips that would have helped us plan our trip, had we known them, so I listed them below, so that you can learn from our experience and plan your visit more effectively.TIP 1: Buying ticketsTickets are quite expensive, as they cost around 25 pounds. There is a voluntary donation of around 2.5 pound included in the price, so if you wouldn't like to donate, you need to ask the cashier to deduct it from your price.TIP 2: Selecting your guideIf you'd like to use a guide book, you can buy it for 5 pounds at the till. If you prefer audio guide, you can rent it inside of the Tower, also for around 5 pounds. There are also some guided tours and performances - you will find the list and the starting times on the leaflet that you will receive with your tickets. We took part in two of them and they were very interesting, especially the tour with the beefeater, who had a gift to engage the crowd and tell stories from the many years that passed within those ancient walls. At the end of the tour, he also explained that beefeaters are not quite usual tour guides and that to become one you need to go through quite a hassle - make sure you stay till the end to hear this story.TIP 3: Planning your stayWe thought that one hour will be just enough to walk around the complex - how much time can you spend in an old tower? Well, it took us three hours and we could have stayed longer. All the tours and stories were just so interesting, that with each and every one, we just wanted more, so depending on your interests, make sure you secure enough time.Tower of London was one of the highlights of our stay in London it was definitely time well spent."
"March 10, 2015",Wonderful in every way! The highlight of my trip!,"Take the time to explore this magnificent museum. Guides were fantastic and informative and so friendly to Americans. Crown Jewels, knights and artifacts were elegantly and effectively showcased. A must do in London!"
"March 5, 2015",awesome way to spend a day,"While on a ""hop-on-hop-off"" tour of London, it was mentioned that ""anyone who speaks the English language...owes some part of their history to this castle""....  to be there and to walk in the same area as so many famous (and infamous) people was an awesome experience!  We did not go on the guided tour given by the Yeoman....but we passed them several times and they, as well as the tourists they were talking to, seemed to be having a really fun time!  We sat on a bench with one of the ravens and we did most of the sites that are there to be seen.  While we could have easily stayed the day, we decided to save this visit for our last day in London so we only had a couple of hours.  While I do feel like we ""got it all done"" it would have been nice to stay and linger over some of the exhibits.  Having gone on February 15, right at opening time...I feel it was not as crowded as it usually is.  In fact, upon leaving...the line to get in was three times longer than when we first entered...so keep that in mind.  I believe the crowds can be large in the Spring/Summer....requiring a lot more time to cover as much ground as we did in the Winter....  There are clean bathroom facilities inside the castle, however I did not notice any place that offered food.   The crown jewels are great but my favourite part was just to be on the ""green"" with the Ravens and just looking at the castle itself."
"March 4, 2015",Wonderful historic site!,"The tower of London is a must see. The Beefeaters are right off the liquor bottle! They are very friendly and helpful. Then there are the crown jewels, absolutely marvelous, a true collection of royal jewels from Queen Victoria's tiny crown to the jeweled scepters. What a display. After that you can see the actual block where Ann Bolynne got her head chopped off along with other torture devices. Just too many to mention. If you are in London, you must not overlook visiting the Tower of London!"
"March 3, 2015","Born Londoner, but still a must visit attraction","I have passed The Tower hundreds of times in my lifetime, but I went inside the walls for the first time last November when guiding a friend around London. The poppy installation was outstanding and very thought provoking. From my point of view The Tower was the highlight of the all the places we visited over 4 days. I will go again at some point this year, and will take my time and spend the whole day there, and if there is a guided tour available I will pay the extra. May I suggest getting a boat from Westminster Pier to the Tower, spend a worthwhile time there and then take a No: 15 bus back to Trafalgar Square."
"February 18, 2015",Be sure to have a beefeater guide!,"After living across the river from this world renown landmark, I finally made it for a proper visit. It's a great place to go with kids - the history is interesting and the tour isn't too too long! I didn't see the crown jewels - the line was too long the day we went, but I am sure they would be great to see. The cafe which opened on the premises is wonderful too - great for just a drink outside or a coffee and lovely cakes! Fed worth the time and money! "
"February 18, 2015",Anglophiles and History Buffs will enjoy!,"Though your ticket will be pricey and the line to see the Crown Jewels will be long, there is so much romantic and tragic history packed behind these walls, it's a must see. I skipped the audio tour and opted for a guided tour by a Beefeater instead. They have an immense amount of knowledge and a way of bringing history to life that you just can't get from an audio guide. The Beefeater tours are free (included in your pricey ticket to enter the grounds) so you might as well make use of them. "
"February 14, 2015","A ""must do"" in London","Really, what can be said about this place that has not already been written?  Situated in the heart of London, The Tower area has been the scene of some of England's most horrific events but also houses the fantastic crown jewels.  My advice- 1) Go early in the morning to avoid crowds.  Even then, it will be busy during the summer months. 2) Get in the line for the Crown Jewels even if it looks so long you think you will never get in.  It moves along at a pretty good clip.  3) Take the time to stop and listen to some of the stories being told by the Beefeaters.  They are entertaining and fascinating."
"February 10, 2015",A surprise for me,"Typically, I often carry very little interest in history, and am usually drawn to more modern attractions. While I did have an interest in going to the Tower Of London (first trip to London, I have to at least go see it), my girlfriend was EXTREMELY looking forward to seeing it. Honestly, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would have. The Yeoman we had for our tour was delightful and entertaining. Between that, the White Tower and the Crown Jewels, there really is at least a little something for everyone. Be prepared for long lines depending on the time of day that you go. Luckily for us, we went first thing on a Wednesday morning. Seemed to help a lot!"
"February 4, 2015",Crown Jewels!  A Must See!,"Traveled to see the Tower with my two young adult children and some of their friends.  Part of the tour is led by a Beefeater (who takes you into the chapel to give you an overview of the history of the Tower of London).  After you are on your own to wander the rest or use headsets for more detail.  Gloomy rainy day, but it's fine because you go in and out of buildings.  Line to see the crown jewels is long, but they are smart enough to wind you through interesting photos as well as a film of Queen Elizabeth's coronation.  Septors and crowns with huge jewels set in them, so cool to see in person!"
"February 4, 2015",Good place to learn about some of British history,"Really good place, if you wish to learn a bit more about British history firsthand. Authentic furniture, cold ancient walls, and great stories brings this place on the top of London attractions."
"May 2, 2015",Not been in a Long While !!!,Just amazing History of my Country !!!! And got a Boat back to Westminster from Tower Pier.........which was an awesome experience in it's self !!!
"May 2, 2015",STAMPS,"Whilst we had an enjoyable visit to ""The Tower"" we just wanted to make others aware of the stamps.  We purchased a book of Tower stamps to send postcards to relatives/friends in the UK.  Having asked if the stamps were okay to use and were told yes, we were really disappointed to find out that when received by the receipients, a charge was made.  Apparently the stamps are not for UK use.  When we contacted the Tower about this, whilst very polite and pleasant, we were told to take it up with the Post Office. Just a word of caution, the stamps aren't cheap (£1.00 each) plus the postcard plus the surcharge incurred by recipients make the pleasure of sending postcards a very expensive activity."
"May 2, 2015",A must see for the London visitor,"Great tours, plenty of room to explore--this is one of the best Historic Palaces of London.  Get there early before the crowds and tours arrive for the best experience."
"April 30, 2015",Don't miss this tour,"The tickets provide a yeoman warder - a knowledgable guide w more than 22 yrs of service in the military - he provided an extensive tour - with fantastic info - it lasted 45 min which was perfect to then visited the Crown Jewels ( on the property / the knights and armory museums - the other parts to this "" village"" - don't leave London without this visit! "
"April 30, 2015",# 1 tourist thing to do in London,The guides are informative and funny.The crown jewels are unrivaled.If you can only do one thing...do this.
"April 27, 2015",Educational and fun for kids!,"My two sons (ages 8 and 10) and I spent the whole day there! Lots to see and keep then engaged. They learned a lot about England's history and had fun doing it. Expect to spend most of the day to explore. There were re-enactments which were enjoyable for kids and adults alike! I highly recommend the Beefeater Tours if they are not too crowded. They are free, (sometimes funny) and informative. Audio tours are ok if you want to go it alone but the Beefeaters added more details!"
"April 24, 2015",Overwhelming feeling of walking among the famous and infamous figures in history!,"Plan to spend several hours mainly because of the amount of walking and stair climbing will require some downtime resting on one of the many sitting areas around the Tower.  Make sure that you join one of the free Yeoman's tours...this is the highlight of the visit.  These fabulous, and very decorated soldiers, give a delightful tour using humor and audience interaction.  If you go early, head towards the Crown Jewel exhibit as it attracts crowds quickly.  There are several nice cafes inside the Tower for coffee and snacks.  Also, the customer service from the audio desk to the front entrance organizers was outstanding."
"April 21, 2015",Oldest London Site,"You can't miss the Tower of London for history, beauty and a sense of time.  From the Roman Wall to the Crown Jewels, there is something for everyone.  I love to see the Yeoman Guards and the Ravens that never leave the grounds.  "
"April 11, 2015","huge lines, little to see","disappointed with the tower, renovations limit displays, 1.5 hour line to see Crown Jewels, over all worst tourist activity we visited, far too many people, "
"April 9, 2015",Gives You Goosebumps!,"Give yourself a lot of time when traveling to the Tower of London!  There is so much to see!  Whether you be a weapons/armor nut or just like hearing the old stories, there is something for everyone.  As soon as I entered, I got a feeling like I was back in time.  It literally gave me goosebumps!  Like you can feel the spirits passed.  There was so much to see, if I ever get to London again, I will definitely go a second time!"
"February 4, 2015",Get there 9am,We arrived at opening time and it was fantastic we practically had the place to ourselves. And no cue to see the Crown Jewels   The cafe was lovely but cakes expensive.  This is must on any visit to London
"January 21, 2015",Tips to avoid the lines when visiting with small children,"Arrive as the Tower opens. If you are a family with multiple children and plan to visit more than one Royal Palace (excluding Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle) you should invest in an Annual Pass. In fact, you should visit more than one palace because they are each excellent in their own right (check out my Hampton Court review). I have not been to Kew Palace and Gardens in years but its great in the summer.You can purchase the Annual Pass ahead of time and it will be sent to you. If you have a UK bank account you can save even more by paying with your debit card. Of course, I did not follow my own advice and arrived without having bought tickets but I circumvented the ticket line by going to the Welcome Center to buy the pass (they may even sell regular tickets but I'm not sure). If you arrive early you will avoid the lines to enter the Tower- just a few minutes makes a huge difference, so I cannot emphasize enough that you must arrive as the Tower opens to the public. Next, make a beeline straight for the Crown jewels- this way you will stand in line for half an hour or less instead of the crazy lines later in the day that rival Disneyland Attractions. Stop at the Welcome Center before you enter to pick up an Activity Pack- we all enjoyed it- it was an excellent little scavenger hunt with a little history. Don't let the lines deter you, just plan well, use the activity pack and hit the gift shop to make each tyke happy as they exit."
"January 15, 2015",Don't miss even if you have a few days.,Really beautiful and historic brickwork layout well preserved and you can see where the moat was etc. Well kept you can get around easy but if you are seeing the Crown Jewels would suggest you arrive early before there is too much of a line.
"May 30, 2015",get thee to the tower,"This is not a cheap tourist attraction (almost £50 for 2 people) but I would say it is worth a visit.Get there early and go and see the crown jewels before the queue builds up (some people have queued for well over 1 hour) they are well worth a visit- but not sure about a long wait.The armouries is good, henry the eighth and other well known monarchs armour on display.The bloody tour and the tower torture are lacking, the torture tower has 3 items on display and some people had to queue to see these (not really worth the time).The Anne Boyelyn reinactment is good to watch- very entertaining and the characters are mingling with the crowds before and after performances for photos.I would recommend getting an audio guide (£4) this made the visit more enjoyable/informative."
"May 30, 2015",The Say was Sunny,Best way to take pictures of this building is in the sun. Easy to get to with the Tube Tower Hill Station is the best stop. You walk out and look across the street and there is is. Grand and Majestic waiting for you to visit.
"May 29, 2015",A must see,"Loved it. A must see. Dont miss the crown jewels, very interesting. Best to buy the tickets ahead of time, but we did not experience a line at all. It was quite easy to get in."
"May 29, 2015",You can feel the history!,"Even though we visited on a slightly misty, rainy day, you could feel the presence of history here.  It is amazing what was built on this site so many years ago.  How difficult life must have been for those that worked here or were imprisoned here. There is much to see and soak up as you learn more about the Tower of London.  Don't wait until late is the day to arrive, get here early so you can spend the day!  Plenty of activities to keep you busy."
"May 24, 2015",Must See,"If you are a history buff, or just interested in medieval or English history, this place is a must see.  Loved the Henry VIII armor and Bloody Tower.  But, the best part is the Crown Jewels, they are breath taking...  Also, try to follow a tour guide as they will enhance your visit and explain what's what."
"May 24, 2015",A great history ,"When you get inside, take the beefeater tour around the castle, you get a lot of information. Then take a walk to the vault and see the Crown jewels, and then walk around the castle to see all the small corners. There is so much information given to you in an easy manner that you easily can spend half a day there without getting tired. "
"May 22, 2015",rubbish,awful they don't give you a map and no tour so your left to wonder and to cramped and busy not good for kids either 
"May 17, 2015","A Must See, but Tricky","The Tower is a must see, but it is not an easy visit.  Buy your tickets in advance and skip the long, slow ticket lines.  Go EARLY to see the Crown Jewels; if you don't go early it chews up the entire visit.  After the Jewels, seeing the rest of the Tower takes at least two hours.  The audio tour is average, so combine your audio with lectures from the uniformed ""Beefeaters"" for more information. It always helps to read up using a guide book in advance.Right behind the ticket booth (outside the Tower) there are a few sandwich shops that are packed and dirty.  Walk past these one more block parallel to the Thames and you'll see several more that are clean and not jammed."
"May 16, 2015",So much History - a must see when in London,"Lots of reviews for this, so I will try and focus on some tips.  Buy tickets online prior to your visit if you can.  It avoids all the hassles if it is busy and cuts the stress.  Try and get there for when it opens and do the Crown Jewels first.  This bit gets busy and if (like us) you like going more than once on the moving escalator past the jewels, you need to get there in good time.  Don't bother with the audio guides.  These cost £3 per person and instead of guiding you round the whole site as I have experienced at other places, they are limited to the Crown Jewels, Dungeons, and a couple of outside areas.  Two of the audio spots are also in the outdoor areas, so if weather is bad, you won't want to stand and listen!  Buy a guidebook instead.  Has all the info and is great to take home and read after your visit with a glass of wine!  The history in the Tower is practically pouring out of every stone.  It is awesome.  We took two children with us and there was plenty to keep them busy.  The Ravens and Beefeaters were a huge hit, and the wall walk was great too.  We also ate at the new Armouries cafe on site for lunch.  I know you can go out and find places locally, but when you are with children, sometimes that's just a step too far.  We thought the cafe was great - food was lovely and staff were only too happy to help you choose food.  Choice was wide and varied but as we were here in the winter, we all had hot food and it was superb.  This is not a place for people with mobility issues, or those that find walking a problem.  It was a great visit and we will be back!"
"January 12, 2015",Lots to see and learn,"The Tower is full of great exhibits and there are many great things to see and learn about. The Crown Jewels are fascinating and the armouries in the White Tower always catch my interest. I would like an exhibition to tell more about some of the characters who were imprisoned there or met their end at the Tower, but maybe I just like the gore! The walls offer a great walk and a chance to look out across the Thames and the London skyline. I went with a school group and had a student who felt unwell and the staff were helpful and supportive. I only wish that the poppy exhibition had still be there as that looked amazing and I would have loved to see it in person."
"January 10, 2015",Queues so big waste of day,"Was there yesterday on short 4 day trip to london. Happily took a whopping £53 off me for family ticket without warning us queues for Crown Jewels, torture chamber were so vast you had to wait well over hour for each feature ie to do whole thing would take 3 plus hours if not more and a conveyor belt approach used ie all moved on by crowd behind. "
"January 3, 2015",Simply stunning..and......????,The poppies....what can I say....overwhelmed as many others were....as i had purchased one of them I asked a steward if he could point out which was mine....! Sense of humour bypass in that fellow ...! He he...!!
"December 14, 2014",Interesting historical piece.,"Visited the site first time I have been living in London for many years. Winter time is not so crowded so I would recommend this time of the year and it was also Sunday which helped. Great to hear about the history of the site through the audio guide which you can pick up once you enter the Tower. Crown jewels and armoury was amazing, highly recommended. If you are lucky you can do the whole thing in about 3 hours. It is well worth a visit."
"December 10, 2014",There's nothing like it.....,"I've been to The Tower many times, but to me nothing bears going in the winter on a slightly dry but misty day.  I think its something about the atmosphere it creates that makes the visit to such a historic place so special.  I visited with my elderly parents and 9 year old son and we all enjoyed it immensely.  We were there by 9.30, which gave us an almost private tour of the White Tower Line of Kings and Armoury and a similar viewing of the Crown Jewels.  As always no visit is complete without a Beefeater tour, which never fails to engage and impress with its sound bites of valuable history, gory tales and a good dose of humour. The Beefeaters are a font of Tower knowledge and along with all staff, are only too happy to answer any questions you may have. We also had a refreshment stop part way through our visit, which was also a pleasant surprise and very reasonable. Overall this is one of my favourite historical sites in London and I think, for the wealth of historical interest on offer, for any type of group or individuals, it is excellent value for money."
"December 1, 2014",Wish we had more time!,"This was one of the highlights for me.  It was poppy day when we went so we had to get past 1000's of people just to get there so we ended up running short on time.  If you like jewels, of course that is fascinating to see up close and personal.  But also, the collection of armor and the stories!  A headset is a must.  Take one of the live tours if you can.  See it all so you can imbue the history there.  We actually had some pretty decent food in the café.  There is a wonderful picture at the National Gallery of the impending beheading at the Tower of London of the young queen who was in power for under two weeks.  Everything gets tied together if you have enough time to actually visit things in London."
"November 28, 2014",Worthwhile tourist trap,"I had been to the Tower of London back in 1987. The only significant change is the addition of actors giving period performances. Kids will probably really enjoy the performances. There is an enormous amount of history here.  Exhibits are interesting and well laid out. It will take a half a day to get through everything. History buffs will love this stuff. Casual tourists might burn to after a couple of hours.  I took a year of British history in college and had some background and understanding as to the importance of this place, and the people and artifacts displayed. My wife has little interest in the difference between sixteenth century armor and seventeenth century armor.  Two hours here was enough for her."
"May 14, 2015",Kohinoor Diamond,U must see it for the kohinoor diamond.if u are here u must have atleast have 4 hours to see it completely.and please see the tower bridge next to it.london pass saves a lot of time in helping u get a fast entry on a crowded weekend.
"June 17, 2015",Yeoman Clive was outstanding!,"Taking the Yeoman tour once you enter the Tower is a must!  Clive was our guide, and he was very informative and entertaining.  Touring the Tower is literally taking a step back in time, and you literally ""feel"" the history a you walk the halls.  You can easily spend 4-5 hours here. Make sure you check out the Crown Jewels - don't be afraid of the queues- it moves quickly."
"June 15, 2015",900 Years of History,"The Tower of London is a place that should be number one on any tourist's first visit to London.  I've been here twice, and I was impressed during both visits.The tower is very easy to get to from any location in London. It is located right beside the Tower Hill stop on the Circle (Yellow) and District (Green) lines on the Tube. The towers location on the Thames beside the Tower Bridge makes for an excellent location to take photographs of the city.When you visit, you should strongly consider to purchase your tickets before hand on the internet. The tickets are £1 cheaper if you purchase them online. Another added plus is that you can bring the printed ticket directly to the gate without standing in line.When you enter the tower, wait for the next Yeoman Warder tour. The Yeoman Warders or Beefeaters, really make the Tower visit worthwhile. While the Warders speak loudly, do try to stay close to his presentation. The Yeoman Warders are known for their dry wit and I could not imagine being led around the Tower by another tour guide. It is humorous when they make fun of the other tours.  The Warders also give great information about everything that is offered at the Tower.The White Tower involves a lot of steps and climbing. If you are unable to climb stairs, unfortunately you will not have access to this area. In the White Tower, you will find many artifacts from the British Royalty. The Crown Jewels are one of the main reasons that people come to the Tower. The lines can be long, and they were on the day that I visited as it was a Bank Holiday.  Good news though, the Tower has free wifi and you will easily be able to pass your time. There are also some entertainers in period dress and their antics will keep you occupied.Take the time to climb the walls as once again, you will get great views of the grounds and the surrounding city.  Once again, this area is not easily accessible if you have difficulty climbing stairs."
"June 14, 2015",Crown Jewels are worth the wait,we took the tour--very hard to hear but highly interesting. allow for at least 3 hours.  not a lot of food so you might want to take a snack.  we really enjoyed the Tower.  i would not suggest taking children under 10 as it is a lot of history and walking.  But our teens enjoyed it. 
"June 2, 2015",Don't Miss,"So much to see here that you could spend all day soaking in all of the historic pieces. This is one of those places you have to visit if you are interested in the history of England. See the Crown Jewels, the ravens, the White Tower, and much more. Lots to see and learn for all ages. Highly recommended."
"May 30, 2015",Great for everyone,"So much more than the ""tower"" itself, this expansive collection of buildings and exhibits covers the Crown Jewels, Knights in Armour and much, much more.  Enjoy a ""Beefeater"" tour if you can, we found it too crowded to be very enjoyable, but the rest of the visit was well worthwile."
"May 30, 2015",Inaccessible in a wheelchair,"Obviously this is a very old site and you wouldn't expect ramps everywhere, however the whole site is cobbled from the entrance gate in and the 'access routes' are narrow, uneven and cluttered with benches and bins. Unless your wheelchair is good at negotiating cobbles - most get stuck and nearly tip over - do not visit unless you can get out and walk. Jewel House good once we finally got there, getting back to the exit was really hard though."
"May 30, 2015",Don't miss even if you have a few days.,Really beautiful and historic brickwork layout well preserved and you can see where the moat was etc. Well kept you can get around easy but if you are seeing the Crown Jewels would suggest you arrive early before there is too much of a line.
"May 30, 2015",get thee to the tower,"This is not a cheap tourist attraction (almost £50 for 2 people) but I would say it is worth a visit.Get there early and go and see the crown jewels before the queue builds up (some people have queued for well over 1 hour) they are well worth a visit- but not sure about a long wait.The armouries is good, henry the eighth and other well known monarchs armour on display.The bloody tour and the tower torture are lacking, the torture tower has 3 items on display and some people had to queue to see these (not really worth the time).The Anne Boyelyn reinactment is good to watch- very entertaining and the characters are mingling with the crowds before and after performances for photos.I would recommend getting an audio guide (£4) this made the visit more enjoyable/informative."

"May 29, 2015",A Poignant Time,"The fact that William the Conqueror's Tower, built in 1078, is still standing is pretty amazing. His powerful presence and lasting legacy endures.We bought our tickets at Heathrow ahead of time, so we avoided the lines to get in. We highly recommend the Yeoman Warder's tour to get acclimated. Our Beefeater, Kevin, was terrific.So much to see: The White Tower, the Kings' armor collection, The Crown Jewels, Tower Green, the Ravens, Traitor's Gate, etc. One of our favorite experiences was to walk outside along the top of the castle walls as sound effects of charging soldiers and flying arrows recreated the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.The special ceramic poppies exhibit for those who fought and died in World War I was particularly moving. The cost of that war, and by implication so many others, was brought home in a strangely beautiful and incredibly powerful way that no words could ever match. The Tower itself has a bloody history, but in our modern day, at least, it is gratifying to know that it is being used for peaceful purposes to entertain its guests. We felt privileged to be able to visit the Tower at such a poignant time in its history."
"November 9, 2014",Poppies tribute to WW1,I went on my own to see the poppies in October and again with my family in November because it was so important I felt to see. I was blown away by the vison and beauty these poppies created around the Tower. MOVING.... its one of the best things  I've seen in a very long while. WELL DONE TO THIS AMAZING TRIBUTE to all the fallen. Life long memory to never forget. The Tower of London totally awesome you gave the go ahead for this to happen.
"November 9, 2014",Poppies,"Went to see the poppies. It is a simple ,effective and very emotional experience. You get told how many men were killed but you can't visualise that amount until you see the amount of poppies in the grounds of the Tower. It is a beautiful but sad sight to see.but a great reminder of why we should all try to get along together and avoid this loss of life again.feel very privaliged  to have seen this display. What a great idea.This will be spoken about for years."
"November 8, 2014",Very Poppy-lar. ,Visited the tower to see the poppies at 10pm. Still quite busy but could get close to the railings to get in some great photos. Really worth a look. To see the sheer scale of this wonderful piece of art. Such a great way to remember the fallen that fought for our country. I have also visited the tower and would recommend that too. Its a great day out and you do learn a lot. Its been a few years since I've been there but I did enjoy it when I went. I just wanted to share my experiences of the poppies and would advise anyone to go and see them before they go. 
"November 7, 2014",a place of interest for all ages,"I visited the Tower of London yesterday to look at the poppies,  and also to visit other areas.  I was last there in 1966 and the housing of the Crown Jewels has been improved giving much more information and better viewing.  I also went into the Mint museum which was very interesting, the 1914-1918 room which gave an insight into the War and what was required as a recruit.  I walked part of the walls, saw the ravens, had refreshment in the Cafe with a gluten-free cake and thoroughly enjoyed my visit.  I spent more time looking at the poppies which were quite amazing and an excellent memorial to those who had lost their lives in the War.  It was busy but there were no problems, it was good value and I am pleased that I did not miss the experience."
"November 6, 2014",Fantastic day out for all the family,We were lucky to visit when the poppies were all installed - a really amazing and moving exhibition.  There is so much else to see from the crown jewells to the beefeaters.  A must for anyone visiting London
"October 31, 2014","The 1960's called, they want their attraction back!!!","This attraction is bad value for money.  The UK has taken some flack over the years for bad food, bad customer service, warm beer and bad teeth.  The Tower of London just about re-enforces all those stereotypes.This is a magnificent castle and landmark, and something that our nation can be proud of, but I wished we stayed outside and looked at it rather than pay £55 for a family ticket. At this point I'm going to declare that I didn't wait in the queue to see the Crown Jewels, and maybe if I had, my experience would have been a different one.  But I didn't, so I can only judge what I saw.The organisation was a shambles. I bought my tickets on line and was instructed to collect my tickets from the ticket office on the day of my visit.  I queued for 30 minutes when I was told that I could walk straight in through the main gate, other people around me were saying that they'd been turned back with their online vouchers.  Chaos reigned, not the best start.The Poppies were amazing, no question, very thought provoking and worth seeing, but they can be seen just as well from outside the castle.Some of the displays were pretty poor, e.g. the Royal Beasts, where the public are offered a whitewashed room with some dull drawings, pictures and text.  Seeing all the Victoria Crosses was very special, but the supporting info-graphics in that area were drab and dull.I think after about 90 minutes we realised that we'd made a mistake visiting and planned a hasty exit back down to central London and had a great time at the area around the London Eye, Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square - all for free -.With other attractions really upping their game across the country, the people running the Tower need to think hard about their customer, and what they expect to get for the entry fee.  This is either a working castle supported by the government and a minimal entry fee, or a self funding enterprise.  Take a leaf from Warwick Castle, an excellent day out with lots of interaction and displays.  Can't even remember how much I paid to get in, but lot's of good memories."
"October 31, 2014",The visit was spoilt by a complete lack of crowd control,"Having seen and read in the media about the Poppies in the moat, we decided to take our two teenage kids up to London at half-term for the day get a sense of occasion and what the whole thing represented.The sight really was something to behold and will certainly remain in the memory for a while. Sadly the other thing which will remain in the memory is the whole money grabbing side of the Tower Experience where the organisers of the facility were clearly more interested in how many entrance tickets they could sell, rather than whether the visitors had a memorable and enriching visit. We queued about 20minutes to get our entrance tickets and then queued another 20 minutes to get in the gate. What we found when we got inside can only be described as total chaos. The size of the crowd was more akin to a major premier league football game. There was absolutely no organisation with regards to managing the queues and you could see tempers starting to get frayed when people who had clearly queued for over 30minutes in an overflow queue to the main queue for the Crown Jewels were then told they had joined a false queue and had to start again from somewhere else. I know it was half term and would be a busier time of year but this was basically a complete disaster. After a while all of our group started to feel very uncomfortable about our personal safety with regards to the number of people that had been let in and we decided to leave as if there had been a security scare our fear was that it would have been a mass stampede to get out of the very narrow exit and someone could have been seriously injured.As we made our way to the exit we had to push against the crowds that were still pouring in and still queuing outside to get in.Overall we felt like we had been fleeced of our entrance fee."
"October 31, 2014",ENJOYABLE DAY BUT....,Well worth a visit and the site of all the poppies is very moving.  We waited in line for an hour for the Crown Jewels which I didn't think was too bad considering it was half term! However I would recommend getting there early and seeing the jewels as soon as you arrive! as by lunch time the line for the jewels was triple!  I was amazed at how many people were there with buggies and very young children - not recommended for the very young - by the afternoon alot of very bored/crying children - not a place I would have chosen when my children were very young.  You can see the poppies WITHOUT going into the grounds itself!
"October 30, 2014",One of the must sees during a trip to London,"Everyone has their own list of things you must see on a trip to London...I think everyone would agree this is a must.  There is so much tradition and history surrounding the Tower...the stories of intrigue and mystery...all the makings of a good movie.There were a number of things we did not do I wish we had at the Tower, but the whole trip was a whirlwind, so here are just a few suggestions:- Get there early -- Like a couple of other reviews I have read recently, it is best to get there when it opens and get one of the first tours from the Yeoman Warders.  Definitely worth missing the wait.  The crowds are heavy with the Poppy display currently going on.  I would allow at least half a day if you start when it opens to take in it all.- Read up a bit -- All of England is so full of history, but there are certain places that are richer than most.  Even if you start with Wikipedia, do yourself a favor and read up on the Tower.  It will help give some background on what you hear and see.  Even as a history buff, there was so much I was not aware of until the visit.- Walk all around the outside too -- We arrived from a boat on the Thames, so we came from the Tower Bridge.  Not until later did I realize there other great viewing angles (for photos) from the other side of moat wall that made for great shots!- Do see the jewels -- May seem hokey, but it is worth seeing.  If you get there early, you will avoid the incredibly long line that develops during the day.  - If you can, you need to see the poppy exhibit -- The exhibit is called ""Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red"" and commemorates the British (all subjects of the Crown) who lost their lives during the first world war on this year, the centennial of its start.  I think as Americans, we forget the horrible toll that war had on all of Europe.  More than 880,000 red ceramic poppies will fill the Tower moat area, each placed by hand.  It is as moving as anything I have seen when you grasp that each poppy represents a life lost during the war...and that is only on one side.  There have been a couple of art critics who have panned the exhibit, one horribly so in a blog in the UK Guardian, but as one who has seen many of our country's memorials, it is well worth the visit to take in the magnitude of this exhibit. The display lasts until Armistice Day, November 11th of this year.  There is a restaurant on the grounds, but I would suggest heading over to Borough Market for some great food!  Lots of market booths and fresh fish.  You can find just about any kind of food over there -- not a far walk and definitely a cheap cab ride over.Plenty of ways to get to the Tower...accessible via the Underground...just start your day there and you won't regret it."
"October 29, 2014",Ceramic Poppies - Must See!,"As part of my 65th birthday present from my wife, we visited the Tower of London. We took the tour with a member of the Yeoman of the Guard, very funny, irreverent and hugely entertaining - recommend it. However, the poppies are just awesome - they have to be the must see exhibit this Autumn. Very moving, very beautiful, takes your breath away."
"October 8, 2014",Go and See the poppies it's Free,"The poppy field around the tower to commemorate the dead of World War I should not be missed , there will be c 900000 ceramic red poppies when 11 November comes. A very moving and spectacular  tribute to those who gave their lives for freedom. You do not need to pay for entry to the Tower to see them all."
"October 5, 2014",Could have spent the whole day here.  Take the Beefeater's tour!,"I probably have more pictures of the Tower of London than any other single attraction from our 2 week trip to England.  We arrived as soon as they opened and the place was fairly quiet for the first hour.  It got more crowded as the day wore on.Knowing what I know now I would visit the crown jewels first if you arrive early, then take the first available Beefeaters tour.  This will give you a good overview so you can explore on your own later.  The crown jewels didn't interest me, but I know they do most others.  You stand on a conveyor belt that glides you past crowns, sceptors, rings, and lots of bling.The Beefeaters tour was the BEST!  John was our guide and he not only had a great sense of humor, his voice was loud enough that we could hear him.  Our tour group was large (that's why I recommend doing the tour as early as you can to keep the group smaller).  John took us on a one hour trip with great stories about the tower, and the only way to see the chapel is on a tour.  (John, you know you did well because we're not calling you Jack - the name of our guide if we had a bad review.)There is more to see than just the tower itself and the crown jewels.  The chapel holds the remains of Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Catherine Howard, and others and seeing it brought home how desolate one's fate was if you met your end in the courtyard around the corner.  The dungeon is a little cheesy but worth a few minutes.  The tower itself holds lots and lots of armory.  The grounds are beautiful and you have good views of Tower Bridge.  Be sure to allow plenty of time.  We spent 5 hours here and wish we had a little more."
"October 1, 2014",Ages of History Very Well Displayed,"The Tower of London is amazing and GIGANTIC. This attraction was covered on our London Pass so again, no waiting in line to buy tickets. We just walked right up to the front gate and the lady there scanned our cards and let us in. The adio guides are available for a small fee and they also have guided tours given by the Yeomen. We opted to go with the audio guides on this trip because the guided tour was just starting when we arrived and it was very crowded. So with the audio guides, you just go where you want to within the grounds and hit the corresponding number to hear about that area. In this way, we were able to jump ahead and avoid the big crowds. Only parts of the Tower have audio guides so for some of it, you just look at the displays and enjoy the sights. Well, try to enjoy. Some of the things were quite gruesome. They have a torture exhibit that is small, but does get the point across. I wouldn't have wanted to be put in the ""Scavanger's Daughter"" that's for sure! The crown jewels were of course, very popular. Because of this, you are put onto a little conveyer belt and just glide along slowly as you watch the jewels go by. They are very beautiful and lit well so that they just dazzle but I was not really into the big crowds there. The Tower can feel a little overwhelming at times. At least it did for my mom and I. Every time we walked out of one area, we found ourselves somewhere entirely new and it seemed a little endless now and then. But there are several shops and a nice cafe near where they keep the ravens so we stopped by for some tea and a sandwich and then continued on with our sightseeing. Also, there is the amazing poppy exhibit that will be completed by the 11th of November. It was amazing to see and we took lots of pics of them and there is a temporary exhibit inside the tower that tells you about how they are being made. Very moving. Honestly, I don't know if we even saw everything here as it was a lot to take in all at once. If time allows, I would suggest seeing part of the Tower, and then coming back another day for the rest. If not, then pick out the areas you want to see ahead of time and hit those. Too much at once and your eyes start to glaze over. Even mine did a little and I absolutely love history."
"September 23, 2014",Blood swept lands and seas of red,"This is an amazing installation of ceramic poppies in the Tower Of London moat which you can see without charge. They are being added to daily until 888,246 poppies, each representing a British fatality of WW1, fill the moat. They will be removed after 11 November so you only have 2 months left to see this powerful and moving display. Wish I'd gone at sunset to witness the the Last Post being played and individual dedications being made."
"September 10, 2014",Wonderful Historical Building,"We had an amazing day at the Tower of London and you could of spent all day there.  It is worthwhile paying for audio for a self guided tour.  The queues were long for the Crown Jewels but moved quickly and well worth the wait.  The poppy exhibition was beautiful and represents British soldiers lost in WW1 (888,246 ceramic poppies will progressively fill the Tower's moat)."
"September 5, 2014",Don't lose your head or patience,"Fabulous day spent at The Tower despite the crowds. Best advice I can give is to wait for the free tour with a Beefeater. (they are every half hour in summer during peak time, maybe not so frequent at other times) Our guide was Crawford, he was fun, informative and made the history of the Tower interesting. Also worth the wait to see the crown jewels."
"September 4, 2014",An essential if you're visiting London,"Of all the places we've visited in London this summer, the Tower of London is one of the places that we enjoyed the most. This monumental historic place is loaded with history, and there is something truly impressive about walking in these settings. The audioguide is highly recommended, as it greatly enhances your visit and lets you know more about the history of this place. My advice is that you get there as close to the opening as possible (10 in the morning) and get in line for the Jewels of the Crown exposition right away, because the queue can get awfully long ! That way, you'll be able to take a walk through the rest of the Tower afterwards and won't lose any time."
"September 3, 2014",The Tower of London Remembers Exhibit Not To Be Missed!,"I am not even British and I cried when I saw this once in a lifetime, amazing installation! The immensity of this work of art and the red poppies spilling out from the wall is a sight to be seen. It is a somber reminder of the blood let by the thousands who gave their lives.....thanks to all the volunteers who ""plant"" the 880,000 ceramic red poppies daily!"
"September 3, 2014",Real slice of history,"The Tower of London is about as iconic a site as you can find in London if you are a history buff.  It seems the very walls breathe British history.  We walked in just in time to see the Beefeaters march past, which was cool. Loved walking through the various towers and seeing how things must  have looked centuries ago.Lots of people there, but that is to be expected. The views of the Tower Bridge looming over the old fortress were fabulous. It is a bit pricey, but it seems like just about everything is pricey in London these days."
"September 3, 2014",Poppy Display,"Went up especially to see the 800,000 ceramic poppies. What a display. You don't need to pay to visit the Tower as the display can be seen from all the public access roads around the Tower of London. Well worth going to see."
,WW1 Poppy Experience,"When we got near to the Tower of London there was such an enormous queue that we decided to avoid an inside visit and just kept to the pavement and take a long walk around the outside to see the Ceramic poppies. The number of the poppies is just overwhelming, when you consider that each one planted represents a lost life. The red being a great contrast against the so green lawns surrounding the tower. I enjoyed the visit, but obviously it was a very busy site, the location was overloaded with people."
,Went to see the Poppies...did so much more....,"I'd never been to the Tower of London before (typical scenario when its on your doorstep!) but having purchased a Poppy wanted to go and see the display for ourselves so took the family during  half term. We started with a Yeoman Warders guided tour - which was exceptional....interesting, funny and and educational! This should be on everyone's list of MUST DO's if you are a 1st timer as you'll lean so much more about the history of the place and then know where to go afterwards. Our Yeoman was also hilarious in his story telling...The White Tower, Crown Jewels and Wall Walk are also must see / must do's and the Cafe is an example of how to do mass catering well (ie: It doesn't have to be greasy microwave rubbish) with all the food sourced from the various food markets around London and presented / prepared well.The staff everywhere were always very helpful and polite and there are various displays and acts around to educate and entertain in equal measure. Finally the Poppies are every bit as good as the pictures you have seen....just better in person !"
,A MUST in London,"The home of English Kings and Queens since the 11th century, where they lived and died, were imprisoned and ruled, a scene of murder and gruesome torture. A fortress, palace, armoury, place to keep your money (ie the Jewels and a mint), the list goes on and on. This is one of, if not THE major sight in London. No Theme Park effects (apart from the odd person in period clothing), no modern tourist trappings, this is the real deal. Even if you have the slightest interest in English heritage or history this place is fascinating. A better deal at 20 pounds entrance fee you will not find in London for the crown jewels, Henry VIII´s armour, the White Tower (built by William the Conqueror) with a beautiful chapel, the beefeaters, the ravens plus more. Top tip: wait for the guided tours by one of the beefeaters just inside the entrance, you´ll get a really good synopsis of the history and quite a few laughs into the bargain. Just one word of warning, this place is not particularly handicap friendly as there are no lifts in the old buildings (for obvious reasons) and a lot of steps in them, but just soaking up the atmosphere here is worthwhile."
,The Poppies Made It,"We went on a coach trip, primarily to see the poppies and, by co-incidence, chose the day of the Queen's visit.  We didn't see her as she had left by the time we arrived but the ceramic poppies are an amazing site.  You actually can't really see much of them from within the Tower - a free walk around the outside gives you the best view.However, the trip included a visit to The Tower itself which I had not been to for 60 years.  There's plenty to see and most is very well presented.  It was obviously a busy day but didn't appear overcrowded except perhaps for the Crown Jewels.  Here, standing on a conveyor for a small part of the exhibit kept the queue moving and is something which maybe could be extended as some people did appear to linger obstructing the view of others.We had an interesting talk and visit to the Church by Andy Merry, one of the Yeoman Warders, whose mixture of humour and facts, taught me more of our own history in 20 minutes than I remember from 10 years or so of history lessons at school.All in all, well worth the visit and we left wondering why we tend to avoid our own heritage that foreign tourists make a beeline for."
,A moat full of Poppies,"Couldn't leave London without seeing the Poppies at the Tower and it was well worth the journey across town. Don't know how many there are at this time but the aim is for 888,246 ceramic poppies by 11th November, one for each military death during the First World War. You don't need to go into the Tower to see them as there is viewing all around the tower. We went early evening and it was very moving, a sea of red.  The display will be dismantled after the 11th November so if you can, visit soon. Its a once in a life time."
,Poppies to commemorate British lives lost in WW1,It is free to visit and see the hand crafted poppies being placed in the moat of the Tower of London. Each poppy represents a life of one of the British service personnel who died in World War 1. When we visited on a busy Saturday afternoon we were struck by the beauty of the poppies but also by the quietness of the people standing and looking.  Very thought provoking
,An absolute must do,I literally got goosebumps standing at the Traitor's gate and imagining a teen aged Elizabeth Tudor walking up the steps.  It is almost overwhelming to look at brickwork from 1068 and imagine William the conquerer sitting in the same space. 
,A must see!!!!,"We were greeted by a sea of red ceramic poppies spilling out of the tower and covering over a hundred yards of grass around the tower wall perimeter. Crossing into the tower we had the best tour guide, he was hilarious, informative dressed in beefeater attire and gave us a wonderful tour around thd grounds. This place filled with such incredible history, after 4 1/2 hours we still hadn't seen it all. I definitely will be revisiting when we come back."
,Sea of Poppies and Roll Call,"Whilst on a day trip to London up to November 11 a trip to the Tower of London is a must!The sea of Poppies is a breath taking sight! More so as night falls.This exhibition is free. The poppies are right around the tower and the cascade from a window tumbling down the wall is lovely.However you can not fail to be moved as you remind yourself that each poppy represents a life lost to war.The poppies themselves are quite large and one is displayed in a plastic bubble beside a sign giving details of the exhibition. We went not to visit the Tower and Crown Jewels on this visit (alas time would not allow)The purpose of our visit was to hear a relative's name being called during the 6.25 p.m. roll call of the dead of World War 1.A small crowd gathered and a member of the armed forces together with a bugler also from the armed forces (on this occasion the Royal Air Force) marched to the centre spot and a list of over 100+  names was read out including my relative's and from countries as far as New Zealand and Canada.The crowd were silent and each name could be clearly heard.The poem ""We will remember them"" is spoken and the last post played.Names are submitted on line and you are e-mailed with the date and list of  all names to be called.We were notified a week after submitting our relatives details.    Get there early for a good position down from the steps leading to the path around the Tower.Each poppy is available for purchase and we have one ordered."
,Great history but avoid bank holidays,"What a great place to visit!!  Entry was £25 and was well worth it!!  We went Easter Monday and the place was packed so I would recommend avoiding any long weekends or holidays.  The Yeoman's tour is very popular and is often a very big group but again, really worth it.  Unfortunately we ran out of time to see the crown jewels as we had a flight to catch, so we will be back to check them out later."
"October 22, 2014",Great place to visit,This is a good place to visit. With all its narrow stairways and places to explore. the Crown Jewels and all the garments they have there is just worth the visit on its own. But there is so much else to see. It takes you right back to medieval times wile you are right in the heart of today's fast pasted world. This place is well worth the visit.
"October 21, 2014",Nice oasis near London Tower,Nice place to have lunch and eat something quick. Calm spot with friendly staff. Worth the visit if you are near London Tower. 
"October 21, 2014",The Tower is a great site,This was my second time visiting The Tower of London. It is a little expensive to enter but you get a lot. The free Beefeater tour is a lot of fun as well. They take you around in a small group and give talk about historical events and superstitions. Eight of us were traveling together and we had family members from 10 to 60 years old and everyone enjoyed it. The crown jewels are a must. Bring good walking shoes and enjoy the grounds. After you take the tour you will be able to explore more on your own. My niece and I spotted two beefed terse and left the tour group for a moment to take pictures with them. They were great sports and even joined in the fun as we were having a great time. This is a must see site!
"October 20, 2014",Great location- amazing historical area to tour.,"We have been to the Tower twice now. And it's always in March. Even tho it's still cool and damp, it seems fitting for the atmosphere of the tower. Amazing location- great place for pics of the tower itself and the tower bridge. The historical aspect is hard to wrap your head around. I do suggest going to the tower in March. The queues are not outrageous as I imagine them to be during high traffic tourist season. You can breeze in and out of the White Castle/armory in the center and the Crown Jewel rooms (no pics in the jewel rooms).  You do have to watch for large groups of French school groups which are always in London it seems. The price is a little higher, but they do have to pay the staff and maintain the grounds. And uphold the traditions of the Tower so paying that seems to really be a small price. There are restaurants and pubs across the street which you can snag a table of you get there before all the offices from the financial district let out for the day. Spend some time there and miss the high traffic late afternoon rush hour on the tube. Amazing history. I suggest taking s guided tour. The hubs and I have wondered thru it twice at our own pace and after watching a PBS special about the tower I realized how much we missed about specific details on the history. It will be worth your time to have the pros teach you about the tower when you are there."
"October 18, 2014",Beautiful Tower of London !,"We decided to go to visit the Tower of London with 2 friends . Visit was pretty good because we had a guide, Billy , with excellent skills in history and he knew what he was talking about . He made the visit going so fast and interesting thanks to his charisma and humour with his special touch . Tower is very nice and chapel is so beautiful . I recommend to get the free guide for it to make the visit better . It is must see in London . X "
"October 17, 2014",Get there early to avoid the crowds,"Fabulous architecture, great history, good workout, great Yeoman storytelling, really getting there by boat, and the most fabulous jewelry collection in the world. Get your tickets in advance !"
"October 15, 2014",Wow!!!,"Aside from being one of a kind structure in England, I'm really amazed of its historical background...Really amazing!!!"
"October 12, 2014",not cheap but very nice,The audio guide was very helpfull as english is not our first language. It was very interesting and instructive to understand part of the history oficial the United Kingdom. Luckily we saw groups of children with their teachers visiting tais important landmark. Do not miss it!
"October 11, 2014",Worthy of admission price,"The guided tour - included in admission - is good.  After you do that, there are several good historical displays throughout the castle which you can self-guide on.  Spent almost two hours here.  Tip: go up on the wall in the SW corner, and go all the way around from there.  "
"October 9, 2014",Best value for money,"The Tower of London is the best value for money for any tour in London.  Free guided tours are conducted by Yeoman Warders.  Yeoman Mark certainly brought history alive.  Great for children who always love guts and gore.  Do it once, but do it.  Best to arrive early (before the bus tours).  See the Jewels and then meet near the entrance for the tour.  The exhibition of poppies in the moat was also a superbly moving experience."
"April 7, 2015",If you only see one attraction in London it has to be this,"This was the third place I went to in London and it blew the other two places out of the water. It was amazing going around and learning about all the history, The best part, by far, was the free tour given by the Beefeaters. Our tour guide was extremely funny and made the tour fantastic. I have never enjoyed any tour anywhere as much as I did this one solely because of the Beefeater. He made quite a few stereotypical jokes targeted towards certain races, but they were funny because they weren't anything malicious and he aimed that at everyone, even English people. One helpful piece of advice, if you want to see the crown jewels go there as soon as it opens because it gets very busy very fast and you'll have to wait in line for over an hour."
"April 5, 2015",Awesome medieval experience,"Pro tip - take the tour that starts at the entrance gate, it's the only way to see the Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula. The site is an excellent collection of buildings and associated exhibits. You can see everything from the Crown Jewels to armor and swords to the Ceremony of the Keys. If you explore the entire site then this can easily be a full day visit. I loved visiting the Tower of London."
"April 3, 2015",Suprisingly lame,"The Tower of London was one of the places I was most excited to visit during my trip to London, and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment of our vacation.  The lines (or queues as they call it), were INSANE. There was a queue to get in, then queues inside for each thing there is to see. We chose the shortest queue first (the Bloody Tower), which took over 40 minutes, and the walk through the tower itself took about 10 minutes. The exhibits also weren't very well done to me. Not worth it. We also did the wall walk, which moved at a glacial pace and with people bumping against us the entire way. We utilized the audio guide, which I found to be mediocre. We also attempted to join the guided tour, however, the group was too big and we could barely hear what he was saying as his voice was not loud enough to carry. To top it off, the sense of history here felt sadly absent. I liked this place better from the outside.  The poppies are dramatic and stunning."
"March 29, 2015","888,246 ceramic poppies","That is the number of English soldiers who died in  World War I and an artist made one ceramic poppy for each of the dead soldiers.  It was an incredible sight.  On November 12, 2014 they began dismantling the exhibit and sending the poppies to those who had purchased the poppies.  The proceeds went to Veterans' organizations.   We did not visit the Tower of London this time.  We just admired the poppies."
"March 27, 2015",First Rate Attraction,We visited the Tower of London ad the poppies display and went on a guided tour which was very informative and interesting. As it was late in the afternoon there was no long line to view the Royal Jewels and that was a special treat. There is so much British History that took place within the tower walls.
"March 25, 2015","Plenty of poppies, people and memories","I went to see the installation of poppies on November 9th. I have not been in such a large gathering of queuing people, neither have I witnessed such patience of a crowd. The reason was that people showed due respect for each one of the lives that were given, represented by a poppy and that the installation was so breathtaking. Beautiful."
"March 21, 2015",Poppies...,I was in awe when I approached the Tower of London and saw all of the poppies.  What an amazing tribute to all of those who served .
"March 21, 2015",Poppies are just magical,"Not there for long so get there ASAP. Despite the thousands of visitors it is a must see, try and join the queues on the Tower Bridge side of the Tower of London and then work your way anticlockwise. You will then get good views of the cascade from the Tower's window and the spray by the River Thames. Don't try and rush though ....you will need a good couple of hours just to get around at the moment!"
"March 20, 2015",Beautiful place,"Very interesting to see such well preserved antique structure, with almost 1.000 years old, in te middle of a large city as London. I like very much of the art installation called ""Swept Lands and Seas of Red' around the place, with lots of artificial red flowers."
"March 13, 2015",Poppies,A very emotional but beautiful scene here. A must see if visiting London. Especially at night when  the lights illuminate the flowers
"November 26, 2014",beautiful,went to the tower to see the poppies.absolutely stunning.having visited the tower before we didn't go in this time but do remember it being a fansinating place with amazing exhibites. very crowed but we managed to get some lovely pictures.well worth a visit but be prepared for long queues. 
"November 26, 2014",Poppies Looked Amazing. Disappointed in the attraction,"Well, let me start by saying the poppies were absolutely amazing and so moving. Very fitting tribute for the men and women who died for our freedom.However I was extremely disappointed and confused by the set up and organisation of the Tower of London.Granted we arrived late on, about 11am, and were greeted by a queue that stretched around the front entrance, and all the way back to the road.There was nothing to indicate how long a wait you would have (like what you get at theme parks) no organised queuing system, people pushing in front and no staff to assist.There was no signs to indicate which booths you go too to buy the tickets (again all of which had queue's out the door).We just found it all too confusing and stressful and given that we had limited time in London decided not to wait.We were very disappointed that we didn't get chance to see inside."
"November 25, 2014",Like a rugby scrum!,"Took the children to the Tower of London to see the poppies and go inside the Tower to see Crown Jewels etc. Most other parents in the UK must have had the same idea. The ques were worse than Alton Towers, and took forever to get anywhere. We paid a fortune, and were there for less that 1 hour as the ques were so awful. People having panic attacks in the ques to get our of the the Armoury Room.Why let so many in? A huge dissaapointment, as we have been to lots of other historical castles (Windsor, Warwick) and never been like this. OK it was half term, but a rugby scrum to leave the Armoury Room? Come on..."
"November 17, 2014",Where Pictures Speak Louder Than Words,"There's little to add about the Poppies in the Moat, but hopefully these pictures convey the scene.The thousands of poppies should remind us all of the sacrifices of our forefathers who fought not against country or creed but against tyranny in all its forms so that we, the Tripadvisor reviewers of today, can travel freely the way that we do."
"November 15, 2014",Fantastic historical sight but too busy,"We went to the Tower of London on a Sunday during half-term when many people were visiting to see the remembrance poppies. Apparently there had been 30,000 visitors the day before. Luckily we had bought our tickets on line before we left home so we didn't have to stand in the long queues at the ticket office. Nevertheless, there were still queues at the main entrance. We thought about visiting the Crown Jewels but a Beefeater told us that the queues were 1 hour 45r minutes, the longest he had seen in his nine years working there. We waited until later in the day and only queued for 1 hour - it was worth it though - the Jewels are spectacular. We also visited the White Tower which has interesting armoury exhibits, including the suits of armour of a number of English kings. Beware though, that there are lots of steps on narrow spiral staircases. We also walked along part of the ramparts and visited a number of towers along the way. There are some interesting exhibits and good views of Tower Bridge and the Thames. However, there were further queues to get through some of the narrow walkways and staircases. There were also queues to get into the one café in the Tower. We discovered that the queues were caused by people waiting for the coffee machine and that there were no queues to be served food or to pay. There is quite a lot of choice of food, of good quality and reasonably priced. There are plenty of tables which are cleaned regularly. One problem with the Tower is the lack of toilets. There are nowhere near enough for the number of visitors - there were long queues. If you want to visit, arrive either early or late to minimise queuing, and buy tickets in advance (its cheaper and avoids queues)."
"November 14, 2014",Poppies!,"Visited Tower Hill to view the poppies (can be viewed from outside the Tower complex for free). Absolutely stunning and very evocative. Go and see asap, they will only be there until November 11th! (Come out of Tower Hill tube station, turn right and cross road towards the Tower.) "
"November 10, 2014",See the poppies while you can,"The poppies are amazing as a spectacle, fascinating as a work of art, and very moving as a tribute.  it's worth walking along the river side, which is less popular - you're closer to the poppies there."
"November 10, 2014",The poppies are spectacular,"This is a must see.The tribute to the fallen is quite a fantastic display and very moving.After the Armistice Day celebrations, they will disappear... so don't miss them now!"
"November 10, 2014",Poppies,Went to view poppies and visit Tower. Crowded but well worth visit. Information good though wouldn't recommend visiting at present with a buggy as crowds not buggy friendly
"November 10, 2014",Don't lose your head,"Visiting one of London's most iconic tourist attractions you need to be prepared to deal with the crowds and queues, there's no avoiding them.  But the Tower of London is truly impressive and worth every minute.  We took advantage of a 2-1 offer on our family and friends railcard that saved us a lot on our entry fee. First up, do take advantage of the guided Yeoman tours, the red and black clad tour guides are an invaluable source of knowledge on the Tower and tell some macabre yet fascinating stories of the bloody history of the Tower.  The tours are frequent and in 90 minutes will give you sufficient insight so as to be able to prioritise the rest of your visit.  We arrived after lunch and took the advice of our guide waiting until the last hour before closing to see the Crown Jewels, by which time the endless serpentine queue, more reminiscent of a theme park, had largely disappeared.  There is a great deal to see and do visiting the Tower and some fascinating history to absorb, plan your visit, pace yourself (particularly with kids) and look forward to an unforgettable time."
"October 28, 2014",A must do in London,You just really have to do the tower of London and expect to stay half a day to really get your money's worth. We took one of the guided tours and LOVED our guide and learned a ton. The crown jewels are worth the trip alone. My 22 year old nephew was very impressed with it.
"October 28, 2014",A great family day out ... and those poppies!!!,"I visited the Tower of London at the weekend with my two seven year olds, a friend and her three children. We used Tesco Vouchers for our admission so the price was not an issue. We got there fairly early and went to see the Crown Jewels as per advice on here. There was no queue at about 10am but later in the afternoon...oh dear! My friend's son, 10, in particular, was really fascinated by the exhibition. The other children liked meeting the Beefeaters (Yeomans) and hearing the stories of the two princes, the ravens and the gory executions. The White Tower exhibition was fascinating as well and despite visiting on a Saturday in the Summer holidays the place was not packed with no queues for loos etc. At the moment there is, of course, also the art installation in honour of the nearly 900,000 members of the military who died in the first world war in the dry moat of the Tower. This looks impressive on the television but in the flesh it is breath-taking so it's worth a visit for this alone. In total we were probably there for about 5 hours. Enjoy!"
"October 28, 2014",Brilliant free tour by the Beefeaters that live there.,"I love the Tower. One of my favourite sites in London. A whole day's entertainment. Clever ravens, crown jewels, ghosts, scandals, traitors' gate. What is there not to love? Well, maybe the price. It's a little steep, but make sure you wait for the beefeaters when you go in as the tour they give is included in the price and they can give it in different languages, so enquire at the kiosk as you pay."
"October 28, 2014",A walk in history,"This was a most satisfying place to spend a morning. We arrived first thing, and with the London Pass walked right in.  There is a bag check if you have a bag.  We went to the Crown Jewels first, and we could take our time looking at them. There is a conveyor walkway but we could hop on again as there was no crowd at 9am.  There is a no picture rule. Afterwards, we spent time exploring all of the towers, dungeons and grounds.  Everyone that is employed at the Tower should be commended on the fine job they are doing with maintaining and displaying the history of the Tower! One if the most historic places in London, and a must see!!"
"October 27, 2014",Poppies At The Tower,"We just went to see The Poppies. Each one represents a life lost in WW1. Very moving and very beautiful to look at, and free! There are about 100000 there at the moment but by November there will be 860000. We will be back again to see it finished.  Well worth a look at. Gorgeous."
"October 26, 2014",Brilliant place to visit...and wonderful 'Beefeater' tourguide!,"We had visited a few years ago but, with new foster children who had never visited London before, decided to go back. Our tickets we prebooked via another website, and it averaged £10 per person (well worth it). The entry queue was about 15 minutes (we visited end July 2014), but this included the security bag checks. We were immediately caught up in the 'Beefeater' tour on the bridge - the crowd was very large, but the guide was impressive, fun, included lots of stories and projected his voice well. It was a great 'quick run' around the grounds with introduction to the history, before being able to spend a few hours going around at our own pace. The guide even pointed out the best 'route' to take to avoid the longer queues. The majority of the Tower is as you would expect - an ancient building, with lots of rooms, stairs and history. This is not a 'tourist attraction' so other than the guides, don't go if you want to be entertained or led through room by room. The crown jewels were beautiful, and reading there history etc added to the impact - we queued for about 15 minutes to get in (have waited longer for a bus personally, so not bothered), which was mainly due to the numbers being managed, so it wasn't too crowded inside and we were able to spend as much or as little time as we wanted looking at everything. Other areas generally include staged 'rooms' or historic/timeline displays, but our kids thought it was amazing and had loads and loads of questions about kings and queens, who died and when.....The only negative we had on the day was the restaurant in the old armoury - for 2 adults and 3 children to eat a sandwich and a drink cost over £50 so recommend taking your own food/drink, or wait until you are outside the Tower."
"October 26, 2014",Amazing,"My boyfriend and I spent 4 hours here and still didn't want to leave but had to because we had a schedule to keep. There is so much history here that you need more then one day to take it all in. Not to mention the gorgeous grounds and castle. If you like history that delves deep into kings, queens, knights, torture, executions, royalty, jewels, armor, battles, and life of a Londoner through history this place is for you. I would go back in a heartbeat."
"October 24, 2014",One Of The Top Attractions in London,You can learn so much of History when you visit  Tower of London.  Allow sufficient time for the visit. It is recommended that you start early in  the morning when the Crowds are thin. Crown Jewels are the Star Attraction and you visit it first so that your time is saved. The exhibits are well explained and you learn a lot. We spent nearly four hours and you could spend the whole day visiting the Towers as it has much to offer. An enjoyable visit.
"October 23, 2014",A must see,"If you are going to be in London, you must visit the Tower of London.  It is easy to get to (by tube or bus), and you can take a tour given by Beefeaters.  Unfortunately my son did not have much patience and my husband is hard of hearing, so we simply wandered the place on our own and read all the posted information we could.  Do not be discouraged if the line to see the Crown Jewels is about a mile long - that line moved incredibly quickly, and the jewels are definitely something that should be seen!!  The place was beautiful, and the history incredible.  We had a wonderful time there!"
"October 22, 2014",Tower of London,"My limited knowledge of history said ""executions at the Tower of London"". Boy was I lacking in knowledge. The Tower of London is a vast walled property like an estate. There are definitely execution areas including an archway from the Thames into the prison area but there is so much more. Also many steps and circular stairways to maneuver. "
"August 10, 2014",Tower not Terrible..not Tremendous either,"Ok in a nutshell: I totally wanted to be drawn into the long history of the Tower itself here. What I didn't know and got was something more compartmentalized as to broad bits of history of England. Now that's not all bad; but in the way it presents I kind of felt as if it was a tourist destination akin to Epcot center with more unrelated history particles grouped together without any rides. The Tower of London complex is roughly 13 acres with multiple buildings and exhibits throughout. It has the remains of the tower and genuine other period buildings set amongst some grassy park-scapes with the river to one side. It sits slightly lower from certain street levels and entrances and you can occasionally get a glimpse of the modern buildings and London skyline construction as backdrops from within the site. Although they have done a very good job of limiting that issue, you do really do feel you are back in a gothic built castle and time period.Yes, the Crown Jewels are there and that should be your first stop as there always seems to be a Q. We wanted to see them first; so we lined up right about noon and it took us about 25 minutes to get in. Once in; you go through second and third line-management distractions with some video shows and historical tidbits up until you actually get to the jewels. Absolutely gorgeous and amazing! But what doesn't do justice is the people mover conveyer belts that go past them. One can understand the need to move people along, security, the safety of the jewels.... But gliding; albeit slowly past the jewels on belts makes you feel quite mechanical and processed in the matter. Especially after waiting up to 50 plus minutes to get to see them.But then you always get to say, as we wanted, ""I saw the Crown Jewels"".There are other displays and exhibits set up through out the compound, all dealing with either historical aspects of the Tower center itself, or England's growth and expansion. We found the English small coin ""minting "" exhibit and museum  quite nice although almost hidden in a tiny building once into the main entrance.There are a lot of steps up and down and the majority of the compound is very and I mean very rough bricked cobbles and often uneven surfaces. It is also on a hill, so those with bad knees and walking issues you will have quite a rough go of it. They do have accessibility guides and wheel chair rentals. But with the exception of the main ""square "" and access to the Crown Jewels most of the rest of the complex, Exhibits, and entry points are extremely difficult to navigate and access at all. If it's not narrow steep staircases (towers as you would expect) it's tiny doorways, stairs and wood stair cases everywhere, and cobblestones with gaps, that would jar anyone in a push chair or wheelchair right out if it.  Both wheelchairs and strollers bounce terribly. Do be careful!Visitor facilities are abundant, benches in the outdoor complex more like the ""square"" amongst the main buildings were plentiful; and peaceful, grassy, tree-d areas always a step or few away for a nice park feel. You can watch the Tower ravens picking through the grass. The occasional cart for ice cream or treats could always be found on the next turn (tres ""Disney-esq"" again) although with Beefeaters ( do take a tour with them) and proper English actors entertaining the visitors you knew you were in London no questions.Lastly, the moat or what was the moat is currently splayed with hundreds of ceramic red roses which look amazing. A tribute to all the servicemen in the UK, it is quite stunning and blankets a large area of the moat region on all sides of the outer wall of the complex. Looking down from the streets above it looks like fields and fields of real red flowers, almost a ""wizard of oz"" or Monet poppy field visage, and is quite impressive. Think that is there till Nov of 2014Overall this seems a fair place to visit (I'd make it 1/2day or less as the kids will get restless) and the Crown Jewels are the stellar attraction. The complex is also right on the riverside with City Cruises right next to it, so if you do the Big Bus tour or similar you usually get a Free cruise with them, and it's an added perk to walk through the gift shop upon leaving the Tower complex and hop on a free cruise back to center if town and Westminster pier.I appreciate the history of the Tower but found it and the compound more broken up than I expected as far as a linear history lesson, with too much of too many little things covered. So for that fact plus the big inaccessibility issues I could only give it a fair rating."
"August 8, 2014","Disappointed,nothing great about this - Skip","This is my first review on TA. I have to admit I visited this purely based on TA reviews and ratings. I left the tower feeling I have missed something / seriously disappointed. There is no guidance from staff or anyone there. It was raining and was told there is no guided tour because of rain. The place is big with several towers. There are long queues everywhere and the amount of time you spend on queue to enter a tower is more than the time you spend inside it. I spent 40 mins in queue for ""Torture tower"" and its basically one small room with 2 weapons - 5 mins inside. The ""crown jewels"" is over hyped and prepare for 1 hour queue on outside - and when you enter - its exhibits of jewels and crowns - there is nothing jaw dropping - you can pretty much imagine how these would look like - its OK on the whole. The next tower is ""white tower"" which is basically exhibits of armors, weapons etc. There are couple of cool things like faces of kings, a dragon and a lion - but that's about it. There is not much of an ""experience"" more of seeing exhibits.I did not have beefeaters tour - Infact I was lost as there is no guidance on what to do and what is provided as part of attraction. I spent on whole about 4 hours (door to door) and 25 pounds on just this attraction and left feeling disappointed and that missing feeling. There could be more in there, but there is not much guidance to explore it the best possible way.Bottomline - Avoid it to save your time and money."
"August 6, 2014",Poppies,Went to see the remembrance poppies. Outstanding! Well worth a visit. It is a fabulous sight.  You don't have to go into the attraction to view the poppies.
"August 6, 2014","Just want to see poppies, its free","The poppies exhibition is completely visible without entering the tower, so if you want to see this amazing display, and I recommend you do before it goes 11th November then it wont cost you anything. You can see the  888,246 poppies project one for every life lost in 1914 war as a work in progress as the volunteers carry out this great project.If entering the tower itself you can save by booking on line but be aware that the receipt states to present this to group bookings, a little kiosk alongside the other pay on the day kiosk which does open until 09:50, 10 mins before opening and large queues already forming. The staff are efficient though and work the queues checking everyone in the right place. My family ticket enabled me to take my receipt direct to the group entrance by traitors gate without exchanging for a ticket and was a fast track route.I recommend heading straight for the crown jewels display on arrival. We did this and was able to walk straight the the main display of crowns without queue. 15 minutes later the queue was already out on the courtyard and after 30 mins passed open time the metal zig zag barriers were full."
"August 6, 2014",Excellent but overcrowded.,"We went because I really wanted to see the poppy installation in the moat - and I'd never been! Admittedly it's the end of the summer holidays and you could expect crowds but wow. After we'd queued to get in and been told that we should have collected our audio guides way back at the beginning, and my husband ran back to get them and had to queue all over again, it was a slow start. Of course it is an incredible place with amazing collections of weaponry and iconic relics of history but we had to do a slow shuffle through the White Tower and struggle to see some exhibits and when we finally got out and headed for the Crown Jewels, the queue was insane. It filled up the roped off area and just wound around the grounds. It was also hardly moving, so after 30 minutes we decided to call it a day. However we will go again sometime and the poppy installation is exceptionally beautiful and very moving. A truly lovely idea and worth going to see in person. But for the Tower itself you should get in there early or its a struggle to see anything at all. "
"August 4, 2014",Roll of Honour at The Tower,Visited the Roll of Honour at The Tower last night.  Beautifully simple but powerfully moving sunset ceremony.  Another opportunity to reflect on the lives lost during WW1.  Highly recommended.
"July 28, 2014",A piece of history in the centre of London,"Tip - Book tickets on line to secure the best deal and avoid long ticket queues, However beware at peak times bag searches at the entrance slow admission lines down.The Tower of London is a must see attraction. There are lots of stairs, so wear comfortable shoes, but necessary if you want to see everything during your visit. Visitors can buy an audio tour, follow the beefeater guides or follow their own route. There are excellent videos and information boards to complement the guide books and tour guides. TIP - The jewel room is one of the most popular attractions and queues can take 40 minutes plus at busy times. Make this one of the first things you see to avoid peak times. There is very little shade in the queue so on hot days grab a drink or ice cream!History is explained in a fun and interesting way and the Beefeaters are always on hand to provide interesting stories or assistance. No one should visit London without a day at the Tower.Restaurant and food outlets very good but expensive, there are lots of food shops within walking distance of the Tower. Take a picnic or buy when you leave. "
"July 22, 2014",A must when visiting London,"Nearly a thousand years of British and French history housed within one of  London's most iconic buildings. Get there early, see the Crown Jewels then take a guided tour from one of the Yeoman Wardens. Amazing and interesting place. Once finished take a river taxi to Westminster to continue the sight seeing."
"July 17, 2014","C'mon, It's the Tower of London -  You Have to Visit at Least ONCE","This review includes basic information, practical tips if touring with children, and observations - read on.If you are visiting London, then you really must visit the Tower of London.  It's a must see.  It is a huge piece of English history that if you really pay attention, you will learn much more than you ever thought possible.  The architecture is amazing and the thought of how long the structure has been in existence is memorizing.  There are many places to explore, things to read, things to look at, and in the white tower there are so many things to see and do with hands on exploring.  The jewels are a must see at least once for what they are.  If you are able hook up with one of the guides to really get the detailed tour information.Here are the things you should know.  It is crowded, especially if you visit in the summer.  It is a sea of people all trying to look at the same things as you.  Go as early as possible in the day to avoid the crowds OR go late in the day after all of the people who went early are worn out and have left.Estimate at least a couple of hours to see the main things - if you are a reader or want to follow the tour guides, plan to be there longer.It is expensive.  You can look online for vouchers or we purchased a discount ticket in conjunction with our Hop On Hop Off bus pass - shop around to save yourself some money.  They will nickel and dime you everywhere.  If you want to listen to the audio tour, there is a fee - while it doesn't seem to be all that much, when you multiple that times 4 for our family it was expensive on top of the admission price.  Food is more expensive inside than outside and outside there are tons of little restaurants, including an EAT. You can take food in and have a picnic if you can find a spot - again, wall to wall people.There are a lot of steps in the White Tower and in the summer, it can get quite hot.  So, have some patience and a bottle of water.  There are seats throughout the tower that you can have a quick sit down when you need to.If you are touring with children....expect to move a lot quicker through some of the exhibits.  We had visited the Tower before as a couple and were able to take in much of the history then, because when touring with children, we move at a faster speed and they want to read and see things that we might not have thought were very exciting.  They enjoyed the exhibits in the White Tower and they enjoyed the hands on activities.  Our younger son enjoyed things more than the older one, but they both enjoyed what they could see and do.They had both wanted to see the Crown Jewels, but the line wrapped all around the courtyard and they quickly changed their mind that it wasn't that important.  As an adult - we would have probably waited in line.  One tip is to walk in and go straight to the back of the tower and do the whole tour backwards - the crowds tend to work from the front back and then front again.It's worth seeing, plan on spending several hours there, plan to be tired afterwards, especially if it is a hot summer day.  Plan to do something afterwards where you can sit down for a bit - like the Hop on Hop off bus!"
"July 14, 2014",Tower Fantastic - Yeoman Warder Mark outstanding!,A first time visit for us & our 9 & 5 year old children. Blown away by the place. The significance of the history really hits you. Mark Anderson was our Yeoman Warder tour guide and he is just outstanding. Comic timing & repartee brilliant from start to finish. Hussar! 
"September 2, 2014",A cold day at the Tower,"Visited London the first week of April, 2013, tthe coldest Easter season in 100 years. So we bundled up and took off. The Tower of London is not to be missed. Took the great advice from others in this forum, went early  and headed straight for the Jewels, while everyone else was waiting for a Yeoman Tour. Even on this cold day there were a good bit of people. Got in without a  wait viewed the Jewels at leasure then went back to catch the tour. The tour is free and fantastic !  Expect to spend 2 and a half to three hours. BY the way, there always seems to be a long line at the tourture display. Like everyone else we joined in. After the longest wait of the Tower we viewed a rack. This would be the only thing I would skip. You can always look up a picture of this torture device on line. In Short, The Tower is the must see for a first timer."
"September 1, 2014",MUST SEE IN LONDON!!  Do the tour with the Beefeater,"It's a little overwhelming.  You buy a ticket and people try to sell you a tour book or an audio guide.  They barely mention that real beefeaters offer tours that are included in your ticket.The tour is a MUST!  You will truly miss out of you don't take it.  It lasts 1 hour.  The coolest part?  A Beefeater must have at least 22 years of military experience, still be active military, take a written and oral exam and then show military skills before being hired.  Only 37 Beefeaters in England and they are considered the Queen's personal body guards.  They LIVE in the tower and guard it every day.  So, one of the Queen's personal body guards is your guide.Definitely give yourself at least 3-4 hours to see everything.  While the line to the Crown Jewels may seem ridiculous you should know that it takes about 25-30 minutes if it is filled all the way through the ropes.  Not too bad if you are into a lot of gold and diamonds."
"August 26, 2014",Wow!  It's fun being a tourist!,"We were completely blown away by this place.  Expected to be there for an hour, hour and a half - we were there for FOUR AND A HALF HOURS!  The most amazing place ever,  We hired headsets, which I would highly recommend, which made the whole thing so much fun.  The players who walk around and play out scenarios were brilliant and very atmospheric.  I would very much like to go again to relive things and to see what I'm sure I must have missed,"
"August 25, 2014",Headless body found in topless castle.,If you have time for only one attraction in London this is the one.The tour is included with your admission and begin every half hour on the hour under the main entrance archway. The tour guides are the famous beefeaters ( yeoman warders ) who mix history and humor in entertaining fashion and leave you wanting for more when they depart. Once the tours are over you have all day to explore the Crown Jewels and the many towers which populate the grounds.A must see in the bloody tower is the medevil torture device called the spluge of the joo.
"August 24, 2014",Walk the Roman Wall around Roman London,"Start at the Tower of London, and follow the route of the Roman Wall back to the River Thames near St Paul's Cathedral.Try going to the Museum of London, 150 London Wall, London EC2Y 5HN and visiting the Roman exhibition. Use this as a starting point to walk the Roman Wall, parts of which still remain in buildings, much of it uncovered due to Blitz damage in World War 2. The Wall extends from the Tower of London, around to St Paul's Cathedral. In the 1980s the Museum of London put up a series of information panels on the route of the walk but these have mostly been vandalised so you will need to do a little research in order to find the route. A good place to start is at the Museum of London, which is halfway around the Roman Wall route.There are some serious treasures on the route, not least of which is the Roman Colisseum in the basements of London Guildhall - amazing exhibition! However, for me, walking the Wall gave me a much greater understanding of how London developed - almost all of what we would now know as the City of London was within the Wall, and helps one to realise what a compact and small place London really is (or was)!!"
"August 21, 2014",Really pretty poor day out,"I took my family to the tower of London yesterday and had pretty high expectations of the day out. I had got the 2 for one tickets which still rather confusingly worked out at £46 for the four of us even though the family ticket was £56. I was expecting queues in the place given how popular the place was and they were substantial although actually moved relatively quickly. We went straight for the Crown Jewels tower first as that had the largest queue and it would hopefully be easier after that for other towers to visit.Once we made it into the actual tower with the Crown Jewels it’s a conga line event through largely empty rooms with only the barest nod towards any information or context of where you are. Getting into the actual room you are then on a moving pavement that takes you past the main case with the jewels in it. I would say that they are beautiful and well light but you get all of about 60 seconds before you are at the other end. There is a moving pavement on the other side but the place is seriously packed and you are competing with the hordes that are streaming in to get a second glance at them. Once past the main cases there are several other smaller exhibition cases with other artefacts in them including a beautiful punch bowl that you could almost swim in, but again there are so many people it’s hard to actually spend anymore than a minute at the cases before you’re swamped with people pushing in wanting to see. After leaving the Crown Jewels we went to the tower that had the torture exhibits in it. Again there was a queue but this was relatively small and we got in to the room in about 10 minutes. Once inside there were only two actual things to look at and one of them was a replica. We spent all of about 30 seconds in the room before going back out.Once we left this exhibit we decide to leave the Tower and go for something to eat. I asked my sons, aged 11 and 14, what they thought of it and they both said it was pretty boring which I have to say I agreed with.Overall my impression of the place is it is set up more for crowd control rather than actually showing off the exhibits or providing an entertaining and value for money day out. The torture museum was spectacularly bad considering both the history and also the amount of these types of artefacts that are still in existence. Given that the Tower of London has got to be one of the major tourist attractions in the whole of the UK I was astonished a just how bad the place was and how it was set up."
"August 17, 2014",Not really worth £20.90 to get in ... spend your hard earned quid elsewhere,"The only attraction that sparked the slightest interest for me were the crown jewels. I was absolutely captivated by the sparkles that I kept leaning forward to get a closer look since I'm blind as a bat ... only to knock my head against a very clear & Windex clean glass window. My girl friend was wondering what the heck I was doing leaning so close until she heard a loud clink sound. Lucky no one else heard or saw & we pissed ourselves laughing. THAT was the highlight of this attraction. And that's all.The torture tower was a snoozefest & I thought whatever big rolling pins they had to stretch & rip apart limbs was like a sun bake in the beach. For the ultimate torture equipment, the Germans & Hungarians know their shiet. Go visit Bran Castle, not only is it more historically interesting & hauntingly beautiful, but its conveniently located in Romania so you can explore the rest of this fascinating country! I like London for its food, shopping & architecture, but most of the main attractions ... dear god! Not worth your $$ nor time. (Unless you are big on English history). Overall, I spent £20 to headbutt the crown jewels. Hmmm ... impressive. Next! "
"August 16, 2014",A fast conveyor belt,"I was so looking forward to my visit here as the last time I went I was about 9 years old.  The grounds and the actual building are amazing when you look at the detail and relate it to its age.  So, we approached the room with the crown jewels only to be told to stand on the conveyor belt so we could be whizzed through as there was so many people.  I hardly had a chance to see them :(  Guess I will just have to keep my memories of when I was a child."
"August 15, 2014",Sadly disappointing and carelessly set out,"After happily paying the extortionate entry fee, I was incredibly excited to finally visit the tower of London. As a self-taught history buff, the tower has always topped my list of visits and after visiting as many castles in the UK as my free time would allow, it was finally time to visit the king of historical sites. To say I was disappointed with the experience would be an understatement. The outside is certainly imposing and broods with promise. However, once you get past the hideously modern entry gates, you discover that the history of the castle has been stripped away or locked away and all that remains are bare walls unadorned with information, exhibits or even tapestries! The guide book contains some information which may help the visitor to apply history to the bare buildings but is of course impossible to read while trying to navigate the crowds and towers. The main attraction for me was the history, the buildings and the church. The church was closed to visitors and the buildings were stripped bare and consequently interchangeable. We came across the tower where the Duke of Clarence was drowned in his barrell of wine entirely by accident, hidden under some scaffolding. The crown jewels seem to be the main attraction and although mildly interesting, are only seen briefly after huge queues. It felt as if the tower was more interested in getting your money than educating or entertaining its visitors.Whoever curates this historical site is at best struggling with huge expectation and few resources. They should try paying the visitor fee and viewing the site as a history enthusiast and they might review its presentation."
"August 14, 2014",To many steps,Not disabled friendly to few ramps and cafe closes to early no order in crown jewels display people pushing every way spoiled it for us
"May 18, 2013",Beware of the voluntary donation,"I am sure others have stated this here before. I admit I did not check the reviews prior to visiting this attraction. After all it's the ""Tower of London"". it was more a MUST do than a WANT to do on my list.I was positivley surprised, by the effort they put in and the tour they offered was worth the hefty entrance fee.But beware the entrance fee they charge per default includes a ""voluntary donation"" if you do not wish to donate you have to ask explicitley for a ticket without donation. Which I did, because I am the persone who voluntary donates, just not if forced to do so!To be fare it wasn't a problem at all. I just had to reveal myself as a non caring person who does not which to support a cause that's not clearly stated. Because all they say is that it is a donation not whatever for it is used.They'll give you a big thank you on your ticket though. My friend got one. She wasn't to happy, because she didn't realize she actually volunteered."
"April 24, 2013",Day Visit to Tower of London,"Day trip on the 14th February 2013. On arrival at the entrance i asked where I could get tickets. A pair of guides said ""Up the hill"". Then they continued their own conversation. Most of the guides had a similar attitude. The crown jewels and the Royal Armouries displays have been reduced in size significantly, since my last visit. Very dissappointing. Not much to see around the site. A few cannons dotted here and there. The guide, a Yoeman, gave loads of statistics and if you interupted his speil, which was obviously a standard patter, he got annoyed.£45 for Two seniors and one child. Certainly NOT value for money. A very dissappointing visit.The ticket price also gave a ""Donation"". to what? i never found out. And certainly no option to opt out. Dont bother going"
"April 12, 2013","More than just jewels, a thousand years of English history in one place","Went with my seven-year-old, and we both had a fantastic time seeing how the history of England progressed, with the Tower playing an integral role in so many events. Whether you are a first time visitor to London or have lived here all your life, everyone should see this at least once. Worth every penny. My tip - take a Thames river cruise from Westminster Pier and arrive by boat, just like the many people in history who arrived that way, never to leave..."
"April 4, 2013","Wonderful day out - allow time, pre-purchase to save queueing","Had originally arrived at the Tower at 14:40 (having spent more time than planned at the wonderful HMS Belfast) and contemplated a quick 2/3 hour tour, but wasn't convinced if that was a good idea. We spoke to the cashier who rightly advised us to come back the next morning, and also recommended we pre-booked on the internet, as that allows you to collect your tickets at the Group bookings cashdesks, which have considerably smaller / no queues. Great tip if you're limited for time and want to avoid the long buy-on-the-day queues.The Tower tour was great. We didn't follow the 'guides' as the crowd around them were enormous. Instead we took a couple of audio guides and a map. Yes, the masses of visitors is hard to handle at first, but providing you're patient you get used to it.   I recommend you visit all of the different areas of the Towers as they all have a different story to tell. In the end we spent around 6 hours there, taking our time and letting our girls see everything they wanted to. "
"December 23, 2012",great to visit,it's about 30 years since I last went and it's transformed for the good in every respect - you could spend a day there - i was there for half a day with my 15yr old son - very well done indeed
"December 21, 2012",Go early!,"We got there when it opened and had a great time. Very few people -- though it was filling up by the time we left. Go straight for the crown jewels (those fill up first) and then wander. Tours by the beefeaters are well done (you need to be on one to see the chapel) and you can join in progress. Armor exhibit didn't have a lot of helpful guidance, but the boys in the group were entranced. Highly recommend doing a Thames cruise afterward...and the restaurant at the tower is terrific (was surprised -- !)"
"December 17, 2012",Too expensive and overrated.,"We went as a family but we were disappointed with the Tower of London. Mainly the high price leaves you with a sense of being cheated as you only see a tiny amount of it. £20 each to see the Crown Jewels! Other than the exterior of the tower, it lacks any soul and is very boring. Crown Jewels OK but you go round on a conveyer. The sheer volume of people going in means endless queuing. Way too expensive even if entertaining and interesting at times. Embarrassing.Also pet peeve: CLEAN THOSE TOILETS PLEASE!!!!"
"October 31, 2012",waited years for this brilliance,"id waited to see the tower of london since i was a kid and i wasnt dissapointed, hopped off the tube and walked down to the riverbank to take in tower bridge and the thames before wandering over to by my tickets... everything about it was so so cool, loved every minute"
"October 20, 2012",Wonderful Place to Visit,"You can honestly spend all day at the Tower of London.  However, we only had a few hours.  We were lucky to get go on a tour with Stephen (who was so great).  If you have time, go on one of the tours hosted by the Beefeater, you will get much more out of your visit.The crown jewls are amazing, and the grounds and history of the place are incredible.  There is a lot to see and do hear.  I would have loved to have more time.  This attractions was well worth the cost."
"September 26, 2012",British history at its finest!,"Been here several times…enjoy it each time.  This historic castle, perched on the north bank of the Thames holds within its walls a wealth of British history. Founded in 1055, the White Tower (hence the name, “Tower of London”) was built by William the Conqueror.Don’t miss the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula (where Anne Boleyn is buried); Traitor’s gate, the White Tower, and, of course,  the crown jewels.The Beefeaters are a wealth of information and, bonus, very entertaining!Your admission ticket (£20.90) includes access to the tower, a tour by Yeoman Warder, tour of white tower, crown jewels, and several other things that escape my mind at the moment.Tips: You can avoid queues and purchase your tickets online at:http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/admissionsprices/toweroflondonadmission"
"August 21, 2012",Dont take a buggy!!!!,"Love it, lots of culture and history relating to the city I call home.  Absolutely fascinating but prepare for some queues into some of the exhibits - the worst thing we done was to take a baby (it was a last minute decision to go in) as she slept and we struggled - they did not think about buggy designs of the future when they were building all those little towers and winding staircases eh!"
"March 26, 2013",Finally ...,"After years of watching programmes and reading about it I finally got to visit it. Spent over 6 hours wandering round, visiting the different towers reading the history. Was impressed by the crown jewels collection. I can't wait to go back again.A must do with plenty and allow plenty of time."
"March 19, 2013",Crown Jewels & Yeoman Warder Tour - excellent!,"The Tower is much more hands on than back in the Dark Ages when I was a kid - the Crown Jewels display is very informative as well as spectacular & the Yeoman Warder tour is even better than I remembered.  There were actors playing scenes from the Tower's history which was great (we saw Monmouth & co) & really brought history to life.Didn't see everything but can recommend the Fusiliers museum where you can (try &) pick up a full backpack of the kind soldier carry out in Afghanistan, try on different headgear & learn of their regimental history; & the White Tower with a fantastic display of armour & weapons.  Saw the Bloody Tower too, good but not as good as the rest...Advice: get there early & go straight to the Crown Jewels (if you want to see them) - there was hardly anyone today, THEN go on the Yeoman Warder tour, then wander around by yourselves."
"February 15, 2013",Midieval times that comes alive..,"There is halal food just outside the Tower of London. It sells fish and chips, hotdog etc. The place is also nice. The beefeaters are doing a wonderful job in introducing the different places. There are the same number of ppl (befeaters) staying in the tower as there was few hundred yrs ago."
"January 13, 2013","worth spending the time, especially the jewels","Firstly, it was really tiring to walk around the entire tower of london, especially all the stairs so be prepared to get a pair of comfy shoes. The exhibition in the tower changes over the time. I tried to walk around with the audio tour instead of the guided tour becoz it was way too many people surrounding him and i could not hear a thing. I think the guided tour would be a better experience. Most of the part are interesting to look at, however I would expect a better restoration in some of the rooms. The Jewels is a must see."
"January 12, 2013",Tower Hamlets resident tip,"A great tourist destination but for those who are Tower Hamlets residents, take your council tax bill along with your Idea Store card and get entrance for just one pound. That's a brilliant discount and means you can return time after time."
"January 5, 2013",Fascinating Historical Site,"easily could have spent a couple of hours wandering around this place. So much to explore and learn. Loved every minute, and would recommend not to miss this impressive site.*use the leaflet from the tube stations to get two for one"
"August 20, 2012",Must do in London,This is something that you want to do in London. If you've got 2 to 3 hours you can pretty much see the lot. Best thing is to start off doing the free tours by the Yeoman. That takes about an hour and then you can see the rest of the stuff yourself.A couple of tips:1. If you can book online then do so. The lines to the ticket booth are not that long but you will easily spend 30 minutes or more waiting. The ticketing process is ridiculously slow - about 5 minutes per person. It seems that their computer software and printer have issues and it takes that long for them to issue a ticket. Just really hopeless.2. Get the tube train to Tower Hill. It's an easy entry from there. Don't try to get there from the London Bridge station that's not the best option.
"August 18, 2012",You need time to do this place justice,"There is tons to explore at the Tower of London, and enough stuff to keep boys and girls entertained.  My daughter, true to form loved the jewels and horses.  My son loved the weapons and the armor.  They both loved exploring what was once the royal animal menagerie.We had lunch at the New Armory Café, and it was terrific.I would have preferred for the audio tour to be part of the entrance fee!"
"July 23, 2012",Don't be too early,"I love the Tower and have visited it multiple times.  On this last visit though I learnt something useful for future visits.  Don't be too early.  the bonus is that there aren't queues to get in early, but the very very big downside is that the first Beefeater tour of the day is too large for you to hear your Beefeater if you're at the back of the queue.  Later in the day there seem to be less folk waiting for tours to start."
"June 27, 2012",A great family day out. Steeped in history.,"We just fancied seeing the Crown Jewels. We knew the rest of it and thought it would be just another castle to stroll around. How wrong we were. We took advice from earlier reviewers. We arrived at the gates at 9am. The queue was about 50 deep ahead of us. We did as was suggested and made a beeline for the Crown Jewels. It was great to zip straight in - no queues - saunter about, study stuff, see it then go back and see it again. All without the clutter of other people crowding you out. The room where The Queen's Crown is has a moving floor on both sides. This would be to keep the hoardes moving when it gets busy. Which as we found out was just as we exited the building. The next piece of advice we were given by the same reviewer was to take the Beefeater's Walking Tour at 10am. This would allow us access to St Peter's Chapel which you would otherwise not be allowed into. Our Beefeater was Mitch Jones a cunning Welsh linguist who made the tour incredibly humourous and knowledgeable and interesting and he was playing to old folk and kids alike. There is no extra to pay for the tour but you will be asked to donate alms inside the Chapel so take some coins. After this we were free to roam about as we wished. By the time we finished our tour the queue for the Crown Jewels was now hours long and looked incredibly uncomfortable. Thank you to the person who took the trouble to give that initial advice which we took.My advice to you would be to take a portable picnic and carry water bottles enough for you. The prices are high being a tourist venue and London. We ate in the café and a meal of soup for me, cod n chips for the kids and a sandwich for the wife came to around £30.00 The food was really nice and very filling, (even the soup). But if you came on a budget my advice would be to bring a picnic. A bottle of water (very small) is £1.60. You will find plenty of benches dotted around to sit on.The White Tower houses an amazing museum of historical armour and weapons. It is my final ""must see"" at the Tower of London. We got there by tube train. We were there from 9am to 3:30pm and paid £58.89 for our family of 2 adults and 2 kids below 10yrs old - this included the guide book which we only had time to read when we were out and back at the hotel. I can heartily recommend this as a """"Must See"" part of your visit to London."
"June 18, 2012",Favorite,6 and 9 year old and wife and I loved it.  Make to get there by tube then get tix at the shop by the tube stop.  Get there when it opens and go straight to the Crown Jewels which can be seen in twenty minutes.  If you get there later you will wait in line with a few hundred of your closest friends.  Then go back to the entrance near the moat to get a free beefeater tour- we had a marine fellow who was great.  That great tour takes an hour.  See if you can catch the changing of the guard who march right through the crowd- awesome close up opportunity.  Then white tower for 45 mins.  Then wander randomly to some of the side rooms.  Brilliant time.
"June 9, 2012",Love love love it!!!!!,"I don't know how you could say anything negative about this incredible historic venue. The Beefmaster's tour was fascinating and set the stage for the remainder of the visit.  The Crown Jewels had a long line but it really moved quickly. Unlike other museums, this one can be enjoyed even with crowds.  The history is incredible, the grounds were immaculate, the gift shops were lovely. I wish I had more time to spend here. Teenagers and hubby enjoyed it just as much as I did."
"June 9, 2012",Busy Venue,"Fabulous Venue but too may stairs in the White Tower , Queue for the crown jewels was around 30 mins long, Good beefeaters very knowledgeable. 1 Lemonade & 1 Bottle of Pepsi £4.30 bit steep as the lemonade was only a small cup not a bottle or can  "
"June 9, 2012",The Crown Jewels and the Yeoman Tour,"Buy your tickets online, go to the desk to pick them up about 20 minutes before they open.  When the gates open, go straight to the Crown Jewels before the crowds, then go back to the entry to catch the next Yeoman tour.  The Yeoman tour was very entertaining and one of the highlights for our trip to London."
"June 3, 2012",Take the yeoman's (Beefeaters) tour when you go,"I saw the Tower of London back in the 60's so I was happy to do it a little differently this time.  We did the yeoman's tour first and our yeoman (Mitch) was very informative and the tour was a lot of fun.  It gives you a more personal insight into the Tower(s).  Oh, and here's a tip - the answer is 20.  Trust me.  Afterwards we quickly toured the white tower.  I say quickly because we weren't interested in spending a lot of time looking at medieval hardware, etc.  We then toured the tower where Sir Walter Raleigh had stayed (the Bloody Tower I think?) which was of interest since I'm from Raleigh.  If you go up the stairs then be warned that they are very steep and narrow.  We did not look at the crown jewels.  The line was over an hour long and I'd seen them before.  Note:  We bought our tickets at the Traders Post store, which Rick Steves said can be faster when there are lines.  We got a senior discount as well."
"June 1, 2012",DO NOT miss this!,"The Tower of London is an amazing place, even in the pouring rain! We purchased the London Pass which would have allowed us to skip the queue but we were there right at opening (9:00am) so we went right in.I would highly recommend going early and heading straight for the Crown Jewels in the Jewel House. We went directly in and were able to spend a good amount of time admiring the jewels ad reading about them. By the time we were finished, the lines to get in was incredible!We took a Beefeater Yeoman tour (free) and he was so good at giving out information and was a stitch to listen to. The tour ends in the Royal Chapel next to the execution site where Anne Boleyn and others lost their heads. The history of this site is truly amazing.The White Tower with it’s armor and weapons display was incredible. The Bloody Tower which contains the executioner’s block and ax and other means of torture. Sir Walter Raleigh’s apartment was there and the staircase where the Boy Princes remains were found. Sounds gory but that is what history is about."
"May 10, 2012",Fun Day out!,"My boyfriend and I visited for the first time as adults in May 2013.  We did feel a little guilty about going to a castle without the kids, but it was nice to take our time and read things rather than being rushed along to get to the ice creams at the end!There was a long queue for the Crown Jewels, but it was worth it.  It was good having the guide too, as we read a few interesting facts in there! Overall, it was a great day out and we are looking forward to going again with the kids when they are all a bit older and will be properly interested in history!"
"May 6, 2012",Incredible,"If you appreciate history, this is a must see. Off all my travels, this was one of the most incredible sites I have seen. Just fabulous. The Yeoman tour is very historical (and accurate). The crown jewels are stunning. And any Tudor fan will appreciate standing in the very spot that Anne Boleyn was killed. This is a must see."
"April 27, 2012","Not the ""Tower"" expected!","The Tower of London, founded by William the Conqueror in 1066, is situated on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. It is one of the world's most famous fortresses with over 900 years history and has served as a royal palace, treasury, the home of the Royal Mint, public records office, prison, armoury and even a zoo. In 1988, it was declared an UNESCO World Heritage site.Some of the highlights of the Tower are: i) Yeoman Warder (popularly known as Beefeaters, tasked with the job of guarding the Crown Jewels as well as showing visitors some of the attractions highlights) guided tour, available every 30 minutes from 10am on Tuesday to Saturday and 10:30am on Monday and Sunday; the Crown Jewels; ii) the White Tower (a massive stone building in white colour in the middle of the sight) which houses displays from the Royal Armouries' collection; iii) the famous ravens next to the White Tower; iv) the Medieval Palace.  I visited the Tower with my brother on Sunday and the line was fine early in the morning. We were in within half an hour after security check (conducted manually). Since the guided tour started much later, we took the free visitor's guide (available in various languages) and explored the Tower based on the guide (just follow the numbers labelled on the guide will do) instead. We spent approximately two hours exploring the whole complex and were a bit disappointed because it is not as impressive as we expected. Important information:i) It is open daily from 9am (Monday and Sunday from 10am) to 4:30pm (1/11 to 29/2) and 5:30pm (1/3 to 31/10);ii) Closed on January 1 and December 24 to 26; iii) Admission fee is applicable for on-the-spot purchase at £20.90 (Adult) and £10.45 (children >5 and <16) and online purchase at £18 (Adult) and £9 (children >5 and <16);iv) Ticket includes access to everywhere within the Tower (even the Yeoman Warder guided tour) except the prohibited area and the hire of an audioguide;v) I visited the Tower with my London Pass, a pass which promised free and fast track entry to avoid long lines. Free entry, yes. Fast track? Yes and no. Yes, because i skip the line to buy admission ticket (the ticket booths are app. 300 to 500m away from the entrance). No, because all the London Pass owners were asked to queue along with the rest for entry on the day i visited. Eventually, I was glad that i bought a London Pass instead of spending £18-20.90 just to visit it. At least i was allowed to visit more places with my London Pass instead of spending that amount of money for just a single entry. vi) Leave your luggage bag with your hotel or find a place to store it because it is really difficult to explore the Tower with your bag."
"August 8, 2013",Interesting but Crowded,"My wife is a History buff, so we had to see the Tower of London when we visited London.Book through Tesco vouchers if you can and entrance is free, otherwise it is £50-00 for a family. You have to queue regardless of how you pay.The location is fantastic. Right next to Tower Bridge and the Millenium Pier when arriving by river. Some brilliant photo opportunities of Tower Bridge and the TOL itself once inside.There is a queue for the Jewel House, which houses the Crown Jewels, but you must see this. The White Tower does not have much of interest inside, but the other areas are of general interest. Sadly, as with other London attractions, too many people are let in at the same time, and as a result, it is hard to see what you want to (children have no chance) without someone (usually German) being in your way. Also, do not say sorry to anyone if they bump into you/them as most are ignorant, with the exception of the English, Scottish and Americans, who are genuinely courteous and polite. I said sorry 10 times and then gave up when hardly anyone acknowledged my good manners.Overall, well worth visiting, although now I have seen everything, I will not be back."
"August 6, 2013",Tower of Tedium - The Yeoman were the highlight,"Visited on the last Saturday in March 2012 when it was baking hot and crowds were high. We tagged on to a Yeoman's tour which was good fun, but the pace was too fast and the group way too large with those at the back struggling to hear what was being said.There were three other main parts to the Tower: (i) Armoury - this was of reasonable interest, but one shiny piece of metal soon looked like any other (bar Henry VIII's fat-armour and it's ""interesting"" protection for his personal crown jewels); (ii) The Crown Jewels - ho-hum, to be honest. Yes they are stunning, but there is so little in the way of back-story that again, once you have seen 1 crown, you have seen them all; and (iii) Torture Section - this is like an add-on and is quite dull. A shame really, as I am a self-confessed fan of medieval gore!Must try harder, Tower (except for Steve the Yeoman who was fab)!Expensive at £19 for an adult - probably worth about £8-9 in my opinion."
"August 4, 2013",Absolute rip off and waste of money !,"As a keen historian, I was desperately disappointed with what was on offer. It wasn't even worth a fiver let alone the £19.80 we paid on the 2 4 1 offer. From the shortened beefeater talk, the restricted areas because of tree felling ( to provide clear views of the White Tower in the overhead camera shots for the Olympics I shouldn't wonder) to the dingy backstreet flyblown jewellers presentation of the Crown Jewels. It had all the air of a third rate run down end of the pier seaside attraction. The Arms and armpour exhibition in the White tower was boring with a capital B. The only imaginative display was a sculptured  dragon made out of armour and weapons.Save your money , catch the train and go to Dover Castle instead to see what can be done with a bit of  enthusiasm and imagination."
"July 2, 2013",Don't believe anyone who gives it less than a 5.,"Been here many times over the years.  Never get tired of it.  You can come a number of times and see soemthing new each time.  Amazing history and so much to see.  Great for kids, lots of narrow windy steps.  Ravens are cool, Crown Jewels are awesome.  If you only have a short time, save the White Tower for another visit.  Too busy and not as interesting as the outer Tower, in my opinion.  Love the chopping block area and the little prison where Lady Jane Grey was held.  The best grafitti in the world.  Go!"
"July 2, 2013",Beefeaters are a feast,The Beefeaters are a feast everyone can enjoy - even vegetarians! They know their stuff and convey it well and wittily. The Crown Jevels are an absolute must and a triumph of both content and presentation.
"July 1, 2013",Much more than expected,Busy and expensive to get in but very historical.  Could easily spend a day there if interested in British history.  Would have preferred a tour option that gave less detail.
"June 29, 2013",Real London History,"Take the tour, that way you don't miss anything.  I visited over 50 years ago and it still has the charm and magic it had for me as a child.  Well worth a visit"
"June 20, 2013","You can feel the history, it almost feels wrong to be wearing 'modern' clothing.","Go early in the day because you'll likely want to spend an entire morning or afternoon there.Take a guided tour by one of the Beefeaters (just wait inside the gate with the crowd, they come every 15 minutes).  This will give you an overview and point out some of the more well-known areas (Traitor's Gate, The White Tower, Crown Jewels etc).Then take some time just to wander about.  Start at the White Tower (don't forget the souvenir shop in the basement).  There's armour, weaponry, a room decorated in the Tudor style, including the sounds and smells (yes, smells) of 'yore'.Most of the walls allow you to walk on top of them, giving you access to numerous rooms and cells as well.The Crown Jewels are also housed here and definitely worth a look."
"June 9, 2013",Tower tours,"the best historic attraction we visited. Informative, interesting and slightly chilling! Fabulous :) "
"May 26, 2013",Going back in time,"Briliant place to visit. It's an all day event. It's like going back in time. One sees  how the nobility lived compared to the solders, serfs and the like lived boct in the 1600's"
"April 26, 2012",Crown Jewels Dazzling,While in London my niece and I went to the Tower of London for a visit.  We saw the Royal Crown Jewels  (lots & lots of them)!!!  Other fascinating features of the tower include the dungeon torture room of course - essential to any medieval castle life.  Another legendary thing we had heard about but needed to see for ourselves were the crows of the Tower of London.  They are huge!!  I have never seen birds like these and we made a video of them.  They are truly majestic.  The Tower of London is on the Thames riverbank and you have a very nice view of London Bridge and the river.  You will be very glad to see this World Heritage Site.  Don't miss it!
"April 7, 2012",Back into history,Any history buff will love to step back in time at The Tower of London.  The displays are always great and the Crown Jewels are worth a visit.  Much of the display at The Tower revolves around the ugly part of the violent history of England but it is part of the growth of humanity and should always be remembered.  We should all know about the past so we can appreciate the present. 
"April 3, 2012",What a sight to behold,"History buffs, and those who just like interesting places, people and things, prepare to have a blast. Cant think of anything negative to say. Do were comfortable shoes, and be prepared to walk up hills and stairs."
"January 24, 2012",just brilliant!!!!,well worth the money to visit. we arrived in time to get a tour of the tower with one of the beef eater guides and he just brought all the tales to life i was mesmerised. the place is totally fantastic and a trip i will not forget. seeing the crown jewels was amazing and the ravens too. just brilliant!!!
"January 7, 2012",Step into London's History and Watch it come Alive,"An absolute must place to visit when you come to London.One big tip if you get a London Pass or a ticket with the Hop on Hop Off Tourist bus that gives you group entry rather than buying tickets at the site will save you a heap of time.We took the self guided audo tour and felt that this was worth every penny (pence?!?) even though it can be a little slow to cover all the information and is a little confusing to follow in a logical order but then it does allow flexibility to go were you want.See the crown jewells or you'll be sorry you didn't although the day we visited was the bank holiday weekend so it was absolutely packed with people.After visiting the London Tower, wander down to the wharf and catch a ferry to Greenwich or another ferry location along the Thames River the crew are a hoot and make it a really extra wonderful experience"
"January 7, 2012",History - you have to see it,"Touristy yes, but it is chock full of history.Get tickets online in advance to save some time.Take a tour with one of the guides for a great overview.Bring your comfortable shoes, there is a lot of walking to do here."
"January 7, 2012",Who'd have thought diamonds would sparkle so much,"I've grown up dreaming about visiting the Tower of London. Standing at the sight of those royal beheadings made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The together with the crown jewels make the Tower a must see. We found the portable headset guide to confusing and will do the tour next time. Recommend booking on line and taking advantage of some of the combined ticket discounts. Also please be polite to the Beefeaters, they are lovely gentlemen and are often treated very rudely by we tourists."
"January 7, 2012",Much better than expected,"I had always wanted to visit the Tower of London so this trip we made time to do so! We are so glad we did as it was very interesting and good fun. We had a tour with Shady, an extremely informative and humorous Yeomen Warder. I would strongly recommend the tour as to listen to the stories come alive was far better than reading them from a tour guide book."
"January 7, 2012",It's actually a whole castle!,"Ok, so you probably already knew that, but seriously, it's huge and there's a TON to see! Wear comfortable shoes, use the brochure/map to help you choose your priorities because while you could spend an entire day there, it can get tiring going up and down all the stairs, maneuvering your way around the crowds, and the information overload to the brain. It's an easy walk to/from a tube (subway) station. Also, we bought our tickets online in advance and picked them up when we arrived, which worked well (shorter lines, and saved a bit). Favorite parts were the crown jewels, White Tower (which is the oldest tower), and old Roman wall outside. "
"January 6, 2012",Get there early!,We had a 12 hour lay over at Heathrow and decided to take ourselves into see the Tower of London.  So easy to get from the airport to the Tower.  We arrived before 9 am and had a coffee and bought our tickets at the kiosk.  By the time the gates opened there was a line forming.  It was still not to bad and we made our way straight to the crown jewels exhibit.  Stunning is all I can say about that part of the tower.  By the time we got out there was a line some 20 minutes long just to get into the jewels.  There are so many different types of exhibits to see.  They are more interactive things for the kids to do then when I was here 25 years ago.  After finishing the White Tower exhibits the line for the crown jewels was over an hour...and this was a Sunday in February!!!So enjoy this amazing piece of history but get there early to avoid as much of the lines as you can.
"January 5, 2012",well worth visiting,"very good attraction, and the tube stops just a couple of mins walk away,  you need about 3 hours at least and theres plenty to see, the crown jewels of course being the main attraction... actors in period costume doing little enactments through the day keep things interesting and give one a sense of how it must have been in the past... theres instruments of torture, garments used at occasions of state... the site of beheading etc should you like the darker side of the past as well! you can visit all the little towers inside and walk along the ramparts which give you a really good view of tower bridge which is just outside.there are lilttle tours conducted every 15 or so by the yeoman in costume which are very insightful as well as quite humorous which should not be missed...should also mention that though we usually avoid cafetarias in tourist attractions it was a bit of a rainy day and we ate in the Tower cafe and the stew with dumplings and the pie we had was lovely! if thats not your cup of tea theres a nice fish and chips place just outside the entrance which also looked really good..."
"January 5, 2012",TReid to go twice...lines too long and could not get in,"So difficult to get in.. we tired twice, once in pouring rain and the 8 lines were 40 people deep.....too many people here.... "
"January 5, 2012",The best tour in the city!,"My wife and I spent a 5 day vacation trip in London in June, 2013. We made the Tower of London Tour and it worth every pound that we spend in it. The Beefeaters guided tour is the best tour in this facility. This tours runs every hour and all are well explained and funny. After the tour, we went to the see the crown jewels and are amazing. I'm strongly recommend to do this tour if you are in London."
"January 5, 2012",Worth the price of admission,"I'm not sure why the Tower of London gets a bad rap for being ""overrated"". Yes it's fairly small compared to some castles, but has an immense amount of history. The crown jewels alone are worth seeing. I would recommend starting the day with the Yeoman Warder's tour (included in admission) and then picking out where you want to go. The castle also offers some great views of Tower Bridge."
"December 10, 2011",Don't skip it,We skipped the tower on our first London trip. This time we went and loved it. The tour was good and the sense of history amazing!! The Crown Jewels were a highlight. 
"October 27, 2011",Excellent; plan on at least two days,"This is an incredible experience to learn about the history of Great Britain from the standpoint of its monarchy.  There is so much to see, from the guided tours by Yeoman Warders (commonly called Beefeaters), to the Crown Jewels, there is so much to see and do.  The Yeoman Warders, who are not tour guides, but part of a centuries old tradition of being part of the personal bodyguard of the monarch, are informative and entertaining.  The in-house cafeteria is also worth a visit, whether for a cuppa to warm up on a cold English fall day, or for a plate of traditional fish, chips and mushy peas.  If you want to truly enjoy the experience, and see everything, then you should plan on at least two days at the Tower.  Enjoy!"
"October 27, 2011",Bring History Alive At The Tower,"Will capture the imagination of medieval and tudor history lovers, jewel lovers, and castle lovers.  I live fairly close to the Tower and it is one of my favourite London landmarks. I think tourists sometimes imagine it will be a huge tower but it is actually a sprawling castle set on the North Bank of the Thames and is right next to Tower Bridge too.Tips: Take a Yeoman Warder Tour and hear the history of the tower through their lively re-tellings. Another way of getting the most out of your visit is if you pay attention to the information placards dotted around all over the place. Also, if you are a resident of Tower Hamlets, take some proof of address and ID with you and you can get into the Tower for just £1 rather than the usual ticket price! (Check online first to make sure this offer is still valid.) Leave plenty of time for your visit as there is a lot to see and learn about (I recommend 2-3 hours.)Things to Visit Inside: The White Tower Exhibition, THe Crown Jewels Exhibition, The Water Gate (where Queen Anne Boleyn was brought into the Tower by boat before her execution.)Location and Amenities: Tower Hill station is the closest tube station. Amenities outside the Tower: There as some cafes and a fast food restaurant (KFC) near the tower (by the ticket office) as well as a couple of Starbucks cafes. There is also a variety of good restaurants 3 to 5 minutes walk away in St Katherine Docks (ask for directions as these are on the embankment level, lower than street level, so not immediately visible from the streets around the castle but they are very close by.) Once you are inside inside the Tower there are toilets and cafes.Nearby Attractions: Tower Bridge and St Katherine docks. Also London Bridge and the London Dungeons are in this vicinity so if you plan on visiting those, maximise your time by doing so on the same day."
"October 26, 2011",HALT! Who goes there!,"Love love love the Tower of London!  What a fantastic spine tingling place this is!  Not only is this the home of the Crown Jewels my friends but has to be home to some of THE most important historical moments in British history.  I recommend a self guided audio tour which is at your leisure and of course you can press repeat on those all important facts! Go the extra dollars for the audio - you will thank me later!  Allow at least two hours for this attraction, you can get lost listening to all the stories and dont forget to check out Traitors Gate and the bloody tower with spooky stories of torture!  Take a photo with the ravens which are kept at the Tower Grounds - as the story goes, if there are no Ravens at the Tower of London then the Monarch will fall!"
"October 26, 2011",Should be called Tower of Queues-not for young children!,"I love history and was so excited to go to the place where so many historic British events have happened but I was very disappointed.  The queues were terrible, to buy a ticket we stood for so long in the pouring rain, at least half an hour and then the young 'lady' at the till selling the tickets was so rude and unhelpful I was tempted to just turn around and say forget it.  I found most of the staff quite sullen and considering where they are working and how many International people they meet, they really do give a miserable impression of this great historic site to the public.  DO NOT TAKE YOUNG CHILDREN!  I saw so many crying children in pushchairs, they looked totally fed up, the stairs and 'landscape' of the whole place is completely unsuitable for babies and buggy's!  Yes some parts were interesting but the sheer volume of people just made the experience disappointing, you are pushing up against hoards of people and waiting and waiting in queues! The cafe is pure chaos, never want to go back there again.  Oh dear I'm trying to remember the good bits, the crown jewels, those 15 minutes looking at them were memorable but I will never go back again.  The ticket was so expensive and for what I paid the experience just not worth it, I wish I had gone to the Victoria and Albert museum instead and that's free."
"October 26, 2011",Don't miss out! The Tower is a must!,"My husband, myself and our three university aged children were on a once in a lifetime family holiday together from Australia. The Tower of London was a highlight of our visit to London! We all loved  soaking up the atmosphere. The ghosts of famous historical figures of the past such as Elizabeth 1, Anne Boleyn, William the Conqueror etc seemed almost to be standing amongst us! What amazing history!  We all loved our visit and want to come again!"
"February 25, 2014",Plan To Stay At Least Half A Day,We originally budgeted only a couple of hours for this site but spent more than half a day here! The size of the tower is immense and the history is very well presented. You must take a beefeater tour! The cafe here is also very good. Their sausages are the best ones we had in England!
"January 31, 2014",arrive early and beat the crowds,"I arrived at the Tower of London at 10am and had no wait to buy tickets or see the crown jewels, which were astounding. The armory display in the White Tower was interesting as well but the highlight was a tour by a Beefeater with a keen sense of humor. I had a great time and would recommend a visit when coming to London."
"January 17, 2014",Where the medieval story books came alive!,"This place offered such an amazing look into the English medieval past. Our beefeater tour guide was very knowledgeable yet hilarious! Part of the time we were with the tour guide, the other part we explored the different towers on our own. The Tower of London is situated next to the famous London Tower Bridge so be sure to capture your photos from the Tower facing the Bridge! Each of the towers served a different purpose and I was most fascinated with the White Tower (main one) and not to mention the tower that houses the crown jewels of the past English rulers! We stayed in Russell Square and took the Tube all the way out to Tower Hill and it was an enjoyable (somewhat scenic) ride. This is a must in London!"
"January 3, 2014",Great way to spend a morning!,"We were able to take a Beefeater tour and visit the Tower of London complex in a few short hours, however if you are super interested in the armor displays you will want to give yourself some more time.  Loved the Beefeater tour, in fact our guide was the Raven Keeper as well!  He was great.  The Crown Jewels were awesome, however I was disappointed that there weren't any tiaras on display.  One tip! We purchased a Historic Royal Palaces Joint Membership which allowed us free access to Tower of London, Kensington Palace (which we ended up not visiting due to the awful reviews), Hampton Court Palace, among others.  This saved us money (or at minimum broke even), however it's worth the money even if only visiting 1 palace---we skipped all lines completely and walked right to the final ticket gates, showed the card, and walked right through. You also get a souvenir book and a 10% discount at gift shops.  Highly recommended to do this!"
"December 26, 2013",Tower of London review,"Excellent , well worth the entrance fee. I would recommend that you attend the Beefeater tour which only takes 45 minutes but gives you an interesting, factual and funny account of  the history of the Tower as well as British monarchy.  Do not be put off by the long queue to view the crown jewels as the crowd moves quickly and is well worth the visit. Watch out for the changing of the guard each hour and take a photograph of the guard in his full dress uniform in front of his sentry hut .. a must !"
"November 7, 2013","Beautiful buildings, fascinating history","If you have any interest in Kings and Queens, history of Britain or just love buildings, then you should really make time for a trip to the Tower of London.  Like many people who live close by, I hadn't been for years and was really looking forward to my trip.There really is so much to see and do here, from the Towers, to the Crown Jewels, right to the armoury exhibitions.A couple of hints for your day out- The latter part of the day seems a lot less busy than the start of the day.  We went between 1.30 and 5.15 and it seemed a good time to go- Book your tickets online.. As well as the queues being less, the tickets are actually cheaper.- There is a lot of walking and stairs within the complex of buildings.  Don't expect lifts, escalators or ramps as there aren't any.  If you are not able to climb stairs then this might not be the attraction for you.- The paper leaflet, its not very helpful.  It tells you the name of the area within the Tower and that is it.  No history and nothing of its use. You are better off getting the audio tour, or if possible joining one of the beefeater tours.- Explore everything possible...every staircase, every building and every door.  The areas not for public use are clearly sign posted but we found many towers and exhibitions which had virtually no people in as they were round a small corner.- Take time to go into the chapel when it is open.  There is normally someone supervising within this building and they are able to tell you some fascinating facts and figures.- Definitely go and see the crown jewels.  If there is no queue out the front of the building pop in immediately.  As when we were there, there were times when the queue was snaking around the corner.- Once in the crown jewels exhibition, when you get to the slow moving walkways either side of the jewels.  Do both sides.  We did the back side first, then walked back the 40 steps and viewed them from the front.  If you dont do this then you will miss some of the stunning gems on display, which are you can only see from one side.Overal we had a great day out and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"September 28, 2013",Wonderful place to go!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit! I would recommend, however, that you get there as soon as they open and go straight for the crown jewels to avoid the line.  You will thank me (and yourself) later when you pass the building holding the crown jewels and the line is out the door!I spent about 3 hours at the Tower of London and wanted to stay much longer! Most certainly get a tour by a Teoman (AKA Beefeater).  They have tours every have hour and you can meet them near the entrance (I believe it's at the clock at the entrance.)"
"September 24, 2013",Climbing Required..Medievil Stairmaster,"I think they have lifts for handicapped...the old, younge, fat, out-of-shape just have to climb those stairs...up and down, up and down and up and up.  Just saying.  Go rested.  You can see the jewels and the chapel with no climbing.  Everything else involves stairs.  Much of it is worth the climb.  For sure catch the free, brief Beefeater Tour.  They are funny guys... retired Sergeants Majors who live with their families in the Tower.   The jewels are stunning.  I didn't get to see the chapel because there was a wedding (besides the Royal Wedding) going on.I highly recommend planning ahead and making reservations for The Ceremony of the Keys.  This is a real military ceremony that has been conducted for over 600 years, every night at 2130 hours, to secure the tower.  Active duty service members and Beefeaters conduct the ceremony.  It is free but requires an invitation.  I requested my tickets in late December for April.  They recommend requesting no less than 2 months in advance.  You will feel honored to witness this ceremony."
"September 17, 2013",Splendor and Heebie Jeebies All in One Place,"We originally planned on spending about three hours at The Tower.  We ended up staying for five, and probably could have stayed longer.  Even our children weren't ready to leave, but our trip was of a limited duration and we needed to move on.Our first thought on entering the Tower Grounds was that it was almost like Royal Epcot.  It's amazingly clean and well labeled.  Everything is easy to find, and the salacious aspects of the doings in the Tower are played up in addition to the other, more mundane, facts.  The tours are incredible and full of interesting tidbits with a great deliver, but if you are there with children, you might do better to go it alone with a guidebook.The first thing my children noticed and giggled over was King Henry VIII's suit of armor.  If you have seen it, you know exactly what I'm talking about.  You only have to do a google image search to understand.  The stairway where the bones of the Princes in the Tower is labeled as well, and in a good area for pictures.  There are good options for food, but they are expensive.  We ended up eating at one of the little cafes anyway.  The food was very good, but cost more than it was worth, really.  The Crown Jewels were far less interesting than everything else on display and the stories that abounded about the things that happened within the Tower walls."
"August 25, 2013",Beefeater turns gruesome into fun!,"This is both an historically interesting but also fun for kids attraction. It's best to start off with the beefeater tour which meets at the front entrance. This is a one-hour tour of the outside of the towers led by a humorous guide in a period costume. He sets the groundwork for you to pick which towers you want to visit. There's plenty of green space plus short, humorous demonstrations for the kids. The line is long to see the crown jewels, but it moves fast and there are videos to watch while you wait. The cafeteria was OK, but for Americans, the food was ""different"" - wouldn't recommend the bacon, pickle, mustard, and mayo sandwich! Bathrooms are good - try the one in the basement of the prison next to the execution site. You can easily spend several hours here. Also, buy tickets online so you don't have to wait in the ticket line- they are good for 7 days from the date you buy them for."
"July 5, 2011","If you see anything in London, See this!","I’ve made several trips to London for different things and have visited the Tower of London twice.  In my mind, it is THE thing to see and visit in London.  So much of England’s colorful history has centered around the Tower.  The Beefeaters give a lively and colorful tour.  Recommend that you use the London Card (for express entry).  Don’t be afraid to ask questions about what line you might be standing in.  Many folks wait in line needlessly…don’t be a sheep!  The Crown Jewels are here in the Tower.  Typically, the line for them is quite long.  It tends to move fairly rapidly as they have you on a conveyor belt as you past the jewels…if you’ve never seen them, then they’re worth a look.  If you’re a Tudors fan, then the Tower is a must.  Be sure and check on line for tours and times…you can walk the Tower grounds without a guide, but if you don’t take a Beefeaters’ tour (free with admission), then you’ve really missed the Tower.  If you want an additional unique Tower experience, check out the Ceremony of the Keys where they lock the Tower for the night…as they’ve been doing for over 700 years.   You must write for tickets (a couple of months in advance)…which are free, but it will require a trip to your post office for an international self-addressed stamped envelope.  The Ceremony of the Keys is not a substitute for a normal Tower tour, but it was intimate, unique, and the only way to experience the Tower at night."
"June 27, 2011",Awe Inspiring,"The Tower has so much history within it's walls that you should allocate an entire day to take it all in. One room is stuffed with military hardware. The Crown Jewels are elsewhere, and will bedazzle you by their opulance. Free guided tours of the outside grounds are hosted by the tower guards, the Beefeaters. The tours are rich in detail and permiated with typical British wit and humor. It's also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. So if you're like me, trying to visit as many WHS's as possible in one lifetime, don't miss this one. Do buy a London Card so you can skip lines and save money on entrance to many of London's exquisite attractions."
"June 21, 2011",Buy your tickets  before on line!,Buy your tickets on the web before.  Just print your receipt and go to the welcome center and pick them up!  Be there when they open and avoid lines and crowds!  You will save time and money!
"June 13, 2011",Get there early!,"We arrived at noon and stayed there till closing time at 5:30.  Had we realized how much there was to see, we would have come at 9am when they open.  Don't miss the Yeoman Warder's tour.  Our first one was cancelled 5 minutes into the talk because it started to rain.  Apparently they don't conduct tours in the rain.  Fortunately we were able to catch a second Yeoman Warder's tour later in the day during a lull when the rain stopped.  When it started sprinkling again our Yeoman quickly rushed us into the chapel where he finished giving us the historical background to the Tower of London.  Don't miss the Crown Jewels while you are there.  The line-up is worth it.  Also, we were able to use a two-for-one voucher because we had bought a 7 day paper travelcard from one of the National Railway stations in London but even if we had had to pay the full price admission, it would have been worth it."
"June 13, 2011",A Great London Experience,"Throughly enjoyed our visit.  Be sure to allow yourself enough time to view everything, at least 4 hours.  We took a beefeater tour to start and them followed the audio guide throughout the site for the remainder of our time.  The line for the crown jewels was quite long on a Wednesday afternoon but it moved along quickly, so don't be put off.  The crown jewels and beefeater tour were the highlight of the visit.  We purchased our tickets in advance on their website and skipped a bit of queue time."
"June 12, 2011",London's Premier Historical Site,"As an annual member of the Royal Palaces, I've been to the Tower of London three times in the past 12 months. Firstly, on a sidenote, I recommend visitors to get off at Monument tube station opposed to Tower Hill. The monument is a 300+ step column that was erected as a memorial in the wake of the Great Fire of London in 1666 and offers some great views of London.The Tower of London is a magnificent castle that is perched on the River Thames next to London Bridge. During my first visit I did the guided tour which I recommend for first-timers as it is conducted by one of the resident Beefeaters, is entertaining, informative and witty. I'm not usually a fan of guided tours but at this particular attraction I found the information relative and engaging. Within the grounds there are a number of different sectors to visit. The newly launched Beasts section is something of a disappointment even if the information is quite interesting (apparently Henry VIII kept a Polar Bear on the grounds!). The two highlights for me are the crown jewels along with a bloodline of heritage of the royals, videos of the various royal weddings and the jewels used at the royal ceremonies including the Queens crown etc. The second most fascinating part is the armory used by Henry VIII and other royalty that it remarkably well-kept and intricate in detail. There is a lot of showcase of weapons and armory with fantastic design. The grounds are also host to a war museum, the bloody tower, the site where Anne Boleyn was beheaded, the prisoners tower with preserved inscriptions dating back hundreds of years, the superstitious ravens (rumour has it that the tower will crumble if they ever leave) and other bits and bobs. All in all you could spend an entire day here and it would be well spent. One of the top attractions in London and offers so much."
"May 20, 2011",Ensure that you have atleast 3-4 hours to really enjoy this...,This is one of the must do's in london..... lots of history and stories are there about his place and the best place to heat them is to take the warden tour...Do make sure that you spare good 4 hours for this attraction as you would need to wait for 30-45 mins in the queue for the crown jewels and the warden tour is 1-1.25 hours long. You need to take time out to see the rest of the place yourself.Dont forget to get a glance of the Tower Bridge right next to the Tower of London....
"May 18, 2011",Ceremony of the Keys,"A must do and it's FREE! Each night at the Tower they have a ceremony that is the traditional locking up of the Tower of London and has taken place on each and every night, without fail, for at least 700 years. It happens at 9:30 pm and they only let about 40 people take part each night. You have to write away for the tickets but they are free and it is a really interesting ceremony with lots of pomp and tradition, as you would expect! It's mice to be there without all the crowds of the daytime plus you are seeing something that really not that many people know about or have done. The address to get tickets is on this website http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/WhatsOn/ceremonyofthekeys.aspxand they recommend having 3 or 4 alternate dates that you can come.I highly recommend doing this if you can while you are in London. You won't be disappointed!"
"May 6, 2011",EXCELLENT DAY OUT,"We visited the site on Monday 11/07/11 arriving around 10.30am we had booked tickets via the internet which we collected from the information centre at Tower Hill so avoiding the queues which had already formed at the ticket offices. Entrance into the Tower took only a few minutes, the security staff searching bags at the entrance are obviously bored with their jobs and need an atitude change but the rest of the staff are helpful and readily supply information and help wherever possible.The Tower is full of interesting items and historical facts and its well worth following one of the outlined tours around the castle.Allow yourself a good few hours to see everything properly, but be aware as the days goes on the crowds get worse, so the earlier you start the better.Plenty of places to sit down and relax on a fine day.Great value for money if you enjoy history.If you want a good photo of the Ravens get your sandwiches out they will soon find you !"
"May 1, 2011",Crown Jewels a Must See,Enjoyed walking around the complex visiting the various towers.  The crown jewels are a must see.  We got there fairly early and with no crowds we were able to leisurely take in the jewels.  Do come on a full stomach as the restaurant in the complex was the worst ever. The quality of the food is why many sites have turned the food concessions over to a fast food restaurant (McDonalds).
"August 20, 2011",Definitely take the guided tour,"If you haven't been to the tower, you haven't seen London.  It's one of the top four or five must-see sites.  Definitely take the guided tour first.  It's humorous and informative.  All the wardens are real showmen.  The tour is really the high point.  The crown jewels are worth seeing.  The armory in the White Tower is interesting (armor, weapons, etc), but it drags and there's apparently no other way out but to see the whole place. And that's really about it.  The most impressive part of the tower is it's hulking size and its role in British history.  If you're expecting excitement, don't go."
"August 19, 2011",Nice morning activity,"I'm really glad I didn't miss this and really enjoyed wandering around and taking pictures before the crowds got heavy, around 11 am. Go when it first opens. I thought the audio tour was a waste of money as it was quite confusing to figure out where to start it for different narratives. my unexpected favorite part was seeing all the little armor sets for young kings. Very cool."
"August 18, 2011",London history not to be missed!,"My wife and I visited the Tower of London this past August. It was well worth the price of admission, and the 3 hours we spent there was not enough. Unfortunately, the line up for the Crown Jewels was enormous, so we chose not to wait. Instead, we went through the rest of the castle, and thoroughly enjoyed that. The highlight of the afternoon, though, was the free tour given by the “Beefeater” Yeoman Warder.  It was insightful, comedic at times, and very informative. Kudos to this gentleman for wrangling our group of about 30 people, and speaking without a microphone loud enough to be heard at all times. I would love to have another opportunity to visit London when I might be able to spend most of the day taking in all that the Tower of London has to offer."
"August 8, 2011",Very Interesting Time at the Tower of London,"My daughter, 11, and I enjoyed our visit to the Tower of London.  We especially enjoyed the Beefeater's Tour. It was one of the highlights of the trip. We were the fourth and fifth visitors inside that morning and went right to the Crown Jewels. Saw them by ourselves which was very nice. We were able to take all the time we wanted to see them so go when it first opens.Then after the tour, we took a boat which was right beside it to Greenwich."
"August 8, 2011",Get the most from a day at the Tower of London during peak season,"We visited the Tower of London in early August 2011 with a nine-year old.  To get the most out of a very crowded attraction during the busiest time, I would suggest:*Buy your ticket online before you leave home at www.hrp.org.uk/toweroflondon/*About 45 minutes to 30 minutes before the main gate opens, go to the Visitor Centre, just to the right of the main entrance to exchange your print out for tickets and also to pick up a free children's info pack (pencil, fun facts, button).  The Visitor Centre is open before the main gates open, so save yourself some time and get everything you need before heading to the entrance.*Line up at the entrance.  We waited about 40 minutes, but were the third in line*Once in, head straight for the Crown Jewels.  Seriously, the lines for that alone start building up about 30 minutes after the main entrance opens.  We beelined it and there were no crowds, we lingered and got to ask questions from the two guards on duty.  They are magnificent, but after seeing the lines afterwards, I wouldn't have waited.*Then head to the White Tower to see all the armour and weapons and history of the kings' horses. There is a great interactive, hands-on area for kids that my son really loved.*You can take the Yeoman tour, but believe me, purchase the individual handheld listening devices instead.  The groups for the free Yeoman tours are way too large.  You can't hear anything despite how loud they speak.*You can walk around based on the numbers listed on your pamphlet (given out when you enter) and take your time.*We had lunch at the cafeteria-style Armoury Restaurant.  Food isn't bad.  Make use of the special kid's meal coupon attached to the back of the info pamphet for a good price on a kid's meal.  I believe it was 5 pounds for a hot main, dessert and drink*When it started getting really busy, stay outside in the open areas and search for the six ravens that live there.  They all have coloured bands on their feet and your pamphlet will show the names that correspond to each colour.  Our son had a great time finding them around the Tower in the open areas.  It also gives you a chance to catch you breath from all the squeezing in the interior areas of the Tower.*The Tower is really a number of different buildings enclosed by the moat and walls, so don't think it's just one building.  There is a lot of walking involved, but it's a great way to spend a day."
"August 4, 2011","Excellent, a must see in London",Spent 4 hours in the Tower of London and could have stayed longer.  There is so much to see and the crown jewels are amazing.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  We got real value for money with the two for one vouchers and under 5's go free.  The one thing we thought was very expensive was the cafe - food very overpriced - so if you want to save money bring your own and have a picnic.  Also wear confortable walking shoes.
"August 1, 2011",Still a Towerful experience,"Using the Hop on Off bus and recognizing that the Red business are audio tours and the driver has free ears buds .. or the yellow bus which is speaker tour then there is a Blue bus .. which has small route ..  Nice ride passing the palace and on through pass the Parliament and London Eye, Big Ben ( which is the bell inside) it is actually St. Stephen's tower you're seeing. Anyway ... crossing the bridge to south bank you then cross back over the Tower Bridge .. . As for the tower .. hard to say whether you like the pressing crowds of a guided tour or pay a little for your own audio tour. It was humid so we chose the audio tour and went about at our own pace. The Crown Jewels?? Well that is the big winding line that everybody is standing in ... and it continues to wind and wind inside where videos show you the jewels .. but then finally you press forward to the big vault and yes the Jewels are there .. Gold, Sapphires , Emeralds. Pearls ... Diamonds .. then .. out you go. The eatery there was very quaint. Cornish pastry etc .. spacious and orderly. The gift shop has nice different items like pewter knights and a metal chopping block.  Tip .. If you buy your ticket from the Hop On bus people you will get a free ride on the Thames ... see my Thames review."
"July 29, 2011",Don't miss this!,"This was one of the best tours we took in the whole of London.  We walked around with a Yeoman Warder who told us the history and stories of the Tower.  There's a lot more to it than just being a prison where traitor's were kept before execution.  There are many exhibits  including armor and weapons, instruments of torture, and of course, the Crown Jewels are a ""must see.""  There is also a nice cafe where we ate lunch which was quite good.  This is a big place, so plan to spend several hours here.  It is well worth it."
"July 25, 2011",A must see,"So much history to see/experience.  Site itself is well maintained and the Beefeaters give an excellent tour.  Went with 2 children and they did not want to leave -- wanted to return the next day.  Had lunch in the cafeteria -- lots of good food to choose from, including homemade shortbread biscuits/scones, and very clean.  If you can, take one of the many ferries -- an enjoyable, relaxing way to see the city.  Highly recommend."
"July 15, 2011",Fantastic voyage back in time!!,"This is a must see while in London. We arrived early on a Sunday (yikes) and went straight to the Crown Jewels. No line -- we walked straight through. We then toured the White Tower -- so much history. Finally we toured with a Beefeater -- he was great. They are required to be history experts, and boy was he. He made the place come alive. They actually live at the Tower, so they consider this their home. They take a lot of pride in it. So easy to get via the tube -- just go early and straight to the jewels."
"October 25, 2011",Highlight of London trip,"The Tower of London was a highlight of our trip.  Make sure to take the tour with a Beefeater.  Our guide, Mark, was fantastic with a perfect mix of history and humor in his presentation.    I imagine the audio is adequate but he made history come to life.  Don't wait to the end of the day for this sight."
"October 12, 2011",interesting but expensive,"We visited the Tower Of London in the afternoon, buying the tickets at the gate. If you can plan your trip in advance then you can get tickets cheaper over the Internet. We paid £17 each, and without knowing a 10% voluntary donation, which meant the total cost to get in was £37.40. It was only a couple of hours before closing time but the place was still very busy.We had time to walk around the walls, visit the various small towers and look round the armouries exhibition in the big White Tower. We also had a good look at the Crown Jewels. There's plenty of information available around the site detailing the history of each area.My only criticism would be there's not really much to do in there. Even though it was busy we easily got round it all in two hours. So nearly forty pounds seems expensive for the time we spent in there.You can read more about our visit in my travel diaries at pencer.org."
"September 16, 2011",A medieval treasure,"You can't visit the Tower without getting a deep sense of the incredible history of the city of London and England as a whole . It isn't always a pleasant sense of history - but even the bloodcurdling parts are fascinating. Go early, as the queues and crowds get much bigger through the day particularly for the Jewel House. We started with a yeoman warder guided tour but found it too slow-moving so struck out on our own. In hindsight this may not have been the best way to go because we certainly missed some important and interesting bits of information, but I guess it comes down to how much time you have. For example, we went right past the area on the green where Anne Boleyn and others were executed without realising it. The White Tower (the original Tower of London) has a large multi-storey museum inside which is full of weapons and armory among other gems such as the old Norman garderobe (toilet). I would definitely suggest that if you are a visitor to London then you really should go and see the Tower, otherwise you haven't really captured the essence of the place."
"September 15, 2011",That's it?  Very disappointing,"This was on my husband's and my top things to see in London when we were there last week.  I really wish I had just walked around the outside to take some pictures instead of wasting 17 Pounds per person.  I couldn't get over the lack of things to see inside.  The torture chamber was pathetic!  You'll see better and more torture devices at an x-rated store.  Maybe if the price dropped SIGNIFICANTLY, then it would be worth the money.  But as of now, the only thing positive is being able to say ""I've been to the Tower of London"", and I got a picture with the Tower Bridge behind me.  (But you can take the Tower Bridge picture without paying to go inside.)  Save your money - this was lame."
"September 12, 2011",Great visit,"On a June trip to London with my family of 4, we visited the Tower.  We have an interest in the history of the Tower, so were excited to go.  We did arrive right at 9:00 when it opened.  There was no line at all.  We walked right in straight to the Crown Jewels as many have suggested.  We had no wait at all.  We then took one of the Beefeater tours which was very entertaining.  After that we did some touring on our own.  We stayed nearly 3 hours and enjoyed our time.  Highly recommend for those who already have some knowledge of the history of this place."
"September 1, 2011",So much to see!,"You can spend the entire day at the Tower.  Ready to start early (when the Tower opened at 9 AM), we first went to the crown jewels (our hotel recommended that).  They are just unbelievable!  It's really cool that there's a conveyor belt to go by them!  We then went to the ""Fit for a King"" exhibit which had opened the day we went (April 6.)  So many interesting things and some interactive ones too.  We walked around the buildings -- and went to the White Tower, Dungeon, etc.  (Some of the stairs are really steep and little!)The highlight, though, was being able to talk to the Beefeaters and see the guards up close.  (We even got a photo with the first female Yeoman, Moira something.)  We went to the ""Ceremony of the Keys"" on Sunday night. (You must write them for a reservation as only 50+ people are allowed per night.)  There were no photos allowed, but it was really interesting that this tradition has continued for over 400 years!Recommended attraction - absolutely.  Leave LOTS of time to explore!"
"August 26, 2011",Take time to see this,"This is one of the best things we did while on a weekend in London. Its definitely worth the que for the tickets and the price. There is so much information there, but it is all very well presented and keeps you interested the whole way through. Allow a full morning or afternoon, and dont rush through, or you will miss some of the information on the walls, projectors around. We got a real feel for the history of the Tower and everything that went on there. We didnt eat there, though the rest of the facilities were very clean and well looked after. Watch out for the changing of the guard, and the actors that are all around to bring the history to life. They make the wait in the ques fly by. Oh yeah, wear comfy shoes, you will definitely spend most of your time walking around here."
"August 25, 2011",If you do one thing in London do the Tower and the Beefeater tour.,"Really enjoyed the visit.  The Beefeater tours were fantastic, lots of little known facts and quite a bit of comedy thrown in, really informative.  Also they all seem to have their own routines and stories so you could quite cheerfully do a couple with different Beefeaters and not get bored.  I'm an exiled Londoner and know London very, very well and I think if you do one thing while you're there it should be the Beefeater tour at the Tower.  It cost £17.00 to get in as an adult but it is well worth it and the Beefeater tour is included in that.The exhibitions are interesting and well explained, the Crown Jewels were breathtaking.  You really do feel like you are almost living history as you walk around the Tower.I would agree with other reviewers that it is probably best to take a bottle of water and some sandwiches as the refreshments stalls are expensive. There are fantastic sites to take photos of Tower Bridge and up and down the Thames within the Tower too.Very, very enjoyable and well worth the money in my opinion."
"August 25, 2011",An informative few hours,"Myself, husband and daughters aged 8 and 4 visited the Tower in Feb 2010.  I felt quite ignorant after wandering around and reading all the information!  It was interesting.It was busy, but we beat most of the crowds by getting there just as it opened at 10am - I'd suggest this if you're planning a visit.  I'd also suggest taking your own food or planning around meal times as eating there is expensive.Our kids couldn't stand the slow pace of the Yeoman's and so we explored on our own, but if you get the chance I'd take the tour with them as they're very informatve and amusing.Beware, there are lots of stairs!"
"August 24, 2011",top of my list,"I've been to London quite a few times but only went to Tower of London this round. It certainly ranked among the top 3 places to go in my list. A well-preserved fortress. The ""stars of Africa"", 300 and 500 carats each in the crown jewels section are particularly impressive. Plus, you can take good shots of London bridge. All in all, very entertaining. If you do go, consider buying tickets on-line as I spent half an hour queuing at the ticket booth."
"April 25, 2011",Amazing,To avoid the queue for tickets you can get the tickets further along from the first lot of booths. You can also buy them for another day. To avoid the queue to go in once you have your tickets you can walk round to the group entrance and go in there.There is a queue for the crown jewels but it is well worth it they are absolutely stunning. It is extremely interesting. One word of warning it was raining when we went and were told the yeomen/beefeaters dont do their tours in the rain - what a shame.
"April 19, 2011",Back to the past,"After reading many books about English history, and watching so many movies and TV series about medieval England, this is a place one must go.I spent a whole day there and took hundreds of photos.I felt like travelling through time, back to the 1500s and 1600s.Don't miss the guided tours!"
"April 10, 2011",Must See,"Even though I was on business in London, I managed to see a few things. This is one you should not miss. Its full of history and you can spend as much time as you wish to.The best time to visit is in the morning, and you can start here if you are touring the city the entire day."
"August 20, 2010",A Must!,"During a recent trip to London, I visited many attractions, and the Tower was by far the best and most worthwhile excursion. At a cost of 17 pounds for an adult admission, the Tower is well worth it: the site is well documented, so visitors less-knowledgeable of history will be able to appreciate the site. Additionally, there are many hands on and interactive elements, such as a CSI style analysis of the Richard III/ young princes conspiracy. And the Crown Jewels are not to be missed! (and make sure to check out the security at the vault!). I could not give this a higher recommendation."
"July 19, 2010","Stunning, as expected","This place is amazing.  It is a true historic site worthy of a visit from everyone.  I've been there twice, but I think once would have been adequate.  It is worth a visit and is truly spectacular, but it doesn't change, so once would have been fine, too."
"July 4, 2010",One of the best attractions in London.,I have visited the Tower of London as a Man and a boy and the magic is still there. An educational trip through time.
"May 4, 2010",Wonderfull,"This place was more than I expected, and I had high expectations when I arrived. I headed for the crown jewels exposition first, proving to be a smart thing to do to beat the crowds. The guided tours by the guards are highly recommended, but you don't need to start with one. The museum inside the Tower was fascinating -especially the part for children (however, fun for all ages) where you could try your skills as an archer  for example."
"April 20, 2010",So much history,"One of our favorite places to visit when in London.There is so much to see and do in the tower.It can be a very long and tiring day though.Try to arrive close to opening time and make sure you visit the Crown Jewels first, as the waiting in line gets very  much longer later in the day. Also, its worth joining a Yeoman Warder  tour .They give a good ( and amusing) commentry on the history and take you into the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincular where Anne Boleyn,Katherine Howard and many other execution victims are buried."
"February 23, 2010",Beefeaters are wonderful!,"Spent most of the day at the Tower of London.  Originally went to see the crown jewels but got a great surprise when we took two of the free tours with the resident Beefeaters.  On one tour they give you the history of the tower grounds, the royalty that has lived there, and the royalty that has died there.  On the tour of the white tower you hear of how the kings lived hundreds of years ago.   The guides were so much fun to listen to.  They truly love what they do and are enthusiatic about making thier guest enjoy thier visit."
"February 20, 2010",Don't arrive too late,"A word of warning: if you arrive too late to join the last tour you will be sold a full-price ticket (outrageously expensive, compared to most other London attractions) and will be free to wander around the buildings and exhibitions, but this is like paying to go to a cinema to watch a movie with the sound turned off -- almost a complete waste of time and money.Having said that, everyone says that the Beefeater tours are good, so just make sure you get there early enough!"
"January 7, 2010",Great Place,"I have been to the tower of London three times this year, taking my kids there on two occasions, and we all loved it. The line to get in can be quite a hassle, but once through we chose not to go on the beefeater tour but headed instead over to the far side away from the crowds and went round that way.It proved a great idea as we were constantly against the crowds.The Beefeaters themselves were great and even though we didn't go on their actual tour, we did meet several and they told us little stories, which was great.I think this is a must do location that everyone should visit, whether you live in London or whether you are a visitor to London."
"January 6, 2010",A Grim & Ghostly Place,Even in the sun this place has an atmosphere of death and haunting. You can feel the presence of the executed and tortured souls that must still walk the grounds. A place that I would imagine would be terrifying at night! A great day out for those who like history and historic buildings. Good value for money and the guards are most informative!
"December 23, 2009",Beefeaters diamonds and more,"I visited this attraction with my dad on monday. Upon arriving we quickly decided we should have booked on line as it saves a little bit off the price and a lot of the queue. The queu looked awful so we popped round the corner for lunch instead. (must recommend the quality burger bar - its delicious with huge fresh burgers for a reasonable cost - but i digress)After lunch we decided to to go and queue and to our great fortune the queue had disappeared due to rain showers! So we headed into the tower of london. We did wait for a yeoman tour which started out quite promising and sounded very interesting but unfortunately the tour was called off as it started pouring down with rain (and hail) The pklace is HUGE! the walk around the tops was lovely on the riverside but the other side had a much less attractive view :( the crown jewels are SPECTACULAR and I don't think you will ever see diamonds so huge! although I was disappointed to find that the older crowns have been stripped of all diamonds and gems for security reasons. I also enjoyed the bloody tower (not another bloody tower!) and the walk around outside on the cobbled area. there are a couple of guards on the area, one performed a little stompy march for us, but I'm pretty sure the other was sleeping... The only part of this trip that I did not enjoy as much was the white tower as it is a huge exhibet and as I am personally not hugely interested in weaponry, It was a little tedious. I did quite enjoy the interactive area at the end however (young child in me) I would strongly recommend this visit for anyone with an interest in londons history, and an enjoyment in gruesome details. Also, the ravens are HUGE!enjoy your trip!"
"December 5, 2009",My favourite place in London,"I live just outside London and have visited a lot of of the major and not so major attractions that London has to offer. The Tower of London is my favourite place in the whole city and possibly the whole country. The official guides suggest you should allow 2-3 hours to visit the tower but there is so much to see and do I would suggest at least half a day is necessary - I could happily wander round all day.From the Bloody Tower to the Crown Jewels to the huge armoury there is something for everyone - including the ancient ""graffiti"" carved into the prison cell walls by prisoners in ancient times.DO NOT miss the Beefeaters tour - these guys are very funny and really know their stuff - you'd be mad to not to participate.By the way watch out for the ravens - don't be tempted to feed them - they BITE!Fantastic value for money."
"November 13, 2009",Crown jewels were cool but the rest was -blah-,"The crown jewels were really cool but if they weren't there this wouldn't be worth seeing. Traitors gate is exactly that, a gate. It was too crowded and slow moving old people made it frustrating. The entrance fee was too high.You can only look at the crown jewels while standing on a conveyor belt..."
"November 3, 2009",One of my favorite attractions in London,"I enjoyed walking through the castle, fort, museums, etc. during my visit to London!  The crowned jewels museum inside the Tower was fabulous!!"
"October 24, 2009",Don't miss it,"I stopped by the tower of London while on a tour and it was fantastic.  The architecture and history is not to be missed.  Also the crown jewels were neat.  There is so much to do inside, including the torture chamber and various rooms and exhibits. You can also take picture with the beefeaters (guards).  Don't miss the ravens.  You can also get nice pictures of tower bridge while there.  One of my highlights of London."
"October 23, 2009",My second favorite place in England,"This is an amazing site and clearly a must see.  Now I'm the type of person who knows nothing about gold and honestly never cared for it. It's a precious metal. End of story.  Well, when you go here and literally see tons and tons of gold crafted to perfection, you'll realize what all the hype is about. It's unbelievably beautiful and it hypnotizes the viewer...i almost found myself scheming! And that's just one aspect of the Tower of London.  This castle also holds seemingly unlimited pieces of authentic weapons from javelins and maces to armor and muskets.  You could literally walk around for an entire day here and keep seeing new things.  Since it is a castle, relax and sit down for a while and contemplate the sheer magnificence of this imposing structure. Watch out for raven though! These ravens are actually famous and have existed on the grounds of this castle for hundreds of years.  They actually have guards there to care for them! And rest assured that you won't be lost because there are guides in costume to guide you throughout."
"October 23, 2009",Defnitely worth taking some time to see!,"We have been living in London for a few months and are due to go back to the states in May. We wanted to make sure that we saw all of the London sights before we leave and we were not disappointed. You can spend as much or as little time as you want here. There is a lot of history and many options for touring. We took the audio tour because we didn't want to walk around in the large Beefeater groups. We were able to get a quick blurb on each place of interest, which suited us just fine. I am really glad we went to see the Tower of London and enjoyed the experience."
"October 9, 2009",History Come to Life,"If you only have enough time to do a couple of things in London, this should definitely be on your list.Buy your tickets online and then go to the ""group"" entrance. It didn't make sense to me at the time, but it worked out perfectly, and I got to skip massive queues that apparently started forming well before it even opened because when I arrived promptly at opening time there were already hundreds of people in line.Once you head inside the Tower, go straight to the building in the far corner that houses the Crown Jewels. This was my first stop and I essentially walked straight in, waiting less than 10 minutes. A few hours later I passed the line and was told it was a two hour wait to see the Crown Jewels. So go first even if it seems you are walking past other interesting things--you can backtrack to see them later.The towers with the prisoner's graffiti were fascinating, as were Traitor's Gate, the Palace, and the Bloody Tower complete with its exhibit on torture. And the relatively new monument to the beheaded victims was unique. Despite being very touristy, it was one of the places in London where you could really feel the historical significance of the place and in my opinion was well worth the entrance fee and time. Buy the guidebook and then take yourself around. I did that, and stopped on one of the many benches outside each tower or exhibit and read the paragraphs about it before I entered. I found that much more enjoyable than taking one of the fabled Beefeater Tours only because the one I started with quickly had over 200 people crowded around trying to hear the guide.A good visit here that covers everything will take three to four hours, and that is without counting the time you may have to wait to see the Jewels."
"January 4, 2009",Spectacular and historic day out,"There really is a lot to see in the Tower - allow most of, if not a whole day for it.  Crown jewels and Henry VIII's armory very impressive, plus an amusing tournament/ sword fight for entertainment.  There is some queueing, but videos/ displays to pass the time.  Not really for the youngest of children, but 6 and above should enjoy it.  Not cheap at £17 per adult, but worth it.  Bargain if you use Tesco or other vouchers."
"April 22, 2008",Get there early!,I went to the Tower in the middle of July.  I read somewhere to get there early and see the Crown Jewels first.  This was great advice. I got there about 9:30 and went right to the jewels.  There was me and about 10other people.  A staff had said that I had gotten there before the insanity had started.  i left around noon and the place was really filling up by then.
"April 22, 2008",Dissapointing,"Visiting the Tower of London I had high expectations, sadly I was left rather disappointed by the experience.Other than the exterior of the white tower, for me it lacks any feeling of real history. I was saddened to discover most of the surrounding towers were demolished and rebuilt in the 18th century. Walking around this historical attraction leaves you with a sense of being cheated as you only see a tiny amount of what is there, you are taken through many narrow passages, up steps then down again & so on with little to really look at on the way.The grounds of the tower are full of more recent buildings, its a total mish mash detracting from the historical white tower, some of the buildings even as recent as 1943? why ever was such a travesty allowed on such historical ground?The crown jewels were quite interesting especially queen victoria's crown. I also enjoyed looking at the display of Henry VIII's armoured clothing, although there was no information as to how this massive collection has survived?The most interesting part of the Tower of London for me, would have to be Traitors Gate. I would imagine its changed very little, although the steps from the water up to the bloody tower I have to say look relatively recent, as there appears to be no or very little wear to the steps.To see the best parts of the Tower of London observe from outside, you can get superb views of the white tower and also Traitors Gate without having to pay to go inside.I understood that no visit to London was complete without seeing this landmark, although I agree with this to an extent I feel the true identity of this landmark has been lost and if you want my opinion I would urge you to view from outside and leave the rest to your imagination."
"April 16, 2008","Seriously, A Must See!","When in London, you must not miss this incredible site! Full of history, original architecture, and the Crown Jewels, a visit here can sum up what London once was. Said by some to be one of the most haunted locations in England, visitors can quickly see why ghosts might choose to haunt this venue. You must do the tour with the Yeoman Warders--their stories are rich and their dedication to the Tower obvious. You will learn a great deal and have fun in the process. This destination is great for all ages, but as the buildings are original and quite old, handicapped accessibility is limited. Allow plenty of time to wander through the many buildings-there is much to see, and you will be enthralled! No trip to England is complete without a visit here!"
"March 31, 2008",England has history like no other city in the world,If you get the chance go & visit the Tower of London. Make sure you allow at least 2-3 hours for your visit. Pick up a map or a free tour with one of the attractions Beefeaters. Well worth a visit.
"January 3, 2008",Do NOT miss this,"Tons of fun.  Great for kids.  Lots of history, and the free guided tours are wonderful.  The tours are given by the Beefeaters who live in the tower.  This is one of my favorite places to visit."
"September 15, 2007",Awesome history right out of the Medieval ages,Worth getting there early no later than 10am as the lineups accumulate all day. Suggest buying tickets online in advance for better prices and no lineups getting them at the pre-order kiosk. Lineups for same day purchases were 3 lines of 30-40 deep. WE spent 6 hours there enjoying all we read. Need at least 3 hours if u appreciate and read the captions and info.  Crown jewels are impressive. Worth the price of admission.
"August 16, 2007",Must see for first timers,"Every time I go to London, we go here because we are with a first timer. This museum is a must but last I was there I remember it being WAY expensive...so if you are a student you MUST get one of the student passes that gives discounts."
"July 19, 2007","Amazing, but plan accordingly","It lived up to the hype. Too bad we went at the wrong time. By all means, AVOID the Tower of London on Sunday afternoons. The place was packed. The line to see the Crown Jewels was massive. Once we saw how long it was, we had to cut short our Beefeater tour just to wait in line. As a result, we missed out on some other places that were worth seeing like the White Tower and the Bloody Tower.The Crown Jewels were nice, but I'm not sure if it was worth the hour long wait.The highlight was definitely the Beefeater tour. Our guy was entertaining and downright hilarious with his awesome stories of the Tower of London's notorious history."
"April 10, 2007",History done right,"So happy we decided to purchase tickets to the Tower of London, the Master Yeoman tour was a true highlight, loads of information, history and execution tales - HAZZAR!! Surprised to learn the Master Yeoman still love on sight (not for the feint hearted - there’s lots of ghosts here). The Crown Jewels were beautiful and worth the short wait - make sure you pick your time though, by the time we exited there was a much longer queue to enter this exhibit. If you’re lucky you can catch the changing of the guard which was another highlight. In all a fabulous way to spend a few hours. Spring and summer visits include the beautiful flowers in the moat."
"September 13, 2009",Very enjoyable day,"We had the 9 o’clock time slot for our tour. This worked out very well because we beat the crowd. We saw the Crown jewels first, and then took the beefeater tour.  Our tour guide was very enjoyable, giving us a lot of history as well as humor. We did a lot of walking on uneven surfaces, which was difficult for my husband. Thankfully, there were places for him to sit as we went along."
"August 3, 2009","Fantastic, informative, very friendly staff in the shops. Made to feel very welcome ","Very informative tour by a chap called Nev, he had such a vast amount of knowledge and kept people's interest. We didn't get to see everything we wanted to due to time. Definitely worth the money. "
"July 28, 2009","Beefeaters, Ravens, and Jewels!!!","Home to the crown jewels, ravens, and the Beefeaters, the The Tower of London is an absolutely incredible place to visit, there is so much history to see, hear, and learn. Our tour began at the entrance, where a mote once filled the area, now it's a sunken field, that surrounds the castle, as our guide informed us, the mote connected to the Thames River. The field was used during the World Wars to house troops waiting to deploy. Our guide was one the Beefeaters, that guard the Tower of London, crown jewels, and ravens. He dressed in the traditional uniform, was a very informative, and even had a few decent jokes, he also told us that he was one the Beefeaters that walked in the funeral procession of the late Queen, an amazing tie in to our tour. Everywhere we went, our guide pointed out events that shape England, from monarchs that lived in the premises, to prisoners that were housed, and executed. There wasn't any queue for the crown jewels, we were able to walk in and see them in display, beautiful, intricate, and opulent, they don't allow any pictures to be taken. The Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula, is the resting place of three queens. The Tower of London is the residence of the Beefeater Guards, and their families, a fact I didn't know, until our guide mentioned it. Then there is the Tower Ravens, which were in their rooks, being cared for, there was an avian flu outbreak, and the guards wanted to keep them safe. Overall, I had an amazing experience, walking through The Tower of London, hearing the stories, legends, and history of this place really those make one appreciate the more. This is a must do for anyone visiting London."
"July 22, 2009",Absolutely Fabulous,"Absolutely  fabulous .. I went with my family and young Grandchildren. I had visited the Tower many many years ago and it really didn't disappoint.. We had an 11 am entry and thought we would have a long wait for the Crown Jewels, but we were so lucky and although we joined the queue we waited around 10 mins before getting in.We then went back to join the the next tour which is in my opinion is a 'must do' .. we had the amazing Andy Terry who was a wealth of information and held the audience with a mix of comedy too!Make sure you leave enough time to see it all 4-6 hours is what I would suggest.  It is quite costly with a large family but you can shop around for discounts, we used the 'lottery days out' vouchers through British Heritage.We are steeped in so much History and it is wonderful to see the Tourists in awe of what we are lucky to have here."
"June 26, 2009","One of the ""must do"" activities in London -","Definitely take the free tour!  The Warders are knowledgable, and funny!  The Tower is a ""must do"" for anyone visiting London for the first time.  The line-up to see the Crown Jewels appears very long, but the new system they have - it moves quickly!  There is SO much to see, and after you have heard the info - everything makes much more sense & is more interesting. "
"June 18, 2009",Must See When in London,I consider the Tower of London a must-see. The main attraction is the Crown Jewels but the history of the palace and the tower is fascinating as well.
"May 26, 2009",Crown Jewels Did Not Disappoint!,I had always wanted to visit the Tower of London and was thrilled when I had an extra day to do so. My main objective was to see the Crown Jewels and I was not disappointed!  What a fabulous venue to be immersed in history.
"May 20, 2009",Must See-Allow 3 hrs.+,"I last visited Tower of London in 1970. Vastly updated with enhanced visitor opportunities and greater access since then. The self-guided aspects are A+, extremely informative; begin with the Beefeater tour First,as orientation. Staff in period costumes stay in character so one feels immersed in the historic period. Do not stop your visit with a quick trip to the Crown Jewels! Take advantage of everything!Clean, safe, and fantastic in very way."
"March 4, 2009",Highlight of our London visit!,"Our entire family found our tour of the Tower of London to be one of the highlights of our visit to the city this summer. So much incredible history.We booked our tickets in advance on-line and made sure to arrive on time for the Yeoman tour, which made all the difference. Our beefeater was very knowledgeable, funny and entertaining. The entire visit took more than 3 hours and frankly we could have stayed much longer, exploring the various chambers and taking in the spontaneous ""plays"" recreating past events.Don't visit London without visiting the Tower!"
"February 27, 2009",Interesting & Macabre Bit of History,"Purchasing and using the tickets through Tripadvisor went smoothly. They just scanned the code at the entrance. We went on a rainy Saturday morning around 9:30-10 and were concerned when we saw lines formed, but it turned out to be mostly tour groups so we walked right in with our tickets. The yeoman tour was very entertaining-highly recommended! We hit the crown jewels right after which was busy but we were still able to get up to the cases to see the exhibits, maybe waiting a minute for someone else to move on at each spot. A significant line formed at the jewels by the time we exited which was after 10am. The white tower, bloody tower, and torture tower were also interesting if not a bit macabre. My 12 and 15 year olds found the experience interesting enough and maybe even soaked in a bit of history! We spent a little over 2 hours but you could easily spend more if you do the audio tours and read all the plaques, which my kids did not have the patience/energy to do."
"August 31, 2023","Amazing tour by Beefeater Mark, lines go faster than they look!","We had an awesome visit to the Tower, and it sure didn't hurt that it was a gorgeous summer day. Our Beefeater Tour was given by Mark who was clearly concerned about whether we would say nice things about him on TripAdvisor. He needn't have fretted; for a decorated military man, he nevertheless nearly missed his calling as a raconteur and comedian. Clearly a well-chosen Yeoman Warder and an absolute treat for us to lead off our visit.Since it was hot and sunny and our kids are young, we groaned a little when we saw the line for the Crown Jewels exhibit stretching all the way down the hill; we joined the line back by the Cafe entrance. Shortly after we got in line, it got moving quite fast. At one point we passed a sign stating 20 minutes from that point to the jewels, and it was barely ten minutes; by 20 minutes, we were well into the jewels exhibit. This was our experience throughout the visit; while it was indeed crowded, all of the lines moved quite well and we didn't wait a long time to visit any of the buildings or exhibits, use restrooms, purchase meals or snacks, etc. Also they don't actively manage the size of the tour groups; the Beefeaters somehow manage to do their thing with whatever size mob shows up and follows them around, and yet - it works.For us, there was so much to see and do at the Tower that we spent most of the day there. Glad we didn't buy a London Pass because it seems tor really get your money's worth out of it, you have to make it to 2-3 of the attractions each day. I definitely feel like we got a good value and then some with our Tower of London standalone tickets and would not have liked feeling rushed to get on to the next London Pass site."
"August 30, 2023",Great way to get some English history.,"Such history in this little place.  Be sure to go on the Beefeater tour to get the big overview.  Very good story tellers.  After the overview, take a deeper dive into the White Castle and other interesting spots.  You can easily spend half a day here.  There really is no way to see the Royal Jewels unless you go first thing when the doors open.  By noon, the line to enter see the jewels is just too much."
"August 30, 2023",Terrible experience,"There were so many people blocking everything, you can’t see any signs so I didn’t know pictures weren’t allowed. I took my phone out and got a five minute lecture about how i was told THOUSANDS of times about it. Not a single person told me on my way in. Sorry your colleagues don’t take your job as seriously as you, crazy lady! I wasn’t arguing and immediately put my phone away but she felt this offputting lecture was necessary. I get you hate your job and life, but don’t take it out on people who are here for the first time and don’t know every one of your royal rules. God forbid someone photograph your pillaged jewels, colonizers!! "
"August 28, 2023",Amazing - Go There Early!,"I definitely recommend getting tickets and going before 10 am - the battlements are a treat, the ravens are quite chatty and the staff are very knowledgable! Plenty of places to rest and people watch as well as soak up history."
"August 27, 2023","Beautiful, but not quick","Tower of London was not at all what I expected.  Not sure why, but I expected a tower, not an entire complex of buildings, towers, castle, complete with a moat (now filled with flowers).  If you go, go early and head straight for the Crown Jewels as the line gets super long.  Don’t expect to see every crown jewel, just a large sampling.  Then go take the Beefeater tour, back at the main gate.  This tour is fantastic and gives you so much history. From there, you can take your time and explore the various buildings. Keep an eye out for the Ravens who guard."
"August 26, 2023",A fascinating place but beware of the crowds,"The Tower of London is an iconic tourist attraction and the tourists flock here in such vast numbers that it can be a trying day out to enjoy this historic site. Take the Underground to Tower Hill station and it is only a short walk away. I strongly recommend arriving before the opening at 9:00 as the queue was already about 200m long to enter when we arrived shortly thereafter. As soon as you get in, make haste to go straight to the Crown Jewels exhibit and don’t even think about looking at anything else. If you head straight there the queue is very short but leave it too long and the line up becomes out of control. There will be plenty of time later to back track and explore the other parts of the site. The Yeoman’s tours are well worth the time and leave every 30 mins. You will get a colourful and humorous presentation of the historic site, including details you otherwise would not ever know about. In my opinion, avoid the tour that departs at 10:00 because it is far too crowded. Other later tours were much less so. After visiting the site, take a walk over the nearby Tower Bridge and up the right to the Borough Markets for lunch. They have an amazing array of food to choose from."
"August 25, 2023",Ripped off.  ROYALLY. ,"Seriously? Most of the Crown Jewels were gone for the Coronation. I'm an American.  Didn't even know that the king thing was happening when I bought the tickets while still in US. Bought tickets for today 2 weeks ago. LAST NIGHT we got a message telling us, ""oops. What you paid to see is gone. "" Nice."
"August 14, 2023",Tower of London Insight,"I really enjoyed seeing the Crown Jewels and our self guided tour of the various buildings throughout the Tower of London.  There was a lot of confusion on the location of the “tour” and once we found it, it was so crowded that we didn’t want to participate. I would suggest getting there early and going straight to see the Crown Jewels before visiting any other site.  Tours don’t starts until 10 am."
"August 11, 2023",Overcrowded and limited information,Absolutely poor experience. Numbers of visitors are so poorly managed that be prepared to queue to see Crown Jewels for over an hour and to struggle to see exhibits due to people standing in way and bumping into you. Profits before experience come to mind. Shame as I love history and really wanted to enjoy this place. Info boards were pretty basic. I expected more.
"July 29, 2023",Towered over London.,"Such a great place to visit. The history, the stories and the jewels. I would advise you to do the Beefeater tour, which meets right at the front gate. With them, you'll learn about the Tower and get into a chapel that you won't be able to get into without them. Seeing the jewels is nice too, there are a few videos on loop playing about the royals, but not being a fan of the royals i skip this. Look out for the HUGE gold and jewel encrusted punch bowl, you could bath baby twins in there!"
"July 28, 2023",not worth it!,"My sister and i were verrrrry disappointed with this experience.  It was incredibly expensive and not nearly as interesting as we had hoped it would be.  Most of the rooms were nearly bare!  Admittedly, the crown jewels and such were interesting but after only a few minutes we left and enjoyed touring the grounds far more than the tower itself.  Not an attraction i would ever visit again ."
"June 23, 2023","Historically Significant, must see","We got to the Tower of London in the morning on a wednesday in Sept 06, and it was not overcrowded.  When we were leaving that afternoon, it was filling up quickly, so go early if possible.This is truly and amazing place to visit, and the history of the complex is fascinating. I'm a history buff,  and I had read about the tower a lot over the years. I think knowing the history of the place as well as all the significant eventsthat took place here enhanced the experience for me.  Its a must see."
"June 5, 2023",Tower of London was great!,Went there a couple years ago.  The Royal Jewels were beautiful!  Everything was so spectacular and interesting.  The tour guide was great.  I would recommend this to anyone.  What a great learning experience.
"June 1, 2023",The dream came true,I wasn’t able to take my eyes off of such a wonderful picture of an untouched history… I’ve always dreamt of arriving in London and once I’m here I couldn’t help but see the beauty of this city.
"May 31, 2023",Solo London Trip,Fantastic!! I lucked out and one of the beefeater tours was starting right away. Fantastic guide and overview of everything in the tower.  Give yourself plenty of time! I unfortunately went the same day I was flying home and had to leave before I saw everything.  I was there 3 hours and didn't get to take everything in.  Really interesting place with lots to see. 
"May 28, 2023",Fun packed afternoon,"It was the kids first time to the Tower of London and they enjoyed every moment of it! All members of staff where very welcoming, friendly and knowledgable and where always on hand to assist. I won’t bore you with everything you can see and do but there is plenty to experience. Kids enjoyed the Crown Jewels and the Ravens!"
"May 19, 2023",Yeoman Warder tour with Scott Kelly hashtag Beefy409 ,Had a real honour and privilege to be able to get onto the 1pm Yeoman Warder tour with none other than Scott Kelly aka Beefy409 on Friday 1st September 2023.Such a really great tour. Full of history  executions blood sweat and tears. I would highly recommend a Yeoman Warder tour as its included with your entry fee ticket. Thank you Scott once again 
"May 5, 2023",Great day at The Tower of London.,"We visited the Tower as a birthday experience for my wife.Pre-booked tickets meant that we just walked in.We joined the Beefeater tour led by Beefy409. He was magnificent. Much humour, appealing to all ages in the audience. We and our Granddaughters learned a great deal of the history of the building and its occupants. They loved the gruesome bits!My wife received first aid treatment for a wasp sting and we were given VIP treatment by Jenny in The White Tower.So much to see and enjoy. The sites of execution were particularly poignant.All of the staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful. The restaurant food was appreciated and reasonably priced.Do visit. It's a treat."
"April 18, 2023",The BEST day,"What an amazing day!!I cannot put into words how special the beefeaters made the day, they were absolutely amazing, the tours were hilarious but also so interesting and educational. I had such a great day! Thank you all for your efforts. Only thing I will say is get there early to spend the whole day, we arrived at 12pm and didn’t leave until 5.30 (closing time) and I felt I could have spent a lot more time there.Everything about this place is wonderful!
