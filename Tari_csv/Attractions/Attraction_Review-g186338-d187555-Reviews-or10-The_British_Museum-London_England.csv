"Written February 21, 2020","Operational reasons, huh?","So your website tells me that today I could have seen a free exhibition of prints and lucky me it’s Friday so the museum is open till 8.30 pm. After making my way through completely over complicated and unnecessary amounts of zigzagging Disneyland style queuing barriers, I arrive inside and head for said exhibition. It’s 5.40 pm and the doors are locked shut at Room 90. Countless other people are ascending the stairs to said room. But no. Locked. Signage? No. Barrier? No. Log in for your free WiFi to check your website because obviously I’ve missed something. No. Staff member? No. Descend to Room 24 where two staff members are having a laugh. I mean literally. Ask them if the exhibition closes at an earlier time. Well they’re not sure but sometimes it closes early for ‘operational reasons ‘ (this exhibition opened yesterday...what you mean is you don’t have the staff - could be a Brexit issue? Just sayin’.....)and perhaps I could ring to check first. Sorry, what? But it will be open tomorrow. Yes that’s great as I don’t live in London and had made a special journey based on your website information. Oh well, better make the most of....the rather uncomfortable feeling I got walking round the extraordinary exhibits which, and I quote a guide I passed, are British because they were paid for by British people. Casts a new light on the formerly named Elgin marbles, doesn’t it now? No, I’m not finished yet. I just need to mention the ladies loos downstairs under the Great Court. Sorry, but what person designed soap dispensers so far from the edge of the hand basin that you need to practically mount said hand basin to reach them? There, I’m done now. Thanks for all that."
"Written January 27, 2020",Troy Exhibition British Museum,"We visited Troy in Turkey in 2018 and also went to the museums in Athens and Istanbul, where many of the artefacts are held.  The exhibition at the British Museum Troy: Myth and Reality was a huge let down and made even more disappointing by having to pay £20 each to see the exhibition.  We went on Sunday 26th January and it was very crowded and nearly impossible to look at the exhibits without someone pushing in front of you (not the BM’s fault, though they could restrict number) but the layout of the exhibition didn’t help with circulation.  In comparison to what we saw in Athens and Istanbul it was very disappointing and certainly not worth the cost of entry!"
"Written February 22, 2020",Impressive grand building - Very London but bigger than most !,"Zig zag queuing barriers put out prematurely when no queues evident.Walking 20 times further to the entrance than necessary is unwelcome when you already walk so much in London. Free entry, but after obligatory bag search there is a bank of manned donation desks where there is an unwelcome 'hard sell' to donate. I would have anyway, but felt pressurised to do so before i'd even entered the museum. Anyway, rant over, once inside, this is clearly a place that warrants multiple visits if you can. Its huge, and just so much to see, although we found some of the artefacts lit so that there was too much reflection on the glass cabinets, making it tricky to read the descriptions and history of the item. Bigger print would be beneficial. As there is soooo much to see, i'd recommend checking out the website prior to visiting and selecting what areas of exhibits particularly interest you and concentrate on those floors.  All in all, its not just one of London's GREATEST attractions, it's a World Class attraction."
"Written July 5, 2021",Disappointing and Overpriced,"We came to see the Thomas Becket exhibition as we're both hugely interested in Medieval history..Less than an hour later we emerged feeling very underwhelmed, although there are some nice items on display the exhibition is far too short and the accompanying book way overpriced, oh and forget social distancing as soon as you get in.The exterior gates aren't open until 10am, so we were kept waiting as the queue grew, instead of starting at the security point, would have less impact on our booking time that way.I love the British Museum but this offering sadly didn't live up to the hype or expectations, the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library was much better value."
"Written January 13, 2020",Serene Sunday...,I visited on a Sunday afternoon around 2 pm in January. The museum did not close until 5:30pm. It was great that I could walk around the museum without huge crowds. I was able to go to every exhibit and look at it without crowds. Although the museum entry is free I did pay £6 for the audio guide. I thought this guide was excellent. Not only was it informative about the exhibits but it also helped me to find my way around the museum from room to room and level to level. It has a number of cafés offering cream teas and also a restaurant.
"Written January 19, 2020",Never disappoints,"This was my second time at the British Museum, and I intend to go back this week since the special exhibitions are cheaper during the week.The collection is so vast, it’s impossible to see and absorb it all. Last time I had been visiting with three young children so we only did Egyptian statues and Mummies. This time I was also able to see the Library celebrating the Age of Enlightenment with all the curiosities collected. Later will return to see the special exhibit on Troy.I highly recommend a visit here every time you are in London."
"Written January 4, 2020",Ancient Egypt room is missing Horus,I always love visiting the ancient Egyptian room. The British museum is always worth It for that alone ..but a big disappointment that there is a Huge stone Horus statue now gone missing from the excellent display . It's probably too priceless & needs to be kept away from a worshipping public that want to touch it rather than just look. But I really wish they would bring it back .. even under glass. I miss the god Horus a lot & nobody could tell me when or if it will return
"Written February 18, 2020",One of the best museums I have been in,"Its one of the largest and most interesting museum in the world. There are exhibits of ancient cultures from across the world and endless amounts of treasures. I recommend spending the entire day here, but even if you had a month you couldn't explore everything here. When I went to this place, they had a manga and anime exhibit which was super awesome because you can see the works of famous authors. Honestly can't recommend this place enough, its a must visit if you visit London."
"Written February 23, 2020","Huge, long lines for security check and 2 pounds for a map","It takes about 10 minutes in line to get checked, and it’s always crowded. It’s annoying to have to pay 2 pounds for a map. Clearly it has amazing exhibitions but download a map prior and focus on a few exhibits to get the most as it could take days."
"Written September 3, 2021",What a joke,"Like many London museums you have to book a time slot on a particular day. They didn’t have tickets on our preferred day and we set out really early on our confirmed day so we weren’t late, fearing being turned away.  What a surprise we weren’t asked to show our prebooked tickets at any stage and we definitely didn’t sneak in.  As for the museum, in light they are not doing tours at the moment, would recommend buying a guide book if you want to take full advantage of your visit. We didn’t, and although we spent a couple of hours there and saw lots of lovely interesting pieces, suspect we missed some must see artefacts. The other observation is that there is little British history at this museum, and probably explains why there were a significant number of Far East and Middle East/North Africa visitors on the day we visited, albeit I wondered how with the Covid restrictions they were here in significant numbers"
"Written April 16, 2020",Great museum!,"This museum was the largest I have ever been to, I got lost a couple times. ;pThere were also a lot of exhibits to check out! It was great to check out all the exhibits and learn a bit about London's history. There is a fee for audio guides and for the featured exhibit.  When I went to this museum, it very crowded and there is also no map provided but the place does have free wifi, so perhaps it was provided online?Otherwise, I had a good time."
"Written January 25, 2020",A must to see,My travel guide said the side entrance would be shorter but it was closed so had no choice but to use the front. Arrived just after 10am when it opened on a Wednesday. Very short queue to get in through security which is outside the museum. As I had no bag was waved through which helped. There were a number of school parties and coaches arriving so glad I came early.The museum is so large and varied that it is not possible to see everything in one visit.I wanted to see The Rosetta Stone which unfortunately was one of the first exhibits and although there was no real queue to get in the museum there were a large number of people in front of the exhibit taking photos and in the end I gave up trying to get to the front. Would have been better if it had been further in the museum so crowds would have spread out. My next exhibit I wanted to see was The Elgin Marbles which were in a room at the back of the ground floor and when I got there the room was nearly empty...making my point about the siting of the previous exhibit.I also wanted to see exhibits on the first floor which again didn’t have big crowds as it was still early. Had a coffee downstairs before I left.Next time I am in London I will visit again to see other things. The museum is free although donations are appreciated 
"Written March 8, 2022",Weekend museum visit,"On visiting the website prior to visiting, it suggested we needed to book tickets and we did, however on arriving the tickets were not checked at all, so I am not sure if this is still necessary. Tickets to special exhibitions are definitely needed, but I felt pricey. Lots to see in the museum and something for everyone. There were some collections that didn’t interest me, but others that I thought were very interesting. I especially like the watches and clocks. There is a lovely Japanese restaurant nearby, called Cocoro and I would recommend eating here if visiting the museum as it is only a few minutes walk away."
"Written September 16, 2020",Totally worth a visit. ,"My wife and I had been looking at. Museums to visit during our three days in London.  I booked online which was easy and straight forward, it is free but we did make a donation. Don't worry because there are plenty of places to make donations at the museum. We showed up on time flashed our passes and jumped the queue, which I have to say was really great. The museum is amazing and the pieces of history there are simply breathtaking.  It was busy there and everyone was wearing a mask,  some people would adhere to social distancing and others would not. There is a little cafe area half way through to purchase hot drinks and a little bite to eat. It is aroubd £3.00 for a cup of tea and more for a coffee.. Baguettes were priced £5 and over. Allow yourself a minimum of two hours to walk around."
"Written January 6, 2020",Incredible exhibits ,I would highly recommend a visit to The British Museum it has an extensive range of exhibits from all around the world. Descriptions and information are clear and informative. Picking up map is a must so that you don’t miss out on anything! There is more than history too there are art exhibits and extra installations which change periodically. You may need a full day or more! 
"Written January 3, 2020",Very long wait at the entrance,"It took me twenty minutes to get into the British Museum yesterday.  There was a long queue and only one security guard on my side checking bags, who didn't even grunt when I handed him my rucksack.  I wondered why there was a woman beside him doing nothing, and another four at the top, also not checking bags.  It was only when I was asked to go to counter 2 that they asked me for a donation.  Given that I'd spent 20 minutes in the cold, waiting to have my bag searched, by a woefully under-resourced, and rude, security guard, I didn't feel like contributing.  If they'd also been checking bags, my waiting time would have been substantially less.  It gives a very bad impression of what is one of the best museums in the world. I live in London and come often.  My friend was inside with my ticket for the Troy exhibition and I was always buy food and a drink when I visit.  I support the British Museum, and have never objected to doing so until yesterday. I think that you have to review your security procedures."
"Written February 28, 2020",A MUST SEE!,The British Museum is a gem of history.  Don't be daunted by the line to get into the museum.  I almost vaulted but I stayed the course.  Who know when I will be back in London? The line moved along quickly. The museum is free but there are many stations situated for you to donate £5.  Wear comfortable shoes there is a lot of standing and walking.  So much to see and do!
"Written October 2, 2021",Give yourself plenty of time,"Its free but booking a time slot at busy times might give you quicker entry. It was quiet when I went and other than a bag check I was in within five minutes. The size of the collections is immense and you start by wondering where to start top to bottom right to left, then you enter each section and either walk around and on to the next or walk left to right, then do you go from the furthest time to the present. It's all choice and looking at each exhibit and taking a small part in will take a minimum of two hours. It's more of a collection of artefacts picked up from when Britain had an empire when collectors and archaeologists could dig or pick up and bring back almost anything they liked. You do wonder after a while ''How did they take so much from the poorer less developed areas of the World '' and could it be done today? The ''British'' part is interesting and the story can be seen in many regional British Museums. The Museum is dominated by the earliest cultures that our own western ones would have developed from such as  early Egyptian, Roman & Greek civilisations. I can't see a part of the planet that hasn't been covered. You cannot fail to learn something from a visit and if you wanted to go in-depth into an era then you will need plenty of hours planned and possibly day's to do it justice. If you're local to London then as it's free and Public transport frequent then you could go whenever. Its heavy on the feet if you intend seeing the lot and keeping kids interested might be a challenge, the Mummies might fascinate or scare them. it's warm inside due to the glass roof but it's cooler in some rooms that have large fans to stand by.Gift shop is too full of irrelevant items that can be bought anywhere and have nothing to do with the museum there's a few London gifts like Taxis and Bus models.I'd prefer more Museum specific based gifts .Cafe's looked and expensive £3 for tea, with not more choice than a Train Station Newsagent would sell, Crisps and pre-packed Sandwiches it wasn't busy but was short staffed the queues added price were slow enough to avoid."
"Written April 10, 2020",Incredible,"You could spend a lifetime here and never fully appreciate all the treasures.  Plan on at least half a day (minimum) to see the highlights.  If you are traveling with children, you can check your coats/bags free of charge in the family cloakroom.  We also used the object-based tours available on their website - as a type of scavenger hunt through the museum."
"Written November 20, 2021",Really impressive museum - and it is free,"A really impressive museum - well laid out, absolutely full of artefacts, everything is very well explained, and efficiently organised.  The museum is free, although booking is advised (just so they can smooth numbers throughout the day I think).  Well worth a visit if you are in London."
"Written April 2, 2023",World cultural icon badly let down by poor entrance experience,"We booked a 90min spotlight tour and arrived 15min before the scheduled 11:30am yesterday. Upon arrival we were confronted with three different queues, two of which were long snaking ones marked “All Visitors” and “Timed Entry Tickets”.Anxious to arrive on time for the tour, we approach the usher to enquire about the location of the meeting spot for the tour. With complete indifference and a miserable attitude, she pointed towards the “All visitors” queue with a sweeping gesture. We stood in the queue for a few minutes and unconvinced  that she has even given any consideration to our question, we switched over to the “timed entry ticket” queue which to us made a bit more sense. Having committed without conviction that we are in right queue and resigned that we might actually missed our tour, we arrived finally at the bag check area to find to our consternation that the TWO queues which have caused much confusion at the entrance MERGED INTO ONE anyway! I have to state that this bewilderment was shared by many frustrated visitors in the queue.It is very disappointing that a world cultural icon like the British museum which receives over six million people around the world annually is not able to put in place a more sensible queue system and a polite welcome that the Brits are famous for."
"Written August 29, 2020",Museum you MUST visit,"British Museum needs no introduction. Certainly one of the best attractions in London and a must-see for everyone. Basically, one can describe the British Museum as a museum of the history of mankind. The expositions show artefacts from different parts of the world (Europe, Asia, Africa, America) and different times (large part from the ancient time, but also from middle-ages or even XVIII century) and have no weak point. And if we're talking about the exhibitions, especially impressive are those with items from ancient Egypt, Rome and Mesopotamia. The artefacts from medieval Europe and pre-Columbian America are another part worth seeing.  Honestly, I could mention every part of the museum here. Simply, go and see yourself (and be prepared to spend there entire day)."
"Written January 8, 2020",Busy but thrilling,"What can you do except wish you had more time at this place! Loved the huge indigenous peoples exhibit, the large libraries full of Greek sculptures and the beautiful Chinese vases, tapestries and artifacts. It’s a stunning amount of stories to take in. The cafes have a few decent vegan snacks and good teas. The gift shops are also quite fun! Bonus - staff were quite friendly! Plan your visit, give yourself time to make your way through the crowds and enjoy the experience."
"Written February 28, 2020",Well worth the visit,I had always wanted to see the British Museum and on our recent trip to London we made a point of visiting. The exhibits are all arranged very well and we enjoyed the time very much. The highlights were the Rosetta Stone and the Platypus. You can actually see the marks where they tried to pry the beak off when it was first sent from Australia.
"Written June 9, 2023",Good 1-2 hour activity,"Interesting museum! The Egypt exhibits were the most interesting and are a must see. It’s nice that the museum is free, but do not bring kids if you don’t like constant complaining and want to stay for longer than an hour!! It’s also pretty crowded, but there are always some less crowded rooms. "
"Written February 22, 2020",A place to visit ,"Wonderful experience...Hundreds of people visiting one of the most well known Museums in the world. A huge journey in the history, life, culture and civilisation of so many countries in the world. Surely a memorable destination. "
"Written October 17, 2022",Brilliant Location and Superb Building,"We came here to attend an evening function downstairs at The British Museum held by the British Horror Film Academy Festival. What a truly superb venue and such an excellent atmosphere. The all-ticket event was incredible, and the capacity audience watched 5 short horror films followed by the feature horror film ""Feed Me"". All the films were just simply brilliant, and we loved them all. At the end of the evening, they did all the annual awards ceremony and the film ""Feed Me"" took 5 awards which was truly amazing including our son who took the Best Actor Award for 2022. We would highly recommend a visit to this excellent location and would encourage others to consider using the wonderful facilities and screen area within."
"Written June 9, 2022",Stonehenge exhibition,"Stonehenge exhibition.  Enormous security queues at front entrance can be mitigated  by the, thankfully,  poorly patronised entry at rear. The Museum's Stonehenge exhibition was up to its usual exceptional standards. Excellent presentation, displays and information about some wonderful objects. It was rather dark and at times this hampered mildly (reading). Don't go thinking this is about a stone circle. Its about giving context to the structure in terms of the peoples connected with its times. In a way the circle is a minor part of the overall thrust and production. I spent nearly two hours absorbed by its excellence."
"Written August 26, 2023",Arrive early,"This is a huge place and you need to get here early in order to have a decent visit there are always many groups here from all over the world who have already prebooked. There is a good shop across the road which sells souvenirs where you can leave your baggage for a small price, I paid 8 pounds and you can leave it there until 6 PM on that day it's best to leave your luggage there as you cannot take it into the British museum any longer. There are huge rooms upon rooms and floors upon floors with many different world culture that are artifacts on display despite the ones that have gone missing recently and have been in the news. This place has so much that it does not even keep know what's gone missing. The Japanese artifacts on one of the top floors are always fantastic to see as are all the sculptures the wonderful glass ceiling with its design is always a tourist attraction in itself. The merchandise here is very expensive so I would suggest you pick 1 or 2 things that you like and buy just those otherwise there are many cafes and smaller restaurants within the museum where you can get something to eat but the feeding is quite spouse and the place is so busy that it's hard to get a table. You can easily spend the whole day here."
"Written August 25, 2022",So much to see,"On arrival we joined the queue outside. It was very fast moving. Once on the grounds we were steered away from the queue and ushered straight through (my sister uses a walking stick). It was very helpful of them. You need a significant amount of time, the museum is huge with a significant number of displays. We visited one of the coffee shops. At the time the card reader had gone down. They were very apologetic and advised people of alternative places to pay. As is standard, there was a long queue at the ladies toilets. But, they are dotted throughout the museum. Maps are £2 or you can download them from the website. There are plenty of boards around too, to tell you which way to go. It’s well worth a visit and it’s completely free. You can, of course, leave a donation."
"Written February 12, 2020",Top London attraction,"This massive museum offers much to learn, you would need days and days to see most of it. It has impressive ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece and Asian cultures collections. If you're visiting London and if you're interested in history at all it's definitely a must see."
"Written January 3, 2020",The Quintessential British Museum,"Nearly everyone has heard of the British Museum and with good reason.  The collections are absolutely amazing.  This is the home of the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, and one of the best collections of Egyptian artifacts outside Egypt.(Controvery over whether Britain should be the custodian of these things aside.)But that is only the beginning.  There are artifacts from all over the world: an amazing collection of Greek and Etruscan terracotta objects, Roman glass, the Sutton Hoo treasure, some of the most famous Maya stellae, beautiful torquoise mosaic objects of the Aztec culture; sections devoted to China, Japan, and the South Pacific.  A serindipity of German ""notgeld"".  And much more!One of the most wonderful areas is King George Library, the ""Enlightenment Room"": one could spend an entire day just there!That being said, one has to be prepared for crowds, particularly at popular exhibits like the Egyptian artifacts and King George Library.  During the week there are numerous school groups clogging these areas and multiple tours in a variety of languages.  One has to be patient: go see something 'unpopular' at peak times and try the popular things later.  We actually saw the Rosetta Stone at one point with not another soul around.  It helps to have several hours to devote here."
"Written February 17, 2020",Troy exhibition,"I was a bit apprehensive about taking my partner and friend to see the exhibition. I was educated with regards to classical Greece and have read the Iliad and Odyssey. They had little prior knowledge of either. However they thoroughly enjoyed it and were probably did so more than me as it was all so new to them. On one of the worst days of the year so far, we happily spent 7 hours in the museum and were quite disappointed when closing time came."
"Written January 19, 2020",Decided to meet up with family in the restaurant on the third floor,We decided to meet up with 4 of my wife's cousin who we hadn't seen for over 10 yeas and the British museum was a great choice. We eat in the third floor circle restaurant and what a great choice. The food and service was First Class so would'nt hesitate to recommend.
"Written January 17, 2020",What a superb place - and the best attraction catering in London!,"The museum itself is incredible. The architecture, exhibits and interpretation all superb. And so spacious it never feels crowded. However, with a dd who can't have  dairy or soy, eating out is tough. This was the first and only place of many we visited that properly understood, catered with something delicious, and didn't make her sick. Both the pizzeria and the courtyard cafe were superb, and the pizzeria's food was both the tastiest, and the cheapest wholesome, healthy and delicious meal we've had in our time in London. Troy exhibition was also superb. Can't wait to return."
"Written October 2, 2020",4000BC and all that,Good to see that the British Museum has reopened after the Covid19 lockdown.  You need to pre book a ticket-easy as website works smoothlyTake care to arrive at the allocated time- then entry is smooth and easy. Only the ground floor open and a signposted route to follow. It makes one reflect on current pandemic challenges when faced with the statues from Egypt dating back to 4000 BC.  The details given are worth reading.  Also before visiting the Museum worth taking time to follow one of the British Museum video tours shown on YouTube.  The curators are expert at explaining the pieces  and giving relevant background.The whole tour is in line with best Covid guidelinesIt takes about 2-3 hours to complete.
"Written February 9, 2020",Huge Museum but non is related to British History !!??,"it's a bite weird that all things in the museum were history of other countries (e.g. China, Egypt...etc) but non of them is related to British!!   Anyways, Museum is huge, it may takes you 4-5 hours to go through everything if you are interested.  Be spare more time when you are going to British Museum"
"Written August 11, 2021",Great museum,We visited the museum on a Sunday afternoon in August and although we booked online we had to queue which seemed daft. You have your bags checked and wheeled luggage isn't permitted into the museum. The museum is huge and so impressive from the moment you step in. You could spend the day here and still not see everything. We only visited the general exhibitions but there are other exhibits which you can pay for.
"Written June 18, 2022",Fantastic afternoon tea in the grand court,Had a wonderful afternoon tea plus Prosecco at the Grand Court with my friends. The sandwiches were fresh and quite filling. We didn’t manage to finish all the desserts.Very relaxed atmosphere and friendly service.Recommend booking beforehand- we booked just two days beforehand for Saturday at 1 pm.It was reasonably priced.
"Written February 15, 2020",One of London’s Treasures,"The British museum is a must see when you are in London. We visited on the weekend, while there was an Achilles exhibit that was being challenged. Demonstrators were everywhere in the museum to boycott BP who was sponsoring the exhibit. Was able to see the Rosetta Stone, which was a big reason we went to the museum. Overall, it was a great experience and truly enlightening to see everything that was showcased in the British Museum."
"Written January 9, 2020",Troy: Myth and Reality Exhibition,"As the blurb says: the legend of Troy has endured for more than 3,000 years. The exhibition explores Greek and Asian artifacts gathered during the several site excavations and artworks contemporary of the times. It is well laid out and documented, with Homer’s Iliad being the narrative theme. Quite apart from the story of a great city, plunged into a 10-year, the sculptures, paintings, pots and other stunning artifacts are amazing. The incredible Filippo Albacini sculpure, The Wounded Achilles, is worth the entrance fee alone."
"Written December 2, 2022","No, thank you.","No clear road to go there from Russell Square (one single board).  Just a little slate to say where the entrance is. Museum's free but it's better to have ""timed tickets"" so we made a reservation. We arrived at the opening and still had to queue under the heavy rain, on the sidewalk, the whole street long for 20 minutes. After that, we could finally go inside the museum's courtyard,  still under the heavy rain, (to wait 20-30 minutes again) to reach a marquee where our bags are checked. Then, back to the heavy rain again to walk to the ""museum's real entrance"". Couldn't the museum put on our reservation ""Warning, there will be a queue outside for security, please dress accordingly""? No tickets' checking, wonder why we took them???Lots of jewellery within the museum as many statues. The museum is worldwilde known so we had lots of expectations. Seems we had too many.The rooms' names are put on a little board put at the top right, written in a small font. Difficult to read from afar, even more if you're small. And the rooms don't have a logic. You'll pass from one to another without a direct link between them.Our visit wasn't enjoyable because of the numerous classes of students. They didn't listen to their teachers and used showcases as desk to write. They were very loud and also ran all along the museum. They also took a whole space for themselves. One or two classes is enough. Why so many? We couldn't even hear one another because of them, even though we were side by side. We also couldn't see all the items exposed because of them (showcases blinded by paper & notebooks).  The little corridors between the showcases were blocked by them so there are parts of the museum we couldn't get access to (even though we asked them to move). And they were there a lot of time, we left before they did!Shops are all over the place, felt like too many stores for one museum. The one we visited was small, the goods sold there didn't have a lot in common with the museum (""tobelerone british museum"" ok, but why  selling ""Harry Potter Wand"" from Running Press, for example). Their variety is very small. And most stuff were pricey... From our visit, we only recommend looking at the ""clocks room"", where we saw some clocks we haven't seen before, the greek temple's recreation, and that's basically it. Note: we didn't go to the exhibitions you can get access to, after paying entrance for it.We don't know if we had set our expectations too high, but it's the first time ever that we've been that disappointed after visiting a museum...."
"Written February 2, 2020",Plan  to spend most of the day,"I really love this musuem ive been 2x and still havent seen everything.If you can i recommend joining a few of the free tours offered in certain sections, the times are posted when you enter. its really interesting to not just see a sculpture and ceramic and admire, but to learn the history and culture of the time it was made."
"Written January 24, 2020",So much stuff but only a handful of truly amazing things,Walking through the museum you sort of get the impression that back in the day the British Museum would pay anyone and everyone for anything they could prize from its location and carry back with them from wherever it came from. There's just so much stuff and most of it is pretty similar. Sometimes you get the impression that Egypt especially must be pretty short of ancient artifacts because they are all in the British Museum. That being said the Rosetta Stone was wonderful to see and some of the Roman Statues and Greek things are pretty special.I would recommend but i'd probably point people towards the Natural History Museum as its just better.
"Written February 4, 2020",Iconic collection of ancient treasures,"My first visit to this fabulous museum and it was definitely worth the wait.We arrived early at opening time and entered (for free!) quickly without having to queue. The place filled up very quickly after we arrived and by the time we left, the queues were out of the main gates so it’s definitely worth beating the rush.We spent hours wandering around the 90+(?) galleries of artefacts from around the world covering all of the major cultures and races from throughout history.Many of the exhibits were truly iconic and were instantly recognisable from all of the books and tv we’ve seen over the years - it was amazing to see them up close in real life. Some, such as the rosetta stone were real stars and attracted crowds of viewers whilst other “minor” exhibits weren’t as obvious but were fascinating to read about.An inspiring visit with a huge amount to see. We thought we’d seen everything but spotted several areas in the guide afterwards which we’d completely missed so there’s still more to see next time."
"Written February 28, 2020",Incredible Exhibits,"I visited on a clear, warm, sunny weekday in January. It was almost a shame to be inside rather than outside enjoying the rare weather. I arrived at about opening time and there was not a long queue or wait to get through the security checkpoint and “ticket” counter where they ask if you would like to make a donation. I only had a few hours and wanted to look at some of the ancient stuff. I went to the Rosetta Stone, then continued through the Assyrian exhibits to the Parthenon sculptures. I went downstairs to the Greek and Roman architectural pieces then headed up to see the India exhibits. A brief look around the dying gallery and it was time to go. The museum wasn’t very busy but, some galleries and areas were mobbed with groups of Chinese or American tourists and others were empty. By the time I was leaving, the cafes and shops were full in the great court and there was a queue for the toilets. It was cool to see the actual Rosetta Stone but, it is behind glass, there used to be a full-sized copy that was displayed in the open."
"Written January 4, 2020",Disappointing Troy,"I absoltuely love the British Museum, it's my favourite place in London, and I've visited dozens of times. However, I was sadly disappointed with the Troy exhibition for two reasons. Firstly, it was really dark inside which made reading many of the panels quite difficult. Secondly, despite choosing an allocated time slot, to control the volulme of visitors, it was extremely busy. Dodging between people's legs and bodies in order to read information in a poorly lit exhibition detracted from the level of enjoyment I was expecting. Not nearly as good as the Pompeii arrangements from a few years ago."
"Written February 1, 2020",Troy - brilliant exhibition,"The British Museum is vast and exhausting if you do not pace yourself and be very selective.  Check out what it has to offer and select in priority order what you really want to see with some extras if you have time and stamina.  I came for the Troy exhibition. As always the exhibitions are very well curated and engaging.  This looked at myth, fact, and influence.  The story was told through found Greek pottery, sculpture, Roman frescoes; archaeological finds and modern interpretations in art and even cinema.  If you visit more than one exhibition a year it really is worth looking at membership. I did and never regretted it even though I live 200 miles form London!"
"Written February 29, 2020",Visit to the Troy exhibition ,"We visited in half term to see the Troy exhibit which was fabulous. While there we also looked through the Egyptian Halls as we had visited the Tutenkhamun exhibit the day before as well as looking through a number of the other halls. The museum is vast and you could literally spend days there. I recommend you plan what you would like to see (roughly) before you go or at least purchase a map for £2 when you enter then grab a coffee from one of the various refreshment areas and decide what to visit.  All three of the children (23,12 and 9) absolutely loved it and would have spent a second day there easily."
"Written February 13, 2020",Just Wow!,"I’d heard a lot about The British Museum. My father had been many years previously, but I had not been in the capital for over 50 years, when I was 4. I had an itinerary for my 4 days in London, as well as a to-do list what to see in each museum. The three top items I wanted to visit were; the Rosetta Stone, Easter Islands Ho Hakananai’a statue and the Lewis Chessmen. The first two I had heard about listening to the excellent Radio 4 the World in 100 object podcasts. The Lewis Chessmen came to the fore listening to Frank Skinners excellent podcast, which got me to visit the smaller number in Edinburgh and also the site on the Isle of Lewis where they were found. I digress… The amount of arts and materials on display is mind boggling and would take days to see. My advice would be to research what you want to see and temper this with the time that you have available. The central hall which houses the café, shop, toilets etc. has the most magnificent lattice glass roof and really complements this grand old building well. Don’t forget to make a donation and use a map to plan and enhance your experience. Staff as with all of the other museums in London are first rate and deserve a mention."
"Written January 27, 2020","My first visit, and I will definitely go again","This is the first time that I have been into the museum, despite having always lived and worked within the London area.We viewed the excellent 700 years of jade exhibition and went through to the introduction to China which was fascinating.Spent 2-3 hours walking around after which it was difficult to absorb anything further, will definitely return.Understandably the best museum in the world.Plenty of toilets. eating places and gift shops.  Very helpful staff throughout."
"Written March 1, 2020",Good not the best in london,Popped in here as was one of the few last museums I havent been to know london. Lovely building well organised artifacts. Good amount of foot flow no real hold ups to see anything. Queue was about 20 minutes outside which in this weather is a bit rubbish but I can understand security needs to be done 
"Written August 8, 2022",One of the best museums in the world,"Turned up at the entrance where some renovations were taking place, so they had a temporary line and security area which took no time at all to get through. It's completely free to enter, and you don't need to book ahead unless you want to be guaranteed entry as they are trying to control crowds. The central atrium is absolutely spectacular with a glass roof covering the entire area, letting in tons of natural light. The museum itself is massive and you could easily spend a whole day there and not see everything. Almost every point in human history is covered here, starting from the dawn of civilization all the way up to the present day. Honestly one of the best museums in the world!"
"Written January 1, 2020",Great place to spend the day,"There was a huge queue at the entrance, but it went very fast, we only had to queue for 10 minutes. They provide food inside and places where you can rest if you get tired walking around all the rooms. The only problem,like everywhere else, are the people who take selfies and disturb others while admiring the exhibited items... "
"Written March 7, 2020",Beautifully designed building,Visited this museum with a group and concentrated on two rooms only as too much to take in in a couple of hours. We were thrilled by the entrance and the structure of the glass dome letting natural light in. Thoroughly recommend a visit.
"Written June 14, 2020","Great Museum, Rude Staff ","We had such a good time at this Museum. The highlight was the Rosetta Stone but this massive museum is filled with millions of things to see. You could spend weeks browsing around. The entry is free or with a donation. There was no line to get into the museum at 4pm. They have a cloak room for an extra charge. There are a few dining options within the museum, including a grab and go coffee shop. As the museum was closing we heard an announcement that we had 15 mins before closing time. We started to head back to the main entrance and was met by a VERY rude worker who SHOVED us out of one of the show rooms. I just couldn't believe how aggressive he was and rude to us. Had no idea why he had to literally PUSH us out as we still had 15 mins plus we were clearly walking in the direction of the exit. "
"Written August 29, 2021",Nero with some grumbling.,"Accessibility issues continue. Little seating within the exhibition space. The signage in front of exhibits is too small. Many visitors have sight issues and you are waiting whilst people lean forward trying to read the labelling in the fairly dim light. Build up of people waiting to read despite us visiting at a less popular time / day. It begs the question what happens when a wheelchair user blocks the view…I have commented before on these issues to the BM but it seems there is no change in the presentation of special (and pretty extensive to be honest) exhibitions. We are not all minted tourists, some of us are locals on a pension and I think the BM could do better for my £18 to be honest.Some good materials, atmospherically presented, interesting and thought provoking.Oh, and your demographic questions…I was with adult family member"
"Written January 23, 2020",A must-see; set aside a whole day,"From the Great Space to individual exhibition spaces, there are so many amazing things to see here. Give yourself time to wander; you will never be able to take it all in, but you will definitely be able to appreciate the highlights. The current exhibition about Troy is also excellent, but go early to avoid the crowds."
"Written August 21, 2020",The British Museum ,"Fairly enjoyable day out with young children, quite congested so make sure you keep your eye on young children and personal belongings.On our visit, there was a fashion show for local students which was good fun.The main exhibition my children wanted to see was the infamous ancient Egyptian section and it didn’t disappoint."
"Written March 23, 2020","Worth visiting & revisiting - a great, extensive collection of fascinating artefacts","Amazing exhibitions and over 60 permanent galleries, more than you can get through in any single visit. If you are a local, then this is a museum you can visit any number of times and never get bored.  The exhibitions are always interesting, with plenty of extra information and events, and competitively priced."
"Written August 7, 2022",Poorly organized and over-crowded,"The collections are of course stunning. But the lay-out of the rooms makes no sense, neither chronologically nor geographically. The maps are hard to follow, and the crowds were intense. We signed-up for an entry time, as they do care about minimizing crowds. But they let far too many people in at once, and the experience was kind of disorienting and stifling."
"Written August 22, 2021",Great museum but could be more user friendly,"An unwelcoming start as the staff checking bags seemed fed up and rude.  We also had a timed ticket and moved in a slow queue in comparison to the people who hadn't got tickets.Headed first to the Nero exhibition - which as very good.  It was a little busy but there were options to read the material on your phone to reduce crowded.  It was well presented with clear information for different audiences.  I didn't know much before so found it informative.After coffee (good if pricey), we tried the audio tour from the website.  However, they have removed all the paper maps and that there was no easy way to find the objects on the tour.  I asked a member of staff and they weren't able to to help either.  I appreciate they have had to remove the audio tours and maps - however - they need to be replaced by something.Other places (eg Tate and National Gallery) seem better organised and an altogether smoother, more encouraging experience as we move to a different phase of Covid response."
"Written June 13, 2022","Amazing museum for Egyptian, Greek and Roman artifacts.","Spent an entire day here(10:30-5pm)! So much to see and very well organized. Lots of extremely friendly and helpful staff. Had lunch here and everything was fresh and tasty. Went to the special exhibit on Feminine Power which was pretty interesting. Artifacts pulled from the main part of the museum and displayed together with different historians commentary as well as descriptions of each artifact. The museum is free, special exhibits are not but I felt it was worth the price because it was well thought out and displayed. The free tours, provided by volunteers, were great! Caught a few in the different galleries and was very impressed. You have to book a time to enter the museum and special exhibits. Arrived at the museum to a huge line( que) and did panic but no one even checked our booking for the museum. Bag checks are required and staff was very efficient and friendly. Signage to special exhibit was lacking but lots of staff around to ask for directions. A short walk from the subway ( tube) very pretty area too."
"Written February 19, 2020",Chilly visit to artefacts,"We visited British Museum on 18.2.2020.We enjoyed our visit a lot. We downloaded, printed and marked parts of museum we wanted to see and it was great idea. Because museum is simply huge. We had very pleasant time and spent there a bit over 4h, including lunch at Pizzeria (btw excellent pizza!).It was just strange that pizza smell was noticeable even in one of the exhibition rooms. But it worked well and we are happy we went for the pizza.We must admit we were both very surprised how cold it was in the museum. I thought jeans and t-shirt would be enough. But half way through our visit, we had to go back to cloak room, to pick up my hoodie, because it was unbearably cold. Did not happen to us in any other museum though. But we do understand that since there are big pieces of various artefacts on walls, there is just zero space for heating. So before you go check which parts of exhibition you want to see and keep in mind it gets a bit chilly :)"
"Written August 2, 2021",A fascinating experience,We decided to have a day at the museums in London. We planned on visiting 3 or 4 but only got round to 2 because of the sheer scale of the British Museum. It's a fascinating place with so much history and artifacts. Definitely go in with an open schedule as you may end up doing what we did and losing track of time. We'll definitely be back!
"Written March 13, 2022",Easy and impressive,"I read a lot of reviews before going and was concerned it would be too busy or the queue to get inside would be really long. We visited on a Saturday and arrived at about 14.00. There was no queue to get inside, the bag check was quick and easy, no one asked to see a ticket or to make a donation (there are boxes throughout the museum to donate in cash.) My only complaint is that there is so much to see and you can't possibly see it all in a day. It wasn't too busy and people were respectful so if there's a crowd gathered around an artefact just stand in place gradually moving forward for less than a minute and you'll get to the front. We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food."
"Written January 29, 2020",Stunining Museum Collections,Extraordinary collections of art from all over the world. Historical parts are breathtaking. The Queen's library was one of my favorites spots to visit. It is a museum that needs several visits to accomplish great discories.
"Written August 6, 2023",Sheep herding,"When visiting the very expensive side exhibitions of say the Sainsbury gallery it is advisable to get there with more than 2 hours to spare. Otherwise they literally kick you out before you’ve finished enjoying the exhibits. Honestly, it was like being kicked out of the boozer at closing time. Terrible experience. The staff need a talking to. Horrible"
"Written October 16, 2021","Not that many tourists, a great time for visiting now","Over 13 million items representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. it is advisable to have a list of specific sections of the museum that you want to see otherwise it gets overwhelming and your feet get very tired.  We picked the Egyptian mummies (missed them in Cairo) and Hoards of gold, silver etc found in UK.  The stories behind the discovered Hoardes within UK were amazing! Sutton Hoo, Thetford, Hoxne and the Lynx. We also stopped at the clock gallery because we have a relative that is obsessed with clocks, so we took a lot of videos and pictures. The clocks are set to different times, so they do NOT chime all at the same time. Amazing selection! All eating places are closed except the café by the bookstore that has a selection of sandwiches, croissants, sweets and hot beverages.Self-serve only, and there was plenty of seating available as that were not that many tourists visiting."
"Written January 6, 2020",Disappointing,"Disappointing, it was not what I expected. I have wanted to go for over 40 years and finally got here. It was packed with people, the toilets were smelly and we had to wait in line for 10 minutes, not enough seats if you wanted to sit and have a coffee. Yes teh exhibits were great, but most of the amenities also belonged in a museum."
"Written January 22, 2020","Fascinating, mesmerising, absorbing","Contrary to the  song ""A Foggy day in London town,"" the British museum has NOT lost its charm. You can be a time traveller in other worlds and all in one place for free unless you are going to special exhibition. Immerse yourself in the Egyptian room on the ground floor. Admire the cat there and look eyeball to eyeball at the face on the black coffin.  And check out the stupendous black and red Greek vases elsewhere, which in their time were less valued than their contents (oil!).  Accompanying captions are informative. There's usually quite a lot to read, especially in the special exhibitions (eg. Troy and Inspired by the East- Islamic art's influence on Western art), which can be difficult when it's crowded. I use the large print catalogues so I don't have to peer down at the labels.  The shops are tempting, a bit pricey but a great place for unusual presents. Cloakroom is at least £2.50. NO wheeled cases allowed. Often a long queue for security checks at the front entrance, moves quite quickly. Members skip the line. This time I went in via back entrance in Montague Place. There is still a bag check but there was no line. Museum crowded when I visited between Xmas and New Year, but much quieter when I went 10 days later to see a special exhibition. Check for access. I noticed an outside lift at the front of the museum by the colonnade. The cafe in the Great Court is good, but a bit pricey and there isn't enough seating (eat out?). Don't miss this wonderful museum. "
"Written January 12, 2020",Overwhelming!,The British Museum is amazing. I went on a Friday night when they were open late. There were lots of people there but it didn’t feel crowded. I was able to move through the rooms that I wanted to see without any delay. So much history in such a beautiful building. I highly recommend if you’re interested in this museum to maybe go over a couple days and spend a few hours at a time. Because it can be overwhelming to try and see everything in one trip.
"Written January 20, 2020",Cloak room restriction,"We came from out of town and had a small cabin suitcase with wheels with us which we planned to leave at the cloakroom. It was not allowed. No alternative given. Maybe itvqas our fault for taking it for granted, as we left it in other museums, with no problem. The rule is, no wheels, full stop. We already paid to see the Islamic art exhibition. Fortunately a small Italian restaurant opposite the museum agreed to take it for £5 charge. So, take note. Leave yr wheelie luggage at a left luggage in railway stations or at Yr hotel if you plan to go to the otherwise magnificent British museum."
"Written February 6, 2020",Troy Exhibition,"We booked timed tickets for the Troy Exhibition ( we even managed 241 tickets) but  although the exhibition was very good it was very, very busy when we visited at 11am on a Monday in February.So busy that we found we had to wait in line for a considerable time to see some items.Children running about did not help."
"Written February 18, 2020",BP's Troy exhibition - excellent,We booked in advance and greatly enjoyed this exhibition. I'd done some reading up first so much of the history in the exhibition made more sense so I recommend doing a Wiki on the history of the city first. We spent a couple of hours there having arrived early and spent another hour wandering around some of the other great galleries. Decent cake in the cafe too.
"Written February 29, 2020",Amazing museum,"There is so much to see here that you will need to return another day.  I saw three exhibits:  German Emergency Money 1914-1924, Disposable?, and the Troy:  Myth and Reality exhibits.  The Troy exhibit featured depictions of the myths about Troy, artifacts found at Troy, and objects inspired by Troy.  This museum is a definite must see in London.  (If you are over 60, visit on a Monday afternoon and pay half price for exhibits with an admission charge.  You can only purchase these tickets in person.)"
"Written March 14, 2020",You're probably not allowing yourself enough time,"The treasures available to view are simply incredible.  If you're not taking a guided tour I recommend finding one of the many websites (even the museum map) to point out the key exhibits.  Otherwise, you can really spend all day+ inside.  Plus this helps you plan your visit much more efficiently.My favorites were the Rosetta Stone and the Greek section.  But, there is much-much more!I also recommend getting there when it opens because it will get crowded - especially when the school groups start to show up.Along with Buckingham Palace & The Tower of London, this is a must see."
"Written March 1, 2020",Always something interesting to see ,There is always something interesting to see.  Would recommend concentrating on one or two areas   otherwise it could be overwhelming.  My particular favourite is the Parthenon Gallery with the Elgin Marbles.  Amazing. Have visited twice and found something different each time. I also enjoyed the French Impressionists prints from Manet to Cezanne an exhibition which is on until August  2020 ..and it's free. Bag searches are in operation but the queue moves quite quickly and the staff are very friendly. Probably best to find eating places outside or take in your own food. The cafes are not that good and service is very slow and disorganised. 
"Written September 5, 2020",Not yet,"Ordinarily a great way to spend an afternoon, this wasn’t worth the pre- booked time and journey out there when only the ground floor galleries are open. Other London museums have reopened much more of their collections, and I would have waited longer before going had I known. The offerings in the cafe weren’t particularly inspiring- £3 for a tea is not good value! "
"Written March 4, 2020",If museums are your thing... ,"Huge place, lots of options to explore. If you really want to enjoy and learn the history, I recommend having more than 2 hours available on your trip itinerary. I personally like visiting museums, this one became one of my favorites. Amazing pieces, art, photos, etc... "
"Written March 6, 2020",For history buffs,"This is truly a place you do not wish to miss, mostly if you love history. You will have the chance to learn about all ancient civilizations: Mesopotamia, Egypt, Rome, Germanic tribes, China, etc.My advice is to focus on the civilization (s) you wish to focus on the day of your visit as it would seriously take you entire days to really take it all in.I would not visit with little children as, unless they have a keen interest in it, they will get bored really quickly.Do take the time to enjoy reading the descriptions of what you are seeing, do not just snap a quick pic and off to the next one, you can really learn a lot in this amazing place."
"Written November 14, 2022",A morning at the British Museum,"We arrived at 09:30 Sunday to find a small queue, which grew quite lengthy by the time the gates opened at 10:00, however it was quick to get into the museum, and actually we got in quicker than the queue that had pre-booked tickets (as you're split into booked or not booked queues once through the gate).The museum is excellent, and there's lots to see, and the architecture of the building is amazing.Note to British Museum: the signs splitting the queue into booked and not booked are covered when people are walking past them, so should be at head height, not knee height, which would save your marshall having to shout which queue lane people should be going into)."
"Written May 30, 2021",Iconic for a reason,"I love the BM. It’s so big that I always find something new to enjoy. If visiting for the first time don’t try to do the whole thing or you’ll be overwhelmed but concentrate on a few areas - the Egyptian galleries and Elgin Marbles obviously but don’t miss the Assyrian reliefs which are astonishing and the Sutton Hoo treasure which is brilliantly displayed. Basically, keep coming back and you’ll never be disappointed "
"Written April 7, 2022",Lacking for us,"Arrivals process should be much better as on our first visit (10.30 on a Monday) the queue was right around the corner i.e. 20 minute wait, as bags had to be searched and no one made any effort to allow people with no bags a faster entry.Once inside the Great Court is exceptional architecture & our main aim - the Waddeston Bequest) was closed. We asked and were told this was the decision of the Duty Manager and they could not tell us how long this room would be closed. Sadly, when we went two days later, the same story. I know that maintenance is needed at some time(s) but would have been nice to be forewarned."
"Written January 4, 2020",Best museum I've ever been to!,"This museum is absolutely fantastic! I could've spent all day here. Took my husband and 3 sons (20,18,17) so wanted to hit the highlights before they had museum overload. This museum holds and incredible array of Egyptian art, mummies and jewelry and artifacts. The Greek and Roman section was unbelievable. Cant wait to go back. This is a must see for everyone and its FREE!"
"Written November 30, 2021",A museum not to be missed when in London,"need to pre-booked your free ticket. only special exhibition requires a paid ticket. This place is simply gorgeous and wonderful. You really get to enjoy the different countries' historical pieces of collection of antiques, mummies collection. you will be able to connect yourself  by looking at these collections and learn about all the history of the different countries of the past. This is in fact 1 of the best muesum in London."
"Written February 29, 2020",A little disappointing,"Collection excellent of course, but thé way visitors are Bring treated, has declined. To enter the building your have undergo a security check after being led like sheep through iron fences and a custom build tent... Not Nice..."
"Written August 5, 2020",Brilliant place,"This is arguably the best museum I've ever been to and I've been many times. You will never get to see everything as it's so vast so I recommend a 'greatest hits tour' which  is offered, this takes in the Elgin Marbles, Rosetta Stone, Lewis Chessmen etc.  Also they have daily talks on specific areas such as clocks, money, South America. Fascinating place"
"Written April 22, 2023",Stunning,"We visited many of the museums in London, but this one was by far my favourite. We went in the afternoon and it was extremely crowded so I would suggest perhaps getting there just as it opens. You could spend most of the day enjoying the museum’s beautiful treasures. If you only have time to visit one museum during your day time in London, this would be my recommendation. Although visiting the museum is free, you will need a ticket for a timed entry. You can get this online the day of your visit."
"Written September 6, 2021",Best museum I've ever been to!,"It was a childhood dream of mine to visit the British Museum. After a mishap with the security guards on an attempted visit in July, we returned on Saturday 4th for a look around the museum. Because of what happened during our July visit, we were given complimentary tickets to the Emperor Nero exhibition.The museum itself was amazing, I learnt so much. I saw so many new things, and things I've read so much about and dreamt about seeing. Despite the crowds, there was much to see and do and I found the museum staff placed around were willing to answer any questions that I had and were keen to pass on knowledge. The exhibits were spaced out so well, and due to my autism, I loved that they were categorised (Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, Japan). The rooms were beautiful, the architecture flawless.The Nero exhibition was very interesting and again, we learnt a lot too. I loved all the statues, and the stories of Nero's rule. Again, the staff were keen to pass on knowledge and were very friendly.Overall, we throughly enjoyed our visit and we cannot wait to return."
"Written March 30, 2020",Huge variety of antiquities and gorgeous architecture,"Walking into the central ""atrium"" of this museum, with it's geometric glass panels, is always awe-inspiring. I love the collections here, especially the Egyptians (check out Rosetta stone). You can easily spend 2 hours here - a great free, cultural activity for all ages. "
"Written March 6, 2020",Always busy but an amazing place.,"Egyptian, Greek and Ancient British artifacts rub shoulders in this amazing collection.  Give yourselves lots of time if you want to see even half the collection.Beware,  it is very busy and can become claustrophobic if you don't like crowds! Go early to avoid this.A fantastic free resource for Londoners and Visitors alike."
"Written January 7, 2020",A disappointing Afternoon Tea experience,"Between Christmas and New Year, we had a disappointing Afternoon Tea experience in The Great Court Restaurant. The first table to which we were shown was too small and cramped. The second was a little better, larger but still located in the curving corridor between the servicing area and the restaurant, just by the steps down to the gents' toilets. The service was spasmodic, some of the staff were surly and unfriendly. They were very quick to take our orders and very slow in responding to any follow-up requests. They managed to get the number of sandwiches wrong: four diners should equal four of each filling. Not too difficult, surely? Tea was in tea bags and served in tiny teapots. Should we really have had to ask for milk to go with our tea? Should they then have brought one small jug of milk for three of us to share? Tiny pots of jam, no butter and a splodge of cream for the scones. We deducted the service charge that had been added to the bill. No one asked why. What should have been a memorable family occasion in a lovely setting was, but for all the wrong reasons. We have eaten here before and recommended to our friends. We shall be doing neither from now on."
"Written August 23, 2021",Lots of good exhibitions,It was worth joining as members given the excellent exhibitions on at the moment.  We really enjoyed the Beckett exhibition and learnt a lot.  We had a quick visit to the Nero exhibition.   On your first visit you get 20% off in the shop and further visits 10% off.  The building is stunning and there is so much to see.  Just didn't like the entry system whereby members have to queue outside at 10am and then once you get in the gates there is a fast track.  Could be improved as an entry point.
"Written February 9, 2020",Troy Exhibition,"We visited the museum to see the Troy exhibition; it was interesting and had a lot of focal points. Only thing was the school trips, which meant it took longer to view the exhibits, but it is nice to see children being educated on history( even if they were excitable!) as they are the future generations to preserve it! We also wandered around the museum to see the Rosetta Stone, was Lyon marbles and the mummies, there was just so much to see, we didn’t scratch the surface! We were there for about 5 hours in total. Stunning atrium. As it is free entry to the museum, we will definitely return again and explore!"
"Written August 1, 2021",A good and educational trip to the museum,"We visited in July 2021 when the UK was just opening up after the lockdown. It was good that most people was still on face coverings while indoor and respect personal space.  Now let's talk about the museum- it was amazing....  Artifacts are arranged by location, and there are are vast galleries covering Ancient Egypt, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Greece and Rome, and so you get to choose which you want to focus on... especially if you are tight for time or would like to continue again the next day! Worth the visit and it is free!"
"Written April 11, 2020",#culture,"One of my favourite London museums if not my favourite. You can spend all day in here, it’s close-by to the Soho and Oxford Street and easy to plan your day around. I would highly recommend it for people who like to take their time, read about the artefacts and history rather than just fly through. The Rosetta Stone and the Aztec twin-headed serpent are personal favourites. If you aren’t really interested in the history then I would recommend you go just to take photos in the building because it’s amazing!"
"Written April 4, 2020",A must do when in London,"You can't beat all of the free museums in London. This one had a great combination of artifacts and paintings from all over the world, and some extremely famous items like the Easter Island statue and Rosetta Stone. Since this is a pretty big museum, plan your visit in advance so you can make the best of your time there and save steps. We ended up roaming around aimlessly and backtracking a lot because we went in with no plan. I would leave about 3 hours here to see everything. Less if you rush through and chose specific wings. There are a couple of cafe areas on the first floor if you need a snack and a break. Overall this was a really lovely well laid out museum. Be sure to visit!"
"Written June 22, 2022",Extraordinary,"I visited the British Museum as I was stuck in London due to the tube and rail strikes and needed something to do. I absolutely loved it. The building is light, airy and cool and despite the sheer amount of people visiting never feels crowded. Loved seeing the mummies but their latest exhibition about Stone Henge is wonderful, though you do have to pay for entrance to that. Well worth it as it’s stunning. The gift and book shops have a wide selection of choice with all types of budgets in mind. From pocket money purchases to more expensive goods. However, the cafes are hugely expensive but seating areas are available for packed lunches. This is a brilliant way to spend a day, but it will be hard to see it all in a day due to the sheer size so I will be returning! Thanks also to the staff who were lovely and helpful even during the stressful times of strikes. "
"Written January 22, 2020",Loved this museum and I hope to go back someday.,"We had only a few hours to spend here, so we followed the provided museum map and checked out the highlights that were marked on the map. We saw many interesting objects on our brief tour including many that we had to investigate as we were looking for the ones marked on our map. I could spend a full day in here over and over again to see everything included. "
"Written February 10, 2020",Troy exhibition very good,"I had a wonderful time at this museum. I was looking for 10th to 13th century armour to draw from for a project and they had bits and pieces, but actually the rest of the museum was really interesting too and I ended up going to the troy exhibition and having a much better time than if I was just looking at armour. it was all nicely set up, Clean and very informative. It is a beautiful building also. especially all the Greek parthenon and ancient byzantine lion hunt corridors and stuff is really special and atmospheric. not so much of the sterile, boring ways that things are set up often in museums, which I see the importance of obviously for the sake of consistency between exhibits, but its nice to have different considerations for different things that you are exhibiting. I'm not sure I've managed to say what I wanted to say with that, but moving on: it's not something I usually pay attention to, but a lot of care was taken in the curation, especially for lower levels. good job I had a nice time"
"Written June 16, 2021",You have to make this one of your stops in London,"This is an amazing Museum, so big and interesting, with a lot of area. The entry is free, but in today's circumstances you have to book a time slot on their website. It's pretty easy to do though, and I suggest you make a donation if you can. Trust me it's totally worth it. I would suggest you either start in the morning or go in there two days in a row, because there is so much to see and explore that it can be overwhelming, especially if you go with kids."
"Written January 12, 2020",Absolutely Overwhelming,I think you could spend a week here and not see it all. We spent a few hours and probably only saw 10% of the free galleries. Very crowded on the weekends. There is a movement to have some artifacts returned to their homes so you may see protestors. 
"Written January 6, 2020",Very Interesting and Cool,"We (2 adults & 1 child) went to the British Museum on Dec. 27 2019. It was cool and interesting for me (the child ). I was very fascinated by the mummy and Rosetta stones exhibits. In my opinion, this is one of the best museums I’ve been to in my life because they have helpful audio guides. There are many entertaining and informative exhibits.( Obe, 11 )"
"Written February 18, 2020",It is huge! Plan to spend the better part of your day here!,"Oh my goodness, the queuing is set up to try and get you in efficiently.But once inside this beautifully immense space, you need time to properly walk and immerse yourself. It is huge here. Almost overwhelming.It has lots of space around exhibits and doesn't feel crammed.I didn't get enough time and would definitely come back. And it would be worth exploring over and over."
"Written March 5, 2020",Mummies Galore!,"Having been to the Tutankhamum exhibition at The Saachi Gallery lately I felt compelled to write a review on my prior visit to the British Museum.  The Egyptian section is far more impressive than I imagined and the museum in general has lots of quirky things, like money making machines and clocks galore!  That roof over the central hall always amazes me too.  Will return."
"Written February 3, 2020",A Must-See,"The British Museum is one of the most well-curated museums in the world and a must-see if you are in London. With everything from mummies to pieces of the Parthenon, you could spend days wandering around. Some of the exhibits are so spectacular that I left shocked I was able to view such renowned artifacts up close (i.e. the Rosetta Stone!). Go with friends, family, or even by yourself for a lovely day trip!"
"Written August 28, 2023",External tour guides are out of control,"The complete and utter lack of control of external tour groups made the visit completely unbearable. I counted (and filmed) seven tour groups yelling over each other in competition in one small space as one official tour given by a staff member was completely drowned out. Completely unacceptable working conditions for museum staff members. These same large unofficial tour groups allowed their group members to do whatever they liked (including climb onto of statues) because they don’t want to risk their tips and frankly don’t care about the locations they visit. It was lawless,  as there was complete disregard of any other visitor as they barrelled passed and raised their voices over other tour groups and did whatever they liked. No tour groups should be permitted access and only official museum tours should be permitted in line with majority of tourist attractions in Britain. I stayed for a couple of hours and found sections such as the Islamic art much better as the large groups avoided them. In these isolated areas you could enjoy the collections. Where you could find peace and quiet it is a brilliant and varied collection. A bit dated in places but with some TLC it could be improved upon. However I would not recommend this attraction until they ban external tour groups and tour leaders. It’s frankly ridiculous and the museum staff have my sympathies having to work in those conditions; putting up that that level of noise and disrespect."
"Written September 23, 2020",Only 1 floor is open,"a little disappointing because only one floor is open and even then certain exhibitions were closed. I am assuming this was to lack of staff and/or due to current restrictions.Saying that it was still a good day out, with several interesting exhibits to see. The staff are friendly and helpful and we took our 8 month old and found the museum to be very family/baby friendly."
"Written February 1, 2020",So much history!,"The museum is immense. We thought we'd spend most of the day there,  but our endurance gave out. I'd recommend planning just 2 hours a day there and do it in several days in between other activities. There were no lines to get in on a Friday morning in January. So many incredible things to see!"
"Written January 5, 2020",The best museum I’ve ever visited! (And it’s free!),"The British Museum is a must-go in London. With huge collections of invaluable pieces from around the world, you will certainly find something that interests you. When I got there, the audio guides have all been sold out. But I figured I could get the audio guide from visitors who had just finished visiting (with luck). I followed the “top 10” tour of the audio guide, which are all amazing pieces recommended by the curators. This one-hour tour was about enough for me. If you’re into museums, you can definitely spend a day or two here."
"Written November 30, 2020",See the ancient worlds in one day  -  or more,"The British Museum – It would take a book to cover the essentials to see in Britain’s most venerated museum.  It has treasures from around the world, many from the colonial period when British explorers and agents found great examples from around the world and brought them to London.  Little wonder that many countries want these treasures returned home!  Must see – the Rosetta Stone, the Egyptian mummies, ancient Greek and Roman and middle eastern treasures, the Chinese, Indian and Japanese exhibits, and other equally interesting finds.  The only other museum I know of that could compare competitively with the British Museum is the Smithsonian Museums (actually 20 separate museums and the National Zoo).  Easily three hours to see some of the main points.  And realistically one could spend a week lost in the British Museum.    It is worthwhile to schedule your trip to London in the off season to see the British Museum.  We visited in late Fall 2019 and it was not crowded, but the reputation is for long lines and jumping up and down to see things if you are behind other people.  Admission – free."
"Written January 7, 2020",Too popular,"I have been going to the BM for decades as I love the permanent collections, the exhibitions, the cafes and the shops. It is really a nightmare these days. The glass ceiling looks spectacular but it makes the Great Court very stuffy. It is always insanely crowded and of course many people are just there to take pictures of themselves and the exhibits. If you don't get there at opening time, ie 10am, you are going g to be shuffling round very very slowly. The BM is very much a victim of its own success and if I was in London as a tourist I would go to one of the South Kensington museums, or the Wallace collection or somewhere less iconic."
"Written October 25, 2022",Great museum for seeing the great Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles.,"Great Museum for seeing lots of history, in Greece and Egypt and Britain.In Great Russell Street London.There is a queue to get in but if you book a time slot online it's easier and then join the queue at that time. It's free entry but you can can leave a donation when booking of £5 or £10 or anything like this. The museum is very large and has a new roof since we last visited and it is beautiful so airy and great architecture, so lovely to look at. We saw the Elgin marbles now called the Pantheon Sculptures and also the Rosetta Stone amongst other things. All the old British coinage and bank notes. The shops are great, large bookshop in the middle and lots of smaller gift shops around the museum selling memorabilia like keyrings, pens and pencils and replicas of sculptures. We had afternoon tea in the restaurant which we had booked beforehand, it was lovely it is upstairs at the back of the museum near the amazing roof. The staff are friendly and helpful, the tea was very reasonably priced and the cakes, scones and sandwiches were so tasty and plenty of them, the tea was great also you could have different types and we had champagne too. The atmosphere was amazing and to be sitting in all that history was a bonus. Would definitely recommend it to anyone and would definitely go again."
"Written February 26, 2020",Nice to jump the queues at Exhibitions,"I became a ""Friend"" of the British Museum so that I could get access to special exhibits at either the start or the end of an Exhibition. Due to ill-health we can't plan a date & timeslot in advance, it's much more convenient to just decide ""on the day"" to go.This occasion I was going to see the ""Troy Myth & Reality"" before it closed. Went on a weekday at around 11am, and whilst there were no queues outside for security, I found the exhibition itself surprisingly crowded by oldies like us - maybe everyone had the same idea. Interesting, but not quite what I was expecting - more myth than reality.The usual browse around the gift shop gave us some ideas for grandchildren."
"Written January 21, 2020",Absolutely Amazing!!!,"One of the best and most complete museums in the world. They have the original Rosetta Stone, real mummies and original artwork from some of the best artists in the world. Truly incredible museum. It's very big and will probably take several hours to explore and depending how thorough you like to be, you might need to come back for a second day to complete your visit. Adults and children of different ages will enjoy this awesome museum."
"Written February 19, 2020",The history of the work under one roof,"This is one of the greatest museums the world. Its exhibits are all wonderful and it is well laid out. It has a number of iconic exhibits including the Rosetta Stone which is the first thing you see, and the frieze from the Parthenon. Its collection of artifacts from Ancient Egypt are particularly stunning. Access is limited just now, presumably due to Covid, but there is still plenty to absorb you for a couple of hours anyway. It is one of the ""must see"" places in London so you really must see it!"
"Written October 6, 2020",Astounding amount of history!,"We took a trip to London, ended up getting a hotel in Holborn, which was just two blocks from the British Museum. So it was super convenient and something we would have gone out of our way for anyway.The line outside was long but it moved quickly and efficiently. Notably security was not only productive but genuinely charming. The entrance was just stunning, the staircases and the rotunda genuinely gave us pause. The sheer depth of how much stuff was here was also intimidating. We had to get a map and actually figure out our plan of attack.For me the Egyptian exhibits were the highlights but literally every historical period and geographic area had amazing exhibits. I love weapons and they had them in spades, from primitive clubs to gorgeous inlaid swords.My only reservations were twofold. 1st, apparently every school in London brought their kids and they swarmed the place like locusts. I though British kids were a lot more civilized than Americans but not these ones!The other small reservation is that there are some exhibits that you have to pay extra to see. In this case it was Stonehenge. As we were going to the real thing I was okay but for the token price it would have been worth it.All in all, these small reservations did nothing to deflate the experience. I would go back again and spend another full day there!"
"Written April 25, 2022",Fantastic Museum,"I love the British Museum, especially the Egyptian Section. It is quiet and the rooms are very well organised. It is free so accessible to anyone which I think it is amazing for families and all people. If you want to support it you can easily make a donation. The queue looks long, but it is very fast so it takes only few minutes to access the museum itself. Booking is required even if free."
"Written October 17, 2022",The British Museum visit,The building itself is magnificent and galleries spacious so even when busy it is ok to walk with many.I wanted to visit to see the Egypt gallery as I have recently been at the Saatchi gallery to see the Tutankhamun exhibition.I was very disappointed to find two of the main rooms containing artefacts closed to the public until further notice(No date for reopening).The very least the Museum could do is advise on the website what is available and works that are taking place with restrictive accessThe artefacts that were on show were really good but I left a little flat and slightly annoyed.This is somebody who lives in London who can come back anytime so I feel for many of our foreign visitorsAnother annoying thing is the tour guides who seem to be both official and unofficial .Apart from my little issues I had a great time and I will be back to see the rest.
"Written January 4, 2020",The most authorative museum in the world.,"This museum is the model for the Museums of the World with the widest spead of departments, and is the go to start if wishing to learn about any historical artefact anywhere.  I have recently visited its stunning exhibition about Troy, and I wish I had all the information on the exhibition before visiting the actual site which itself was rather disappointing in contrast to the fascinating museum display. Manyof the exhibits, especially the tomb carvings of the stories brought the myths to life so that it was possible to imagine what must have happened to cause the stories to be written.     "

You can easily spend all day here! If you go in the summer ☀️ like we did, be aware that many of the rooms can be hot. The museum is very popular, so is quite crowded. There is SO much to see, it takes a minimum of 2.5 hours to go through exhibits quickly. "
"Written August 6, 2022",Great Museum,"This is a must visit place when you in London.  The entrance of this museum is amazing, so many collections, and well displayed.The gift shops are wonderful, you get 10% off of your next purchase, so buy item one by one.Best of all the museum is free to entry, even it is free, you are treated as paid visitors, the workers are friendly and helpful, which gave a very good impression of my first visit to London."
"Written July 5, 2022",One of the Premiere Museums of London,"London and the UK in general have a ton of museums to choose from. The British Museum is not to be missed. With a regular rotation of exhibits and some that are regulars you will see a range of art from around the world. There are excellent examples of Egyptian, Persian and Greek art and sculpture. This is a must visit when in London."
"Written January 29, 2020",Exhibits worth seeing,"Extremely interesting exhibits on display. Just shows you, through the ages what man can do.  The carvings and statures are well preserved, just blows your mind away how old they really are. Free to visit. We made a donation, any amount accepted, helps to preserve the exhibits for future generations.  The building it self is worth seeing too, inner atrium is amazing, make sure you see it."
"Written February 2, 2020",A must-see experience!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the British Museum. We didn't expect the museum to be as big as it is - our visit was approx. 3 and a half hours. You have to book a free ticket online in advance to reserve a specific timeslot, however as no one checked our tickets when we entered, I'm not sure how the number of people are controlled as it can get quite busy inside.Not all of the exhibits hold the same level of interest - for example, some of the exhibits are just lots of pots which can get a bit boring after a while. But without a doubt, the best exhibits are Greece and Egypt. Even if you don't enjoy all the exhibits, the fact that this museum is free makes it a must-see experience for anyone. We had a great day out and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting London."
"Written October 28, 2023",Up close and personal,"You can come in this amazing place for free, but if you can afford to donate, please do. It's worth it to keep this place going. You can work your way through relics from ancient lands and civilisations,and both the ornate beautiful stuff and the day to day stuff are fascinating. Seeing something up close from the dawn of civilization is inspiring and leaves you wondering'how' on many occasions. You need more than one visit to do it justice though. Fabulous place."
"Written January 12, 2020",Amazing!,"First of all - I love that all museums in London are free! There are so many exhibits here you need lots of time. We had 2.5 hours and it wasn't anywhere near enough, and we aren't huge museum buffs.It was really warm inside so if you're coming in cooler months, layer up so you can take some layers off inside.Overall well worth a visit!!"
"Written July 3, 2022",You must have a plan !!,"It's vital you have a plan of the key things you want to see; this way you can sort out locations and make the most of the time you have.The museum is massive, there is no way you can just wander around and hope to find things at random.Well laid out, well explained. Huge collection covers every area of interest.Decent cafe.(Entry is free, only buy  tickets if you want a guide to take you around)"
"Written March 1, 2020",Incredible!,"The British museum is truly amazing. You could honestly spend hours wandering all the halls and marvelling at the incredible collection. However, with teens, we decided to just go to the “must see”  items listed on the map and spend about 2 hours inside the museum. Everyone in the family really enjoyed it and it was an excellent experience. I would thoroughly recommend, especially since it’s free!!!"
"Written July 5, 2020",Stone Lions behind the British Museum,"If you visit the British Museum make sure you see the stone lions guarding the north and lesser-used entrance on Montague Place. Most visitors use the main entrance on Great Russell Street and miss these great Art Deco Lions (examples of New Sculpture) carved by Sir George Frampton RA in 1914. It has been reported that at midnight they stand-up, stretch, and take a drink of water, before settling back down into their position. I got a great photo that will always remind me of the museum and our visit to London. (PaM)"
"Written August 6, 2022",Definitely worth a visit,"Short moving queue outside on a Friday afternoon in August, took us about 15 minutes from queue through security to inside the museum. There is so much to see that you'd need all day to really take it all in. We wondered through the rooms and just looked at parts we found interesting which was different for all 4 of us!  My son loves Egyptian and Roman history so we focused our time there.  There are plenty of seats available to rest. But it was very hot with the amount of people and the temperature about 24 degrees outside. Take layers! The programme mentions you can pop in for a 30 minute visit which is ideal if you are close and just want to see the museum in small bursts. Long queue for ladies toilets near the entrance, they need twice the amount of cubicles. I am sure there are others within the museum, but many tourists will be needing the toilet as soon as they get there like we did! "
"Written February 20, 2022",A must-see museum,"Great museum, free at least when we visited. While the famous things - Sutton Hoo, Rosetta Stone, Mausoleum of Halikarnassos - get the most press and visitors, don't ignore other great options.The Assyrian empire art rooms were really remarkable and worth an hour or so of your time. The King's library rooms were a real surprise, with thousands of exhibits, books, trinkets from around the world. The exhibit was titled ""collecting the world"" and was truly wonderful. A full day at the museum might be enough but feel free to splurge for a second day."
"Written January 21, 2021",A trip to the British Museum should be on every tourists agenda,"My favourite room in the British Museum is the Enlightenment Gallery. Last time I was there, I spent ages looking at all the amazing objects collected and concentrated in this huge space and all its cabinets and drawers and boxes and displays. It can get overwhelming, but if you go about it slowly, is very rewarding."
"Written February 9, 2020","Mixed, it depends","The collections are good ofc, but for me, over the years, the loot aspect has grown.  There's just no excuse for the Parthenon frieze to be here anymore.  The new China and India galleries in the back (Montague entrance) are excellent; very nicely curated, and an emphasis on gifts from Eastern donors (we see what you did there ;-) ).Overall, I agree with the criticism (too loud, too full, too commercial, too much bad food, etc.), but it's still a huge museum with great stuff and for free.  You know what you get.People here who complain that the ""British Museum"" is not about British history - facepalm."
"Written September 12, 2021",Great day out,"The British Museum was really interesting and has a huge collection of historic pieces from all over the world. You can spend as little or as long as you want here depending on your individual interests.  Unfortunately the Greek section was closed to the public when we visited which was a shame but there was still plenty of other displays to look at. I would definitely recommend purchasing a map for the small charge of £2 as it will show you where each display can be found and also points out a few interesting items you do not want to miss.The museum is huge and easy to walk around, there are a lot of stairs but also a lift is provided. I would definitely recommend a visit for a family day out."
"Written January 6, 2020","Fascinating place, watch out for crowds.","Took my daughters here for a day out. Had to wait in line for around 30 minutes to get in, but it was a Saturday in the summer, so no surprise. Some of the exhibits were very crowded, especially the Egyptian area, but other areas were much quieter. Overall a great experience, but worth choosing your visit time wisely."
"Written May 30, 2022",A great museum for history buffs.,"If you love all things history, then The British Museum is the place to go. Free entry, and open late on Friday evenings (part of the year),  even if you only have a short amount of time, it is worth heading in just to see The Rosetta Stone. NOTE: to use bag/coat check, it costs per weight so be mindful that isn't free. We also found it so hot inside (even though it was 20 degrees out). Sections were also closed off at 5 pm, with no explanation or warning, even though we were there late on Friday and the last entry is at 8 pm (apparently) "
"Written August 3, 2022",Great museum for history and art lovers!,"Amazing ancient art. I highly recommend this museum for people who love art, history, and the intersection of both. The Greek Marbles were the highlight of my experience. The gift shop offers great merchandise at a very affordable price."
"Written June 14, 2022",Extremely Rude Security!,"We had a fantastic time in the museum! The museum itself is brilliant and the staff inside are great....however...We booked a timed slot online to get into the museum, but we were unsure if that meant we had to queue in the normal entrance or if there was another entrance for pre-booked tickets. We went up to the security guy standing next to the entrance to ask him what to do and where to go. He laughed and replied ""I can't let you in here"". I explained that we weren't trying to get in this way, we just wanted to know if we go in through the main entrance or if there was a pre-booked entrance. He kept laughing at us and replying with ""there is no way I am letting you in here go round! Go round! Go around!"" he kept repeating, getting more aggressive and louder. As we then queued up and got to the entrance, he started shouting at us to fill up the space. He kept laughing and shaking his head and shouting at us even as we were filling up the space. We felt really uncomfortable with this man, and felt very embarrassed as we were made to feel that we had done something wrong.This was a real downer on an otherwise brilliant day in the museum."
"Written January 4, 2020",The worlds history ,As a child I was taken by my parents .I did not appreciate this special museum preferring the science museum.We got to the museum just before 10 am when they open which was wise for this very popular museum.A free entry is an exception in these times .Many civilisations are shown with artefacts that have survived in some cases thousands of years .This is educational and a pleasure to visit A day is not enough and we will visit again soon .
"Written January 28, 2020",Disappointing,This is probably my least favourite museum in London. I found it very difficult to navigate even with a floor plan. Unfortunately on the day of our visit the museum was full of school children many of whom were far too young to appreciate the exhibits. There was too many of them and they were very excitable. The school staff did very little to control them. In the end we left without seeing all we wanted to see. Perhaps school visits could be better arranged so that there is a limited number of children on any given day.
"Written November 2, 2020",Make the effort to visit now,"We wanted to just see the Ancient Greek section, so we booked up a slot. We spent about 90 minutes and it was excellent. Although there were a lot of people it was not so full and you were able to see all the exhibits with time and space.To visit now is a great experience and helps to keep our cultural life vibrant."
"Written February 15, 2022",Not enough time in one day,"A real museum, did not disappoint, thoroughly recommended. I would definitely suggest planning your visit carefully, you can easily spend an hour in a room, decide what you want to see in advance and form there work out which rooms you need to visit. We didn't and ended up missing or skipping some areas, definitely need more than one day. There is a restaurant on the 3rd floor that is worth a visit, helps break up the day, probably need to book during school holidays or if you are a group of 4 or more. They serve lunch and afternoon tea (traditional style) but no takeaway quick snacks etc."
"Written January 7, 2020",Käthe Kollwitz on till January 12 in Room 90,"The British Museum is always wonderful but if you are reading this early January 2020 go to see the Käthe Kollvitz exhibition on in Room 90 now till January 12th. Its free. This room is a must whenever you visit, it's the Print Room.I could wax lyrical but there is no point, see for yourself the wonders the Museum holds. Go early in the day to have some space. Much of the Museum is free, the special exhibitions are always special but. can be pricey, check online before you go. You don't have to see the money spinners to get loads out of your visit. The information desk is good and the gallery assistants very helpful."
"Written January 17, 2020",Troy,"We went to see Troy, myth and reality and spent a good 2 hours at the exhibition. I thought it was superbly curated and I learned a great deal about ancient Greek history and the way it fitted in to the poetry of Homer. There are many fascinating exhibits and I especially enjoyed looking at the different ages of Troy from 1 to 9 and relating the evidence to when the seige of Troy might have occurred. It was busy but not annoyingly so."
"Written April 17, 2020",An Ark of Noah,"This place is amazing! It has things you wouldn't believe about ancient times, about let's say...any religion like relics, drawings, statues, ornements... . That's why i compare this museum to Noah's ark.  We were there in July 2017 and when we look back at the pictures we took, we still think how wonderful this place is. You should go there as early as possible because there is so much to see and so many people visiting."
"Written April 29, 2020",Cannot Miss This,"I love museums, but this one really outdid itself. Not only is the museum itself beautiful to walk around, the exhibits are beyond spectacular. I was first drawn to visit to see the sister exhibit of the Cairo Museum I had seen 1 year earlier. Not only can you see amazing Egyptian artifacts, you can also see some highlights like the Rosetta Stone, an Easter Island head statue, and Mesopotamia artifacts. It's incredible. Also, the museum has some recommended sights based on the length of your visit. This is a handy tool to predict how long you'll want/need to stay. If you're in the mood for physical historical artifacts, this is the museum for you. If you're into traditional art (paintings and such) I would visit the National Gallery. Both are worth a visit in my opinion!"
"Written February 20, 2023",Hieroglyphs: Unlocking ancient Egypt.  Disappointing,This exhibition was £20 entry fee and it was crowded.  There were queues to get into the museum and queues to examine the exhibits themselves.  The lighting was poor and the printed explanations difficult to read.  There was no easily accessible storyline and I felt it represented poor value for money as well as not meeting the requirements of visitors.  You would be better informed reading a book about the interpretation and visiting the free Egyptian rooms at the museum.
"Written January 31, 2020",Unmissable,"Visited the Troy exhibition, which was superb. Of course there was also time to see other exhibits. This museum has so much of interest that even a complete day would not do it justice. Best to pick out the rooms which hold your interest. Apart from the special exhibitions entrance is free."
"Written July 1, 2020",Not for all,"Undoubtedly a fascinating place. However, I only recommend it to history lovers, I personally got very bored. It contains interesting finds that will surely fascinate anyone who knows about it. So I do not recommend young people who are not particularly fond of history to visit this place.There is a long line at the entrance, there are also small shops inside but the prices are not appropriate."
"Written January 9, 2020",Intellectually stimulating,"Of all the Museums of the world with 'British' in the title, this has got to be my favourite.  Well, perhaps joint favourite with the British Concrete Museum and; The British Museum of Roundabouts BUT! let not that take anything away from this bastion of world knowledge.  Particularly impressed with the Sutton Hoo treasures; the bog man; mummies (lots of in various states); Roman finds; Greek pots; the Rosetta Stone and; the Elgin Marbles (I will leave others to argue over where they belong, but possibly worth seeing them sooner, rather then in Athens...)Drinks and food are a bit pricey!  Take your own is the best suggestion.  Perhaps the best gift shop outside of a Disney resort. Truely an excellent and informative museum with a great range of exhibits.  Certainly should be no. 1 on a list of visits whilst you're in town."

Hordes of security people and bag checks. What are they expecting to happen? Tate Britain survives without this level of paranoia.The Nero exhibition was satisfying for me although the perpetual gloom of such events does puzzle me. Does marble actually go off in the light? Some of the lighting did, in fact, help photography. As people recover from pandemic restrictions, the crowds were not as dense as in the past. Some would describe the exhibition merchandise as creative, others as cynically exploitative. A bath duck in legionnaires uniform? Really? Few would disagree that it is very expensive but that is consistent with similar venues."
"Written February 20, 2020",Half term visit,"Fantastic museum but incredibly busy. The queue to get in was enormous, even at 10am and then it was difficult to see the exhibits due to the volume of people inside. Particularly distasteful was being directed to a ‘colleague’ immediately after bag checking whose job was to ask for a donation. This felt misleading and unnecessarily pressurised as there were the usual drop points for donations at the entrance."
"Written January 4, 2020",Simply too crowded,"There was a long q to get into the museum slowed down with bag checks.  After you get in, you won’t be able to enjoy the exhibits bec of the crowds and children running around.  The worst area of congestion was understandably the Egyptian mummies.  The glass display panels were clouded with handprints as everyone wanted an up close and personal encounter with the mummies. The q for the shops was equally bad as well as the q to use the loo.  It was a crazy crowded experience which I did not enjoy at all."
"Written September 28, 2021",Totally disappointing.,"We were absolutely gutted with disappointment from this renowned museum.After the 30-minute security queue, we entered the main hall and were immediately struck by an intense heat. It was 30 degrees outside and the museum's a/c were struggling. Bigtime!Strolling through the countless galleries, it was apparent we've arrived to what is mainly an Egyptian and Babylonian exhibition, which we found not too interesting.Shockingly enough, we gave up and left an hour later."
"Written January 2, 2020",Maybe the most important museum in the world,"The British Museum is worth visiting for one piece alone, the Rosetta Stone. This is what unlocked the mysteries of the hieroglyphs and the world of ancient Egypt end the Pharaohs. If this piece isn't enough there is the Elgin Marbles from Parthenon in Athens. If you want more there is Cleopatras mummy. The list is long, but go see it if not only for the Rosetta Stone. The visit is free of charge, you may donate money when you get in if you want. The museum is open Friday evening, and if you go around 7PM the biggest crowds have gone for dinner. The thing that makes my grade 4/5, and not 5, is that the signs are so and so (you will find the bathrooms downstairs with entrance from the shop in the great hall, and not as arrows indicate up the stairs), that there is not the best access if you ar in a wheelchair or on crutches, and that there are sometimes just to many people to be able to enjoy the things properly."
"Written January 9, 2020",Didn't have a game plan! ,"This is a must see as part of a London itinerary. The museum is massive and we found our selves wandering into rooms without a clear plan of what to see. Of course, the Egyptian Wing was one of our goals I am sure we missed other treasures. Easy to get overwhelmed take a few breaks and use the elevator if your feet hurt like mine. "
"Written October 31, 2020",Overcrowded,We went to the Tantra exhibition. They were letting people queue and enter regardless of time slot once inside it was super crowded and packed. You'd never know we are in the middle of a pandemic. It wasn't safe and we left as it was impossible to manage safe distancing. Very disappointing. The museum itself doesn't have clear one way systems eg arrows on the floor so this was adding to the general confusion
"Written March 10, 2020",World Class Collection of Antiquities,"World class museum with an amazing collection of artifacts, artworks, and treasures from every corner of the world.  Apart from the collection, the building itself is beautiful, with the King’s Library being a highlight.One could easily spend an entire day here.  The displays are very informative, and many of the items on display are not available for view in other museums (even in other large cities).  In my mind there were serious questions about the methods in which some of the items were acquired, and the museum was quite crowded, but it was still worth the visit."
"Written April 13, 2020",My last Visit Was 50 Years Ago,Due to the World wide shut in my visit to this wonderful museum was by the internet and much different to my frequent trips as a boy to this wonderful time machine that took me around the World. Showing me great works of art and beauty and great civilizations that came and went over time. My expeditions with my best mate at the age of 8 began with a 2 or 3 hr walk with my school bag full of bread and butter sandwiches and a fizzy drink and a very early start due to the distance we had to walk from the east end of London .The vidio  was very good and i am planing on visiting 12 other great museums this week.
"Written August 8, 2021","Japan, Books and Death","Upon arriving in London, my friend and I were unsure what to do and where to go while we waited for our other friends to arrive. We decided to go to the British Museum because there were several exhibitions there which interested us. We arrived at the front entrance and were horrified at the sight of the queues. We then saw a sign directing us towards a back entrance, so we walked around the block to a much quieter one. We didn't have to queue at all - a quick scan of the bags and that was it, we were in! We visited the Japanese exhibition first which was really interesting, followed by a quick tour of the Egyptians, Africans and a room all about death. We then went to the shop which had lots on offer - we left with a couple of books between us. Overall, a good experience. Lots of different types of exhibitions to keep lots of different types of people entertained. I would argue this isn't really a museum for children as opposed to the Natural History Museum, and be aware you can't take wheeled suitcases."
"Written January 11, 2022",A Londoner's favourite London attraction,"I think the British Museum is amazing, i've been here many times over the years yet I feel I still haven't seen it all. This place is huge and covers a great diversity of regions and points in history. I would recommend just focusing on the particular galleries you want to see as it's too big to do it all at once. The best bit about it is that it's free, which I think is very important as lower income people shouldn't be priced out of getting to experience all this cultural heritage. Also I must say it's great going now because there aren't as many tourists about! - I did find it could get overly crowded sometimes in pre-Covid times. So this is the ideal time to go.Looking forward to my next visit!"
"Written August 17, 2023",Excellent exhibits but gift shop employee tried to scam us :(,"Great exhibits and queues moved quickly, seating was sparse. The gift shop manager(?) (blonde-ish man in purple shirt) overcharged us for a small unframed painting 'print', charged us £9.99 instead of £4.99, and when we asked him about it, instead of fixing the mistake he gaslit us into thinking that we'd somehow picked out the only higher quality one in the entire shop. Every display with these prints showed £4.99. He tried to convince us that another costumer had put a more expensive one on the rack of cheaper ones. However he failed to show us a single display that had these prints for sale for £9.99. Today we checked the museum website and found that there are two different quality prints however the higher quality one wasn't £9.99. It is very clear that we were overcharged and he was too stubborn to admit that he was wrong, and opted to argue with a costumer and leave his till which had a very long queue. Truly a horrible person I hope never to have the displeasure of meeting again. Terrible end to an otherwise wonderful day."
"Written January 28, 2020",History of the World at the British,"I got there for opening time and this turned out to be a good move to avoid the crowds, which didn't take long to appear.  I'd visited before but still couldn't resist heading to the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles as priorities before wandering through this vast enclave of world history.  My museum staying power is usually limited to around 2 hours before I weary, but 2.5 hours whooshed by before I got my belly call and exited for lunch.  An absolute must when you are in London."
"Written October 23, 2020",A long one-way walk through,"Having booked in advance, it was straightforward to  follow the arrows and see their selection of pieces from ancient times up to more recent.  You can leave the trail at intervals to have a cup of tea or go round the shop, then rejoin the path where you left off.  It's a good way to sample what the Museum has to offer."
"Written January 23, 2020","Great musuem, a must!","Went there on a Sunday morning. We did not wait for a long time to get in.It is very easy to visit and, as we wanted to spend only a limited time we found the object trails defined by the museum. It is easy & great to follow, I do recommend."
"Written February 14, 2020",Very good 90 minute tour with Mandy,"We did an amazing 90 minute highlights tour with Mandy, who is a truly excellent guide. She was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable and made the experience special. There is a wide range of exhibits in this museum and one could spend days roaming the museum halls."
"Written January 25, 2020",Amazing visit to an inconic museum,"First opened to the public in 1759, the museum buildings have been built, expanded, and rebuilt several times over 250 years. The architecture of this amazing building never ceases to inspire.  Largely developed as a result of the expansion of the British Empire, the British Museum has a permanent collection of some eight million works.  Some of the top items include the Rosetta Stone, The Lewis Chessmen, Egyptian statues and much more.  Read our full review at testedtravel.com"
"Written April 19, 2022","Amazing, gigantic museum!","There is just so much to explore at the British Museum! I recommend you spend a full day there (arrive early to avoid queues). Still you'll need to pick your favourite sections as the museum is so vast. I particularly recommended exploring the Egyptian section (Rosetta Stone, pharaohs' statues) and the Middle East section (Iran, Assyrian sphinx statues, etc.). Also check out the Lewis Chess set and the Greek section (Partheon and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus). Every culture and era is represented with the most beautiful and fascinating items and statues!"
"Written October 12, 2022",Needs a couple of visits,There is so much to see at that I strongly recommend a couple of visits to the museum. After a few hours the brain starts to become overwhelmed with information and visual stimulation...Greatly enjoyed the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles. (we later visited the Acropolis Museum in Athens to see the rest)Focused on early Greek and Roman exhibits and were not disappointed. Outstanding.
"Written February 8, 2020",Excellent visit.,Came on quick trip to London to visit Troy exhibition at British Museum. It was worth the trip.  Excellent exhibition which meant a lot to both of us firstly because we have visited the ancient site of Troy and  some sites in Greece associated with this period also because my husband is a classics student and has always been interested in this area of ancient history.  This was a very well put together exhibition with lots of exhibits.  We always visit the museum when we come to London always something to see whether or not there are exhibitions on. Great gift and bookshops also.
"Written February 1, 2020",Sharing culture with a colleague ,"I had my operations director fly in from India for a review meeting and rather then share the delights of a rented office, I decided to hold our meeting at the British Museum while looking at the amazing artefacts. We walked the main galleries which are stunning and we had a very successful meeting.The artefacts really demonstrate the ingenuity of human kind and are humbling."
"Written August 21, 2022",One of the world's must see museums,"This is a large museum and can seem overwhelming. The staff is excellent and will always help with suggestions and directions. The gift shop and bookstore are excellent. Entry is free, but most visitors leave 5 pounds or such as a donation. To see all of the museum, plan two or three visits."
"Written March 5, 2020",Always a pleasure,"Quick call in on way back to train after an overnight stay. No matter how many times you go, there is always something new to see and the quiet within the museum is always a joy away from the hubbub of the city. Could always spend more time here"
"Written February 1, 2020",Amazing collection and free to enter,"I took a 14-year old child who found the mummies and Elgin Marbles very impressive.  The majority of galleries open at 10am, although you can gain access to the building before that.  The covered atrium is a feat of modern engineering.  There is good interpretation"
"Written November 28, 2021","A Magnificent Collection of Mummies, Antiquities and Art",The British Museum can easily hold its own with Le Louvre and the Smithsonians when it comes to ancient artifacts and history.  The Egyptology section is overwhelming in its presentation of mummies and items that date to the time of the Pharoahs.  The displays are informative and endlessly fascinating.The depth of the museum is impressive and easily worth a multi-day trip.
"Written September 27, 2022",More than worth while - if you take your time,"After several trips to London this was our first time at the British Museum - and definitely not our last. As with other major and leading museums across the globe you either need to schedule several hours for your visit - or focus on specific parts of the exhibition. With around eight million objects, the number of items and antiquities from all eras of human history is mind-blowing, with the highlights certainly being the collection of Egyptian mummies and the Rosetta Stone. A personal highlight were the The Africa Galleries. Definitely worth more than one (two, three) visits for everyone vaguely interested in mankind's history and culture."
"Written February 12, 2020",A tour around the world in 90 minutes,I had already visited the Museum a long time ago. This guided tour was an opportunity to review the marvels that the British Museum has to show us and also the new additions in terms of building and exhibits. An excellent guide.A wonderful Museum ti visit again and again.
"Written March 3, 2020",Enchanting place,"We went to see the Rosetta stone and found many other wonderful things. There are so many areas with interesting artefacts that it would take several visits to see the majority of the collections. They have free tours, and entrance to the main exhibition galleries is free. However there are not enough or any disabled toilets on each level and also not enough women’s toilets, the queue was all the way up the stairs. It’s better to visit during the week, wouldn’t recommend in the weekend, it’s way too crowded."
"Written May 6, 2020",All you ever wanted to know about English History,The museum is an expanse of British history with multiple floors covering many acres of ground.  Entry is free though a donation of 5 pounds is requested and expected.  Roman occupation of England features prominently.  One could spend days here studying this incredible documentation.  Very informative.
"Written August 20, 2021",Nero Exhibition August 2021,"We bought tickets for the Nero exhibition.  The online process was fast and simple.  We queued up along the street with visitors to the main (free of charge) museum but that didnt take long.  Then it was a fast trip down an empty queue lane to the place where they check your bags.So, here i was amazed.  There were staff stood behind tables and I walked up, perhaps without thinking too much and showed my ticket.  I was promptly told in a very rude tone that it was a ""bag search"".  Not ""please can i inspect your bag"".  Anyway, had i not been with my daughter I would have called this official out there and then and demanded a discussion with his manager.  So we are not off to a promising start.And so into the exhibition itself.  First, the staff were brilliant and friendly and helpful and cheerful.  This restored my faith in our trip.And so to the artifacts.  Wow - for a Rome enthusiast like me it was brilliant.  There were busts, statues, jewelry, mosaics, weapons, coins etc.  All with excellent background context.  The lighting is done to perfection, really bringing out the subtle details of this magnificent exhibition.  We finished in just over an hour and I could happily have gone round again but my daughter looked like she had seen enough and so we left.  This exhibition is brilliant for any Rome enthusiast.  Also, the stated aim is to challenge whether Nero was the ghastly creature history sees him as.  When you look at the information in the exhibition it seems far from clear cut that he was the monster described.  Indeed, plenty of indicators to the contrary.  Highly recommended."
"Written September 2, 2021","Fantastic day out, skip the cafe","We visited the British Museum in August. It was easy to get to via public transport and wow, the building is SO impressive! We were wide eyed before we'd even seen any of the exhibits.Security and bag checks were nice and quick and the staff in the museum were helpful. The food in the cafe was definitely an acquired taste, and if you're visiting with children I'd advise eating before or afterwards, or bringing a picnic if allowed, because it was very expensive.Walking straight in to see the Rosetta Stone was jaw dropping, we had no idea it was there but we explained it to our 7 year old who was equally thrilled. She is history mad and was in her element wandering through the Egypt and Assyria exhibits with her camera, reading the signs to anyone who would listen.It was a shame that so many exhibits were closed, we would have loved to have seen more Greek artefacts, but it gave us time to see the brilliant Life and Death exhibit which is truly unmissable. The exhibit in the center of the room with the medication and the photographs around it is quite emotional really.The gift shop is full of very creative gifts as well as great books, perfect for history nerds like us!"
"Written January 5, 2020",Amazing Artifacts and Exhibits ,This free museum is a must-do for any visit to London. The history found in this immense building is phenomenal and breathtaking. You will need a minimum of 2-3 hours just to see the highlights like the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles and make your way thru the crowds. 
"Written August 4, 2021",An excellent way to spend most of a day with one gripe,"I visited the British Museum whilst solo travelling in London and pretty much had an excellent time. The queuing system to get in moved very quickly and was very efficient. It had been years upon years since I last visited and I was reminded how well presented the whole museum is. Spotlessly clean, organised really well and easy to navigate. All of the galleries and exhibitions I visited were immensely enjoyable and interesting. I have to disagree with a review left down below saying it's boring for kids. I was travelling solo but I saw many families with kids having a really fun day out and clearly enjoying what they were seeing and the history. Which is always nice to see kids engaging with history.The Cafe which I visited twice was of a good quality, with friendly staff, a little on the pricey side but it's to be expected, it's London, it's the British Museum but the food and coffee was of a very good quality so wasn't as fussed. Their deal to come back in the afternoon and get a free Coffee with a cake is a very good deal too. Good thinking whoever came up with that!My only real gripe was the cost for the temporary exhibitions. I was interested to see the temporary Nero exhibition they had but was put of by the £20 price for only one temporary exhibition. It's not a case that I'm tight. I would have happily paid tenner easily and I did spend money in the gift shop and cafe. It's just £20 for one exhibition rubbed me up the wrong way a little. But otherwise all in all had a highly interesting and enjoyable couple of hours at the British Museum and glad after so long I finally visited again!"
"Written January 15, 2020",Innovative history on display,"The majority of Museums in London are free of charge on entry (V&A) with the exception of crown properties (Kensington Palace, Tower of London).  This Museum was ""renovated"" for the Milleneum with a covered space which provides a sense of a piazza which includes food options and gift shops.  Take advantage of the coat check - England has rainy weather and they do not want you dripping in the display areas.  The Parthenon Marbles (formerly referred to as the Elgin Marbles) are definitely not to be missed.  A great place to explore for several hours."
"Written February 5, 2020","Lots of exhibits, badly organized","I made the mistake of visiting the british museum after the Louvre, compared to the Louvre it is messy, dull, dark, and its audio guide is useless at bestYou would have fun if you just like seeing an artifact in 10 seconds, take a picture and move on .. the museum has a ton of exhibits.But if you like to actually know the history line connecting each era then it is not very amusing, it is frustrating actually with all the randomness placing the artifacts and very little useful information in the audio guide.Also I was shocked to see many ancient treasures being displayed with no casing or protection, and little kids scratching and playing all around them. Just Imagine a very delicate statue being carved thousands of years ago travelling through time to reach this museum and a young man scratching it with his fingers carelessly to see how it feels??"
"Written September 6, 2020",Lots to see but too crowded,We booked a slot to come on a Sunday and the initial impression was that it was very quiet. There is a one way route around the ground floor which is the only one open. There is still a lot to see - certainly half a day at least - but once we got to where the exhibits were we found it to be uncomfortably crowded and hard to maintain social distancing plus quite a few people were wandering around with masks pulled down. Lots of staff but no-one says anything.
"Written January 23, 2020",Fascinating,"The British Museum is one of the most fascinating experiences in London. I visited the Museum on the first Friday of April for four hours in the late afternoon and early evening. The Reading Room in the center of the Museum is incredibly beautiful and historically significant; the new enclosure surrounding it is stunning. The Museum's collections are fabulous - I only saw the Roman, Roman Britain and the Medieval areas during my brief visit. You should plan to see only a small portion of the collections during your visit - plan ahead and you'll have a great time. The shops and the cafe were also very good!"
"Written March 7, 2020",Definitely a must if you come London,"It's been over 10 years since I visited the British Museum and doesnt disappoint no matter how many times you go. A friend visiting from abroad enjoyed the many cultures that is captured here, and its definitely for someone who enjoys history and pretty for those art trips from school. Can be a bit boring for kids thou, but the scones at the cafe look super tasty if you get hungry just looking around. Remember to look up when you go inside, the glass ceiling is just spectacular and breathtaking."
"Written October 23, 2020",A fantastic museum doing its best with Covid,"The British Museum is one of the top museums in the world. Not only does it house some of the world’s most important pieces but there is both a depth and width to its collection.The museum has reopened after lockdown however most of the collection isn’t on view (most of what’s normally on view - most of the collection isn’t on view normally). What you get to see is a mixture of the best of the best - things like the Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone - and some things that just happened to be on a suitable, one way, route through part of the museum.Whilst what you can see is incredibly important you can’t see everything that you might want.I’ve been to the British Museum before and will certainly return. However I’ve now seen their post lockdown offering so I’m waiting until much more of the museum is open again."
"Written April 26, 2020","Great way to spend a rainy day, or sunny for that matter","Amazing museum, sop much to see you can easily spend the whole day just wandering around and having a snack in cafe or restaurant inside the museum. Also the building itselself is beautiful. Easy to reach as well."
"Written February 8, 2022",Disappointed,"I joined British Museum membership a month ago, I was told that the membership card will be posted to me, and I still not receive it yet. Sent a few emails and left message on their facebook page, totally useless, can't believe this is how they treat their member. If you thinking of joining their memberaship, think again."
"Written August 6, 2023","Waste of money, you dont even need to buy a ticket...",The website states you need to buy a ticket and come at your allocated time slot as to not over crowd the museum...There is no one to check tickets...so you can walk right in (wasted money there) The place is over crowded so you're finding yourself pushed up against walls and monuments.Tour guides being groups push and shove you out of the way...100% avoid this place 
"Written September 6, 2022",World Class Collections...excellent shops.,"I will not comment on the collections except to write that there is something for everyone. Wandering  around galleries by chance may bring delightful  surprises and discoveries but I think that reading in advance about the collections  in advance of a visit is advisable.  Leaving aside the collections displayed  I single out the excellence of the shops - they  hold ranges of varied, desirable, and affordable,  stock suitable for all ages."
"Written March 30, 2020",WOW,"This place is huge and full of wonderful things. For free!!The building itself is impressive.There is a small section with something from last century however this museum is best for people who love ancient history, you could easily spend hours there."
"Written February 11, 2020",Fascinating visit,"Whether you’re on a solo visit, with friends or family, the British Museum is always a great stop on your tour of London. There’s so much to see. Entrance was fairly quick through the security tent. Picking your time to visit may be sensible to avoid busy periods. "
"Written June 23, 2020",A must see!,"This is an exceptional museum that I easily spent an entire day visiting. The works cover multiple styles, time periods and geographical area. The staff is professional, helpful and friendly. Visitors can easily go from one gallery to the next while going thru the museum and not have to double back to set to a missed gallery."
"Written October 1, 2020",Peace in the British Museum,Excellent time to visit BM as so quiet. Only ground floor open and you follow a trail finsihing at the de Waal pavilion housing books in exile. BM usually so crowded so lovely to be able to enjoy it in peace and discover objects that one would usually not notice.
"Written February 24, 2020",Take an active approach -- don't just wander,"The BM is one of the great museums of the world, but if you don't have a strategy for your visit, you will not enjoy it as much. The place is something of a warehouse, so wandering around won't do much for you. If you have a specific interest, do a bit of research first. Or take a guided tour or see a current exhibition. A little bit of homework will make your visit more memorable."
"Written April 8, 2022",Not as cool as the hype,"The British Museum is an iconic museum, with many fascinating exhibits. However, they are over-hyped in my opinion. For example, the Parthenon Museum in Athens displays Greek history better than the BM's Elgin Marbles. It is sad to think that most exhibits in this museum were stolen/looted from the UK's colonial times. You can definitely spend an entire day there (like myself). The food from the cafe was reasonably priced (for London) and had a variety of options. However, I am much more impressed with The Met in NYC or other world-class museums I have been to."
"Written October 24, 2020",Small but perfectly formed,"Visited with my daughter today and really enjoyed our time there. Everything is well organised and apart from a few bad eggs, mask wearing and social distancing were adhered to. It’s a beautiful building but there was a lot less to see than I anticipated - that being said we had a really good time. "
"Written January 7, 2020",One of the World's best,"I love the Bristish Museum,  It is home to the Rosetta stone, mummies, Samoan funerary rites, ancient roman relics. But what I love is they always put on brilliant exhibitions.  The scythian exhibit a few years ago was phenomenal, ANcient Egypt, terracotta army.  I was slightly underwhelmed by Troy - it is good, but really only if you don't much about the Illiad or Odyssey.  I wanted to know about the modern dsy site - cn I visit it? What will I find there.Anyway, that is one exhibition.  I have seen dozens here and remembered them for ever.  Higly recommend.  Go during week - it is less crowded."
"Written January 2, 2020","Rosetta Stone, Greek and Egyptian Artifacts, Oh My!","Very cool museum. You can see the world-famous Rosetta Stone right as you enter the Egyptian pavilion. The stone is amazing, and people are good about taking their couple of pictures and moving on so you can take your couple of pictures. The rest of the museum is very nice, as well as the gift shop. Recommended for older kids only. Younger kids would be bored."
"Written January 24, 2020",‘Troy’ exhibit,"A lot of pots, amazing, would recommend. Explore the amazing collection of art, looking at the fantastical myth based off Homer’s epic poetry, all on loads and loads of pots of varying size and shape of pot. 5 stars."
"Written June 7, 2022",A museum to visit again and again,We spent 2 hours at the British Museum and this is one attraction that is not to be missed. There is plenty for you to see and learn. Definitely come prepared with an idea of which rooms you want to visit; if you decide on the day of you will feel overwhelmed. Our visit was 2 hours and it was only enough time to see the artifacts and objects displayed in 2 rooms!
"Written July 5, 2023",Hot and hectic,Possibly our fault but we didn't expect the museum to be rammed on a rainy Tuesday in early July. We had to queue a while to get in and once inside was absolutely heaving. Had no chance of getting near the Rosetta Stone and getting bodily barged out of the way in the mummies display was a highlight!One of our party felt faint from the heat and had to go outside to cool off - this was particularly noticeable on the upper floors. We'd spent several hundred pounds getting to London and we left feeling very deflated and somewhat moist!
"Written August 31, 2020",Not all open,"Love this place but a great deal of it it is not yet open. No mummies, the asias or english portions open, some parts of greek ect not available.not worth the long journey to see half the museum minus some of the best artifacts "
"Written January 4, 2020",I could die here.,"I'm not kidding. I love the British Museum. I could die happily in any of those galleries. The Egyptian, Sumerian, Greek, Indian, Chinese, and Roman exhibitions are second to none. Only could the greatest empire in human history collect the greatest artifacts and relics from all over the world to display, for free, in a building that is worthy of the collection. Fantastic place to see real history from all over the world."
"Written February 4, 2020",Impressive Collection Worth the Visit.,The British Museum is very impressive with its vast collection if antiquities and artifacts dating back to thousand years BC.  The layout is systematic and organized in a way that you do not feel as crowded as with the visiting the Louvre. We thoroughly enjoy our visit.
"Written February 20, 2020",Great museum ,It's a great museum. It's a bit sad though the fact that so many great art pieces and sculptures from other countries are being displayed at this museum and not their place of origin. Watch it is almost always very busy! 
"Written October 26, 2023",Great museum,"This is a fabulous if overwhelming museum. The tickets are free but we made a timed entry reservation in advance for the earliest slot. When we arrived, the queue was around the block, but it moved fast once doors opened. We followed the 1-hour ""highlights"" tour found on the museum website. It was a good way to see a good portion of the museum as we walked through while keeping somewhat of a focus, as you could easily spend 3 days here. They also have an extensive gift shop. Definitely worth a visit!"
"Written October 3, 2021",A must for all who visit London,"The British Museum is a must for anyone who visits London. The collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, amongst others, is amazing. Unfortunately we were unable to see the Parthenon Frieze as it was being remodeled. The museum was pretty empty due to COVID so we could finally see everything without hoards of people. The timed tickets also help with this. One room that you do not want to miss is the Clock Room - go at the top of the hour so you can hear all of the clocks chime at once. Though it is the British Museum, the museum is not British history but what the British brought back from travels/expeditions around the world."
"Written February 10, 2020",History on a plate ,"Yet another must-see museum in London. It never fails to impress or teach me something new. It has some controversial items, such as Elgin Marbles, that are claimed by their countries of origin so not easy to have a clear moral standpoint but still not a reason to prevent you from seeing this excellent collection of human achievements throughout history. "
"Written October 29, 2020",Not everything accessible,We pre booked our ticket online and walked in without waiting.  It was great to be able to see things without the usual scrum but I was really disappointed at the large amount of galleries that weren't accessible at the moment - but understand the guidelines have to be followed.  Only 1 set of toilets were open which meant a lengthy queue.  Could the museum ask some of its staff to be more friendly - the young man doing the bag searches was mono syllabic at best and some of the others inside weren't much better.  But - we enjoyed our visit and well done to the museum for what they are doing in difficult circumstances.
"Written March 3, 2020",Great museum,A wonderful museum with fantastic treasures. Best to plan a visit and focus on particular areas - including some of the smaller quieter rooms with specialist collections. Avoid wet days - it gets very busy.
"Written February 17, 2020",A classical museum,The British museum is a must seen in London. It houses very important artefacts showing the genius of mankind numerous civilisations. The little downside in my opinion would be a too classical approach to museology. It sometimes lacks the more immersive and interactive experience of other museums of London.
"Written March 12, 2023",Awe-inspiring.,"This is a huge museum, of which only a tiny part can be seen on any one visit.The permanent collections are magnificent and like other similar institutions there is a rolling programme of temporary exhibitions, some of which are charged for (the museum itself has free entry).I recently visited specifically for the superb ‘Hieroglyphs’ exhibition, and come here about 4 times a year. I wish I could visit every week; it’s one of the World’s great museums and should be first on the list for any visitor to London interested in human history and culture."
"Written February 14, 2020",Something for everyone,"Many,  perhaps most, of its exhibits do not concern Britain.  It is a museum built to help the British, and visitors, learn about all sorts of things.  I had hoped for more exhibits on ancient Britain, but was pleased with the exhibits on ancient Rome, ancient Greece,  and China.   "
"Written March 27, 2023",Endlessly fascinating museum,Entry to the British Museum is free so you don't need to spend all day - you can come back another time. I visited many times when I lived in London and have been back on many return trips to London. This time we spent just an hour and looked at some Ancient Egyptian objects and some artefacts from the so-called Dark Ages. There is plenty for future visits! The back entrance is much less busy than the main one. Worth remembering when it is raining.
"Written February 14, 2020",Quick visit having previously worked at the Museum,Just popped in as worked at the Museum many years ago.  It’s an amazing place still. It’s great it’s still a free Museum and open to everyone.  Having visited several Museums in Europe it was noticeable that I didn’t see any labels to the artefacts in French or German they were just in English.  Worth visiting even if you only have an hour to spare.  
"Written February 15, 2020",Head to the Japanese room,"Fabulous building with amazing exhibits.  This time I visited the Japanese room which is one of the more remote areas of the museum, but worth the trip up the stairs.  One of the star pieces is a suit of Samurai armour which is so intricate and beautiful. "
"Written November 11, 2021",It’s free and it’s great,"I was slightly over faced by the amount of impressive exhibits in the museum and have resolved to come back when I have more time to explore properly. Enjoyed the Lewis Chessmen (gallery 40) and the Rosetta Stone, plus the Egyptian mummies. Would suggest focusing on a few galleries rather than wandering aimlessly as we did! Clock room wasn’t operational so had to carry our coats which was a pain. Estimate 50% of guests were wearing masks."
"Written March 9, 2020",Impressive Collection,"We visited here last week on our impromptu trip to London.  It has free entry which is brilliant and a vast array of collections from all around the world, with the highlight undoubtedly being the Mummies of Egypt. They are marvelous and seeing the remains so well preserved, along with the mummy of Cleopatra, it is a must see!It was exceptionally busy in the Mummies section but other than that it was brill. The foyer itself is awe inspiring, and really takes you back in terms of an architecture perspective!"
"Written March 5, 2020",Wonderful to see these priceless artefacts ,"I never fail to be in awe of the workmanship of these huge carved artworks from 2,000+ years ago. The Hall with Ancient Greek reliefs at one end and Asyrian gates still the other with Egyptian statues set out wonderfully through the centre. What’s not to love. We are so privileged to have these to see for free in our city."
"Written August 10, 2021",A must-see London attraction.,"I'm sire many other reviewers have discussed the merits of the museum exhibits so I just wanted to add a quick note about accessibility.  The museum offers wheelchairs to people with disabilities.  Their website asks for people to reserve in advance, but due to poor planning on our part, we didn't get it done.  No worries though.  The staff was able to provide one for my wife, who walks with a cane.  Because of this kind gesture she was able to enjoy a much longer and more thorough visit than she normally would have done.  So glad they have thought of this."
"Written May 12, 2022",Go with a plan of what you want to see,"So much to see and most artifacts are from Foreign countries so not sure why it's called the British Museum. I would recommend going with a plan otherwise you'll end up walking around aimlessly like I did. Found some very interesting things to look at. I found the creation of money from the beginning to now, particularly good"
"Written March 2, 2020",Brilliant and free,"I have been here several times over the years. There is a vast range of artifacts ranging from pre history to modern day.Considering this museum is free it's fantastic, They could charge and it would be totally fair. This place is educational for everyone and certainly shouldn't be missed."
"Written January 18, 2020",Choose your exhibits,You could spend days there as there is so much information artifacts and pieces of history. Lots to see and read and amazing insights in the past. Always busy and its free except certain special exhibits  
"Written December 30, 2020","Beautiful, must see museum!",I went before we had tier 4 in London and I felt incredibly safe and socially distanced. The artefacts in each room were just breathtaking and take you through many different civilisations. The entrance is just beautiful! For any history lover I advise that this is the museum you see if you visit London. As a Londoner I'm super surprised to took me so long to come and see it for myself. The Egyptian artefacts in particular are beautiful. A must see in London!
"Written January 3, 2020",One of the best historcial museums in the world,"Firstly, it's free. But please contribute towards its maintenance as they have assembled some of the most extensive pieces of ancient history I have ever seen. The Rosetta Stone is of course the pride of this museum but if you like ancient Egyptian, Assyrian even Chinese jade history, this is the place for you. For a first timer, you can probably cover it in 4-5 hours with some amount of reading. But if you really want to dig deep, the fact that it is free means you can do a couple of half days and really absorb these fragments of the ancient world. The museum is also family friendly with enough toilets located at the main hall."
"Written March 5, 2020",Excellent day out,"We walked to the museum from Kensington which took about 15 minutes. We entered the museum from the entrance opposite the science museum as it was less busy. There were massive queues at the main entrance which surprised us. We managed to get in after about 15 minutes which was pretty good. The museum was interesting, well signposted inside with plenty of areas to eat and drink. My young daughter was fascinated by the main hallway as it was the scene of the Children’s BBC series Andy’s dinosaur adventures.   "
"Written March 16, 2022","Fabulous treasures in an uninspiring, boring setting","I visited here yesterday and was excited about seeing the Sutton Hoo treasures.  However, when I found the room where these magnificent historical finds were displayed, I was disappointed in the boring and uninspiring layout.  In fact, the whole museum was uninspiring and certainly the whole venue could make more effort in bringing fabulous treasures to life.  For example, more visuals to show how the area of Sutton Hoo might have looked in Anglo Saxon times.  Information about how the burial ship made it to its final resting place.  I wandered around a couple of other rooms and then left feeling that this has to be the most un-interactive museum I have visited.  I'm going to Sutton Hoo this summer (Suffolk) and hope the National Trust have made a better job of telling the story than has been done at the British Museum."
"Written January 25, 2020",Quite disapointed,May be I had too much expectations...You will have much more nice greek statues to see in the National Archeologic museum of Naples as well as Egyptian antiquities.I liked  the renaissance and the Mesopotamia department  On the first floor I found a very interesting.
"Written July 3, 2021",Must see and appreciate,"Had a short wander around on a Friday afternoon. I've been a few times before and still took two hours so recommend you schedule in time. If you're bringing children, I imagine hard to maintain interest in all the collections. Covid managed very well, I actually quite like the one way system to help manage your way round :-) The amazing items and history here is phenomenal and whilst still arguably this isn't their home(s) I think it is really important these artefacts are valued and appreciated whilst they are here - and I think the British Museum do a good job of that as well as providing context. I think some context in some areas needs to be  updated to better reflect our knowledge of history today but there are signs to reflect that too. "
"Written May 15, 2020",amazing collection,"when you walk in, you notice the light change and this massive column holding up a really cool glass ceiling. feels like a spaceship in some ways, even though the outside is serious and robust. a treat!"
"Written June 22, 2021",Old is Gold,"Where do I even begin?! I mean, it's all just so incredibly amazing. Not only is this museum one of the hugest that I've ever seen before, it's also FREE to visit and filled with so many stunning art pieces. No wonder it's one of the world's most visited museums!"
"Written March 2, 2022",A huge overpriced disappointment,"World of Stonehenge. My birthday, venture out of covid world to the BM for a treat.  The exhibition room was packed, made us feel very uncomfortable and exposed. We wear masks in public places, we know it’s not obligatory but still…the BM appeared to be making up for lost revenue by packing ‘em in. Not good. I have commented on previous exhibitions about lack of seating and small fonts on explanations. Nothing changes with the BM, it appears. So if you are a bit crumbly and / or visual impairment you are not going to enjoy this. The poor signage means that people occupy space trying to read stuff that if in larger font would make life easier and transit faster.We expected an exhibition largely about Stonehenge…it was just about everything but Stonehenge. It had lots of lovely artefacts from northern and Western Europe but very little that was from the Stonehenge area. We expected construction, phases, timelines, possible uses, local populations, the speculated rituals etc etc. Very disappointed and highly unimpressed with the BM management consideration of disability needs. We left early."
"Written August 30, 2022",Mummies and Treasures Abound!,"The British Museum has something for everyone. My family of 2 adults and 2 teens started with an extra out-of-hours tour which provided a quiet overview in the book room prior to opening. Afterwards we all split up to see the museum at our leisure, and despite having all different interests all 4 of us easily ate up the 2 hours we had before we met again. My favorites were the mummies, the treasures of Sutton Hoo (a treasure trove discovered by a farmer) and the bog man, a naturally preserved mummy that in my opinion isn't given the notoriety he deserves (you can see his red beard and hair up close). There's a small snackbar in the atrium and a very good book store."
"Written November 16, 2022",A good free experience,"Although we didn't have much time to spend here, it was still a great experience considering it was free. We went on a weekday afternoon and it wasn't insanely busy, but some sections were crowded (especially the Egyptian mummy exhibits). We were disappointed that the Rosetta Stone had been moved into an exhibition that you had to pay for, but it was still good to see a replica. My main reason for not giving 5 stars is that the maps were incredibly confusing, and we wasted a good deal of time trying to find particular rooms, such as the Chinese jade collection. Also be aware that not every lift goes to every floor, so you may have to do a lot of walking across the building to find a lift that goes to your desired floor."
"Written November 22, 2022",Hieroglyphs unlocking ancient Egypt - not autism friendly,"The Hieroglyphs exhibition is very good, i.e. very good exhibits and descriptions plus interactive features. However, the continuous various sounds coming from the speakers in different parts of the exhibition are overwhelming and make it very difficult to concentrate. The worst part is the changting / prayer in Coptic which gave me a headache and made me want to leave as soon as possible. The following rooms had even more noisy sounds mixing together. I'm autistic and do not recommend it to neurodivergent people. Advice for the Brtish Museum: it would really help if you could switch some of the sounds off or reduce the frequency, the worst one is a priest's chanting in Coptic, it goes on and on what's extremely irritating and exhausting."
"Written September 11, 2020",Back with some limitations ,"Happy to be back to one of my favourite museums ever, even in this post-lockdown situation. The main collections open are on the ground floor with the Ancient Egyptian and Greek rooms with splendid artefacts. It would be nice to be back again when more rooms are open to the public. "
"Written July 26, 2023",Disappointing because of crowds,"Some of artefacts within the museum are amazing, and our visit was 2 hours long, if you want to learn as much as possible then you would need to allow more time.The issue is the crowds, just too many people. A few people were disappointed as they had booked a time but had to line up with everyone else until they got in the gate, where they had another line until the check area where we all came together again, so really a complete waste of time booking.Inside it’s difficult to stand back to admire the artefacts because of the amount of people. Its a pity the numbers are not capped. Basically we were glad to leave because of this."
"Written January 5, 2021",Amazing Museum,British Museum always worth a visit no matter how many times you have already visited it. Huge collection well displayed and it offers fun for every age and interest.Another good reason for visit it? It is for free (permanet collection).
"Written September 6, 2022",The World is Here,"You can't take in the Museum in one visit--it's best to choose some highlights.  There are exhibits from all over the world and the museum is making efforts to acknowledge and deal with the colonial/imperial aspects of some of it.  Favourite for me is the Sutton Hoo display and the Enlightenment Rooms.  Tip:  Friday is late opening (until 8:30 pm) and is much quieter and less crowded.  It's free, so you can come more than once.  "
"Written October 7, 2020",fantastic,".This museum has a lot of valuable collections from many countries. Perhaps, one of the most essential museum in the global. From Egypt to China, from Rome to Japan. 2 hours visiting is never be enough to explore all museum rooms. Instead, we must spend even some days to get  all collection completely seen..The building is located near other popular museums and Imperial College London. There is no entrance fee to enjoy this magnificent historic place."
"Written October 31, 2022","Lovely museum, but very busy.","We pre-booked online but when we arrived they were still letting non-booked people in too. It was extremely busy but we got through the queue quite quickly, no-one ever scanned our tickets though. The Egyptian section was so busy that you couldn't really see much so we headed to quieter areas instead. It's all well laid out and plenty of information. The central newly covered area is beautiful but they could do with more seating areas as the cafe was full so we sat on the floor to eat our sandwiches purchased at the café. We only had a couple of hours to look around but would definitely go again on our next visit to London. "
"Written August 30, 2020",A must for anyone visiting London.,The British museum houses an extraordinary collection of fascinating artefacts from all over the world. The Egyptian section is fantastic for kids (and adults) there is so much to see. It is beautifully curated and well worth the visit. I could spend days in there.
"Written August 18, 2023",Little boring but interesting,"One of the biggest museums I've visited in my life and I must say it's really big. Full of objects and information about the Egyptian civilization. I must say that anyone who doesn't master the theme or doesn't like it will end up finding it boring (my case). The best, for me, was the gift shop. The most time consuming process was security, since tickets were purchased online"
"Written February 13, 2020",A friend told us about this museum,We stayed right around the corner from the British Museum and had to visit and see what our friend was talking about. The museum had plenty of historic artifacts that covered most of the globe. It was great to see so many people enjoying the sites.
"Written August 23, 2022","Crowded, hot, and underwhelming","While a visit to the British Museum might seem like a ""must do"", I recommend London's many other fine museums instead.  Certainly, the museum has its highlights (like the Rosetta Stone), but the displays were unimpressive.  Most modern museums include more context for what you're seeing...the Churchill War Rooms being a great example of that.    This honestly seemed more like a display of all the things that Britons found on their world travels, like the UK's attic on display.   There are some real treasures here, I just hope that someday they'll be displayed in their proper context."
"Written March 11, 2022",What a place!,"We hadn’t visited the British Museum since childhood and of course therefore, we didn’t recognise it. There is so much to see but there is only so much one can take in at any one time,  so the suggested visit length of 2-3 hours is about right. It is incredibly well curated and all so very interesting that one visit is simply not enough. It was a shame that a couple of the rooms we particularly wanted to see were closed - so, we will keep our fingers crossed for next time. I particularly enjoyed the hall of ‘Enlightenment’, within which the range of items displayed was staggering. We will return!"
"Written October 25, 2023","Great museum, so much to look at. Artefacts from all over the world","There is so much to look at in the museum. Artefacts from all over the world in one place, the museum is absolutely massive and there are so many exhibits. There was no queue when we came, we just had a bag search and then we were in! Would definitely recommend looking at the ancient Egyptians and romans as we found them to be the most interesting, however we didn’t visit all exhibits. Overall a great day out and best of all, its free and they do walk ins! Would definitely recommend for a day out!"
"Written May 18, 2022","A Treasure Trove of Beauty, although shrouded in questionable morality?","We spent a couple hours on our first day here. This is a great place to pass time as you try to push through the jet lag. What's great about the museum is that you can spend hours going in depth and reading about the treasures or you can skim through, dazed and jet lagged and still enjoy the gorgeous trove of artifacts. Despite the foggy morality of the collection, this is a stunning collection of artifacts. I highly recommend following the museums guide on their greatest hits. This place is GIANT, so go in with a plan. It is very easy to get lost among the treasures."
"Written February 21, 2023",Overcrowded,"The building itself is very impressive and the displays inside are brilliant however we didn't get to enjoy very many of them.  It states on their website they are limiting numbers so you can safely enjoy your visit however this is clearly not the case.  When we arrived we were herded into a marquee by security staff for 'bag check' which was a waste of time as they were just glancing at the bags at best and didn't even ask for us to open ours.  There was no checking of timed tickets and if you hadn't booked a ticket you could still walk straight in so i couldn't see why they even asked you to book a ticket.  The museum was very very crowded ( we visited on a weekday in term time), there was no obvious way you were supposed to go around the museum and several closed off areas so you had to double back the way you came which was odd.  To be honest we felt like we were walking around a busy train station rather than a museum.  The Japan section was quieter and had a nicer feel but that was about it.  Shame, we will try somewhere else next time."
"Written January 26, 2020",Fantastic Exhibits,"Sometimes I forget how lucky we are to have free museum access to all of these brilliant places in the UK. We went to see the section on South Asia, being Indian ourselves. Lots of interesting status and accompanying information, made for a good couple of hours. Will be back in the future."
"Written June 27, 2020",A must see in London,"We absolutely loved the breathtaking experience of visiting the British Museum.   The artefacts are truly breathtaking, they are huge, and you genuinely are taken back to the times in which they are from. The building itself is beautiful and even if you are not an avid historian, you will honestly feel amazed in this stunning place.   "
"Written April 7, 2022",British Museum - great day out!,"I took my 2 young nieces to the British museum on 6 April and we thoroughly enjoyed the day.I particularly enjoyed the guided tour of the China gallery (room 33) given by ""Peter"", he was a very good guide. There are lots of guided tours which are free, and last usually around 30 mins, which is not too long for younger children. The family area in the basement with lockers and lunch tables is particularly useful for storing coats and bags.  (and very clean). Highly recommended for a day out on a dodgy weather day!"
"Written June 29, 2021",Free general entry,Quite simply the biggest & most interesting collection of artefacts from around the world making its name somewhat ironic. It’s far from a museum of British history rather a fine art collection of British collectors. It’s not actually that inspiring or even exciting and I could understand why the hordes of primary school children looked completely bored out of their little minds! It is just room after room of set exhibits after all with no interactive elementsZ After a while the exhibits look the same which is a reflection of how alike human civilisations of the past were and how we have  more in common than not today irrespective of where the exhibit originated from. You can spend hours upon hours here reading all the exhibits and listening to the audio information or you can whizz round in just over an hour as we did and still receive a feast for the eyes.
"Written August 1, 2021","From Sutton Hoo to Assyrian reliefs, there's everything here","We went to see the Sutton Hoo exhibits because of The Dig. It's fascinating, not least because it shows the international trading that was taking place even 1500 years ago.We then moved on to look at the Assyrian exhibits. It's amazing to think that you're looking at real materials 3500 years old, and you can see amazing detail in the reliefs.I guess it's obvious, but the British Museum really does justify many visits, not just once for a couple of hours."
"Written February 23, 2020",Excellent,I often revisit and always make for the Assyrian Rooms. The wall panels are interesting if you spend time examining them. Lots of detail. And the shop has many books and other things to buy. But you cannot do the whole museum in one go. It is too big. Another part that is of interest is the Clock collection. I really do recommend that you visit this part of the collections.
"Written July 5, 2023",Only for the British history,"The museum itself was very nice, however, some the exhibits cost an extra fee which not knowing how good they were we did not partake.  The rest of the museum was extensive and the local exhibits of medieval England was on point, though they should clean the jewelry to show off the shine.  The other stuff, you can see in most museums, like mummies etc.  Main point, when England is having a heat wave, this museum is not airconditioned.  "
"Written January 15, 2020",Must See!,A great way to spend half a day. There are lots of amazing things in the collection - so many that it’s difficult to see and properly appreciate them all in one visit. Entrance is by donation and there are lots of options for tours. We went right when it opened and the crowds were very light for the first few hours.
"Written October 19, 2022",A brilliant visit,"This is an absolutely outstanding museum with so much to see, a day simply is not enough to take in the volume of exhibits and information. It’s laid out across 3/4 floors and they are huge, very well maintained and extremely clean.Lots of staff around to help and they have an app which is excellent to give you an idea of each exhibit hall you enter what it relates to. Restaurant and Coffee shop on site and lots of places to rest your weary feet.Enter via the Montague Street entrance if open as less busy than the main entrance.Does get extremely busy so be warned it won’t be quiet."
"Written July 25, 2023",Superb,"I spent 6 hours in the Museum and enjoyed every minute of it. The place is filled to the brim with beautiful artefacts to marvel at, with interesting placards to explain it all. I went to one of the paid exhibition, which was even more amazing as the curation allowed you to make better sense of the story behind everything and how it all ties together. Take a sandwich and a drink with you to eat in the Great Court to save a little money. Thoroughly recommend. I want to go back the next time I'm in London"
"Written October 25, 2023","Busy, but efficient. ","We visited on a Saturday so queues to be expected. Whilst we did wait in line we managed to get through it quickly and easily, the baggage check being great - the gent not at a station pulled us over as I only had my small handbag, checked it and waved us through. Excellent! We picked up a map of the Museum, as it was so crammed with people, we just did the sections we were interested in and skipped the rest. Having room numbers on the map was helpful to navigate ourselves around.Toilets are well sign posted and maintained, and the gift shop plentiful and staff friendly. "
"Written March 1, 2023",Whats British about it ?,"My wife and I visited this museum after a somewhat deflated visit to the Victoria & Albert museum the day before.We were after exhibits of British life and customs through the ages with artifacts and costumes/daily life etc.Dont buy tickets on line as it is free - if you want to offer a donation, do so inside. We queued  for some time but that was okay.The auditorium is huge - very impressive, but as others have said, it shouldnt be there to win awards for its architectural merits. The layout is still confusing despite a free 'map' (compounded by sparse information of where you actually are and which rooms go where after). Having said that, the staff available are helpful and pleasant for advice.My primary gripe is that this is the British Museum and, in my opinion, should reflect the history and heritage of this island throughout the ages up until the present. Instead, it is full of relics, sculptures, jewellery, pottery, etc, salvaged/procured from around the world (mainly Egypt and Asia) by affluent collectors from the @victorian era.It took me half an hour to come across the word 'Britain' in a display somewhere upstairs !There were so many rooms containing exhibits from Korea, China, Egypt and elsewhere that I felt it was just a celebration of everyone elses culture except 'ours'.I am no zenophobe but I felt all the museum represented was that the British were good at 'obtaining' artefacts in favour of our own culture !Nicely displayed and clean but not actually 'British' at all !!!If the British Museum doesnt contain any historical"

"Written December 15, 2022",A Marvellous Museum,"The biggest museum in Britain and one of the biggest in Europe, the British Museum is full of thousands of displays and many sectors from across the world. The most notable sector is the Egyptian Sector which houses the Rosetta Stone and the Bust of Ramesses the Great. Another sector is the Greek and Parthenon which houses many Parthenon sculptures, Crouching Venus Sculpture and the Sophilos Vase. Other notable sectors include the African, Life and Death, Egyptian Mummies and Chinese Sectors. My favourite room which looks the greatest is the Library of Enlightenment which houses The Piranesi Vase at its centre. There are so many displays to look at there is too many to look at in a day, but you can spend about 3- 4 hours looking at the best ones that catch your eye."
"Written October 10, 2022",Amazing Museum!,"If you appreciate history, you can't go to London without visiting the British Museum. The original Rosetta Stone is here.

"Written April 12, 2021",Amazing,Can't get enough of this place.  I love to wander round and take in the breathtaking pieces from across time and the world. The grandness of the Great Hall as you enter the building sets you up for the magnificence which is to follow.

"Written August 17, 2023",Sardine can,"This place needs more organization, I get that entry is free, but they need a little more regulation with how many people can enter. The building jam packed with people.We went mainly to see the Egypt section, but due to the number of people, we didn't see everything we wanted, and I thought there would be more mummies on display, maybe it depends on the time of year. Just be advised for those sensitive the warmer temperatures the build doesn't seem to have A/C so some exhibits can get extremely hot depending  on how many people are in it"
"Written October 1, 2023",Impossible,"We had always wanted to visit the British Museum but fitting it into our very full schedule was always a challenge . However we managed to organize a Day in London on a Saturday in July . Unfortunately we were unaware that this was the 1st Day of the Summer Holidays . When we arrived we found that there were thousands of People trying to enter the museum . Entrance is Free and is booked on their Website . Everyone must go through a Security Check before entering the Museum . The large Entrance is up a Flight of wide steps . Which meant negotiating large numbers of People sitting on the Steps , contrary to the signs Not to sit on the Steps . They need to move the people on from the steps as it was so crowded . Inside was no better . It was ridiculous . So many people . It was impossible to spend time studying exhibits . We stuck it out for just an hour and gave up ."
"Written August 20, 2022",Brilliant for all ages.,"Throughly enjoyed our visit to the British museum. There is a huge collection of varied artefacts to see. We were particularly taken by the Greek, Assyrian, Chinese & Indian sections. Plenty to see for all ages, lots of interesting facts to read or simply just walk around and look at the displays. You can easily see as much or as little as you please as the map highlights its top things to see around the museum. The cafe area can become quite busy so I’d suggest planning time to visit if needed. Although we visited during summer it was very hot in some sections so would suggest a portable fan if you’re able to take one with you just for comfort."
"Written November 5, 2021",Simply Unmissable!,"Visited here on a recent trip to London when my wife and I were stuck for something to do and it was nearby. I hadn't been here since I was a child, so only had very vague memories of the place. But I am so glad that we went because it was absolutely amazing!Only intended to spend a couple of hours there before going shopping in Oxford Street but ended up being here half the day and still didn't see everything on offer, this really is a place that you need to dedicate an entire day to!The Egyptian section was a particular highlight for me and I was very impressed by the food served in the cafe too, much better than any other museum I have been to."
"Written January 16, 2023",My favourite location in London,"I always make time for the museum when visiting London. The Museum is one of my favourite places on earth. Recently I spent the entire day there. There is ample space, a good coat check (small fee), restuarants, etc.The exhibits change over time and everything is very well laid out but it is huge.The gift shop is massive so take some time as I believe it is one of the nicest places to shop in London. There is so much variety and all profits go back into the museum."
"Written April 25, 2023",Enjoyable!,This museum is huge! I could spend days here learning. The exhibitions are really well done and it is quite easy to move around the museum despite a queue that went around the block at opening. I got my Rosetta Stone fix!
"Written June 27, 2022",Tourist trap,"I didn't particularly enjoy my experience at the British Museum. Other than the Rosetta Stone & a couple of other things, the majority of the museum encompassed rooms filled with the exact same pottery. The museum stank of fried cheese and onions from the cafes and restaurants dotted around. A hilarious touch is the pizzeria they've planted in the middle of an exhibition 😂. Far too overcrowded to actually enjoy some of the rooms & get a look at things, I'd rather go to a museum in which I can look at things without being shoved or pushed out of the way by noisy tourist groups. There are better places in London."
"Written September 13, 2023","Just so much to see, you can't see it all in one visit","It's hard to comprehend just how much history is stored in this wonderful museum... and it's free (but donations are politely encouraged). There will always be crowds of visitors and the main attractions such as the Rosetta Stone will be packed, but there is just so much to see, particularly if you go without an agenda, I find something new everytime I visit. I like to wander aimlessly and see what catches my attention. I do then download the map and check that I've not missed anything I particularly wanted to see. Nearest tube is Russell Square (Piccadilly line), but I enjoy the 20-25 minute walk from King's Cross. Opens at 10am, just right for a leisurely start, and a gentle walk through Russell Square gardens taking in a coffee shop on the way."
"Written March 13, 2023",Nice day out!,"The British Museum is a great experience for anyone who is interested in world culture. It has plenty of exhibitions and there is a good collection of artefacts spanning across various centuries. The museum offers clean bathrooms, baby changing facilities, plenty of space and a gift shop, among other things. It's free to enter, and you can bring all your family, which is a big plus for larger families."
"Written August 6, 2021",A world class visit,"I visit the museum often and each time I go I am amazed how busy it is, but I am not surprised at all!In my opinion Britains finest place to visit for World culture. Always something new or look at and the detail amazing . From entering to leaving , it’s professional and friendly by all the staff. I also have to praise the cleaners to. Why?Because the glass on all the different exhibition frames are so clean , I bumped into the glass when taking a photo. Something they should be proud of.It’s a donation to visit but how could you not donate with all the effort put into an amazing building ."
"Written March 7, 2022",Busy and filthy inadequate toilets.,"The museum is huge- so much to see. Probably best is several visits if you want to truly appreciate it all. We visited as a family with an 8 year old who found parts interesting, but overall it is not geared for children compared to other museums. I was also very disappointed that the only working male toilet was the one in the main hall (any other we found was out of order/closed). Given the large numbers visiting there was a long queue and the toilets disgustingly dirty. This is significant issue for visitors when spending several hours at an attraction with 8yr old children. We had a pre-booked timeslot to arrive but no-one even checked. Security just checked bags. Perhaps worth visiting but only because its free. "
"Written November 7, 2022",Wonderful treasures ,"A fabulous visit to the British Museum, amazing exhibitions, mind blowing history unfolds in front of your eyes.  Feel slightly embarrassed that we pillaged so many artefacts from around the world.  Beautifully done... Will be returning as still more to see and do."
"Written January 31, 2020",Not so “British’ museum……,"Unplanned Train strike this week meant our visit to the British Museum was off, we asked for a change by one day so we could attend and were met with a curt ‘no’.  We had also booked visits to the V&A and Frameless who were very accommodating and allowed us to bring our trip forward a day.   British Museum kept our money but lost us as future customers and also our friends who are British Museum members who will not be renewing in the future.  We had booked a table at the restaurant so they lost that too.  Brendon who sent the uninterested and ‘don’t care’ email needs training in customer care.  We understand tickets being non transferable or not refundable but given a full train and tube strike we thought a more supportive response would have been better.  I won’t visit the not so very ‘British’ museum ever again."
"Written October 2, 2023","The British Museum, in the Bloomsbury area of London,","The British Museum, in the Bloomsbury area of London, England, is a public institution dedicated to human history, art and culture. Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely collected during the era of the British Empire. It was the first public national museum in the world. The Museum was established in 1753 and first opened to the public in 1759. Its expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of expanding British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881.Right now the British Museum is temporary closed due to covid-19 pandemic."
"Written May 24, 2021",Great Feminine Power Exhibition,"We went to the British Museum to visit the Feminine Power Exhibition, which did not disappoint. The displays were very informative and everything was set up in a very easy-to-access way despite it being relatively busy inside the exhibit. The staff were friendly and helpful. The Museum building itself was very impressive both inside and out it is definitely worth taking some time to spend looking at the architecture as well as the cool displays inside. We will be returning to visit the rest of the museum."
"Written September 18, 2022",World class museum,"Always a pleasure to visit this museum, having been to a lot of them over the years both abroad and in the UK this is still my favourite.This time we managed to look at the Egyptian and Medieval sections which we didn't get to spend much time in on the previous visit.The ancient world sections are world class and you can't miss the Rosetta Stone if you have any interest in the history of archaeology."
"Written September 13, 2020",Fascinating and stuffed full of unique treasures,"We visited late afternoon during school holidays so unsurprisingly it was very crowded, which didn't make for the best experience, and I would like to go back out of season and get to see everything in a less stressed environment.  The crowds around the Rosetta Stone made it impossible to see at all, and the amount of people racing from case to case just taking selfies and not actually looking at anything was annoying, so it was a shame this isn't more tightly policed by staff.  However, the number of amazing and unique exhibits under one roof, all for free, is outstanding.  Egyptian mummies, ancient Egyptian statues, the Parthenon marbles, Lewis chessmen, Sutton Hoo treasure are just a few highlights.  Ideally, you could spend several days there, taking your time and seeing everything.  We had to do the highlight tour due to time restraints, and this was listed helpfully in the guide, but we found the layout a bit confusing as rooms lead into each other and there is no quick way through.  If going at a busy time, I would suggest going first thing in the morning, rather than leaving it till later like we did."
"Written April 9, 2023",A brief but interesting visit,The day of our visit was the second day of the new Covid restrictions across England and the museum was very quiet.The security system was in place but very quick to go through. It was great to have a security personnel with a welcoming smile and great sense of humour.As always rg museum is clean spacious and easy to be covid safe.
"Written December 18, 2021",British Museum visit.,"Huge museum, lots of people, be prepared to stay in line to enter, but it moves fast.  If you are not bringing any bags (backpack, purse, bags) you just walk in without been screened.  Amazing collection of Greek, Macedonian and Egyptian cultures, the only problem was that some tourists will just get too close to some statues that is frigtenight that they might tip over it.  There is a restaurant in the top of the museum that serves amazing food.  The Museum shops had a great variety of nice gifts."
"Written October 9, 2022",Brilliantly fascinating,"We had visited the British Museum before during a visit to London but knew we had only scraped the surface of the place.  When we saw there was a Troy exhibition on we decided to go back and we’re really delighted we did.  The exhibition was incredibly interesting and well done, bringing the whole story to life.If you’re in London it’s a must do"
"Written February 3, 2020",So much to see!,"Great place to visit but be warned, it's massive! We scheduled four hours for this visit but didn't even get through a quarter of what's there in that time. There is so much to see but, because of the size, it may be a little bit much for young children. Worth taking some water with you because it's a bit like a maze, once you start it""s kind of hard to get back to the central area where the cafe's located. "
"Written June 29, 2021",A Cornucopia of World Treasures,"A cornucopia of world treasures, there is a slice of world history for everyone at this museum. I often use the British Museum as a litmus test for people I want to get to know better, as you can tell a lot about a person's character by what parts of history they are interested in and which artefacts they tend to look at the longest.I first went to this museum as a child a couple of decades ago and was fascinated by the ancient Egyptian section. As I grew up my tastes changed, and I now enjoy spending significant time looking around the Chinese, Mayan, Incan and Inuit sections learning more about cultures, beliefs and writing methods I never got the chance to learn about when younger. As I learn more about languages in relation to computers, the way that other pre-modern cultures used their own fascinates me and I always wonder what the world might have been had these become more dominant.I strongly recommend spending more than 5 hours, if not an entire day here. I have been going every couple of years for the past 2 decades and I still find unique insights from coming here. The artefacts on display are matched with clear explanations and dates explaining their relevance and context to each time period and room. There are places to sit down and rest if you do have tired feet, or aren't quite as mobile, and there is at least one café that offers cafeteria style food if you do find yourself hungry.If you're young, and are curious about everything, or older and wiser, and have read around history and literature, this museum has something for you."
"Written January 27, 2022",Beautiful,"Extremely interesting. It captures the different aspects of everyday life of all the cities of the past and not. Interesting the approach to ancient works of modern installations, not as meaningless as happens in the modern niche. interesting is the part dedicated to the objects of daily life of the ancient Romans, to the marbles of the Parthenon, to the stele of rosetta..but also to the oriental civilizations. In addition to visit the top floor where there are the only cardboard that is left of Michelangelo."
"Written February 17, 2020",A wonderful museum full of fantastic displays,"There is so much to see in this wonderful building, it is full of some of the most precious treasures from around the world. The building itself is worth visiting in it's own right, and the, now covered central hall is magnificent. The displays range from monumental to the small and delicate. it deserves to be visited more than once to fully appreciate it's contents."
"Written January 30, 2020",Bit disappointed,"We enjoyed the Egyptian exhibit, however if my mother in law hadn't been with us we would have had to queue to get into the museum, one security guard waved us through the barrier, as she was suffering from heat exhaustion. Very few places to sit apart from the cafes, museum can be a bit of maze not very well sign posted, lifts seem not well sign posted and there don't seem to be many of them. The toilets I used were downstairs, I had to queue to use them, 2 cubicles were missing doors and could not be used, the sanitary bin was full to overflowing, it was obvious that they hadn't been checked or cleaned recently. When I went to complain I couldn't find anyone who seemed interested in doing anything about it, they stated they would TRY to speak to a cleaner. With the amount of visitors, covid infections on in the increase I would have thought that the toilets should be checked, cleaned and sanitary bins emptied on a regular basis."
"Written July 12, 2022",Price is right,One of the free things to do in London. Enjoyed stepping back in time. Ramses bust is very impressive. You will miss things go twice it’s free. Only downside was original Rosetta Stone was moved to a pay section of museum. A copy was in another section. 
"Written November 16, 2022",History at it's best,As soon as you walk through the big doors there are loads of things to see and do. We did have to cue round the block to get it but with in ten minutes we where in side after passing through security too. From before Bc right through to the present day there are pots and jewelry and weapons to see and view. The Egyptian part is fascinating as well. Loved every step we made. Due to it being our last day before home we also used the clock room facilities and the cost was very reasonable. Do be aware large pieces of luggage are not allowed in.
"Written October 23, 2023",Great experience for free!,"It is a huge museum and it is free! We spent about 1 hour there and quickly finished with what we wanted to see. Beyond a point there were not too many things to see. Our interest was the India section which was quite interesting. The most intriguing things for us were 2 of them - Egyptian mummies and Japanese samurai dress. These were simply fascinating. For me seeing an Egyptian mummy was a first time experience. For that matter even the Japanese samurai segment which had that wonderful samurai dress. It is worth going to this museum for these exhibits.The toilets provided are inadequate for the crowd specially for females. My wife had to stand in the line for almost 10 minutes! The museum should try to fix this by providing more toilet facilities. It is recommended that you book your slot online even though entry is free. That is because there is a separate entry line for online booking. So, sometimes if there is a big rush you will not have to stand in queue in the walk in line but breeze through the online entry line!But, it is commendable that such a huge and well maintained museum is free of cost for visitors!"
"Written September 6, 2023",Unbelievable,"This museum is so huge and vast that one visit simply does not get you seeing everything this museum has to offer. I saw the coin area, Roman and Greek area and Egyptian area. I especially loved the Roman statues and Egyptian artwork, It's so beautiful and almost unbelievable it happened so long ago. I will come back again and see more of the museum."
"Written April 3, 2022",Excellent Stonehenge Exhibition,"As always the British Museum is a fantastic visit. We have just seen the the Stonehenge Exhibition, a fascinating insight to the history of Stonehenge and associated historical social changes accompanying it. The exhibition has gathered items from all over Europe to explain the full significance of the ancient monument. The rest of the museum, with its huge range of exhibits is always worth at least a couple of hours - if not more."
"Written December 25, 2022",Best history museum,The best history museum we have ever seen. Number of civilizations covered with amazing pieces. This is the first museum for us which was free and no entry fee. We had a young kid with stroller and every place was accessible with multiple lifts. Usually we face a lot of issue with stairs in museums as museum buildings are mostly old. 
"Written January 30, 2020",A full day,"Arriving at the British museum we were not really sure which way to go . But soon found out way. There is so much to see and on so many levels , you need a good day to cover it all. We spent half the day here but it was well spent . Lots of stairs to help you keep fit , but there is also lifts . Great opportunity to take some wonderful pictures to keep as a memory as there is so much to see you will forget half . Toilets throughout and places to grab something to eat and drink. Free to enter , but if there are certain exhibits want to see there is a cost . Great day out all in all if your interested in things from the past ."
"Written September 9, 2021",Superb and so much to see,"We visited the British Museum recently to see the Nero Exhibition. The British Museum is one of the top attractions in London and their exhibitions are always worth attending. The existing exhibits such as the Egyptian Mummies, Viking artefacts, etc are always worth revisiting. You can easily spend days in the British Museum because there is so much to see."
"Written April 3, 2022",Very Interesting,We hadn't been to the British Museum since we were school kids but had difficulty remembering what it was like. It has changed!  We went to the world of Stonehenge. It was extremely interesting & well presented. The only criticism of the whole experience was they let too many people in at a time  even though the bookings were time dependent. Otherwise an excellent exhibition.
"Written August 10, 2022",Wonderful  Museum,"An excellent Museum, it's a must when visiting London. On the positive side, there are the Egypt/Middle East rooms, the Sutton Hoo and Early Medieval Europe rooms and much more; on the negative side, I think that, from a museology point of view, is sorrily outdated.A significant problem of difficult solution is the large crowds moving around: how to avoid large ammounts of people when a museum function is to make available culture to the people."
"Written May 24, 2022",I could spend my whole day here,"Loved the exhibitions, especially the ancient Roman and Egyptian sections. Try to get there early as it is pretty hard to look at the mummies. I'd recommend going on multiple visits as there is so much to see. I was a little disappointed that the  Africa and America exhibitions were closed when I visited, but I don't believe I would have had enough time to see the exhibits as I entered the museum quite late."
"Written April 29, 2022",Collection of the World,"The museum is beautiful and staff are excellent but as a place founded by an aristocrat to house his collections, it does not tell the stories of other cultures and own country the way more modern museums do.  The museum has lots of stuff brought back during London’s colonial heyday and houses remarkable artifacts like the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles so it is worth a day just to see all the interesting historical treasures.  Great place to take children to learn and enjoy an experience that is not available online.  Great gift shop and cafes to grab lunch or a snack."
"Written May 1, 2023",'' A disappointing experience '',"I visited the museum in the end of April and the amount of people that it had was more than the average in a scale where you could not see the artifacts properly. The lack of air condition made the atmosphere unbearable from the heat. The main reason of our visit was the Greek ancient section and more specific the Caryatides. Unfortunately we were not informed that this area of the museum opens once in a while and the excuse was that they were not had enough staff which is unacceptable. The absence of staff had as a resault the supernumerary visitors to touch the exibits. It is unbelievable that there is no information about the closing of Caryatides because many people from all over the world go just to admire treasures like this one.  If the British museum thinks that the ancient Greek section is not that much of importance so that the accesibility is throughout the work hours, it will be better to be returned where they belong and will be more appreciated."
"Written June 24, 2023",Huge place - lots of artifacts,"Huge place with artifacts from all over the ancient world.   It is free!  My wife and I were saying that it is called ""The British Museum"" but only a small part is actually from Great Britain.  We spent 3 hours, had lunch, and reached information overload - and had only covered a little less than half of the place.  There is a lot to see; much of it from ancient times in Assyria, Egypt, Rome, and Greece.  Learned a lot; if you go during a school day (as we did), the school groups can overwhelm - had to skip some areas as a result.  Recommend figuring in advance to plan what you want to see. "
"Written June 4, 2021",Nero exhibition,Another great exhibition at the British Museum. I will not go in details about Nero and the Roman empire but the way it is presented and the artifacts exposed are overwhelming and push people to learn more about this part of the Ancient history... and also how we can reflect on what we take for granted and how further investigations with a more critical mind can change the view we have on History and the way it is presented to us.Great way also to reflect on our modern way how things can be presented differently so you can make your own opinion on historical events instead of ingesting biased information without challenge.I am always amazed how Ancient world history can help us clarify and enlight today's situations or view of the world.Thank you British Museum for this magnificent exposition!
"Written January 27, 2020",Troy: myth and reality,"As BM members we recently visited this exhibition. Although there are some wonderful and amazing artefacts I found it frustrating. Most of the notices are at ground level and involve you in leaning down to read them, thereby casting a shadow so only one person can look at a time. Caring a collapsible seat, a handbag and a walking stick I really couldn’t cope with one of the large print books as well. The only map of the geographical area is in a very constrained place behind a case. We were also slightly disappointed that there was little of modern Troy.I liked the video of modern refugee women talking which shows that nothing changes! Having said all this we always try to see the current special exhibitions which are mostly excellent."
"Written May 2, 2022",Arrive early,"Make sure you turn up WAY before your time slot, especially if it is early morning when it opens. The line to get into the museum snakes around two roads. We were so excited to visit, but the line to get in was so long, we had to skip it! Hopefully next time.."
"Written August 2, 2023",Awful experience.,"What an absolute disgrace, farce and disappointment. What is the actual point of booking tickets to ensure a controlled flow of footfall through the museum when, in actual fact, it was a free for all. Tickets not checked. Museum packed so much that seeing an exhibit was impossible but much worse than this is that it was a health and safety nightmare. Spent 15 minutes in there unable to move. There’s no organisation management."
"Written December 18, 2022","Great museum, amazing exhibitions however train the waiters better, please.","We had so much fun walking though the exhibition even if you keep your coat on, in wintertime as it is, do to the temperatures they need to have, really chilly in certain parts of the museum e.g. Mummy/ ancient Egypt. Visit well worth alone for the amount of things you can and will see as you visit it.However, we felt sorry for the staff at the pizzeria - the food is great and a clear recommendation and at a price point where you say - not that much higher in comparison to the restaurans around, however they needs to be better coordinated in terms of responsibility and knowing what the actually do."
"Written February 16, 2020",It’s free! Worth a visit,"Last time I came here was on a school trip some 30 years ago, so it’s changed a lot in that time.Depending on what you’re interested in you could spend hours looking around.The more general interest exhibits (think Egyptian mummies) can get very busy, so be aware there will be lines."
"Written April 9, 2020",Colossal Museum Best Seen When one has limited time,"The British Museum is one of, if not the best museum in the world. I have the opportunity to visit only two hours to spare. This was just perfect for me and helped me narrow my areas of interest. It has vast ancient Egypt galleries and Hellenic works of art which always peaks my interest. Plenty of areas to stop for a quick bite perfect to keep moving. To have anything more in the way time, one would be tempted to spend eternity there. "
"Written March 22, 2020",A storehouse of information,"Went over to the museum to look for literature on a specialised area of philately. The staff were helpful in exploring my area of focus and providing me with the books required to further my knowledge base. What was interesting was that I could scan material and email it to myself without any charge. Quite impressed with the amount of information that is available, if you know what to look for, with helpful staff to point you to what to look for."
"Written September 30, 2020",Well organised and seeing some treasures anew,"The British Museum is a true Treasure Trove of objects which we have visited on a number of occasions, always seeing something new, and concentrating on certain areas because it would be overkill to see too much in a day. In London for a couple of days, we booked a lockdown visit. A special one way trail on the main floor has been devised which takes you through many of the highlights and as always, opened our eyes to items scarcely seen before. Well done the BM, a treat."
"Written February 29, 2020",Astounding collection of ancient history,Avoiding the ethical debates that occur surrounding some of the artifacts contained here. My daughter is studying the ancient Egyptians this term and ancient Greece next so we decided to bring her to look at the corresponding exhibits.Visiting on a Saturday we expected queues to get in however entering via Russell Square side entrance we had no issues at all and quickly made our way to the Egyptians. The fact that you can be stood centimetres from antiquities from over 1000 years ago boggles the mind. The information presented was concise and allowed my daughter to carry out the research she required. We spent a good few hours here and barely scratched the surface of other departments and collections. There's literally thousands of specimens from across history that we did not see on this visit and look forward to seeing in the future.
"Written August 4, 2023","Stunning, Vast and Comprehensive","While constantly thinking that much of this collection should be repatriated to home countries, I was very happy that such a comprehensive collection of art, decor, jewelry, and more, spanning from the beginning of human civilization and across the globe. We only spent one day, and it got VERY crowded fairly quickly. We did not buy the audio tour, and were OK with the good descriptions throughout. We did think that a guided tour may be quite worth the price."
"Written July 18, 2023",Disgusting verbal abuse from staff and no toilet access! AVOID,"The museum itself is great, however at 4:30pm, 30 minutes before the museum closes, all the toilet shut and you are directed to the front entrance to use the toilet. I got redirected 3 times before asking someone who completely refused to let me use the toilet. Then this man let another pregnant women go to use the toilet and when I announced I was pregnant too he laughed in my face and said no I’m ‘just fat’! As a 25 week pregnant women I was extremely applauded and disgusted by this comment, let alone the disrespect of letting another pregnant women who was not much further along than myself go to the toilet while refusing me. When I expressed my disgust and demanded to speak to a manager the security man then decided to let me go to the toilet. Once through I was stopped by yet another worker told I could not go. After explaining the whole situation she still was resistant to letting me use the toilet but eventually did, where I met a queue of people inside the toilet anyway! This whole situation for anyone is appalling let alone being verbal abuse by staff. Because of this experience I will never return to the British Museum and am extremely disappointed that they would employe verbally abusive staff members. So if you do want to visit don’t expect to use the toilet facilities within the last hour of opening time and if you happen to be pregnant get ready for being called fat instead!"
"Written November 7, 2023",Some Disappointments,"The Museum has plenty of interesting things to see and more than can be covered in a few hours. If traveling from afar, I suggest some research before you go so you can focus on what interests you. There were some disappointments however, which indicate no matter how well you think you have planned, it can all fall in a heap when the organisation doesn't live up to expectations. We had pre-booked tickets, and I highly recommend that you do, even though they are free. Despite tickets, you have to line up with everyone else, a line that extended to the end of the block. Once you reach the gates things move quicker as you are sorted into ticket and non-ticket holders. My focus was to visit the Parthenon Marbles. To my disappointment the gallery was closed even though there was no indication of this in the inforation we received the day prior to our visit or on the website. The websites was still announcing the gallery was opening at 11am and it was listed on their list of ""Available Galleries"". I asked a staff member about access and was informed the gallery had been closed all week and they didn't know why or when it would re-open. Another disappointment was the App. The free information was very general. The additional information, I was hoping for, was locked and required a fee to access. I resorted to searching the internet. I suspect the information I found was less bias. I was also disappointed by the lack of engagement by staff in the galleries. Most were seated and many were on their devices. Apart from the entry process, the museum seemed to cope with the crowd. Lines for the cafe and toilets were satisfactory. Displays were mostly easy to access and were well presented, although some information was too far away to be read, either with or without reading glasses. "
"Written June 20, 2020",British museum.,"It is amazing what can be learned in this place. There are many kinds of guides, it is advisable to go with one, it is enjoyed in a different way. Still this museum with free admission (through tips) is amazing, it has a bit of every great civilization and takes you to another world."
"Written September 23, 2022",Fabulous museum,We visited recently on a busy Saturday and loved our visit. There is so much to see we didn't manage to get round the whole museum. I thought everything was well laid out and it was easy to follow a route. There is a good load of information at each exhibit and although busy we were able to read what we wanted to.There is a decent sized gift shop and cafe. We will be back.
"Written April 17, 2022",Stonehenge - fabulous,We joined the British Museum yesterday because we were in London and wanted to see the Stonehenge exhibition. It was a beautifully curated exhibition of artefacts from around Europe. There were some absolutely stunning exhibits on display - particularly the gold jewellery. We had lunch in the members lounge. It was comfortable and they serve salads from Benugo - delicious. We also shared a lovely piece of carrot cake.
"Written September 1, 2022",very oldfashion museum,"Excellent collection of antiquities. Unfortunately, they are all stripped from wonderful temples that were left bare. Like the Parthenon or the Babylonian or Egyptian antiquities. Shame. They should all be returned to their homeland. Especially now that there are very good museums like the one on the Acropolis or the new to Egypt. The museum is outdated and the antiquities are crammed together without any display without respect. They should be immediately returned to where they belong."
"Written March 2, 2020",Highly Recommended,"I really went to see the Lewis Chessmen and I wasn't disappointed. On my way out, a docent asked me if I'd like to, ""hold an object that is over 400,000 years old?""  Who wouldn't?  I said, ""yes"" and she plopped a hand ax into my hand and explained in detail everything about the object, it was an interesting lesson. She guided her talk into money with a bitcoin, of all things. By the time she finished, I had forgotten about the Elgin Marbles and spent quite a bit of time in ""Money in Crisis"" Germany Emergency Money 1914-1924.   This proved to be very interesting.  I returned to the museum once more during my visit to London."
"Written September 19, 2021",Not very British,We visited the museum hoping to learn about the history of Britain and were very disappointed to see it was full of items from other countries. It’s a great place if you’re looking to learn about a certain thing and you know it’s there. The Rosetta Stone was the most interesting part. A guided tour is probably worthwhile as there is A LOT to see.
"Written March 19, 2022",Time for tour,I've visited the museum many times in the past and spent hours in the galleries. Always interesting. This time I went on the 2.30pm Ancient Egypt free tour. The lady volunteer who gave the talk added interesting information on the relevant displays which you wouldn't have known just browsing on your own. Very good.
"Written January 17, 2023",Fantastic British Museum,"First of all, in order to visit the British Museum, a booking is necessary. The entrance is free of charge unless you visit a temporary exhibition. The inside is really worth the journey. We loved the Egyptian part of the Museum but many other areas are interesting."
"Written August 16, 2021",Amazing place - something for all ages.,"The British Museum has an amazing collecion of  artefacts. It  covers historical and contemporary objets from across the world. Some of the best exhibitins I have ever seen have been here. I have recently seen three exhibitions: Thomas Becket - Murder and the Making of Saint; Nero; Reflections - artists of the Middle East and North Africa which was insightful and beautiful. We mustn't overlook how the Museum came to acquire much of its collection (Empire, Colonialism, Conquest and thievery). "
"Written January 27, 2020",The Ancient World in One place,"What a stunning place! Extraordinary collection from old Egypt, Africa, Greece ... The Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon frescoes, antique sculptures ... so many to see and so many ... people! Take your time even though the museum is relatively small vs other renowned museums."
"Written July 11, 2021",You may miss the Becket exhibit,"A very disappointing visit to the Becket exhibit. It was shallow, not informative, not insighful and childish. All in all it was  like a very well executed high school project.So much more could have been shown re Becket's rise to the chancellorship and then to the Archbishopric. Much more could have been told about how and why Becket incurred such anger on King Henry's side. Much more could have been inferred from the whole affair regarding the place of church and state, Protestant and Catholic, and the present day balance in the UK, where there's officially no separation of church and state whereas the British are some of the least religious people in the free world. Something went seriously wrong in the preperation of this exhibition.Regarding other exhibits, where many parts were sealed off, I feel it's not fair to judge at this time."
"Written September 3, 2021",Amazing,"If you like history and want to walk around ogling all the artefacts that we “found” and “borrowed” during the time of Empire, British not Darth Vadars, then this is the place for you.Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the Kings Library is stunning.Well worth a trip and I’m sure that we will return it all to it’s rightful owners at some point."
"Written January 25, 2022",Extensive collection of the worlds treasures,This stunning building houses a range of quite mind-blowing artifacts opening up a whole new world centred around the dynasties of the past and right up to the present. The treasures and history are at times beyond belief and re-curring visits are essential as each time you will uncover something different. Toilets and refreshments in abundance meaning you could stay for hours or equally just pop in for a spare hour. 
"Written February 3, 2023",Not impressed there was no advance warning of their strike action.,"Came here to visit only to find out they were on strike. I support the museum staff's cause, but there were guards on site at the gates and people walking in and out so it did not make sense. Better information to visitors required. I checked the website the day before making plans but there was no warning. Not impressed. Wanted to see the Elgin Marbles and African displays on this visit but will have to wait till next time."
"Written July 5, 2020","Poorly lit, lovely collection",We could barely see the art and pieces due to poor lighting. It's also much more cramped and looked a bit cheap. The experience itself was a bit stressful because people around you keep touching the sculptures so there's a need for more security! 
"Written November 6, 2022",We went three times in two weeks and still didn't see all we wanted.,"This museum never disappoints, although we were lucky enough to be coming back when the exhibits we wanted to see were closed. You can check first thing in the morning to see what's closed. We couldn't predict the queues. We had no wait for the first 3 visits but on a fourth attempted visit the queue went around the block. It moved quickly but we decided we didn't want to be in a crowded museu."
"Written November 4, 2023",Queues,"The first thing you will encounter when visiting the British Museum are the queues outside. These will move fairly swiftly so don’t be put off. You might consider mitigating those queues by bookjng a time slot to visit online. This is free and will provide you with an emailed entry ticket. So far so good. Once you get the other side of the railings you will be presented with three lanes. One for British Museum members, one for those with time specific entry tickets and those who’ve just rocked up unannounced. What you need to know is that at the end of the queues is a bag check. If you take the members lane you will whizz past the other queues. No one asks to see any proof of membership. At the end of the members lane it simply merges with the lane for those with timed entry tickets. Again no one is there to check anything. You’ve now saved yourself about half an hours wait. Once you get inside the covered white tent like area no one looks at your membership card or your timed emailed tickets.  No checks whatsoever. All that happens in this area is a security bag check and that’s it. Sadly,  I did what I thought was the responsible thing and applied for a time slot, got my ticket emailed and joined the queue for the ticket holders.  I needn’t have bothered. This is just a bag check for everyone regardless of which ticket you hold or indeed no ticket at all. It’s up to you and your conscience which one you go for and how much you like standing in a queue in the rain for no apparent reason. PS All the gallery rooms from number 50 upwards are shut. That’s all the Greek, Roman and Egyptian exhibits. Didn’t see any notice on the web site warning that one of the most popular attractions is out of action. It’s a great experience and well worth the visit. These are all minor inconveniences in the great scheme of things. Talking of conveniences, if your are female please visit the loo before coming here. The queues are horrendous as there aren’t enough female toilets."
"Written August 15, 2023",Huge Disappointment/Major Sections Closed,"I have to say our visit to this museum may have been our greatest travel disappointment ever. Unfortunately for us ( and all other visitors that day in May, 2023), the museum chose to close THREE major areas on the same day. We were unable to access the Egyptian mummies, the entire Assyrian section, and major exhibits in the Greece section. This is absolutely, completely unacceptable. I understand the need to close sections for maintenance and cleaning. But 3 major sections on the same day? Unforgivable. Unfortunately, we may never get back to old London Town, but if we do, we won’t waste our time here. I strongly suggest you call ahead before you go to avoid the unforgettable disappointment we experienced. Good luck….."
"Written January 15, 2023",Still great despite ground floor access restrictions,"Still way too much to see and as always too many people makes seeing some of the exhibits challenging but this is still one of my favourite places in London.I hadn't been here for a few years but most of the favourites are still there, some of the Egyptian statues and most notably the Rosetta Stone are in the Heiroglyphics Exhibition, I hope to see those again in the coming weeks but there is so much else to see. The route through the museum ground floor to the Egyptian Room 4 has been restricted as has some of the Assyrian exhibits, the route for the masses takes you through Greek and Roman periods to get to the Egyptian statues so it feels a bit disjointed from a chronological perspective. I'm not sure if this is a Covid Hangover or there was some genuine maintenance going on. Overall a minor detraction but hopefully the freedom of the restrictions will get restored for access to one of the jewels in the crown of the BM."
"Written March 31, 2022",One of the few positives of Covid,"For some reason, probably Covid, the musrum was less crowded than usual. One could actually see the exhibits without having to push one's way to the front of a horde. Made the visit much more enjoyable."
"Written March 6, 2020",Beautiful masterpieces,"The Museum is huge and you can spend a couple of hours there. There a cafeteria where prices are not too crazy. It's also not too crowded, as people tend to sparse throughout the rooms. Good for the general UK and European history."
"Written July 29, 2021",Just like all the other amazing museums in London,The museum had a beautiful interior and exterior. It had a lot to show as well in terms of history. I would suggest bringing a hand-held fan as it was stuffy inside the museum.   It was 27 degrees on the day we went that they had to close the roman exhibit due to the heat. Other than that I would recommend visiting this magnificent place.
"Written June 3, 2022",Overwhelming amount to take-in,"We allocated only 1/2 day to the museum and that was a good move. Why you ask? Because there is simply way too much to take in everything on one visit. If I lived in London I could easily see a weeks worth of visits to read every description and study every exhibit. Limiting our time to 1/2 day meant it was time to leave after we were all saturated. It's a great museum and I am glad we went. Be aware there are two entrances a front that I understand is usually crowded, and a ""back"" that is less crowded. Glad we chose the later and simply walked in. Be prepared to run your bag thru a security check."
"Written September 8, 2022",A bit disappointing.,"There was a wide range of exhibits but the building is huge and not always well signposted. Lifts were few and far between and the interior of the building was somewhat stark. Probably better to visit this museum prior to some of the architectural splendour of the National Gallery, St Paul’s Cathedral, etc."
"Written September 28, 2023",The Spotlight tour will open your eyes to Ancient Egypt.,"I was visiting the museum and came across the spotlight tour about death in ancient Egypt, In the Egyptian gallery.Our guide,Douglas was knowledgeable, friendly and most well informed.(He even made a couple of ancient Egyptian jokes- not easy !)He made everyone fell included and had close up pictures to illustrate his talk.We moved around the gallery and he showed us items and symbols that we would have missed had we just been wandering through.He spent 20 minutes after the talk answering questions from his audience, which he had no problem answering- he clearly has a passion for his subject.Highly recommended- can’t wait to go back for more."
"Written July 10, 2023",Not the best,"For all the free things to do I would give this a miss. I felt the signage/information didn't say much about where things came from. It was far too busy to be able to look. We booked tickets but no one checked them and you still had to join a queue which seemed totally pointless, also it was so busy when you got inside."
"Written June 17, 2021",World Class,"There is no museum like it. The British Museum is an art, archaeology, sculpture and decorative treasure. So many things from Egypt including the Rosetta Stone (that's how we know what hieroglyphs say). Have to see it. CAN'T miss it."
"Written February 11, 2020","Must be there , never miss one of the best museum in the World","Spare at least 3 hr to visit this place , they will bring you back in time from mummy to present , from Africa to Asia. Must visit zone about Egyptian history and Greek-Roman Exhibition. Pls come early to avoid issue OOS of head phone service."
"Written November 11, 2021",Incredible Experience..,"One of the greatest museums in the world.  Remarkable & unmatched.   Because Britian kind of ruled the world in the 1800s & early 1900s, it did take art fromeverywhere.  When you realize that, and the quality and originality of the art and historical objects you will realize how great this place is.  From ancient Greek artto original books written by monks in the 1400s to Syrian Art from the middle east, it is here.  This is a world class great place...  In London you got to visit it.What is in this museum, is beyond  description.  ...Go there and see for yourself..  Then, you will know about the true greatness of....The British Museum."
"Written February 15, 2020",Wonderful ,"Had to queue for a couple of minutes to go through security but that seems to be common all over London now. Very friendly staff and some really interesting artefacts to look at. I’m not really into “old things” but this was fascinating. The central space was a piece of art in itself. Well worth a visit - especially if it’s a wet day. You could spend all day here, never get bored and remain dry. Plenty of places inside to grab a drink and a snack or even a full meal. Highly recommended. "
"Written September 9, 2021",Great museum and a reminder of the British colonial past.,"Amazing museum, architecture or the building is simply stunning. Vast displays covering a huge variety of historic pieces from around the world. While the museum was interesting, I couldn't help but feel that many of the artifacts should not be there. Perhaps be more appropriate for many of the culturally significant pieces to be back in the country of origin.Too much to cover in a day visit and difficult to keep young children engaged."
"Written April 25, 2022",What an amazing building,We only wanted to visit here to see the Egyptian History sections. Everything on  display was perfectly presented and had a very informative description next to it. I only wish i had more time to further explore the other area's of the museum but im sure that in time i will get another chance to revisit this stunning building.
"Written February 20, 2023",What a let down,"When we arrived at the museum there was a strike on, we had travelled for over 2 hours  and we could not access the building. We had no communication from the museum warning us not to come and had two children aged 5 and 12 with us who were upset, we were told it was on the website, we had no reason to go on the website at 8am in the morning when we left. Extremely disappointed with the overall experience and out of pocket (train, petrol and parking)."
"Written October 25, 2022",Beautiful Museum,"The entry to the museum was well organized and easy to get in. Once you enter the building, you'll see how grand the Great Court is.  They have pieces from all around the world (North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, etc.) The museum is nicely laid out and you spend all day walking around...starting from the top floor or the bottom floor."
"Written August 7, 2023",Luxury and power Persia to Greece exhibition,"Luxury and power Persia to Greece exhibition. This is well set out, as are all exhibitions at the British Museum. It was helpful that I had read some of Mary Renaults books about Alexander the great, Greece and Persia. The exhibition leads you through a chunk of history , well illustrated and documented by exhibits and maps and text. The exhibits are gorgeous. My main reason for the visit was to see the Thracian gold from Bulgaria. When I was at a museum in Bulgaria a few years ago unfortunately the gold was on loan abroad! The gold exhibits were fantastic with great detail surviving burial for a long time and show how carefully they were retrieved and cleaned"
"Written August 14, 2023",Whistle-stop Visit,"It is a great venue and we new we were short on time due to having booked other events in on the same day. However, once inside, we spoke to a member of staff who gave us a museum map which conveniently had a 'Don't Miss' section. This enable us to visit the main bits in our 2hr visit. This was great as we were short on time. To be honest, even spending the whole day here, you will barely scratch the surface. In truth, spending a week here, you would only see a fraction of what they have to offer. It is an amazing place to go and we have been multiple times before. "
"Written September 21, 2022",Amazing Volunteer and Unusual History Made Understandable,"There was a museum volunteer doing hands on history.  We never got to touch something 2,000 years old and understand its history.  There were Roman era letters (in lower case Latin)  written on wood that were ordinary conversations that brought history to life."
"Written November 5, 2023",Burma to Myanmar,After managing the depressing long queue extending around the block entry was quite quick.  The Burma to Myanmar exhibits are well displayed with accompanying explanations.  They vary from clothes to buddhas and gold bowls.  However as it tries to encompass everything the exhibition appears shallow and disjointed.  If you have been to Myanmar you will enjoy it but otherwise you may feel that your knowledge is still superficial.  It took us 50 minutes to get round reading all the explanations.  Not very good vale at £18 /ticket including £2 donation.
"Written June 22, 2022",Something for everyone,This museum presents a wide variety of exhibits and has something for everyone. There was a large queue but went down quite quickly and the luggage checks were done well and fast. There are great gift shops with a large selection of items. There is also a cafe where you can have food and drinks.
"Written July 31, 2023",Way too crowded. ,"Sadly disappointed by the visit. The experience started off well enough. The building itself was a marvel to see. We were incredibly excited at the start of our visit but that quickly turned to discomfort,  annoying and frustrated.  We left after about an hour and definitely missed many of the exhibits. The ones we did see we just rushed through. It was just not possible to enjoy with the large clouds pushing and shoving try to get through. Nothing enjoyable about the experience. We needed to step out for a bit just to catch our breathe after a 20 minute break we attempted to maneuver our way to the rosetta stone but just quickly gave up and left.I would give a lower score but in all fairness it's free and they do have an incredible collection if you can tolerate the experience."
"Written June 28, 2023","Amazing museum, but needs air conditioning in the summer!","The museum is fantastic, with many great exhibits, including the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, and an extensive mummy collection. We were there in mid-June, not a terribly hot day (~80 degrees F outside), but the museum had no air conditioning, very little ventilation, and we simply couldn't stay there as long as we would have liked to. I would gladly pay an entrance fee if the money would go toward some climate control!"
"Written July 5, 2022",Incredible Collection,"This was one of the most incredible museums I have ever visited. From the Rosetta Stone to the Eqyptian collection with mummies, there is SO much to see! I highly recommend breaking it up into two halves (maybe 1.5 to 2 hours for each half), especially if you have children. While it's busy, the cafe has pretty good food and espresso. I also recommend saving time to visit the gift shop - they have really cool sourvenirs that are relatively reasonably priced. Given that this museum is free, I would say this is a must do when visiting London."
"Written March 27, 2022",Unmissable,"Today I only had about 30 mins to skim through the British Museum and that’s a shame because I could have easily spent a whole day there and more.Each section is divided into different cultures, and the collection is amazing. There were loads of things I’d want to go back and have a proper look at.The building itself is beautiful. That might even have been my favourite part, the central part of the building has an incredible dome ceiling with plenty of natural light.I will be back!"
"Written September 22, 2023",Lost a lot of charm,"This used to be such a great museum ten years ago but a museum is more than just its current exhibition. We went to the China exhibition which was wonderful, informative and beautifully thought out but the rest of our experience was dire. The soulless,dirty cafe,where a submarine cheese and ham sandwich costs £11. The tables are uncleared,the staff indifferent and the space undefined. I believe Benugo run it,as they do so many in London. Also,please get your loos regularly cleaned. For a renowned museum your standards of cleanliness and value for money in the cafe are terrible."
"Written April 30, 2022",MUST SEE !!!,"The British Museum is both an architectural beauty and a trove of some of the world's most noted antiquities. Its an archaeological paradise. An overwhelming museum filled with history from around the world. I've never been to a museum like this where there are so many objects from other countries, Worth as much time as you have available. Six hours was not enough for me!!"
"Written June 3, 2021",Family friendly Museum mission,"We booked into the British Museum as my son (7) has never visited before. The one way system is easy to follow and we used the Museum mission activity available on the website (free WiFi access at the museum). The activities upped the interest and enjoyment for us all and made us look at the artefacts in a different way, with details we otherwise would have missed. We didn't get time to do it all before our tummies started to rumble so will be making a return visit. Our only complaint was access to toilets whilst on the one way system was difficult, but staff and volunteers were very helpful in their guidence."
"Written September 10, 2020",British Museum,"So many artifacts from Egypt and Ancient Greece! The one-way system to provide social distancing is set up very well. While parts of the museum are not open yet, it is still worth a visit. It looks like they are adding new exhibits constantly to keep you coming back."
"Written February 23, 2020","Amazing Place, FREE and Friendly!","It's a long while since our last visit and decided to take our two nieces for a wander round. There was a long queue, as it was school holidays and a Saturday, but one of the staff noted my eldest niece is pregnant and allowed us straight through - that was really appreciated as she would have struggled to queue that long.A day is not enough to see everything, but you can get a flavour and see amazing artifacts from all corners of the globe - including the Rosetta Stone.Just have a visit and let the history soak in."
"Written April 27, 2023",Very crowded,It’s a wonderful museum but spoilt by the sheer numbers inside. We booked tickets in advance and arrived at 10.30 on a Monday morning. All those who had booked were held in a long queue to go through security and those who hadn’t booked went straight in. Nobody checked our tickets at all so we need not have booked. Inside it was very busy so we headed for the upper floors to try and escape the crowds. However there were crowds everywhere and our children 8 and 10 were uncomfortable. We persevered and did manage a few galleries. The Sutton Hoo treasure is outstanding as are the Egypt galleries. If you are going you need to be there as it opens and carefully plan your route in advance.
"Written May 10, 2022",Amazing but difficult to taken in,It was definitely an interesting and educational visit.  The halls are well maintained and the building itself is beautiful.  It's an odd thing to see the large amount of relics that have been taken from other countries and is an ugly testament to colonization.  However this entitled view point is also part of British history.  There is a lot to see so I made sure to prioritize my top 10 so we didn't linger too long as we were short on time.  We went during Easter week while schools were out so in anticipation of the crowds we were required to purchase tickets for a small donation but it was a quick and easy process to do so.  Security check was also quick.
"Written March 18, 2023",One of the world's great museums,"The British Museum is one of the world's great museums. There is so much to see. Unlike Australia, the explanatory captions go into great detail, and they take time to read. It is almost impossible to explore the Museum in half a day, so it pays to be selective. Some things you can't miss, such as the Elgin Marbles, which were once on the Parthenon."
"Written June 6, 2023",Beautiful Museum,Went with some friends in London and really enjoyed our day at the museum. It is large and didn't feel crowded even though the long security line outside says differently. Entrance is free but with a suggested donation. The exhibits are well displayed and labeled
"Written August 31, 2023",The Marvelous British Museum,"The British Museum can be described in a nutshell: stratospherically beautiful. Even as you stand in line outside, you can sense the beauty of the museum inside as well. As soon as you enter you are completely lost to admire it all.Huge collection, I highly recommend a visit."
"Written October 4, 2021",Go but be prepared for the huge crowd,"It's one of the most iconic places in the world, a must-see if you're in London, and as a result, it gets way too crowded. You can't really enjoy all the exhibits at your own pace. Moreover, the place is like a labyrinth and the maps are being sold instead of given."
"Written June 28, 2022",riveting egyptian exhibit,"This huge museum had loads of wonderful exhibits I especially liked the egyptian and roman ones.  This museum is free like most in london are, but you can give a donation.  This was a long walk from central  london had to take a bus but was worth  going off the beaten path.  "
"Written January 24, 2023","Go early, avoid crowds.","The museum is great, it has everything you'd like to see in a museum and more. We went to an egypcian exhibition which was great and in there was the Rosetta stone, amazing.You will need between 3-4 hours to be able to see everything and if you are interested in some topics I would suggest spending the entire day there. The architecture of the museum is something worth seeing so even if you are not interested in museums, this one worth the look around, besides the entrance is free.Not many options to eat, or at least I didn't see many but was able to grab a bite on the go."
"Written November 1, 2023",The British Museum,"We visited with family during August to see a Chinese exhibition called “China’s hidden century”. Wow, what an experience it was, telling various stories over the many years. Everything was very well planned out, & due to it being a ticketed event, there was room to move about freely. The exhibition showed various things from artwork, artefacts & clothing, everywhere you looked, there was something to see. Also whilst at the museum, we got chance to go to the Egyptian area, seeing all the amazing stonework that has been preserved."
"Written June 13, 2023",Hot and Crowded,"I really wanted to like this place, but, the day we visited must have been ‘take all the kids in grade school to the museum’. Plus, it was hot, and the place has no AC. I just got tired of seeing the same things. The mummies were cool, the Rosetta Stone a must see, but, everything else - I hate to say I was bored after an hour. You can’t possibly read every notation for every item even if you went every day for the rest of your like. It’s too overwhelming."
"Written June 27, 2021",Soul destroying,"The building is fairly impressive from the outside, front, Once inside the glass roof reminded me of King's Cross Station. Everywhere was painted brilliant white and appeared characterless. Ok if you're into Egyptology but nothing else to see."
"Written September 17, 2021",Too hot to enjoy,"Heat in the museum ruined expensive as unable to fully enjoy it. There were large fans in some rooms but this failed to cool it down. Hire the headphones for guided tour to make the most of the experience. Lots to look at, in particular Egyptian artefacts. Could do with more seating so yon could sit down as there is a lot to walk around. It was free so an ok experience but probably would not go back."
"Written April 3, 2022",Breathtaking first visit.,"If you’re in the area and have a remote interest in world history even if you don’t then you must visit the British Museum. The building the collection is held in is worth the visit on its own but I challenge you not to be impressed and it’s all free apart from a donation. My first visit and we only had two hours before our train didn’t do it in anyway justice, therefore we chose the Greek, Egyptian, Roman areas and Sutton Hoo exhibits. We will be returning when we have more time."
"Written July 8, 2023",Visit London.com. missold tickets,Just heard from the museum that the booking I made last night for afternoon tea will not be honoured due to planned industrial action. These dates should not be advertised as AVAILABLE when they are clearly not. I have contacted visit London.com for a full refund as they are at fault
"Written February 20, 2022",A great day out,"This is a great place to visit either with family or friends, very well laid out, clean and tidy, plenty of staff on hand to give advice and help.  Fantastic exhibits that are well laid out and informative.  Very nice cafe area that has professional and friendly staff, nice clean toilets as well.  Plenty of interests for the children to help keep them amused, there are various things going on around the museum such as talks etc.  The history and culture is not only breathtaking but mind blowing as when looking at the age of the artifact it's amazing how it has survived.  Very interesting to learn about stuff you may have wondered about or thought you knew about.  A great day out and must if you are visiting London."
"Written June 9, 2022",A must see in London,There isn't enough good things to say about this place.  It's a great place for all ages and free to enter!  The exhibits bring you back in time and they are so well done you have to read it all.  This is our second time here and it never disappoints.  The security queues can be a bit long but if you have a family they will move you to a shorter queue.  Give yourself plenty of time here because there is something for everyone here!
"Written March 12, 2023",Awesome collection,"We, 2 of us, we down in London to catch a show, so stopped at the British Museum on the way to the theatre to look around for an hour or 2. You could spend all day there. We tried the 1 hour self guided tour, to see the highlights, but kept getting distracted by everything else. We started in the Oriental section and South Asian section, both of which were fascinating. The whole museum is awesome, and awe inspiring! We visited on a saturday morning in March from 10.30 till 12.00, before lunch and a matinee show. It was quite crowded so you can't get around quickly."
"Written March 12, 2022",The Babylonian and Chinese Galleries are excellent,"We targeted two galleries - the Babylonian Gallery first and then the Chinese Gallery. The Babylonian Gallery is amazing - the quality of the art work, the exhibit are all very impressive and genuinely deserve time. I continue to be amazed by the skill of the craftsmen and the work.The Chinese gallery provides a very helpful survey of Chinese art and culture with some stunning example of pottery, Tang Dynasty Horses and Camels and of course some amazing pictures....there is a lot here that repays some attention and careful consideration. Take time and walk through and enjoy."
"Written July 13, 2023",Too overcrowded.,"It would have been good if not so over crowded.  Lots of interesting exhibits to see but having to constantly manage the huge numbers - was especially difficult when with young children so the visit was spoiled.  The café was full so not possible to take a break.  Also a concern was safety if an emergency arose, due to the amount of visitors allowed in."
"Written December 28, 2022",Best Value and must see while in London,"This place is huge and lot of things to see. With the free admission, it's just an amazing value that every tourist to London should not skip. Make sure to make online reservation beforehand and to get the free paper map at the Information Desk. I purchased the £6 Museum guide that also includes the color map up front. The guide is nicely done and worth the price. One can easily spend few hours here. If under time constraint, I would identify the room numbers I'm interested at from the map and tackle those first. In the morning, we needed to wait in line outside the entrance but the line went fairly quickly."
"Written August 27, 2023",Incredible but crowded ,The British Museum is one of the things you must see if you are in London.The sheer scope and variety of artifacts is mind boggling.My husband and I  spent three hours and that only covered a portion of areas.Things to keep in mind are that the lines for the ladies restrooms are extremely long and the museum is very crowded which is unfortunate but to be expected.There is no a.c so with that many people it was pretty toasty even in a building of that size.We had booked a specific time but no one checked ticket times.
"Written May 10, 2023","Lots of stuff to see related to history, very crowded.","I only had time for about 2-3 hours at the British Museum, but you could easily spend an entire day here because this place is HUGE.  Most of the exhibits cover history of different civilizations like Egypt, Greece, Asia, among others.  There's a lot of stuff to read and artifacts to look at.  The Rosetta Stone is located here as well, which was pretty cool to see in person.  It does get pretty busy, especially considering admission is free.  If you've got the time, definitely worth checking out if learning about history is your thing."
"Written August 8, 2021",Two very helpful staff,"I visited to see the Becket exhibition, which was very good. There was also an Iron Age sword I wanted to see. I got confused trying to find my way to the Iron Age gallery, one staff member I asked was not helpful at all, he muttered in reply to my query, did not seem interested. However, the young woman in the Iron Age area was completely the opposite, very helpful and pleasant, making sure that I found what I wanted. And another member of staff was most helpful when I was trying to find my way to the exit. I know the job of museum attendant can be boring, and people can be irritating, perhaps some staff need extra training."
"Written January 26, 2023",A collection displaying the world in one place,"All the years I have lived in London I have never visited the British Museum.  So today my wife and I booked a visit and went up.Some research online identified a map with 12 objects ""you must see"".  We saw 10, because two galleries were closed, but what this exercise gave us was an object lesson in navigating this amazing place.The free map you can pick up on your arrive includes details of 15 guided tours in various parts of the museum through the day.  After lunch we chose the Roman Britain tour and Medieval Europe tour.  They were both excellent.  The guides were knowledgeable and presented in a relaxed professional manner - I just wish I could remember their names.We also had the opportunity to handle some artefacts, again with a guide to explain them.All in all a very good day out.  One we will repeat to do more of the tours and artefacts stands."
"Written July 14, 2023",Too many crowds (but a good lunch!),"Like all places of importance in London, during our visit the museum was hindered a lot by the volume of the crowds. The museum itself is huge and yet it seemed every room or corridor was packed with people, so it made it hard to see a lot of the artefacts properly or look at them for long enough.We had lunch on the third floor restaurant, which took me a lot by surprise on how good it actually was. I had a delicious fish and chips and roulade for dessert."
"Written January 26, 2022",Don't miss the Korea Room!,"We have visited the British Museum several times. During the most recent visit, we found the Korean Room.  I like Korean pottery very much and did not know this museum had a Korean area.  It isn't easy to find.  The map show it as an island detached from the rest of the space.  It is worth searching out.  Extraordinary display of Korean art & ceramic ware, both ancient and modern. We enjoyed the rest of the museum, of course, ancient Greece, ancient Britain but Korea was a revelatory experience!"
"Written January 10, 2022",Fantastic Collection of British Plunder,"A fantastic day out for anyone remotely interested in fascinating artefacts we British have plundered over the years 🙂, Gladiators Helmets & Weapons Asian Masks, Egyptian Statues .. the list is endless. The central atrium is also an architectural masterpiece."
"Written July 13, 2023",Great to see but……,"Fantastic museum to visit and explore, very good content to see that is also interactive in areas to keep the young kids engaged.But the over crowding takes away from the experience, they should reduce the amount of people that can go through the doors at once.Still very good to see and would recommend going, just be prepared for the chaos."
"Written June 14, 2022",Empowering experience,"I recently visited the ‘Feminine Power: the divine to the demonic’ exhibition - it was exceptional! I visited with my adult daughter and her friend and we were all completely blown away by it.  The combination of text explaining each item, the written reactions of the public, along with the comments of the exhibitions female collaborators was absolutely spot on. There was a claim at the entrance that said I would be changed by what I saw - and they were right. Can’t recommend this highly enough."
"Written September 23, 2022",for the Rosetta Stone,"took the Around the World tour - 90  min - guide was knowledgeable but unfortunately didn't speak loud enough, if you were not right next to her, you could not hear the information;  would have been great to have the head phone/mike like in other museums facilities.  Quite disappointed.  no problem spending 4 hours discovering the treasures the museum has to offer."
"Written May 2, 2022",Impressive,The Stonehenge exhibition rightly deserves the acclaim. Deeply atmospheric you are immersed in the history and anthropology of ancient Britain. Understanding the value to the community including not only as a burial site but of it’s importance in Europe was enlightening. The thought that’s gone into the sounds of the sea and air as well as the light animations is impressive. If you can go you won’t regret it.
"Written April 14, 2023",Didn't disappoint ,"This  museum is a definite see. We were originally supposed to tour this museum early in the week, but due to a strike, we didn't get to see it until today. We were limited in time, so we picked areas of the museum that we were really interested in. It didn't disappoint!   We really enjoyed our visit and perhaps we can return to have more time to see more. "
"Written July 31, 2023",Worth a visit as its free,Free museum thats worth a visit. It gets very crowded if you go on weekends (not sure if this is the same during weekdays . There is no air con so it also can get really warm. We didnt eat from here so cannot comment on price or food.We paid £2 or £4 to store jackets so dont take anything heavy with you.
"Written June 14, 2022",Allow an entire day for visit,This museum has many wonderful exhibits.  Allow an entire day to see this place.  Be sure to get a map and stay close to your spouses.  Easy to get separated.  We sat down every 30 minutes and there are many nice benches to sit on.  There are five floors and it is a good idea to see an entire floor before proceeding to the next floor.  Impressive artifacts from many different countries and many different era's.  Only drawback is the opening and closing hours.  Museum opens at 10:00 am and closes at 5:00 pm.  Best to visit on Friday as they stay open until 8:30 pm.  
"Written September 6, 2021",Good. It has been better,"Used to be better. So many of the wonderful objects are not currently on display. This includes the Parthenon sculptures (Elgin marbles as they used to be known) and the original Portland vase. So disappointing to find that these wonderful items are now hidden from public view. On a plus note the Sutton hoo collection is simply stunning and COVID compliance is good. One question: if the BM can keep all of the gift shops open, why then can’t they open all of the displays?"
"Written June 4, 2022",Historical and Epic,"I would definitely start on the ground floor and work your way to the upstairs. The sheer amount of history being housed under one roof is incredible. I am glad we scheduled ourselves the entire day to spend at this great museum. It took us from open to close and I still wasn't ready to leave. There's no entrance fee, there is food and clean bathrooms available, and the gift shop is full of fun things to remind you of your time."
"Written November 27, 2022",Worth a visit,"Cant believe this experience is free in the UK. Great place for kids. There are cloak rooms to leave your bags and jackets. You need more than a day to do justice to this museum- we just had time to cover the Egyptology section. The amount of detail provided in every section is staggering. The cafe serves good food till 3.00 pm,  Museum closes at 5..00 pm every day with the exception of Fridays. "
"Written October 10, 2022",Is it possible to give 10 out of 5 rating?,"Wow, how can this place not get a 5/5?It was introduced to me as a British museum with nothing British about :)Jaw opening experience to see the artifacts from all over the world, including from the ancient world such as years of Ramses II Egypt, Assyria and even had the actual mummy of Cleopatra!! Unreal!! One place that made me incredibly jealous of Londoners for being able to access this incredible museum at any time for free. Kids loved Ancient Egypt, Greek, Roman and Assyria. Can spend literally days while submerging yourself into the appreciation of rich history of the world. Definitely coming back~"
"Written October 4, 2022",How Many Centuries?,"The use of ceramics and metals in making the varying serving items and decorative items.  The natural stone used to make the chess sets and the tile for walls left me speechless.  I did find the stairs daunting, and then walking to all of the eras of art that I wanted to see caused a bit of back and forth.I am currently following the British history from 1300 to 1800 and seeing some of the items used during those centuries was a surprise.  Even the fact that these items have been described in books does not hold a feather to the actual items."
"Written August 3, 2021",Boring for kids,"This was the most boring of all museums we visited in London. There is absolutely nothing for a seven-year-old to do, Other than look at the mummies. The place is huge, there are no maps, and the raspberry cake I bought in the café was overpriced And stale. Definitely an adults only venue"
"Written January 26, 2023",Rainy day visits,I love the British museum. The glass ceilings stop you from feeling caged in with the generous flow of light. Love the African exhibition downstairs. Lots of variety to see. Loads of space to mingle and spend a carefree day. 
"Written November 8, 2022",Very nice british museum,"If you like museums, you will know that in one day you will not visit this museum. It is a very nourishing experience to be able to find objects with so much history in one place. It is free but you must book in advance. At the entrance there is a map that if you read it in detail you will find that there are routes to visit the most emblematic if your time is short. Also in the center of the building there is where to eat.I loved showing my daughter the history of the world in one place."
"Written April 7, 2023",One the best place to visit in London,"The British Museum is a must-see for anyone visiting London. The stunning sculptures, knowledgeable staff and inspiring stories of the world-renowned exhibits make it a truly memorable experience. Whether you're looking to learn more about history or just take in the beauty of the museum, you won't be disappointed. Highly recommend!"
"Written March 12, 2022",Coffin's Museum,British Museum make us think if all those masterpieces of art were saved from being distroyed în there original location or they have been just stollen from the places were they belong. British Museum îs also a strange Coffin Museum. A collection of coffins from different civilisation. A museum illustrative for our fear to death. A lot of energy used for nothing. Just coffins.
"Written July 6, 2021",Rooms closed and museum focuses on paid exhibitions ,"The Elgin Marbles not available to visit as the room is closed. Able to have rooms fully staffed for exhibitions where this is a charge such as Nero and Becket. Other rooms are also ""closed for maintenance"" but no work is being done! "
"Written September 3, 2023","A lot to see, but very tiring","The British Museum has an impressive collection of historical items, many of which are hundreds or thousands of years old. Obviously, the collection is immense, and there's a lot to see. There is a lot there. It makes sense to go in with a game plan on what you want to see, and where to find it. We used their map of the ""must see"" items and planned based on that. At first, we tried to see everything on the way to those items, but finally decided it made sense to stick with the big items and see other things as you are able.Because it's so long and tiring, a few suggestions. The air conditioning isn't very good, and this was when it was pleasant in the low 20's C. There also aren't a whole of benches or places to rest or take a longer look at things. Still a great experience which everyone should see, but we could have used a more comfortable situation."
"Written August 27, 2022",Dazed,During our recent visit we had to leave the museum much earlier than intended. Many large groups of very young school children were blocking exhibits and doorways and running around. In the end it became so noisy and difficult to navigate we gave up.
"Written February 10, 2023",Just an extraordinary institution - must visit (and it's free!),"So I've been visiting the British Museum with my kids since they were tiny - now they are in their mid 20's they still want to meet me there. I visited yesterday (travelling from Yorkshire) and met my son. We spent 2 hours in Ancient Greece, had one of the best cream teas in London in the Great Court Restaurant and then spent an hour in the Japan Rooms and then a short visit to Anglo Saxon Europe. The staff are wonderfully helpful, the amenities clean and plentiful, the building itself is just sublime. It is one of the best museums in the world."
"Written July 30, 2022",Mementos of history,"After we told our cab driver our destination, he replied, ""Oh, the place where we keep all the things we stole from other countries.""  Yep, that pretty much sums it up. There are, of course, bits from the UK too. The museum is best enjoyed if you focus on a specific interest. The courtyard featured in the description photo is lofty and (on the day when we visited) sunny. The cafes and gifts shops are worth a visit. "
"Written November 20, 2022",Fantastic,"I've been a regular visitor to the British Museum for years and am reviewing my post lockdown visit.It's less crowded though the queues to the loos are long.  You follow a one way route, and when I went it was just the ground floor.  It's still an amazing experience.  "
"Written October 10, 2020",A Bit Disappointed,"I don't like to write negative reviews and prefer not to write anything at all, however, with the British Museum, I must say a few things. I love to go to museums and frequently visit the MET in New York City, the Getty and Getty Villa in California. I had such high hopes for the British Museum. It was difficult to navigate because it was extremely hot inside and it wasn't hot outside. There was no AC. You felt slight relief if you stood in front of the floor fans located in a few areas. Sweat was uncharacteristically rolling down my back the entire visit. There were so many people in attendance. I don't know if it's because the museum is free, but it definitely felt overcrowded. All we could do was rush from one area to the next, skipping many sections. I began to wonder if this was a plan of the museum so people would keep moving and not stay in one place for too long. The only true relief was in the lower level that housed the African exhibit. The AC was on high and felt like a freezer. It felt great! So, this leads me to believe they do have AC, but it was either not working that day, is fickle or they wanted you to keep moving. I wanted to love the museum, but after a little over an hour, my party of four was ready to leave, sadly unimpressed."
"Written July 19, 2023",Too busy and smelly,"The museum is a victim of it's own success, and is unpleasantly crowded. Just crowds of people milling around.Also, thanks to the central atrium being turned over to cafes, the inner galleries reek of cooked food. Such a shame. I won't be back."
"Written February 5, 2023",A Remarkable London Experience!,"Visiting the British Museum in London in July was an enriching experience. The diverse range of exhibits, from ancient artifacts to modern art, offered a captivating journey through history and culture. The museum's impressive architecture and well-organized displays made the visit enjoyable, although the higher summer crowds did affect the overall experience. Despite the crowds, the British Museum remains a must-visit destination for anyone interested in world history and art."
"Written August 28, 2023",Museum deserve more than seven ⭐,"This is one the best museum.

Like students, family's, seniors, youngsters. All will enjoy. Lots of collection and details of many countries. Collection of things are so good. Just see that. Their is fast moving ques. Can take atleast half an hour or more. If you r artist or designer take a pen and paper to gets best design and ideas. They have facilities of water washrooms and coffee areas. Can take so many pictures. Watch this museam with intrest, it's really good one."
"Written December 25, 2022",A record of written human history,"The breadth of displays encompassing human history was just something that's difficult to plan on when you only have a half a day for a visit, while on vacation. This museum warrants multiple visits. I only had about three hours to spend on a Sunday and so tried to see as much as I could. The Egyptian display was very crowded, but the mummies were worth it. Other highlights were the Persian, Greek, Roman, Japanese, and Chinese antiquities. And finally the timekeeping exhibit.Entry is free and it's close to Russell Square and Tottenham tube stations, and 10 minutes south of Euston train station."
"Written July 4, 2023",Interesting and Diverse,"This is a very impressive museum. I reserved a ticket ahead of time with a certain entrance window, but no one checked that when arrived. Definitely download the app ahead of time - it was helpful and had a cool feature where you can pay for different guided tours. I did the ""top 10"" one and it wasn't too expensive, but it was good to have direction moving through the museum. It was really crowded when I went, but I guess that's to be expected during the summer."
"Written September 28, 2021",Nero ... not at all bad!,"Visited the Nero exhibition which was interesting, informative and well displayed.A rush around part of the rest of the British Museum made me wonder why there was no British history in the British Museum.  The Victorian British removed vast amounts of statues from Greece, and Rome .. but there was so much from Egypt one wonders if anything is left there.A great building. Masses of exhibits.  Did the British ""borrow""too much, perhaps?"
"Written April 14, 2022",A must visit,"The building itself is worth the visit but once you’ve picked your jaw up off the floor at the glass roof/ceiling you get to explore the different exhibitions. Artefacts from Ancient Greece, Egypt, Japan to name but a few. I especially liked the clocks exhibit."
"Written June 8, 2023",Skip the Stolen Goods,"Okay this may be controversial but it was crowded, few places to sit and enjoy the art/exhibits, and I was mostly uncomfortable and sad by the amount of exhibits that have been requested to be returned to their homelands.

"Written September 2, 2023",Disorganised and disappointed grandson,"Disorganised and disappointed grandsonMy husband and I took our 8 yr old grandson to the BM on 1st September.  I checked the website yo see if there were any issues in planning our visit. On arrival we made s beeline for the Grove centre on lowe ground floor (-1).  We a d another couple took the lift only to exit and find access cordoned off without explanation. We went back up and were told to take a different lift. On arrival at the Grove reception we asked anout the backpacks and trails and were told they could only gve us a token for a locker and we could have our packed lunch there. They told us to go back up to the main floor and enquire there. Back up we went and saw a desk entitled 'Family visits'. No one was there. We checked our watches and it was not yet 12.30 when the desk was due to close for lunch.  We were growing increasingly frustrated. We headed to the main information desk and were informed there was no one ag tge Family visits desk. This was odd as it was the ladt day of the school summer holidays. I asked if they could give us the trails maps and backpack but was told they could not access thst desk as they were different staff. I asked if they could not just pop across and give us what we needed and we were told they could not. 'Jobsworth' came to mind. He had however one of thd Egyptian trails leaflets we could have. Which was better than nothing but I asked about the Ancient Greek trails  as this was the main purpose of our visit. He said not only did he have nothing else on his desk (it was all at the Family desk across from him - bereft of staff and seemingly inaccessible). Then  the icing on the cake.. many of the Ancient Greek rooms were closed due to staff absences because of the rail strike.  Our grandson could really not understand and neither could we the extent of the lack of information provided.  With one Egyptian trail in hand, no backpack we made the best of our visit which was ultimately enjoyable but could hsve been so much more so."
"Written November 5, 2022",Great day out for the whole family.,"A great day it for the family with lots to see and read and view. We went and saw the Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Asian and south Asian history and artefacts used in those times.  Kids absolutely loved all the displays and reading up on all the history of each thing they saw there.  We stayed for nearly 4Hours and even that we didn’t get to see the whole museum as it’s so big. Def have to make a trip back to see the rest of what we missed. A great day out and free too. Only asking for a donation as you wish to pay."
"Written October 12, 2020",Breath Taking Architecture,"An absolutely amazing place to visit, the architecture inside and out is nothing short of breath taking, literally as soon as you walk in.I had a friend visit from Australia, so I did the normal haunts around London but this was the cherry on the cake, we walked round for nearly 4 hours taking in all the sights.All the staff are super friendly and very knowledgeable which makes your visit so much nicer."

"Written March 13, 2023",Well worth visiting,"I had been to the British Museum as a child so coming back forty years later was interesting. The Great Court is amazing. We loved to see the Benin Bronzes and Parthenon sculptures most of all as well as some of the ancient Egyptian exhibits. Unfortunately it was overrun with primary school kids who were so noisy . Never mind, it is a great free attraction. Highly recommended"
"Written September 21, 2023",treasure trove of human history and culture,"Exploring The British Museum in London was an incredible journey through human history and culture. The vast collection of artifacts and artworks from around the world left me in awe. The museum’s architecture, especially the Great Court and its iconic glass roof, added to the grandeur of the experience. The audio guide was a valuable companion, providing insights into the museum’s treasures. From the Rosetta Stone to the Egyptian mummies, each exhibit was a testament to human achievement. The British Museum offers a captivating exploration of our shared heritage and is a must-visit for anyone interested in history and culture."
"Written December 20, 2022",Excellent exhibition: lousy experience,"As a long-standing member I took two grandchildren to the Heiroglyphs exhibition. The display itself was of the best standards but the rest of the experience! Why has the member's cloakroom been closed - is the BM still using covid as an excuse? Yesterday the tills could only take cash as the internet had broken down, The same thing had happened last time. There were long queues with harassed staff and I was redirected.  I was given change which fell under the counter and a £1 coin could not be retrieved.  The staff member was unable to give me another one.  The catering in the hall is abysmal. I hop that some will change the franchise"
"Written April 3, 2022",Labrynth of Stairs,"There is a lot to see here, you really need a quite a few hours to soak it all in. The maps provided made it very confusing to find the different exhibits (instead of listing the floors and what to find, it has a list of countries and continents and the different floors those collections could be found). There was also a lot of stairs, with very few lifts and stairs at every single toilet (some were closed at the end of long corridors). Was travelling with my Mum who had a bad leg, and we couldn't find any accessible toilets (they were on the map but where in the museum)"
"Written June 5, 2023",Great experience,The British Museum is a must-see for both locals and tourists alike. The museum boasts a wide range of historical artefacts and you can easily spend a day here going from one exhibit to the next. The gift shop also sells some pretty cool items so be sure to check that out for a souvenir home.
"Written July 25, 2022",Great museum and sauna,"This is a wonderful museum.  Went there 25 years ago, and then a couple of weeks ago.  There is some amazing stuff here.  NOTE:  it is nearly unbearably hot right now.  There is A/C in only very limited parts, and the upper floors were closed due to the heat.  We reached our limit at floor 2.  Still some amazing things and the atrium itself is breathtaking."
"Written September 4, 2021",So much to see,Four of us queued up before 10am on a Sunday hoping we’d get in as we didn’t have tickets. The queue was quite long but it moved really quickly from 10am and we got in no problem. We were quite surprised to see many rooms roped off. That said we still really enjoyed our visit.
"Written July 4, 2023",Magnificent visitor experience,"What an amazing place! From the moment you enter, you are taken aback by the pure majesty by the building itself. Inside you are treated to a plethora or exhibits to feast your eyes upon, so allow yourself a good few hours to take it all in.I personally enjoyed the Greek & Roman section prior to entering the Egyptian section, which was breathtaking.  There is so much to see & enjoy, do I’d recommend getting in early.Highly recommended for any visitor to London."
"Written November 15, 2022",Too many people.  What is the point of a timed ticket?,"Returned after a few years. Booked an unnecessary timed ticket online and rushed to get there only to find 3 queues, members only, timed tickets and essentially one for no tickets (which was the longest). Joined the timed ticket queue,  it passed through a security tent, but so did the other 2 queues where we were all mixed up. Didn’t get asked to show our tickets. Inside it was bedlam.  Too many people,  too many school parties.  Had an expensive coffee, far cheaper outside. Toilets were downstairs with a queue. Didn’t get to see all we wanted as one needs a map, print from website as it costs £3 here, and too many people in each room. Egyptian and Greek  exhibits were good to see. Totally amazed how many were let in. It was only a Monday morning.  Bonus was it was free, staff helpful and there were some lifts.  Crowds ruined it for us."
"Written January 4, 2020",LOVED this museum,"Go here - plan for 3-4 hours. FASCINATING museum, even our teens loved it!  Get a guide at the info desk and it'll will tell you what all of the MUST SEE's are and where they are in the museum but make sure you wander throughout the other rooms.  It's all so fascinating!"
"Written August 6, 2022",Free Trip Through Time,"The British Museum has a large inventory of historical items that go back to the Egyptian era.  The actual Rosetta Stone is there!  And it's free.  If you don't spend at least an hour there, you're not trying.  It's a 2-4 hour event.  And it's free.  Be ready to stand in line and have your bags searched.  "
"Written September 3, 2022",Magnificent,"There is a vast collection of relics and artefacts from all around the world which also draws visitors from over the world as there is something each of us can relate to. The building is huge and beautiful with so much information to learn from. Unfortunately there is not enough time to just spend one day at the museum. I would suggest looking at what they have available and which room they are contained in, then plan your day accordingly otherwiseYou will be exhausted at the end"
"Written August 6, 2021",so much history!,Incredible building with so much history in we were very overwhelmed.  We were booked for 2pm and the queue was next to nothing.  Bag check on the way in and then all done.  We purchased a guide book and map (there is a smaller version of the map in the guide book) and set to.Our only gripe was we hadn't seen the planned closure of the area which we were most looking forward to.  This is the main reason our visit was shorter than we expected.Would definitely recommend this as a great way to learn about human history and we will 100% be back when the Greece/Rome rooms reopen.

Plenty of rooms, off rooms, off other rooms (!!) all full of artefacts and collections from different parts of the world, other cultures and times, so plenty to delight the ardent museum goer. Good free talks on variety of subjects throughout the day, although both the ones we'd have liked weren't running on the day we visited. We also found that some of the exhibitions we'd have liked to visit were closed 'for refurbishment' (or some such?) so we missed out on those. Nice that they have now infilled the main courtyard in the centre (Millennium project, I think?) so all indoors now. You could spend a week going round here and still not see all you wanted to see, especially as the rooms 'map' in the booklet is quite difficult to follow, we found. A half day was about right for us - after that we were 'museumed out'!!"
"Written February 21, 2020",Exciting Museum for History Buffs!,"I've wanted to go to The British Museum since I was a child, and I was not disappointed. Their collection of Egyptian artifacts is amazing, and we enjoyed the Byzantine collection, as well. But perhaps most exciting was the special exhibition on Troy. OMG, I am a lifelong fan of mythology, and this exhibit traced the history and story of the Trojan War. I think it would be an archaeologist and historian's dream to assemble an exhibit like this ... taking physical evidence of the people and times, and interweaving it with mythology. It was terrific."
"Written May 7, 2023",Worth a visit,"An amazing museum.  It is extremely large, and in it you can find various objects of inestimable value.  It took us 3 hours to go through it, but we just flew over some parts.  It would take 2 days for a detailed review.  The most interesting parts are the Rosette, mummies, Aztec and Babylonian ornaments, Greek statues, samurai clothing, etc. In my opinion, there are too many different vessels from Greece and Egypt and wall inscriptions from Mesopotamia.  It is valuable, but it is of interest only to historians.  It is good to make an entrance reservation from home, because that way you can skip the queue."
"Written February 28, 2020",Troy exhibition,"Disappointed. We are too familiar with the story and films of it. The display was no more than one beautiful pot design, repeated many times, also used in advertising, so already seen. Really it is a traditional museum display with lots of labels to read. It needs a few video clips or a small cinema area to bring this epic story to life. Even a short guided tour would be fine"
"Written January 21, 2020",Hasn't lost its charm,"It is huge and there are lots and lots of stuff to see. No chance of taking it all in during one visit, so you either have to select what you want to focus on or plan to come back more than once. Though it is big it can get crowded in places."
"Written September 24, 2022",so cool,"The British Museum, a gathering place of the world's top works of art, brings together a treasure trove of artifacts from the ancient civilizations of the world - Egypt, Greece, Rome and. It is the oldest and most magnificent comprehensive museum in the world, and one of the four largest and most famous museums in the world. The museum collects many artifacts and treasures from around the world, and many great scientists' manuscripts, the richness of the collection, the variety of museums in the world is rare. The British National Museum, with a collection of more than 8 million pieces"
"Written September 13, 2020",Family visit ,Thought it would be a good time to visit as they limit the amount of people going in. It wasn’t really busy but plenty of people in there. You could easily see everything without being close to people. Everyone is required to wear a mask and I only saw three people without. There is only one set of toilets open. With a one way system in place some areas are closed. Large shop open and cafe.
"Written October 8, 2023",Great information and easy to read,Lovely day out you spend however long you want. InsideThe information points were very detailed and easy to read We only did 2.5hrs because for us that was enough. Got really hot inside. Don’t be put off with the queue out the front (it’s very quick) we didn’t need to wait for long.
"Written December 6, 2022","An invaluable collection of items, borrowed by the British from the world. ","The is hard to capture just how much beauty and history is in the British Museum.  On one hand it is sad that the citizens of the countries of origin will never see it, on the other had we can. There is too much to see in one visit. Maybe pick an era or a geography and go deep. There is mobile app (very hard to use and constantly crashes) that is must use to hear the history. If you can get a tour guide, that is even better. "
"Written November 17, 2022",Wonderful Museum,"Our third museum visit on the same day.  This was always our go to museum on past visits to London.There is so much to learn and rediscover here, and we love the Assyrian and Egyptian exhibits.Also, the huge covered roof creates such a wonderful place, with the two cafe dining areas bookending the souvenir store.The reading room upstairs is also a must visit.Entrance is free but you need to book your date and time online in advance."
"Written October 6, 2020",Now is a great time to visit,"Another fascinating visit to the great place.How fortunate are we to have this museum, and now is the time to visit. So few people around and all the staff so very helpful, from Chris the bag searcher, also good at directions on departure, to the check in crew for not only the main admission but also the special Tantra exhibition. Just remember to arrange general admission before the allotted time slot to the Tantra exhibition."
"Written October 27, 2020",Arctic exhibition,"Good exhibition, though perhaps not as spectacular as some of the museums special exhibitions. I would be way about attending if you have concerns about covid though. The exhibition was busier than expected (you still got scrums of people around particular displays) but more pertinently there were the odd absolute moron for whom any form of social distancing was an alien concept. At times it was enough to make me feel quite uncomfortable. The museum could probably do with some more prosvtive stewardonh"
"Written November 5, 2022",Great collection of ancient art and artifacts! And a grand display of historical power and taste.,"British museum is one of the world’s top ten museums, just by the enormity of the collection, for instance it has the best Egyptian department after Egypts own museum, and the best ancient Greek department after Athens. It may not belong to UK, or in a colonialMuseum but: Still; there are so many wonderful, crazy, huge, interesting things to see.  So go and see. And go back! You will never be disappointed!!"
"Written February 9, 2023",An incredible place to explore,"With its vast collection of artifacts, it is the perfect place to learn about world history and culture. The building is awe-inspiring and the exhibits are fascinating. The knowledgeable staff are always willing to answer questions and the audio tours provide a great way to uncover the stories behind the artifacts. A must-see for anyone interested in history or culture."
"Written April 16, 2022",What’s the point of telling us we need to book.,We had to book a slot to get into the museum. None of them were that convenient but we did it anyway. We arrived at our allotted time and the queues were massive. I asked the “helper” if I needed to queue considering we had booked a slot and he very rudely told me to get in line. That was it. What’s the point in making people book tickets when the time slots count for nothing. This was a shambles. We ended up leaving.
"Written February 23, 2023",So much to see so many people,"So much to see so many people.  When you show up there is sure to be a line down the street, don't worry it moved pretty fast.  Once inside it is easy to get overwhelmed with all that there is to see and how many people there are.  Could take days to really try to read and look at everything and might be best to split it up and take a break to get a bite to eat, rest then attack it again.Not sure if I would be young children here can see they getting bored very quickly."
"Written October 28, 2020",Good tour for British history,Really good museum for those interested in British history. It's been a few years since I went here last but it was nice to learn more information and see some great artifacts. Look forward to going again.
"Written July 31, 2022",One of the best artifact collections in the world ,"So much incredible history under one roof. Definitely one of the greatest collections of art and artifacts in the world. I mean, the Rosetta Stone is here! I would highly recommend a visit for anyone visiting London. Every time I come back to the British Museum, I discover something new and wondrous. "
"Written February 6, 2023",Very good!,"Been here several times. Now 3 years since last visit. Discovered that I had to book online ticket for free. Nice souvenir shops. Some exhibitions, like the one with the Rosetta stone, is at an extra cost."
"Written September 13, 2023",Very confusing,"We clearly came in by the back door, there was no staff and no direction there at all.  We waited at least 10 minutes for the North lift to come down to -1  and opted to go out by the front door to avoid all the same hassle.    Very little guidance or directional flow through the entire place.  Yes I scanned the QR code and downloaded a map but if you can read all that tiny detail on an iPhone then I take my hat off to you"
"Written July 8, 2023",Amazing!,"It’s always packed, it’s way too big and it’s an absolute maze but there is nothing else like it in the world.  This is really one of the best if not the best museum that you will likely see in your life. It is exhausting however so make sure you allow enough time to take a break (or a few breaks) and don’t try to rush through it.  Also try to plan some highlights that you need to see in advance!"
"Written December 2, 2022",Fantastic museum and staff!,"I was at the British Museum on Nov 28 with my grown son. I could hardly speak because of a cold. I stopped to ask a question of a staff person (building manager?), who kindly directed us to where we wanted to go. A while later he saw us wandering again, suggested the winged lions, and even took us there himself. WOW! Along with all the amazing artifacts on display, my son and I will always remember this man's warmth and cheerfulness. Thank you British Museum for a great day!"
"Written August 17, 2023","Jam Packed, No Bathrooms",My partner and I were really looking forward to the museum and it was SO BUSY. We couldn’t even stop to read plaques without running into people. Also there were two bathrooms in the whole building and both had a 40 minute plus line so I ended up leaving earlier than planned just to go to the bathroom.
"Written June 28, 2021",Fabulous museum.  not to be missed.,"London does museums brilliantly and should be rightly proud of this gem  There is so much to see, you'll want to visit again and again.  On this, my first visit, I was amazed at all the artefacts and how much there was to learn.  The stand out exhibit for me was the 5,500 year old skeleton that is so well preserved there are tufts of hair still on the scalp.  Absolutely amazing.  I will definitely return"
"Written February 18, 2022",Must see,This is by far the best museum I have ever been to.  Even my 24 yo said it was amazing and he was impressed.   You need hours to go through it in order to appreciate the exhibits.  This museum is free which in Canada you would never find.  Absolutely a must visit for everyone
"Written March 3, 2020",Great tour from a museum volunteer,"I took my 11 year old to look around and she loved it. There was almost too much for her to see and take in. We visited the foyer cafe which was fine, but staff could do with some hospitality training. We decided to join the ancient Greece free tour which was amazing. The volunteer guide was very knowledgeable and did her best to answer a wide range of questions. It was a real eye opener to find out about some of the objects in more details."
"Written September 15, 2021",Suggest to follow the 3 hour self tour on the website,"So big suggest the 3 hour guided tour on the website, this way you get to see the main attractions and you go through most of rooms in a way you don’t get lost. Been a few times before but this time was the best due to the guide. Highly recommended"
"Written August 14, 2021",British Museum - ancient Egypt,"The British Museum should be a ""must see"" on your London trip.  There is so much too see and impossible to see it all in one day; with children 4 hours probably is the max.  Spent most of our time in the ancient Egypt exhibits and was facinated by the artifacts.   "
"Written July 11, 2023",The artefacts displayed in this museum are just mind blowing!,This must be the most beautiful museum in the world with artefacts from the most amazing places. My son of 11 had just learnt about Egypt and to show him proof of what he had just learned was awesome. We are also off to Greece and it’s crazy that the sculptures from the Parthenon are in the museum. Totally fascinating. I loved my kids curiosity. I was a bit disappointed that the cafe on the 3rd floor closed so early at 4. It was hard to see the Rosetta Stone. I almost wish there had been some kind of queue so we could have been closer and taken better pics. The place was just packed and I can understand why!
"Written May 2, 2023",Great place to visit ,"Visiting a museum is always one of the best things to do. It helps us to enrich our knowledge of history, culture, people and many other interesting things. The British Museum is one of the must-visit places in your trip to England."
"Written August 5, 2023",Great for kids!,"I visited the “missions” for kids on the museum’s web page and they were great fun. I was there with a 7 and a 9 year old and it was a great way to have them discover the museum and learn about history. We visited the Egypt and Ancient Rome sections of the museum, they were amazing!"
"Written July 27, 2023",Excellent ,"I was amused that as soon as I entered a young lady asked me for a donation. The amusement was due to the fact that after being reduced to utter penury on being colonised for over a century, we now need to donate to take care of what was once ours. A fantastic museum. Must see. "
"Written August 6, 2022",Amazed!,Another wonderful museum in London! The queue was long but moved fast. Astonishing collection and artifacts. Egypt Mummy was interesting section. It's a huge museum be there early. They have about 8 million artifacts all around the world so that what I loved to see everything under 1 roof. The library is interesting and insightful !Bravo to the Curators.
"Written February 18, 2022",Cultural,Lovely to be back post-pandemic. Opens late on Friday.  I went to watch the free Celebrating Peru – ORIGINS Festival which was a lovely cultural experience.  Well organised and busy despite the storm. Staff were pleasant and friendly.  Great museum but so much to see.  One trip is not enough.  Free entrance but some of the events and exhibitions have a fee.
"Written May 23, 2021",Great Beckett exhibition but lack of social distancing.,"We came to visit the Thomas Beckett exhibition. His story, the story of his brutal murder and the reverence after his death was well told and extremely interesting with manuscripts and decorative objects that were nearly 1000 years old. The only problem was the complete lack of social distancing within the exhibition space."
"Written October 29, 2023",Wrong Museum,Strangely nothing in the British museum is British and it feels like they have been taken from their rightful places from museums all around the world. Strangely many of those countries were the plundered British colonies. The only thing British there is the queue to get in.
"Written April 26, 2023",Definitely worth a visit,"There is so much to see in this wonderful museum you would need several days to see everything. However if you only have a couple of hours there a few highlights that are listed in the museum map. We particularly enjoyed seeing the Sutton Hoo artefacts, the Elgin Marbles and the Ancient Egyptian pieces. Definitely worth a visit."
"Written May 31, 2022",Plan ahead and spend some time.,"You could wander for days in this place.  Glad I limited my entry time, or I would never of seen London.  They have artifacts from almost all eras of man, specializing in the lands of England around the world.  What a collection and very helpful staff.  I went specifically to learn about pre-unification of the United Kingdom, and found it, plus a whole lot more.  Most fascinating to put movie storylines together with real exhibits."
"Written April 9, 2022",Plan to spend the day,"Plan to spend 3 hours or more unless you have a particular interest.  Also suggest reserving your entry - I skipped line with my reservation.  Some of the Assyrian sections were closed when I was there, but most of the museum was open.  Pace yourself - look a bit, rest a bit and cogitate, use the free floor plan map and work your way around.  I spent 4 hours...(!)"
"Written March 1, 2023","Busy, Interesting, and there's a great book shop!","This museum is hugely popular with tourists and locals alike. We thought it would be quieter during a February on a weekday. However, we visited on the same day as many schools! Or perhaps this is normal! It was so busy and the museum is HUGE. As a Brit who doesn't live far away, I would visit again section by section. This time I was mainly interested in the Egyptian artefacts, having recently returned from Egypt. Next time, I'll visit to focus on the other sections. The book shop is amazing. They have some great books for kids and adults."
"Written October 19, 2020",Interesting but...,"Nice place, but the COVID 1-way routing was welcomed but got annoying.  We were able to eat lunch in the cafe.  I'm not sure how much of the museum was not open but I'm glad we didn't bring the kids.The free audio is a joke, it's just incomplete clips.  If they aren't going to offer audio headsets then at least provide a way to purchase the guide using your phone."
"Written July 14, 2022",Huge,This is a large museum showing historical artefacts from around the world. Most of the items are of world importance and many are controversial because of the way they were obtained like the Parthenon Marbles and the Benin Bronzes. If you are a tourist in London this is a must visit place. It is as good as any museum in the world and it is free.
"Written August 27, 2022","Simple Amazing artifacts, but I could have used a bottle of water.","Pros: The museum has over 8 million pieces in its collection and I swear we didn't see even a fraction of it. They had so many different exhibits & it was great to see so many things.  The museum was free & their gift shop is huge!Cons: We were there for 3 hours, it was so busy & hot. The upstairs Cafe only serves afternoon tea, which was fantastic, especially when all the other refreshment counters were closed. "
"Written July 3, 2023",Hot and Crowded,"Please be advised that if you are heat-intolerant, this isn't the place for you in the summer! We went mid-June when it was about 80F outside. We walked in and the atrium was very warm. I thought it may be due to all the windows making it like a greenhouse. Well, we went into one of the exhibit wings and it was even hotter in there! Warm, stagnant air, packed with people. No air flow. There was one dinky stand fan and the museum worker was sitting on a bench with the fan pointed at her face. Lol. There's no way to concentrate and read/look at everything  when you've got sweat rolling down your back. We walked out and it was much cooler outside. So, that visit was a big waste of time. We did go previously in Dec 2021 and enjoyed it. There is a lot to see and read which is why we went back this time - to see what we may have missed."
"Written January 13, 2022",Brilliant,So this was one of first places we visited in London. We were extremely excited to see the Egyptians. The mummy collection is unreal. The museum is massive. There was a few things closed off when we were there but hopefully when I’m back it will be open again. Yet again the staff are very friendly and are extremely helpful. It’s also free to get into if your looking for something to do and you don’t want to spend a lot of money. 
"Written January 3, 2023",Highlights for a family with a 8year old child,"We had 2 days, one for the free exhibitions and one for the hieroglyphs exhibition. For the first day we had a time reservation but it really did not matter. Access was easy with reasonable waiting times. We enjoyed the Parthenon sculptures, the Assyrian artefacts and, of course, the Egyptian ones. Roman Britain was also interesting."
"Written February 9, 2022",Great Place for a riany day,"Now this is a place to visit, unfortunately we only had two hours not enough. The building is beautiful and at this time not crowded so getting around was easy and simple. As always food and drinks over priced but otherwise a great place to visit on a rainy day, just allow the whole day."
"Written May 12, 2023",Excellent!,"My second time at this monstrous museum and if I am in London again, I will definitely return. There are so many great finds here that one visit is never enough and the exhibits must be continuously seen to fully appreciate their beauty and their value. The standout artifact is the Rosetta Stone. The carvings are beautiful and by viewing it up close and personal you fully appreciate the value and power of these ancient writings. This and many other artifacts of significant historical importance. I wish I had more time to take them all in!"
"Written October 24, 2023",kind employees ,"I was having a very bad day, my dog died so i decided to get my mind off things and go to the museum. When i was there i spent a long time looking at a sculpture of a dog and one of the staff approached me. Her name was a keida and she was lovely. she noticed i looked upset and brightened my day with her smile. please give her a raise she’s such a kind human being "
"Written November 20, 2022",Disappointing,We booked on line and joined the queue for security.just as we got to the front a security man suddenly let everyone through as the queue was too long. What is the point in security then?Inside it has a fantastic new roofing and a new exhibition space.The main atrium is a complete waste of space ! It's supposed to be a museum not something to win architectural awards with.It was better 30 years ago.The exhibitions are very good if they are what you want to see.If you have got children give it a miss .
"Written May 7, 2023",A must-see for anyone visiting London,"From its unique artifacts to its knowledgeable staff and inspiring displays, this museum is a one-of-a-kind experience.

With extensive collections, stunning sculptures, inspiring displays and free admission, it is a great place to spend the day learning and exploring. The museum is home to artifacts from around the world, allowing visitors to learn about different cultures and their histories. The galleries are beautifully laid out, making it easy to explore and take in the sights. The interactive displays are particularly interesting, allowing visitors to get a more in-depth look at the history and culture of the objects. There is also an impressive collection of sculptures, both ancient and modern, that will leave you in awe."
"Written March 29, 2022",Backpack thuggery,"First I would say who was with you, the option should also state family, without kids.  Why should we have to mention the ages of children anyway.  Utter pointless.The museum constantly is a nice place to visit and a place to lose track of time.  Lots to see and read.  The exhibitions are good.Sadly this time noticed  ore than ever, due to bruises.  Idiots who constantly walking round with backpacks on banging into objects and people Luckily 99% are behind screens and not having the decency to apologise.  Due to how busy it can be time the museum banned them."
"Written July 12, 2023",Mixed feelings!,"This was the first national public museum of London. It was built in 1759 in Russel Street. It has a permanent display of more than 8 million exhibits. These come from all continents and cultures of the world. History of the mankind can be retraced here. I had mixed feelings about this museum. On one hand I felt that the British had plundered their colonies to bring these treasures here and that these objects were the properties of the countries the British took control of like the Rosetta Stone belonged to Egypt, Indian jewels belonged to India. But on the other hand I felt very lucky to see all these treasures well preserved and elegantly presented. Moreover the permanent part of the museum is free to public."
"Written June 24, 2023",Amazing variety of ancient treasures ,"Too much to see in one visit! The Rosetta Stone, artifacts from ancient Egyptian eras, Assyrian antiquities, Chinese and Japanese art and much more if we had more time. Don’t go on a warm day if it can be avoided, there is no A/C in this enormous museum. The Greek and Roman statues were amazing as well. I can see why many countries would like to have these treasures returned!"
"Written January 6, 2020","The museum was amazing, but hope they charge for tickets","The exhibitions in the museum was amazing and nothing to compare of.  However, since it was free of entrance, there was not much order in the museum.  Group tours were blocking your view, air was thick due to the crowd, and uncontrolled parents & kids."
"Written March 21, 2023",Perfect for a rainy day in London ,"Short, 3 days in London. I was told to spend some time at the British Museum. Relatively easy to book a timed entry appointment. Entry fee was free - always nice..There is sooooo much to see. I was only able to visit for 2 hrs. You need to give yourself closer to 4 hours - just to scratch the surface!I took the Enlightenment tour w/Jan. She was wonderful, insightful & witty.Next time I find myself in London (I will be back), I will pay for the self guided audio tour as well"
"Written February 29, 2020",Makes it easy to see the highlights,"Visited and saw the Rosetta Stone & Elgin marbles within an hour.  The museum is well appointed to see the highlights if you are pressed for time.  The Grand Court had a well appointed bookstore.  A must see and free.  Helpful hint:  The entrance at the back of the building had almost no line.  When we passed the entrance at the front, the line was backed up in a queue.  They check bags which slows things down so go around to the back entrance (where the member coat room is located) and breeze on in.  "
"Written July 29, 2023",Awesome museum,"Incredible and so much to see. One day isn't enough!Reserve your free timed tickets in advance (nobody ever checked) and wear comfortable shoes.My only reservations are that the place is absolutely mobbed, and that there are not many washrooms (only on certain floors and very long lines).Something for all ages!"
"Written March 3, 2023",Definitely worth a tour,"The British Museum is a must-see for anyone visiting London. Its vast collection of artifacts from around the world is unparalleled, and its exhibitions are educational and captivating. A must-visit for history and culture buffs alike!"
"Written October 8, 2021",Vast,"It’s so vast that if you are a first time one day visitor all you can do is have a list of either your own or the generally accepted highlights. For me, I went with other’s general opinions & headed for the Rosetta Stone, King Ramesses II head, Easter Island head, Lewis Chessmen, Sutton Hoo treasures, The Mildenhall Treasure, Hoxne Treasure, Winchester Hoard, Lindow Man, Oxus Treasure, Royal Game of Ur, Egyptian mummies & the Portland Vase. The Elgin Marbles room was out of bounds. That was enough for 3 1/2 hours without a break by which time I had museum fatigue but had to leave soon after that for another attraction anyway."
"Written November 20, 2022",Fantastic Free Museum covering a plethora of history,"Obviously this is an amazing free resource in which to see so much about the history of human civilisation (even if some of it was appropriated in somewhat murky circumstances of yore). We were however disappointed that the roman section was closed off (the bit my son most wanted to see!) - we were told this was due to the weather? We did cover most of the first floor in the 2 hours we were there and my partner and son intend to come back on the train for a day at some point to see more of it. Inevitably there are a lot of school parties, some better chaperoned than others but it is possible (and advised) to either take an alternate route or let them have a head start on you so you can peruse the displays at your leisure!We also used the cafe in the atrium and although busy, we were able to get drinks fairly quickly and find seats together."
"Written May 1, 2023",Definitely a must see,"This museum is just incredible. Exhibitions from various ages and geographies, amazing. A definitely must for people who love history and cultures, but not only. For some exhibitions, there are free daily guided tours conducted by the museum's historians. I think you need more than one week to properly explore this museum. And the fact that the entrance is free..."
"Written February 27, 2023",Hieroglyphs,"I went to see the Hieroglyphs exhibit in its last week.  Parts of the museum were closed due to a strike, but the Hieroglyphs exhibit was open.  It's always a good idea to book ahead for the special exhibits.  The key to deciphering the Hieroglyphs is the Rosetta Stone, which was on exhibit.  You also saw other examples of Hieroglyphs and learned how they were deciphered.  It was an excellent exhibit."
"Written April 9, 2023",It is a must-see for any visitor to London,"The inspiring architecture, educational programs, stunning sculptures, and captivating displays make it an unforgettable experience. It's a great way to learn about the past and explore the world's cultures. I especially enjoyed the interactive exhibits and the knowledgeable staff. Highly recommended!"
"Written January 27, 2020",Love the cheat sheet!,"Our visit to London was short , and there is a lot to do.  We almost didn't come to the British Museum because its so big and we thought we wouldn't have time.  But thankfully we got a few tips.  First, use the backdoor. Yes there is a backdoor and the line was 10 people.  The front door was easily 200.  Second, The guide/map gives you a cheat sheet of where to find the top 20 or so items .  The idea is if you only have an hour or so you can find the most popular exhibits like the Easter Island head and the Rosetta stone.   It was great for us because we got to see the ""big ticket"" items with our limited time.    I would recommend allowing yourself more time.  I know we missed a lot, but it was a nice to have for us on this trip."
"Written September 23, 2023",Block off your day for this incredible museum,"A definite must-see when visiting London! It was almost overwhelming how much history was in this museum. So many amazing exhibits. My favorite was Ancient Egypt. I've never seen so many mummies up close. It did get pretty crowded so be prepared for that. We spent hours exploring the museum on our own and it still wasn't enough time. I recommend blocking off your entire day, especially if you like to read everything like we do. A guided tour would have been great as well since there was so much to see. "
"Written May 18, 2022",Unmissable experience - go and see the Rosetta Stone,What a great experience. Free entry to the museum. Impossible to see everything in one go - I found it interesting but at the same time tiring. It's a wonderful place for those who can go there often and admire the collections.
"Written May 9, 2023",The impressive architecture,"The informative tours and educational programs make it a great place to learn about the history of the city and the world. Whether you're a history buff or just looking for a fun afternoon out, the British Museum is sure to provide an enjoyable experience. The exhibits are well-curated and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. I especially enjoyed the interactive exhibits and the educational programs. The museum is a great place to spend a few hours and learn something new. Highly recommended!"
"Written October 1, 2023",British museum is a must see,Allow enough time! We went with the London Walks tour and felt we didn’t have enough time at the museum to just browse so I would say see the museum first and then have a tour if time. The Egyptian stuff is reason alone to go! So much more… the area around the museum is nice too for strolling so be sure to walk around a few blocks. 
"Written March 26, 2023",The British Museum.  It is worth multiple visits,"Outstandiong collection of artifacts.  The central part of the building is beautiful.  From here you can pause and plan your visit.  If you are in London for an extended period I suggest multiple short visits.  The place is so huge and there is so much to see you can get Museum Overload.The Museum is free.  It also gets mobbed so I suggest getting there early (it opens at 10am).  Make it the first stop on your day.There are numerous must sees including but not limited to the Rosetta Stone.  Great exhibit of money, Egyptian Mummies, etc. etc. etc. "
"Written September 21, 2022",A Must-See for Art Historians,"There's so much to see in the British Museum, it may be difficult to do justice to it with just one visit. It has an unbelievable collection of art and artifacts from all different cultures, representing thousands of years. It's simply an amazing place."
"Written August 30, 2022",A must see London museum,"With so much to see, it's difficult to know where to start.  Even with a plan and a map, it can be difficult to find you way around.  The Great Court  is a wonderful piece of architecture.  I'm not normally a fan of Foster and Partners work, but in this instance it's worthy of mention and has created a useable, covered space.   It does get busy busy on rainy days in London. The museum is one of London's must see museums, but don't forget there are others.  Maybe not as big or with the same kudos, but they are worth a visit"
"Written May 8, 2022","The Spiritual Predecessor to OJ's ""If I Did It""","This is an unapolagetic shrine to the horrors of British Imperialism. Its callous disregard for any sort of human decency is frankly appalling. Furthermore, the exhibits aren't very well done and the museum is poorly organized. Not worth it even though it's free."
"Written April 14, 2022",Not same as used to be,"Well, definitely museum has a lot of to see, therefore I come here every time I visit London. However, main different between this time and 10 years ago is that, looks like BM need to invest more to work on manners and custumer service of their security guards, especially in the morning and in front entrance. Not that people wait in huge line and hours before they can enter, but being treated very rude manners and as cattle in stock by security guards. Totally not acceptable for cultural institution."
"Written March 16, 2023",As stunning as I'd been told,"The array of artifacts is spectacular - mostly from Ancient Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia, and Egypt.  Highlights for us included Rosetta Stone, Egyptian mummies, and Japan exhibit! We had tickets, but turned out they were letting anyone in.  I would try and get some ahead of time just in case"
"Written June 11, 2021",Fascinating place and friendly staff,"The museum was excellent, really fascinating pieces of  history. The staff were also helpful and friendly, the security people on the door were really helpful and very generously let us in even though we messed up our booking.   Thank you!"
"Written July 8, 2022",All the stuff we’ve nicked,"There is no doubt that this is an amazing collection in a wonderful space. I am not one of these anti colonial Scots but the more I walked around here the more I felt uncomfortable wondering how folk got their hands in these items. The Greek Parthenon section was the worst.Building itself is stunning, fantastic that it’s free, pretty boring for kids I would think.One tip is not to queue at the main entrance which was very busy but to walk around to the other side and queue was less than 5 minutes"
"Written March 2, 2022",Stonehenge Exhibition,"So disappointing went today  as a birthday treat for the beloved with booked tickets to find not only was it packed to the rafters but so many people not wearing masks as well, covid hasn't gone away not only do I feel that I have been exposed to catching covid in that visit more than over the pass 2 years, the exhibition lacked so much.  We had both been looking forward to learning more of our heritage and Stonehenge, poorly labelled small print meant people crowding and taking along time to read but also very little about Stonehenge which is part of Britain's heritage no learnt about other sight across Europe not Stonehenge.I believed the need to pre book was it was going to be small numbers hence why given a time slot. BM you should be ashamed the risk that so many have been put at today."
"Written October 16, 2023",Must see and free,I would consider this one of the must sees of your trip. The biggest areas on Egypt and it is also the busiest area. If you really want to do a good job seeing it I would think you need to budget about four hours the day we went it opened at 10 and people started lining up around 915. Sam had tickets and some didn’t didn’t seem necessary but it might’ve got you in a few minutes faster
"Written April 10, 2022",An amazing collection of artefacts.,"The BM is an amazing place, full to the rafters of amazing artefacts. There is so much to see that it is impossible to do in a day but find what interests you and enjoy that. There are some trials of one hour, three hour and object trails you can find on -line. You can also download audio commentaries and use them on your tour. There are also trails for families and children. We had a great time looking at the “must sees” and exploring a couple of the rooms that particularly interested us (the Sutton Hoo room is a personal favourite). Top tip: book your tickets on line. It doesn’t cost anything and you can skip the huge queues which build up outside!"
"Written June 16, 2022",Brilliant to just mooch around for a while,Love the fact museums in London are free - can go in for as long or as short as you fancy. I knew what I wanted to see so was only a couple of hours. Still had to pre-book  which I didn't appreciate but booked in outside & staff didn't check time as I was 15 mind early. Was really busy with school trips
"Written October 25, 2023",A great place to spend a few hours,"It's home to an impressive array of fascinating galleries, extensive collections, and inspiring displays. From ancient Egyptian artifacts to modern art, the museum has something to offer everyone. The collections are vast and diverse, ranging from prehistoric artifacts to modern art and design. The galleries are well-curated and offer a wealth of information about the history and culture of the world."
"Written January 19, 2020",Great museum - go take a look. ,"Wonderful museum, great place to see all the stuff the British have ‘acquired’ from around the world over the years. Rosetta Stone, Egyptian Mummies, Elgin Marbles, and much, much more. Free to get in, maps available. Do some research before you go to plan your visit, as there is so much there, you might want to prioritise the things you want to see. Some exhibitions incur a charge to get in. "
"Written January 9, 2020",Wow!,"This is an absolutely fantastic museum. I was here with my young daughter and my teenage daughter and they both were quite taken with the displays. It is free to enter, which is incredible considering their fabulous collection.You get a chance to see the Rosetta Stone as well as loads of things from ancient Egypt and Greece.  Worth a visit or two!"
"Written June 6, 2020",Incredibly well curated museum,"I arrived pretty early in the morning and the line wasn't too long (you do have to basically go through airport security though so that's what causes a long line). The map was easy enough to read and I saw a lot of the big highlights without too much hassle. There's a lot of history there and I would definitely set aside at least 3 hours or so to try to see it all.P.S. Remember that it's free. They'll ask for donations, but it's free and you should take advantage of that."
"Written January 6, 2020","Unrivalled Collections, horribly overcrowded ","I visit the BM about once a year. There is always something new to discover, this time it was the Japanese collection. The ceramics both old and modern are stunning. Unfortunately, each time I visit the crowds get bigger. It can be quite unpleasant at times, you need fortitude to stay the course. It's on the tourist trail and, of course, it is free. Should it charge? It does for special exhibitions. It's certainly something worth discussing if the visitor growth continues at the same rate."
"Written June 22, 2022",A must see,The British Museum is a must do if you have a few days in London. An exceptional collection of artefacts and exhibits that span human history. You could spend multiple days and still not see everything. Go through the Montague Street entrance as there will be a significantly smaller line to get in. You can still walk around to the front to see the covered courtyard space. Have an afternoon tea and recharge for the remaining time. Some exhibits open at staggered times for crowd and staff allowances. Ask the information desk about times. Take your time. Enjoy. It is worth the visit.
"Written September 24, 2023",ENTIRELY BRILLIANT ,"It doesn't get much better than this. If, like me you take your time when visiting museums/tour places, then you can spend a day in here, easy. It is one of the 'prides of Britain' & a must if you visit London. Wonderful."
"Written August 27, 2020",A great experience,"Its Open! Lovely to visit without the usual crowds and able to wander through the collections . It meant I could see everything properly, take photos without people in them and generally have a great experience. Of course I want the restrictions of the pandemic over with but I'd prefer the BM to stay as it is!"
"Written March 6, 2020",Wow so much to see!,What an incredible day. Don’t skip the highlights tour. A great way to get an overview of so many offerings. Jean was so kind and informative. O what I went to see and what I loved are two different things. The Rosetta Stone is awe inspiring. But don’t skip the Sutton Hoo relics and reproductions. The Parthenon exhibit is a time machine taking the viewer back in time.   So many details and so little time. 
"Written February 23, 2023",Impressive,"The virtual tour is quite impressive, the guide introduces a lot of exhibits to us. The displays inside the museum are all amazing, but sadly the tour is a bit short. The tour didn't show any exhibits belonging to Britain, which is a pity for people worldwide. Only watching items from non-Britain countries and even their own countries is a tragedy. We are looking forward to visiting the heritage belonging to British next time."
"Written November 3, 2023","Check it out, it's free, you'll be amazed","It's free so go and have a look.  You will be amazed at all the artefacts they have Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Rome and Greece, Asia, Middle East, Americas.   The actual Rosetta Stone.  Just checkout the website it's all there you could spend a good few hours in here.  Plenty of places to eat and get a drink.  Absolutely amazing."
"Written August 3, 2022",Museum everyone should visit in their life,"Would recommend this museum to any history-enthusiasts, it’s absolutely amazing in there. So many interesting artefacts are in here with places that explain it all. It’s just so interesting to learn about human history. In the picture above is one of the items there, some of you might recognise it!Visit as much as you can in here because you will not regret it. Quick tip: bring a fan, it gets so hot from all the people in there!"
"Written February 12, 2023",Fascinating place,"Spent a few hours here today and could have spent the day. Thousands of fascinating relics from all the ages, from all around the world. Tombs, mummies, Greek gods, you name it. Best of all it’s free. If you get there at at opening time don’t be worried about the queue, it goes down in no time at all. Make sure you leave a small donation on the way in or out."
"Written February 4, 2020",Regular visit to the British Museum,The British Museum has been my favourite Museum since the age of 7. It's now also my children's favourite.I never fail to feel excited and full of wonder the moment I walk in.Except in the gift shop where my children fleece me.
"Written September 10, 2022",Great Museum,"After my first visit back in 2004, I visited the British Museum 18 years late in 2022 again. Back then, you could just walked it, but times are changing. Entrance is still free, but you have to go through security first. The exhibition is truly outstanding and a whole day is not enough to see everything."
"Written May 17, 2020",London staple for a rainy afternoon ,I enjoy coming back to the British Museum every once in a while when in London. There is so much to see and always something new to explore. One of my favourite exhibitions is the Egyptian exhibition and it is always very interesting so see. For anyone who is interested in history this is a very good activity in London!
"Written October 13, 2023",Free entry to observe the history of the world,"The goods, bads and ugliesGoods:They have kept all these antiquities in pristine conditions. They deserve all the applause for that. It's a beautiful building and the amount of stuff they have , you need more than 4 hours to cover everything. The entry is free so yes, go visit here.Bads:One of the most sorted destinations in London. So be prepared by the sheer number of people here at any given time. The help desk ain't that helpful and so is the map. My suggestion is to go around and take your time. The signs r better.Uglies:Majority of the exhibits that I saw are taken out of their colonies without permission. India, middle East, Egypt, Australia, other African countries, south American countries. So, it does not give a good vibe to see all these antiquities still in the King's country. It's saddening. And the fact that they don't wanna give back these to their former colonies! Even more blood Boling.Overall, if you are not from GB, go there, and you may find a piece of your history in this museum. That you probably thought never existed. And then be happy that you were allowed to see your own history for free!"
"Written August 5, 2022","Incredible, but too hot","Utterly fascinating visit, particularly the Egyptian area. Unfortunately, it was so stiflingly hot that we could visit all as we were feeling unwell. Air conditioning or more fans is seriously needed, I am suprised no one fainted."
"Written May 25, 2023",The day wasn't long enough!,"My visit to the British Museum was a highlight of my time in London.  Sure, it's fee if you want to cheap out, but make a sizeable donation.  I believe it is worth it.  There are over 60 galleries and there has to be at least a few that would interest every visitor.  My favs are the Egyption Sculptures, the Greek and Roman Rooms, the nations of MesoAmerica, the Enlightenment, the Money gallery . . . the list is long.  What a beautiful collection!"
"Written March 25, 2022",Interesting insight into Stonehenge.,"We visited the Stonehenge exhibition yesterday after we saw a feature in our local paper that said the exhibition also included finds from Must Farm, near Peterborough. It was the latter that prompted us to visit. Unfortunately the paper over- hyped  the Must Farm exhibits and in reality there were only two small cases of exhibits in the very large exhibition, which we found disappointing. Overall, the exhibition was very interesting  and is worth a visit to give a wider perspective of Stonehenge, involving other countries.  One other point is that the layout of the exhibition is not great and other visitors were totally ignoring social distancing and diving in, within a few inches of faces. Not good and not comfortable !"
"Written January 1, 2020",Free!,"Still cannot believe this place is free. We spent a good full day here, with lunch in between. If you want to avoid the crowds, I would advise getting here 20 prior to opening and then once the doors open, make your way to the top galleries. People tend to start of on the lower levels and make their way up."
"Written August 6, 2023",Too many people and very poorly organised.,This is the most poorly organised museum I have ever been to. It really could be so much better.We arrived with a timed ticket. The queue was all the way down the road. We had no idea if the queue was for timed tickets or all other visitors.It turned out the queue was for everyone and there's no point booking a timed ticket as everyone goes in together. The bag searches were far too limited.When we got into the main entrance it was totally overwhelming. There were so many people packed in. I felt claustrophobic. It was dangerously busy.There needs to be a one way system to avoid the pushing and shoving. It was scary for the children at times and the amount of people in some areas was frightening.The museum and artifacts are fascinating but the experience could be so much better.
"Written February 9, 2023",Amazing historical artifacts,So much to see! You could spend an entire day here and not see even half of the collections. We went in the late afternoon so our time was limited but the lines were short so the wait time to get in was low. We had a 13 year old boy with us and even he was interested in the artifacts. There is a lot of walking so be prepared for that.
"Written November 18, 2021",It was okay,"Our overall experience was good but, seen as though the only time the staff interacted with anyone was to tell them off. They didn’t know anything about the exhibits or where they are to help you look for certain things. They was only interested in talking to each other and barking at the visitors"
"Written June 21, 2020",British design at its best!,Worth a visit if not just to enjoy the masterful interior design! I am a graphic designer and go just to get inspiration. Not too crowded (Especially these days) and the cafe inside the museum is top notch. Worth a check!
"Written February 24, 2020",TROY VISIT,"I went with my daughter and her daughter to the Troy exhibition last month. We thoroughly enjoyed it, though it could have been better signposted, particularly to make it easier to follow a logical progression. Unlike Sheelagh, as a wheelchair user I found the low setting of the information very handy, as it would also be for younger children!The BM's provision of a wheelchair was much appreciated - without it I could not have visited! - and also that my daughter gained free entry as my carer!It is many decades since I was last at the BM - long before the work on the Central Reading Room. What a superb job the designers did all those years ago! We were able to negotiate the lift up to the café, and would give that 5 stars, not only for the afternoon tea but also for the view!I hope to go again very soon, though not during school holidays, if I can persuade some else other than my daughter to be my carer for the day!"
"Written June 29, 2023",Lovely Museum but packed,"Number One suggestion: If you have a 10 am reservation, don't arrive until at least 10:30. The line was wrapped around the block! We went to Starbucks across the street and waited it out.  Bags were searched but oddly enough, no one really looked at or scanned our phone tickets.  Beautiful museum but the end of our trip and I was exhausted and couldn’t walk much.  Hubby viewed some highlights and liked it but everything is spread out into little areas. Lots of walking.  Luckily the atrium is full of benches to take breaks. Thankfully the tickets were free, as we wouldn’t have gotten much value if we paid something.  "
"Written September 2, 2023",Very busy and not customer friendly,"The Museum was packed. Not keen to take my bag in the cloakroom although it was only ten past four and they closed at 5pm. The members' cafe was very nice and quiet for a tea and cake and a big contrast to the hustle and bustle of the museum. Friendly Service. You can only get in there as a member or a guest of a member. The China exhibition seemed a bit lacking in artefacts, it was mostly costumes."
"Written February 6, 2020",Nice experience ,"The British Museum is a very well organized museum, very interesting stories, and a helpful staff. Very big and clean, everything you need as a first visit is available. Good to go with friends and family. I think 1 hour is fare enough to enjoy it. "
"Written August 14, 2022",Excellent Museum,"There is a lot to see here, so set aside at least 4 hours, or research what you want to see and go only to those rooms. This place can be overwhelming, and during summer some rooms get very hot and uncomfortable. Some rooms are not open due to high heat. Get there early to avoid large crowds including guided tours. This is a popular tourist destination and it fills up quickly. The food is good and fairly priced, and toilets are plenty. The staff is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend it."
"Written June 13, 2020",Tour of British Museum with Dani the Guide,"We were 2 couples visiting London and had Dani the Guide show us around the British Museum.  Dani (Danielle)  was excellent.  We found her friendly, warm and very knowledgeable.  We have even kept in touch since the trip - Dani has sent us videos of other sites to see in London in the future.  Dani was so good that we have booked her for our next trip to London.  The British museum was outstanding and seeing it with Dani made it even more outstanding."
"Written August 29, 2023",A great British institution. Always something new and interesting to see.,"A great British institution. Always something new and interesting to see.I am a member and a regular visitor, so I get to avoid the queues and visit the member areas. The price is worth it for those facts alone, plus all contributions are welcome to keep this one of the best places to visit in London."
"Written August 13, 2023",No Great Wave,"We came to see The Great Wave and there are lots of postcards, posters and merchandise with the Great Wave on.  When we got to the Japanese paintings area there was a sign saying that the Great Wave is only displayed once every few years, I feel misled!  There should have been more information available to tell people that the Great Wave is not on display."
"Written August 24, 2022",So much to see!,"After many years of living in London, I finally got around to visiting this museum. The place is incredible, with so much to see and absorb. So much in fact, that we didn't cover a fraction of it. My recommendation would be 'a little and often' i.e. short visits confined to a room or two at a time and  carried out over a period of time, there's so much to take in.Absolutely fascinating."
"Written August 23, 2023",Far too busy and crowded ,"Don't be fooled into getting a booking time to help the venue control numbers.... Booked and printed tickets, not checked once.Don't go to the 300 metres queue on Gt Russell St, go round to Montague Place and pretty much walk straight in.Far far too busy to enjoy the exhibits due to overcrowding. Extremely annoying getting pushed and shoved by someone simply wanting a photo. Took away most of the reason for the visit, to learn about stuff.Didn't actually see much in there that was actually British!!!A 20th Century Korean teahouse should probably be in a teahouse museum. Wouldn't be going back there in a long time"
"Written December 14, 2022",Must see in London,I liked the museum but organization at entry could be better since it was very busy. We came to see Rosetta Stone and Hieroglyphics exhibition. Loved it. The museum is huge. Definitely need the entire day to see everything.
"Written July 22, 2023",Ticketing a farse and too many people,You are told you must book a time slot ticket. Yet when you get there there is another queue for those without a ticket and just merges. No one cares or checks your time slot.As a result when you get in the place is heaving. Can't see anything properly and hot with no fresh air.I propose that none UK tourists should pay:1. This may put a good number off and reduce the numbers.2. Plenty will still pay and bring the museum much needed income.The above should apply to ALL London museums.
"Written July 3, 2023",Always a Treat,Amazing place. On this visit we enjoyed the Money exhibit & the room dedicated to Clocks.  You could spend a month & barely scratch the surface. Note it is very crowded despite the massive scale. Interesting to see some acknowledgement that some of the amazing pieces on display were plundered & returns to their countries of origin are now being negotiated.
"Written January 29, 2020",See all of the stolen goods,"From mummies to Greek statues, there's so much to see in this Museum. I went when they opened to beat the lines and went straight to the Rosetta stone and the Egypt section. The museum store is also very nice and I got some nice eco bags. Shame that these historical artifacts are in Britain and not their home countries.  "
"Written March 20, 2022",Magical time travel,"A chronological tour through Northern European pre- history. The exhibits tell a poignant story, where everything aims at helping us understand the mindset of the hunger gatherers, early farmers, warriors and traders through the ages from before to beyond Stonehenge. If anyone goes with the idea of immersing themselves into the structure of Stonehenge, they'd be disappointed. However, if you are intending to understand the post ice age hunters, early farmers, warriors and traders with their belief system better, this is just magical. We felt in touch with the most elusive of worlds."
"Written June 30, 2023",Just not our thing.,"We had a few hours to kill so thought we’d come here to see a slice of British history. Entirely my fault for not doing my research, but this museum houses artefacts from across the globe.As a consequence I found it all rather tiresome I’m afraid, not helped in the least by the fact it was stiflingly hot owing to many rooms not having air conditioning.Great if global history is your thing. But wasted on someone like me I’m afraid."
"Written January 29, 2023",A good variety,"A good variety of different expositions. Very helpful staff. Visited on Saturday, entry was free. There was too many people so it was hard to get around, especially in Mummy room. There are benches in every room, so  you can sit down and rest. One negative - souvenir shop is really lacking of options! Only few type of souvenirs that are massively overpriced."
"Written January 25, 2022",Take a Private Tour if You Can!,"This was my second visit to the British museum after a gap of 25 years.  My family booked a private tour for me and what a difference it made!  I truly enjoyed my first visit, but it did not compare to the tour I had with my own guide.  I got to see the must-sees on my list, with narrative by my retired classical archaeologist guide, and had the most interesting conversations about the collections.   "
"Written August 24, 2020",DubaiFam,"This review is about The British Museum in the United Kingdom in London. Very accessible place with Tubes, busses, Taxies, private cares and Uber. Entrance is free and its regulated by security guards where I found them doing their job well. they prioritize children, families and old which was really kind gesture of them. The place is huge, nice and clean. I wish they offer some good free services for first time visitor, and look more into having proper water, soap and tissues at the washrooms across the place. Wow, what to say, its like seeing and having the whole world in 1 place. It took us 2 days to hardly finish 50%, would love to repeat the experience. I wish they improve more on the souvenirs when it comes to diversity and prices."
"Written January 27, 2020",Egyptian Art,"We came to see the Rosetta Stone and Parthenon Marbles.  We were most impressed with the Eqyptian hieroglyphics  on a sarcophagus. The layout is easy to understand.  There is plenty of opportunity to donate inside, so don't feel pressure to give at bag check.  Bag check line moved slow so attend early in the day.  "
"Written February 8, 2020",Always Amazing...,"We were staying near the British Museum and always like to go there, for exhibitionsor just to be in that grand and historic building. Browsed around the Greek rooms, this time. Savour the history of this Museum. Never disappointed. "
"Written August 12, 2021",Surrounded by history,"Even if you're not too interested in history, this museum is a must visit. Every corner and staircase has some form of ancient history attached to it. You can easily spend hours here. Be aware, some parts may be closed. So if you're looking for a particular section, it'd be wise to ask prior to arrival."
"Written June 18, 2023",One of the Greatest Museums,It would take weeks to see everything this museum has to offer.  Ask one of the people at the service desk for a recommended itinerary.  The individual we talked to help us plan our visit.  Don't miss visiting this museum.
"Written March 9, 2022",Nothing in the world compares,"To skip visiting the British Museum while in London is to miss out on centuries of history & infinite fascinating exhibits. Whether you want ancient Celtic history, Roman, Greek, Egyptian or contemporary exhibits, you will not be disappointed. The shop is superb as well. Plan to spend the day. There are also fun pubs & shops in the vicinity to indulge your sense of the history of London in other ways. "
"Written July 9, 2021",Well worth a visit,"Went to see an exhibition while visiting London.  Booking process was smooth and easy online.Staff were extremely helpful and welcoming, nice to see a smile on a face. Generally distancing was managed well except for a couple of pinch points in the exhibition  itself - probably due more to the selfishness of visitors who felt the need to stop for a chat at each artefact despite a huge crowd behind them - felt that this could have been better managed by the staff in asking these people to move along and chat away from the exhibits so queues did not develop behind them particularly at the beginning of the display"
"Written March 18, 2023",It is a vast museum,"I've visited 3 times over 30  years.I've still not seen much of the content.My advice is to research what you especially wish to see and head to that section until you've done it all.If you love history and wonder at artifacts, one day will not do it all. So many people just aimlessly ambling around- you need to plan to get the best out of a visit.Simply a fantastic place.Nearest tube is Holborn."
"Written November 3, 2023",Busy free attraction,"Exhibits beautiful and worth seeing. Very busy, overwhelming at times around popular exhibits such as the Egyptian Mummies. Massive queues for toilets, so give yourselves extra time. Did not feel overly family friendly on our visit (although a wet day so potentially busier than usual for crowds escaping the weather)Minimal seating in coffee shop (we were just lucky with our timing to sit at a table as soon as someone vacated it) great cake choices to refuel ahead of going back into the crowds. "
"Written July 4, 2022",Still a wonderful experience,The British Museum remains as good as ever but is SO busy it becomes a bit of a mission to visit. I cannot understand why there should be three separate shops. It took me ages to track down some Egyptian tut for a grandchild. The cafe is too busy and chaotic to be comfortable except for a much needed pitstop.
"Written March 28, 2023",Outstanding collections of cultures from around the world,"There is something to see for everyone, from every possible period.Entry is free of charge. There is a dedicated entry lane if you register in advance and you do not have to queue at all.Go either early in the morning or late afternoon (we did it in 2 sessions)Take the map and follow the ""Don't miss"" artifacts."
"Written May 13, 2023",A must in your list,"Stunning museum, my partner and me needed hours to see every item and admire every culture. History, science, architecture, sculpture, jewelry and so much more. You need more than only one day to see and admire every part of this wonderful museum, one of my favorites."
"Written March 8, 2023",Set the tone for our London vacation,"Our first full day in London, began with the British museum, which was just an absolute delight! Stunning way to start a visit in London, beautiful beautiful museum reminded us of the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York, but deeper older history! We all loved it!"
"Written May 31, 2022",No Organization but Cool Stuff,I did not understand the way that the exhibits we're organized. However once we found what we wanted to see it was neat. It was beyond crowded so I can't even believe what it's like on a weekend. Maybe if you get there when it first opens for the day you'll have a bit of peace?
"Written December 8, 2022",Go later in day….  AM the q is enormous!,"Go later in the day. Our accommodation was stayed close by and noticed no q in the afternoon. When we originally wanted to go, at 10.30am the q is enormous!  Like a massive q a block away before even getting in q outside main entrance. Museum does stay open later on a Friday. Other days it shuts at 5pm. It’s been said before….  The building itself is a beauty and we loved Egyptian exhibit."
"Written January 23, 2020",Amazing,The British Museum is fabulous. Between the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles you can’t help but be impressed. So much to see and no admission fee. Just ask for a donation. You could spend hours here and only scratch the surface of things to see.
"Written February 14, 2022",No Wonder This Us A Top Place To Visit In London,"Probably everything possible has already been written & reviewed about this amazing museum. Can’t believe I have never visited before. Spent about 3hours there, you could probably spend 3weeks & not see everything as there is so much to see. An incredible building full of so many artefacts."
"Written June 28, 2022",British Museum Visit,"There is just so much to see here, you might want to visit on more than one day! No entry charge, but please leave a donation. Items and artefacts displayed from all,over the world and from all cultures. Highlights include The Sutton Hoo and the Rosetta Stone"
"Written February 11, 2020",A Foggy Day,"I think I saw more well preserved mummies in London than in Egypt. This is a fascinating museum to visit. But you must get there hours before it opens -- in order to assure yourself the self-audio tour. The details within the audio are worth the purchase. Every time I go to England, I must take a trip to British Museum. "
"Written August 18, 2022",Go if you want it o do an activity indoors,The building and architecture was splendid. But I was honestly expecting more grand items on display. Levels with exhibitions very tightly spaced Areas felt claustrophobic and lacking in air conditioning. We went on a very hot day.  Food very pricey but plenty of seats for resting throughout the levels.
"Written October 19, 2020",Wonderful Experience,The Egyptian displays are amazing we have visited Egypt many times and been lucky enough to see some of the wonderful sights.This is as good as it gets outside of the relics natural environment. Well worth a visit or two! The building is also amazing and easy to get to.
"Written April 17, 2022",Free but so very crowded,"I had booked a morning time slot online and was rushing as I was a few minutes late. In the end, I went through the side entrance and no-one checked my ticket. The problem was that the museum was therefore packed. Why make people book when you don't enforce it. I enjoyed seeing the Egyptian and Assyrian areas and the Rosetta stone but it was overwhelmingly crowded which detracted from the experience."
"Written September 13, 2022",A personal favourite!,"This is my favourite of all the museums in London bar one, the Imperial War Museum. The variety and content of the exhibits here are simply stunning. However, I firmly believe that we should return the ""Elgin Marbles"" to Greece and the Mummies to their final resting places at home in Egypt."
"Written January 23, 2021",The British Museum,"Sadly the most famous object they have ""The Roseta Stone"" still doesn't interest me at all despite dozens of visits. Maybe I'm not cultured or sophisticated enough to know the value of it yet. I first went there years ago to see the mummies because to me that's more relatable humanly but over the years and after many many visits, I've learnt to appreciate the other smaller things they have at their disposal. Especially the objects the British explorers brought back from their newly discovered colonies. It also gives you an idea of the scale of British empire back when it was truly The Great Britain.I don't know how many times will I have to visit it to see the entire place as its just not possible in one go nor recommended.  I come back with hundreds of pictures and see, learn about something new after every visit. They have so much more stuff in storage than what's on the display. From giant Buddha to tiny little things that need microscope to examine. It's a treasure land for history lovers."
"Written February 28, 2020",Fantastic day,"Visited in half term with my 8yr old daughter and my friend . We had amazing day . The cue was not long to get in . My friend has a disability and we were able to go everywhere we wanted visit . My daughter loved ancient Egypt and Roman history . Could be because she is or has been studying at school . She loved seeing all the mummies and Rosetta Stone . Very excited reading everything . We were there for over 4 hours . What am amazing place for children who love history to explore . We are going to Tutankhamen exhibition in April , but this will take a lot of topping . Well done"
"Written October 25, 2022",Overwhelmingly Wonderful,Our tour guide Andy was amazing.  The British Museum is overwhelming. Andy was able to show us some of key exhibits with spellbinding knowledge and insight.   Having an expert give narration to the stories behind the artifacts really made them come alive. I highly recommend this tour! 
"Written January 4, 2020",London Family trip,"Amazing, enormous and very rich. You will need a half-day to enjoy every spot in this great Museum. Most of the big eras in Human history is there. The location is very easy and close to the main attractions in London."
"Written November 18, 2023",Wanted to visit it for years now,"Would deduct a point as Japan area was closed and I really wanted to see that 😞But, all in all it was a great place to visit and was surprised it was for free (still donated 5£ as it was totally worth it) and got few things from the giftshop. Vast exhibitions, very informative and I have always loved history and various cultures. If you have time for it, would recomend to vist. "
"Written February 22, 2022",Cheated,Visited to view the World of Stonehenge exhibition with pre-booked  tickets. Halfway around we were informed that the gallery was closing and we had to leave. It would have been impossible to circulate faster given the overcrowding. What we saw of the exhibition was fascinating but we would have to go again if we want to see the remainder. That would be over £40 each which is extortionate. The sponsors could fairly feel that their reputation has been severely diminished by their involvement in this event.
"Written August 1, 2022",The Great British Museum ,"A great museum chock-a-block with so  many great exhibitions and artifacts. There's some seriously wonderful things there, from large stone artifacts, to the helmets of the Sutton Hoo horde to all kinds of ancient treasures. Bit packed with tourists and nearby schools taking the kids out for a day trip, but still very fascinating and fun even with the large amount of people. Loved all of it, spent absolutely hours in there. Everything is sign posted and easy to locate, with great little souvenirs, I got a little coin. Really easy to get there from public transport. Definitely one of the things you have to do in London."
"Written April 14, 2022",Fascinating exhibitions,"There is always something new to see in the museum.  Prepare to spend most of the day there so you can cover all areas.  Fascinating exhibitions, and something for everyone.  Booked online easily for a time slot (museum is free).  Queue moved very quickly and we were in promptly."
"Written February 21, 2023",Too much walking and NOT for kids,it was so very big and I hurt my feet walking round. I guess some of the objects where cool but it was just so big and it was confusing to walk around.my kiddos got bored instantly and there was basically nothing for them to do spent most of my time ( and money LOL) in the gift shop i guess there was cool stuff in the gift shop but thats about itdont even have the roseta stone anymoreTLDRdont take your kidsbring a chair re-morgage your home
"Written February 25, 2023",Friday afternoon browsing,"Great way to while away a few hours on a rainy afternoon!  We had a great time learning new things and sharing our own knowledge.  Bad point was when we stopped for a cup of tea  -very expensive and when we went to try to sit down at the communal tables, it was extremely hard to find 2 stools together and the tables were strewn with used cups, plates and crumbs.  Tables could not have been wiped down for hours and there was no sign of anyone on the case."
"Written July 18, 2023",Bucket list museum,"There is so much to see, you really need several days. This is to Britain what the Smithsonian is to the US. Amazing exhibits and stuff you read about in history books. The layout takes a bit to get used to and on the day we visited, it was very crowded.  Glad we went, but after seeing Westminster Abbey in the AM, we were pretty worn out at the end of the day and ready to get off our feet. It is very nice and if you are a museum buff, this should be on your bucket list. preparre to spend an entire day and see as much as you can."
"Written November 23, 2021",Fascinating,"Had a lovely rainy day in London spent in the British museum, how fascinating all of the pieces are. Could definitely spend more than one day here. The coffee and cake from the cafe were lovely too. Overall a great day out."
"Written February 4, 2022",Beautiful treasures but not covid safe,"Absolutely beautiful building with world class treasures. Didn’t stay long as covid measures had been dropped as we were among the minority of people wearing masks and socially distancing. No encouragement at all from the museum to wear masks, so we quickly left. Don’t got if you have underlying health conditions as you won’t be safe."
"Written November 6, 2023",Go however expect refugee–camp sized crowds,The volume of people was overwhelming.  ZERO crowd control.  So many people it was difficult to maneuver and some galleries were so packed people were shoulder to shoulder.  We were there about 11am and left around 12:30.  We managed to force our way to get close to the Rosetta Stone.  We saw some headless statues.  Bought some bottled water.  I don't know if there's a better time to go other than if you are a celebrity and you can arrange an after–hours visit.
"Written September 30, 2022",Elgin's big marbles,"For years I used to think those big round balls in the foyer were Elgin's marbles. Although they were quite impressive to a seven year old, I just couldn't understand why Greece would be so bothered about having them back. Sort of just big concrete balls really. What about all the shiny stuff in there made out of gold? Years later, and with a much better understanding of post-colonialism, and I have to say this is still an amazing museum. Hated, adored, never ignored... that kinda thing. But yeah, maybe some stuff in there raises more questions than it should. Never mind the donations. Probably high time they addressed it. Well, it really is. But in the meantime I'd still pop in with my kids for a walkabout."
"Written October 26, 2022",tea and tour,"A wonderful museum. We had afternoon tea there and it was one of the best in our month-long trip. We booked a day in advance and they prepared delicious vegetarian sandwiches for us. If we return to London, we'll have tea there again - it was amazing!"
"Written August 24, 2023",Great museum but disorganized and very crowded,"The time stamp on the ticket means nothing. No one checks the tickets. Huge line to get in at the front entrance. Did they sell so many tickets for the same time or did people figure out that no one checks the time? If you go around the building to the back entrance, no line there, you can walk right in. Inside was as crowded as the outside. People pushing each other, tons of tired crying children throwing fits. It was difficult to enjoy this beautiful museum in such atmosphere."
"Written February 19, 2022",Spectacular!,"Spectacular! I could get lost to wonder, discover and learn in the museum for weeks if not months! The resources and rooms are extensive, incredible history lays within this building that is absolutely fascinating. Stunning presentation, explanations throughout. The staff are facilities are fantastic."
"Written September 8, 2022",Great Museum,"We spent several hours wandering through this delightful museum on a Sunday morning. So much to see! We had a snack at the cafe, which was very good. The shops were also very good. Definitely recommend if you have a couple of hours and are interested in world history."
"Written February 16, 2020",Great place on a rainy day,"We enjoyed ourselves visiting the British Museum. It’s an attractive building in and out. Catering facilities are available though the seating by the coffee bar is woefully inadequate. Furthermore the toilets are inadequate for the ladies; there were the inevitable waiting lines. However, the exhibition halls are great. Of course we had to find the highlights - Rosetta Stone, Pantheon friezes and Sutton Hoo. But there’s so much more. You can wander in here for hours. Well worth the visits...and many more."
"Written October 28, 2022",So much to see!,There is quite a bit to see! You could possibly spend a whole day here if you did the tours or extra exhibits. We had penciled it on for around 4 hours and we still weren't able to see everything but we did get close! Do be aware that some of the exhibits will require tickets and those will sell out in the morning. You'll need a ticket to see the Rosetta Stone.
"Written January 25, 2022",World's Best Collection,"In my opinion probably the world's best collection of artifacts for the public viewing. It has been curated beautifully and definitely has more to see than you can do in one day or maybe even one week! A GPS system would be useful to find your way around although there were people around who could answer questions or provide directions. The disabled access and wheelchair provision were brilliant, including a system of lifts to avoid stairs, even the outside steps."
"Written July 23, 2023",A treasure trove of ancient civilisations,"A very interesting collection of worldly artefacts. Mostly contains early history such as ancient Egypt/Greek/Rome/Celts etc. it’s laid out rather well considering how much there is, over multiple floors with a restaurant, cafe and plenty of gift shops to choose from. Although I thought I knew what I was coming into I was pleasantly surprised to see treasures such as the Rosetta Stone, and Gebelein Man."
"Written August 31, 2020",Excellent visit.,"The BM has always been a family favourite and this visit was no different. We had to pre book entry tickets which were free of charge and easy to do on line. It was fantastic to be able to spend time in uncrowded exhibit rooms, especially the Ancient Egyptian ones. The toilets were open and were spotless and there were refreshments available to buy from the food counter. All in all, another fab visit. "
"Written October 5, 2022",Rosetta Stone is a must,So much history in one place. Seeing one of the Easter island statues and the Rosetta Stone are two of the coolest things there. Plan almost a full day to even begin to see the museum
"Written February 6, 2020",Egyptian rooms particularly good,"First visit to the British Museum in probably over the 40 years and won't leave it long before I return.  It felt like half of Egypt was in those particular rooms, lots of interesting artefacts.  Also looked at the ancient Greek rooms and some of the Asian ones.  Lots of new information gleaned but too much to take in for one visit, so will be back soon."
"Written October 26, 2023","Shambolic, Lengthy Queue to Get In","Don't believe the website saying there is a 2nd entrance in Montague Place.  There's a door but it can't be used to go in.  The queue for the main entrance stretched around the block to Bloomsbury St but was not signposted nor barriered off so people arriving outside the main gates ended up, in effect, trying to jump the (long) queue,  In some cases, this was inadvertent but not always.  The queue was simply to get a cursory bag check."
"Written January 18, 2020",Not to be missed and go back for special exhibits,"This is one of the world's greatest museums, a must-see. I went back (probably 20+ visits in all) to see an interesting special exhibit on Homer. It was an unusual topic, dealing with literature, history and myth with a large range of very interesting items often scattered and some rarely on display."
"Written July 10, 2022",Worth a visit,"We booked tickets online and when we got there the line was huge, but it moved fast.The museum was fabulous, so many amazing things to see. You literally can spend a whole day there. Unfortunately we didn’t have a great deal of time, so identified the main exhibits we wanted to see and walked fast through the other sections.Definitely worth seeing."
"Written February 1, 2020",Amazing resource,There is so much to see here .Fantastic exhibitions which deserve repeated returns .This time we were absorbed in the Anglo Saxon  displays but distracted many times en route to them .Great to see lots of school parties enjoying their visit .
"Written July 11, 2023",Impressive but Exhausting,This museum is massive! There is so much that I highly recommend finding a map. It’s. Dry confusing to get around because it doesn’t go in a logical order according to the rooms.The Egyptian era was amazing and brought history books to life.The Roman era was neat to see too. They have statues you are use to seeing in books. Just beware there are like 5 levels and they are each hit and with the number of people there it is extremely warm inside!
"Written February 16, 2020",Never on a Sunday ,Never on a Sunday. Long queue on the street in the rain. No wAy to bypass it despite having timed expensive tickets to Troy exhibition until inside the courtyard. The place is way too busy. Exhibition impossible to enjoy as minimal lighting and twice as many people as there should be. Note: very few things there actually from Troy anyway!
"Written January 24, 2020",Stupendous ,"This of course is one of the world’s top museums. There’s so much to see it can be overwhelming. An idea is to focus on the special exhibitions, which can be expensive, but always good. You get to see bits of the rest of the collection on the way"
"Written January 30, 2020",Fabulous museum,"World class and free! The Egypt stuff is the best in the world I've heard. Really loved it. The exhibit on money was also really interesting. Budget a lot of time. Maybe go back over a few days, since it is free."
"Written January 23, 2022",Many things to see,"This was quite an interesting Museum. Lots of history of course. The Egyptian Mummy exhibit was quite interesting and to see how they use modern CT scans to determine what is under the wraps and in the caskets is quite interesting. I wish there were more artifacts and history about Finland. They did have some interesting history about Scandanavian areas, just wish more about Finland. Otherwise it was a great museum with lots to see. Bookstore/Gift store and Cafe as well. Best part it was free other than a suggested donation. "
"Written May 9, 2022",Incredible museum,"This has been said before, but don’t try to see everything in one day, as the place is enormous. I wish we had planned a bit better beforehand because there is a top 10 items to see, which I didn’t know about until we were half way through our visit.  Nonetheless on our unplanned walk around we saw many items that were incredible from all around the world and throughout many historical time periods.It’s free, so a no brainer if this sort of thing interests you."
"Written June 25, 2022",Amazing collection of Treasures - just not all ours!,it's the second time we've been to the BM. What amazing things in there. Though i did find myself slightly uncomfortable walking around knowing that many of the artefacts there were plunders from various countries in the time when Britain ruled the world! Get there early - there were Q's from 9.20am. Opens at 10.
"Written February 8, 2023","If you enjoy walking and history, this is the place for you!","Visited for several hours, propably still missed a bunch. Very open and big rooms but felt claustrophobic at times when there was many groups of children running and yelling. Some of the interesting areas were closed for some reason."
"Written January 14, 2020",Full of Knowledge,"As it is broken down into eras and dynasties,  and it is easy to follow the progress of nations. Be prepared for a lot of walking as the place is huge, and on many floors. But have an interest in history and archeology or it may be wasted on you. It could take all day to walk around, but after about 2 hours we had overloaded."
"Written June 1, 2021",Terrible Covid safety,I travelled here for the much lauded Thomas Becket exhibition. As I write I am in a non socially distanced queue for the ladies toilets. You will tell me it is up to people to judge and decide but let me tell you until they are lying in their 2 metre length coffins they don’t know what 2 metres is - I mean they’d have to be very tall....the exhibition was marred by people pushing ahead (oh look a woman has just pushed ahead of me on the stairs to the toilet and I’m not yet dead and fairly fit...) - whilst your guides sit there  and look peaceful. Quite frankly I want my money back. My own workplace is a great deal more secure than this. And don’t gee me started on cultural appropriation.
"Written April 25, 2022",Long lines everywhere,"Be prepared to wait for hours in line to get in even with free tickets for a specific time. The line was 2 blocks long, no accommodations for disabled folks. Every venue in London was crowded with long wait times and expensive.  Add 30% to your budget to visit London."
"Written September 16, 2021",Disappointed,"Interesting as usual. However security guard was quite unreasonable. We left some of our party to go and have lunch that they had brought on the greenery by the main entrance. We then went in search of food, on the assumption that we would just rejoin them. However once we had got food, the security guard did not let us through the gate, saying we'd have to rejoin the queue for the security checks in. Clearly it wasn't as obvious to them as it was to me that they could have simply checked our bags then and there and let us through. As we were quite literally holding food, there was no way the security check would have let us in. Instead we had to leave and go somewhere else. All and in, I would not recommend trying to go and come back with food"
"Written March 21, 2020",Great Collection,Great Collection of some of the best of every country / culture. Especially Asia and Greek collection of my personal interest. Free entry (donation suggested). Assuming normally there's a lineup. we were lucky that there wasn't when we visited. 
"Written May 13, 2023",Well worth a visit,"The wealth of exhibits and the fact that it is free make this a must-see whenever you visit London.  The crowds can be a bit much, so that that timing can be important.  Tour groups tend to descend, so look for buses parked out back.  There is so much to see that you may need more than one day!"
"Written January 16, 2023",Fin and informative,Visited in January 2023 with family.Advisable to book free tickets in advance. There is a separate ques for people with booked tickets.You can get a free map from the reception and visit the attractions according to time you have. There are “not to be missed” exhibits mentioned in the map.Egypt section is the most crowded one.Kids enjoyed the displays.Great way to have fun and informative day out with family.
"Written March 28, 2022",Great big museum but almost too big!,"Went to the museum yesterday with a few friends, I had been before but had completely forgotten how big it was and how much was crammed inside. There's so much to see that in future I would probably choose to do it on two separate times instead of all at once. Fantastic place though."
"Written December 4, 2022",Fantastic museum well worth the visit ,"The British museum is full of the most magnificent treasures, form across the millennia. There are some stunning pieces in an equally stunning building. I always try and visit when I'm in London as there is so much to see, you need a few trips. "
"Written May 14, 2022",The British Museum,Great museum. Their antiquity collection is one of the best. This time went thru the Egyptian rooms (the second floor mummies section is mostly closed for renovation though) and Mesopotamian exhibit.
"Written September 7, 2023",Spectacular Museum. ,This is free and truly you cannot miss this so awesome so much to see give yourself at least 3 hours. The Egyptian section is like wow and wow. Everything we saw was amazing. Great photo opportunities and big gift shop.
"Written November 10, 2022",Exhibits from practically every part of the world ,"We spent practically the whole day on  Sunday there,- reaching at about 11am and only leaving when it closed at 5pm. There is so much to see. It provides a snapshot of practically the whole world as there are exhi its from all the continents and most regions of the world. Truly an educational and eye opening experience. Very tired at the end of the day but it was well worth it being on my feet the whole time visiting the numerous rooms. "
"Written April 11, 2022",One of the World's Great Museums,"What can I say, its the British Museum.  One of the world's great museums.  The Greek, Roman, and Egyptian artefacts are impressive.  The Elgin Marbles are unique...but should be returned to Greece, no?    Very good section on Sutton Hoo - and it's British, so no issues with it :)    Everything is well laid out, explanations are good.  A true learning experience.  And its free (but you are encouraged to leave a donation)."
"Written March 6, 2020",Meet me at the Museum,"Every time I return to London to visit family, the Museum is always on my to do list. This year I couldn’t believe the queues to get in, so I ended up going later in the day. Such a sad thing to be bagged checked at this great institution but alas it’s the sign of the times. Once in, we’ll go to the top floor and work your way down. For me it’s the Egyptian Rooms every time. I feel the despair within the sarcophagus’ - I connect with the sense of life within the glass cabinets.Always an enjoyable time at the BM."
"Written January 5, 2020",Awesome,The museum itself is amazing to visit and look at the architecture. Their collection is just as great. My only complaint would be how seeing the Roseta Stone was managed. Very pushy crowds and chaotic from the moment it opened. Wonderful over wise and excellent shop inside the museum.
"Written October 15, 2023",A building to view.,"The museum building itself is quite magnificent and intimidating in a good way. There is undoubtedly a lot to see and 3 or 4hrs is not enough. However, I did gind it difficult to navigate and whilst the rooms were numbered I found it a bit chaotic and it spoiled my visit which I was really looking forward to.. "
"Written March 31, 2023","fascinating exhibits, well displayed, easy layout.","great visit on Wednesday before Easter hols. some great books in the shop. the tea at the cafe is excellent. loves the Assyria, Ancient Egypt, China, India and Africa galleries - although Africa gallery was a bit limited and also very hot. Only wish we'd had a bit more time as there was lots more to see. Could do with more toilets as very busy, and better signage to the toilets as one sign took us on a wild goose chase."
"Written August 11, 2021",Ok kind of day,"A very impressive building; we were asked to pre book time slots, why I don’t know, no check of you ticket on arrival just follow a queue, have your bag checked and in you go. Popped for a coffee first which was slow and badly organised for service. Exhibition space is huge and one you could quite easily spend days at. However I found the layout very confusing trying to work out if you start left, or right. How everything works and links together and I must say still don’t get the curating set up. Some very interesting facts but would of liked more interpretations of the contents of the cases. After a couple of hours it all felt very similar and we Called it a day. We did have a lunch, can’t Daly the food quality which was good, service again was questionable and certainly having to wait for drinks was not great. Will be back but not for a while"
"Written February 6, 2023",VERY BIG Hard layout to find things,"We went on a Saturday in January. This place is HUGE and there aren't enough bathrooms! It was VERY VERY busy, but for the most part, you didn't have to wait long to get close to a case to view. I didn't see any recognizable staff to ask questions as to how to get from place A to B!  It really was a bit overwhelming - only ended up staying  a couple hours and that was enough."
"Written August 18, 2023",So much to see.,"How can you NOT go here!  It's got a little bit of everything.  The Rosetta Stone, an Easter Island statute, coins dating longer back to you can guess.  It's terribly impressive.  It is, however, extremely crowded.  The lines for restrooms (for men) FLY by, but the lines for restrooms for women are at a snail's pace.  Mind that."
"Written March 1, 2020",Mother of all museums,"It is a huge sprawling place. Artefacts from all over the world and categorized according to country. It is difficult to finish in one day.See one wing , eat something and then see another wing. The place was full of school children perhaps an educational tour for them."
"Written May 29, 2021",Wonderful collection and staff,"As a disabled woman travelling alone, I am always interested in how staff treat me in the various places I mention. The staff at the British Museum were wonderful. I was directed to the lifts without asking, and always felt that my safety and welfare were their concern. The museum collection was amazing, I especially enjoyed the Mesopotamian rooms. "
"Written November 18, 2022",You can easily spend days in here!,"The British Museum is amazing.  The amount of displays throughout are almost overwhelming.  You could easily spend days walking through, reading and taking it all in.  It’s very crowded, so bring your patience.  A must for anyone who enjoys history."
"Written June 27, 2023",Magnificent,"Can't begin to describe how much stuff there is in this place; awesome.  The hand-out map showing where the most popular displays/artifacts were located, was a big help.  You can plan to spend all day there; but after 2 - 3 hours, you'll wish you had planned for a second visit some other day. "
"Written March 8, 2020",Troy Exhibition,"This place always leave me in awe. Fantastic free general entrance makes it a superb visit for anyone. This was the last day of the Troy exhibition and we managed to squeeze it in before our train home. Excellent pieces, well laid out and documented. This place knows how to do it."
"Written July 3, 2022",Many artifacts,"So much to see and do that if you fail to plan you will easily become overwhelmed, as we did. Make sure you pre-plan a course of action. We felt slightly troubled by the fact many of these treasures were plundered (“taken”) from others, just be prepared, it is a bit unsettling."
"Written July 21, 2022",Amazing with Yellow Moon Tours,"If you are history buff you need to go.  Having a guide from Yellow Moon makes it even better, The details you find out from them and history is amazing.  Joe and Georgia make London a great place to visit. "
"Written October 27, 2021",No Covid Precautions,"The British Museum didn’t appear to have any Covid precautions in place. No mask requirement, no limitation on the number of people allowed in rooms, nothing. My wife has a compromised immune system. We can’t be in a place like this. Did the pandemic end????"
"Written March 18, 2022",First time visit,"Luckily we booked this for the only rainy day we had whilst in London. There is so much to see here it’s hard to see everything, we  spent nearly 3 hours here and didn’t see everything. All rooms are well laid out with useful information about the exhibits and you’re able to see whatever you want as not too busy because of booking system"
"Written January 8, 2020",Soooooo much better than my last visit in 1970s,"Wow what a difference, this was a cluttered gloomy place last time I visited. The removal of all the organic building that had stuffed up the quad is amazing, what a lovely space. So much to see, a day is only enough scratch the surface."
"Written February 28, 2020",Troy Exhibition ,"Visiting Troy exhibition . Very disappointed to find it over crowded, despite timed tickets. The signage is in small print at knee or ankle height. Unfortunately due to the design of the lighting, shadows are cast on the information boards further increasing the difficulty of reading the information boards. "
"Written March 7, 2020",One of the World's Best Museums,"Yesterday a friend and I went to see  ""Troy""  Exhibition.   It must have taken years of planning to put together this great show.  I can't advise seeing it,  as it closes tomorrow.  BUT   there is so much to see in the other exhibition halls that  you could be there days.    Added addition,  it has many dining options.  Don't miss this museum!"
"Written January 12, 2020",Kind of disappointing ,"The guide to the rooms are not intuitive or easily seen. The staff was kindly helpful as we asked for specific numbers. Many of the special exhibits were not available, sad. Lots of Egyptians exhibits. The African section seemed to think West Africa represented all of Africa. Not as impressed as I expected to be. "
"Written March 6, 2020",Amazing ,This museum is one of the best I've ever been in. The ancient Greek exhibition is huge. I mean how did they manage to bring all that stuff in the UK. The ancient Egyptian exhibition is also quite big. Nice place to visit and don't forget it is free!!
"Written August 12, 2023","Unmissable, amazing museum ","Undoubtedly one of the world's great museums.  Such an enormous amount of ancient artifacts in incredible condition.  Amazing to see art created more than 4000 years ago.  Of particular interest are the archaeological finds that back up large sections of the Old Testament of the Bible.  Amazing to see items from Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia and Greece that so fully back up what is written in the Bible.  Free entry, but be prepared to queue and for large crowds!"
"Written September 19, 2020",Masterpiece,"One of the best museum I ever seen before : lots of masterpieces, a very nice building and a very nice organisation inside. You cannot don't go there if you travel in London. Only a fool can avoided the British Museum. If you like history please don't miss the Rosetta Stone. It's a big pebble with some writing in different languages. Definitely a masterpiece too. Have fun !"
"Written February 20, 2022",Fabulous!,"Booked tickets in advance for the exhibitions I wanted to see-Peru and Stonehenge. The Stonehenge visit was excellent, full of interesting information and fascinating artefacts. Spent an hour and a half here. I also visited the Peru exhibition. Very good but not nearly as extensive as I had expected for a paid exhibition. Also visited the excellent Japanese exhibition and the Coffee Culture of the Islamic World. Two days well spent at my favourite museum."
"Written August 13, 2022",Amazing,"It's hard to pin point one area that I loved more than the rest. I do love 1485+ years of British history, so I enjoyed the gold coins.I've been before, but there's always so much to see, you can never see it all in one day."
"Written September 15, 2022",Beautifully presented collections - wheelchair accessible ,"Amazing collections with well written descriptions. Wheelchair access was good for the most part, some additional assistance was needed. A very busy location which can make it difficult to navigate in a wheelchair. I think additional seating would be beneficial. "
"Written March 4, 2020",I came to see Alexander walker,"I being here many times, I got off at Holborn  station just follow the sign very easy.I wanted to see Alexander Walker collection it was a small room. Room number 90.Just a few of his Collection was on display. It was free."
"Written February 12, 2020",Always worth a visit,Every year we visit London and I always manage a visit. I am studying Egyptology and love seeing the exhibits fir Egypt and the Near East. There are still parts of the museum that I haven't seen yet.
"Written January 3, 2020",Could Spend a Week,"Absolute must! We could easily spend a week in the museum, it’s huge. Allow at least 3 hours. Also recommend the cafe for lunch, expected it to very busy but got a table right away, reasonable priced good food."
"Written August 1, 2022",Great Museum,There is so much to see at this museum. You could visit many time and fail to see everything. I do think it could be improved by suggesting walking routs to make sure you see everything.
"Written January 11, 2022","Free visit, download floor plan.","Downloaded free museum floor plan on phone. It lists several highlights along with the room they are in. Found them all easily, browsing other rooms and objects on my way round. Well worth a visit."
"Written April 8, 2022",A must see for me,"You can spend an hour or a day at the museum.  Whatever your  age or interests, you will find an exhibit.  I love the Egyptian rooms and Viking treasures. Clean restrooms.  Coffee and treats easily available.  "
"Written February 19, 2020",Superb museum,"Amazing place. Very informative and so much to see. Free entry after a quick bag search! (Unless you’re like the woman in front of us who refused to let go of her bag lol 😂) Ideal place to visit as the weather was bad too. Cafes to have a drink and snack in, but be prepared not to get a seat!! All in all a great experience and worth a visit. "
"Written November 17, 2023",My disappointment with British Museum.,"As expected British Museum is one of the most visited, for the visitors to London. It gets renovated from time to time. During my visit, this time, I was very much interested in Indian section. But there, was no specific  section called Indian. It was called: China and South Asia. I was very much disappointed. They have given huge importance to China and its culture and neglected India. We are know, India was a CROWN in the jewel of British Empire. Now, British Museum, disowned, its own CROWN. Very disappointed, indeed. I might not visit again."
"Written October 1, 2022",Five hours were not enough,"Spectacular and well-organized museum. There is no charge, but there is a counter when you enter that looks like a ticket counter, but it is for donations. Don't let the lines scare you. It goes fast and once inside the museum, everyone spreads out. Of course, there were hordes of school children. The Cafe in the museum is very upscale. Take time for that.  "
"Written May 23, 2021",Just great value,"Had a brief visit on a Sunday morning post-lockdown, staff were excellent and very helpful.We covered from ancient Egypt, through to medieval Europe and took in the new Sutton Hoo exhibition.Fascinating stuff and well worth a visit, probably would struggle to cover it all even with 2 full days!"
"Written April 3, 2020",Tea,"Yup they sell tea and scones,  the service was quick and effective . There's a few places for refreshments  in the museum and the balcony bar wasn't the ideal location, but it punctuated my visit. looking at all those  plundered empire goodies and the Japanese gallery. "
"Written November 21, 2022",Amazing museum for free,"Is a huge museum with lot of ancient history exhibits. Was amazed to see mummies so close. But my personal crush was Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. I only read about it when I was a child, as here it is, real statues from there. Amazed!And the court is great in terms of space and amazing ceiling!Also The Great wave off Kanagawa stored here, but it is exhibited once per several years. We missed, but you might be lucky"
"Written January 9, 2023",Nice free museum,For a big museum like this with so many exhibited items. It is hard to imagine that it is actually free. You can easily spend a few hours or even more because there’s a lot to see. Highly recommend it to people who would like some free leisure.
"Written January 4, 2020",Great museum highly recommend it,Ive been to the museum in mid December.It was free and with wonderful historic details.The roman ruined details were my preferred area of visit.Highly recommend the museum for anyone coming to London.
"Written March 25, 2022",Excellent Stonehenge exhibition,"Brilliant Stonehenge exhibition. Interesting exhibits, well displayed and explained. Spent over 90 minutes in it, although some of that was unfortunately queuing to get to see things. Also enjoyed the Sutton Hoo finds and usually also visit the Lion Hunt but this was closed for some reason. Only downside is the appalling ground floor cafe, dreadful food and horrible seating - don’t go there."
"Written October 20, 2022",A great place,"Great Place!  So much to see, not enough time to see everything.  Such rich history in this museum and not crowded together.  It would take at least a year to  walk through and see everything.  The best part is no entrance fees, only donations."
"Written September 17, 2023",A must-see when in London,"The sheer wealth of objects and history of this place is simply mind-blowing. There’s so much to see: Egypt, Babylon, Persia, Australia.. I can recommend to book a guided „around the world“ tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable, amazingly polite and she truly made our visit an unforgettable experience. I will certainly come back."

I understand it may be as do not want people walking around with sticky/dirty fingers but when you re with children it is a problem that they want something to drink or eat. "
"Written June 24, 2020",Amazing Museum,"As a history lover, I really enjoyed the museum. There's everything from the Egyptians, to the Greeks, to the Mesopotamians, Chinese and many more. It's a worldwide history tour. And the Rosetta Stone is a must-see even if there's always a lot of people around it.Would highly recommend."
"Written March 26, 2023",Good day at museum,"So much to see for kids and adults alike. Egyptian mummies , tombs . Greek sculptures were amazing. The Chinese jade collection.

Make sure you book on line very busy ."
"Written March 2, 2020",What a treat!,We hadn't planned on going here while on our short visit to London. We had only 2 hours to spare and took a walk to this lovely place and we were so happy we did. Easy security lines and a bustling atmosphere is a beautifully laid out space. Wonderful exhibits with something for everyone in our family. Don't miss it!
"Written January 4, 2020",MUST VISIT,I think that everyone knows that they must go to this museum when they visit London.  My suggestion is to plan what you want to see and not get distracted but all the things you could see.  The library to the right of the entrance often gets overlooked because everyone goes left to the RS and Elgin Marbles.  It had curios that were really interesting.  
"Written March 5, 2020",One of the best museum I saw ever,"Huge huge museum, beats even Louvre in size of gallerys. It's all free majorly, some special areas need ticket. However, you need a whole day to capture all of its offering. This is not a 1/2 hr visit place."
"Written May 6, 2022",Stonehenge and more,Went to the World of Stonehenge exhibition. Much wider than just Stonehenge and interesting to see the extent of trade going on at that time. Lots of exhibits on loan from other countries. Imaginative exhibition with atmospheric soundtrack playing. Highly recommended.
"Written March 4, 2022",A good couple of hours to have in London,"A variety of eras and civilisations covered in an easy to walk building. You can walk room to room, slipping from one era to another, with plenty to have a look at.It can be, if I being honest, a little disconnected in how the different timelines are situated on the main floor. However, if you just keep on walking, you’ll hit everything no matter the order."
"Written July 18, 2022",Makes me proud to be British. So long as you dont think too hard about how we got a lot of the stuff here.... ,Awesome. An amazing collection of exhibits from all around the world.Suitable for a quick trot round or a full day (or more) of exploration.Massively busy when I visited on a Friday midday but thats to be expected for such a unique place.
"Written September 14, 2021",Awesome,"If you enjoy museums then this is an absolute must.  While I didn’t spend too much time here as I had a prior engagement, but what I did see was incredible.  There is no cost but you need to book a time slot on the website.  Very clean and tidy and items well preserved and nicely spaced out.  There are plenty of clean toilets as well as coffee shops and souvenir shops.  Be prepared to spend a few hours here! Definitely worth a visit,"
"Written August 2, 2023",Don't try to do it all in one visit,"Try to figure out in advance what you want to see. There is so much, that it takes many, many visits to take it all in. If you have a chance, take a guided tour of what interests you.Seeing how much and what the British have ""acquired"" made me better understand the discussion about returning precious artefacts to the original countries."
"Written February 4, 2023",Went to visit our parthenon marbles,Amazing museum. Huge. You need a full day. Only downside was the room the Parthenon marbles is in was freezing! Why? Nice cafe. Helpful staff. Pay for the audio tours it is worth it. 
"Written February 8, 2020",Family trip to the capital,"Fabulous time had here with a 13 year old and 8 year old. So much to see that we could have easily spent the day here. Cafe is reasonably priced, and some great gift and book shops. Love the place. We will return! 😍"
"Written March 16, 2023",It is a big museum! Worth your time,This museum is true to its marketing - it is big! Take your time to visit all the halls and exhibitions. The bathrooms were clean during the December tourist season and the curio shop is packed with good quality items. Well worth your time and definitely a must see.
"Written May 24, 2022",Great with kids,"We had prebooked a ticket but it wasn't checked, just bags searched. Place was huge, we arrived about 2 hours before closing and think I saw half of it. Since my kid had ancient Europe just thought in school we mainly focused on that. 2 hours was enough for that. Collection is huge and stunning, although I'm not sure about the morality of some of the artifacts. I recommend plan ahead of what to see and where things are located."
"Written March 6, 2020",So much to see,"One of my top three. Very detailed exhibits with great pieces. Well laid out to follow progression of cultures. Not such good layout when switching between cultures. Rosetta Stone, Elgin marbles, mummies.Chinese history, Rome just a few. Had a large room entitled the Enlightenment that I could spend a year in."
"Written February 26, 2020",2nd visit ,"Absolutely amazing, but probably need 2 days to see all. Well organised, very busy but didn’t feel too crowded. Plenty of washrooms (always important). Amazingly foc to enter but donations gratefully accepted. "
"Written February 22, 2020",Family Visit,"A great day out, to much to do in one day so we got a map and took 10 minutes to choose which parts we wanted to look at. Good facilities and very clean toilets. Free to get in but there are places to make a donation. Free WiFi. Will definitely go back."
"Written September 11, 2021",The food is the only thing in the British Museum that is british!,"There isn't a wide variety of fare but it is perfectly adequate. What one would expect from a small catering unit in a public museum. Good staff. As well as the usual faddish, false milks there is also proper full-fat milk! Now being offered that is ancient!"
"Written February 21, 2023",Amazing!,"They didn’t check our ticket and was no sign of how they were managing numbers that entered. Place was packed in some areas (Egyptian) and others weren’t too bad. There is so much to see, you could spend a week there. I will definitely return to see more "
"Written April 10, 2023",Stunning items in a stunning building,We needed two trips to the Museum to see everything. The inside is stunning. The Egyptian section was my favourite but other family members loved the Aztec and Chinese sections too. There is a wonderful shop inside and even the food is better than expected. 
"Written March 2, 2023",The equivalent of the Louvre in London,"I did three of the free guided visits. I loved the last one: Ancient Rome (at 15:15). David was articulate and engaging. He gave us a recap of the Roman Empire in around 40 minutes. It was very my favourite out of the three guided visits I did. One of the best museums I’ve been in London so far ! Definetely recommend to come if you have at least 2 hours. There’s so much to see, you need to  do several visits."
"Written March 4, 2023",Great but avoid if you have an allergy.,"Museum is amazing, but ultimately too big to try and do in one visit. The map also isn’t very clear/easy to work out. Main issue was with the catering facilities in the museum. No allergy information is shown on the counter but there are signs reassuring allergy sufferers that they only need to ask and they will be helped. Allegedly.I asked at the counter and the server said she thought two of the cakes were gluten free but that she would check. She went to a colleague who who filling the fridge and asked. His response was, ‘we’re too busy. Just tell him we don’t know and we can’t find out because the manager isn’t here’. I found this quite rude to be honest, and can’t believe that the eateries don’t have an allergen menu to hand. It’s an accident waiting to happen…"
"Written September 11, 2020",Good to be back,Reduced lower ground route available. Well organised entry and visit. Staff visibly cleaning seating areas. Enjoyed being back to visit one of my favourite places.
"Written February 18, 2020",Thousands of years of World's History in one place.,"The British Museum is definitely a must see. Free entrance since the opening day, it is an absolute moving experience. Browsing throught history, room by room, is riveting.  Rosetta Stone and the Partenon are, of course, masterpieces, but they are not the only one. Every time I visit here, I am amazed. And the staff is kind, professional and helpful. Don't miss this jewel!"
"Written May 3, 2022",Best museum in the world ,"Love the BM...so mych of interest for everyone. Went this time for the Stonehenge exhibition which was interesting but a little disjointed in its presentation we found. I would also question some of the ""facts"" ..however the artefacts were excellent"
"Written July 26, 2023",Impressive but crowded,"Visited 24th of july. The crowds here were no joke. The Rosette's Stone and the Eqyptian section is the death zone. The exhibitions were impressive and vast, but less from what the Natural History Museum and V&A Museum had to offer. Would recommend for someone interested in history and archeology."
"Written January 7, 2020",Awesome place,"This place reminded me of Louvre, with so many things to see.  Best of all, it's free to get in.  We only spend 3 hours there, but you can easily spend days if you want.  My kids enjoyed the Rosetta Stone and other Egyptian antiquity items."
"Written February 25, 2020","Amazing place, cold spend weeks here!","Absolutely incredible. We went to see the Rodin Exhibition and it was an absolute marvel. The size of the place is a signt to behold and the structure itself well worth a visit, but there's always so mcu to see you will keep going back."
"Written January 1, 2022",Not enough time!,"Two hours flew by!  I wished we spent 4 hours minimum.  Semi-private tour is worth the investment.  Our tour guide, Becky, basically grew up at this museum.  And it showed.  Well done, kid."
"Written February 12, 2023",As good as ever,Never disappointed when visiting National Museum. Always impressed with amount and variety of items on display. Felt very welcome as a visitor and not rushed in any way. Plenty to impress all ages from young children to not so young! Wheelchair friendly and in easy walking distance from major railway stations. Well worth a visit.
"Written July 16, 2023",Crowded and hot,"This place is great in every sense, but it was to crowded and warm for us. It was also difficult to find a place to seat down. We ended our stay with just seeing a glimt of all the museum have to offer. Maybe we had a better experience on one of these guided tours."
"Written March 28, 2023",Fantastic museum,Large museum with a lot of great things to see. It’s well laid out with good signage to direct you. We loved all the displays. We spent about 4 hours but you could definitely make it a full day.

"Written March 25, 2022",Great for the whole family,"A wonderful afternoon at an historic institution.  My kids liked the mummies, of course, but also enjoyed the Roman and British artifacts.  We spent a lot of time in the Mesopotamia area as well.  The personal library in cuneiform combining about doing homework or getting a baby to sleep was priceless.  The courtyard cafes were also great for a break with the littles between exhibits."
"Written November 1, 2021",Great day out,"Absolutely brilliant, still as good as when I was younger, now I get to enjoy how great it is with my child. So fantastic to be able to go to London again and we have the best museums. Staff are really helpful and friendly, very clean and safe environment. Everything was perfect, great day out."

There is never enough time to see it all.I was very pleased to be able to sign one of the Condolence Books marking the passing of Queen Elizabeth II. She had been Queen my whole life &, as I went to elementary school in Canada, her beautiful portrait hung in our classroom. I knew that all was right with the world as she was in charge.Do NOT miss this museum!It is free but leave a donation if you can."
"Written April 14, 2022",Great free entertainment for all the family,Booked time slot on line. How lovely that it’s a fee attraction. Used the back entrance so no queues to get in. Managed to get a free guided tour of Mexico which was excellent. Well worth a visit.

"Written June 29, 2022",Enjoyable.,"The museum is very well laid out, an efficient and quick wiring system, plenty to see. Personally, I wouldn’t have thought this would be massively interesting for children, definitely more for adults. That said, there were plenty of school parties in attendance. An enjoyable morning out."
"Written January 25, 2020",one of the great big museums,"Huge museum, too for one day or one visit. best to go in for a couple of hours, out and back in another day. best for ancient Greece and the things you barely listened to in school, now real and intresting"
"Written September 18, 2021",Always worth a visit! One of the best in the world.,I never tire of the British Museum.  Excellent for adults and children.  A wonderful collect from all over the world.  See many of the things you studied in World History class or have heard and read about.  Beautifully done and worth a visit every time you are in London.
"Written September 28, 2020",Not only for rainy days,Fantastic collection for adults and children alike. you can go 100 times and you have still not seen everything.  The building with his atrium is already worth a visit. Take a look into the old reading room. Very good exhibitions - well curated!
"Written September 3, 2021",Great place,"Huge museum, spread over many floors. They have an excellent Ancient Egypt section, but its a bit scary to see the mummies.lovely toilet areas, nice shop (although a bit busy). Really enjoyed our time here"
"Written July 12, 2022",Great Exhibit,"Came with my wife to see the feminine power exhibit and honestly it was great. Learnt a lot and was very impressed with what they've put together for the exhibit. We then went around the rest of the museum and loved every minute of it! Especially the Egyptian and Phoenician sections. Very much my field, and I always love how well curated they are!"
"Written October 13, 2022",A true gem!,Lovely museum with lots of exhibits. We went there to see the Rosetta stone but unfortunately they only had the replica. The museum is very spacious and easy to navigate. The dining area was under these wonderful glass ceilings which we thoroughly enjoyed. We only covered a third of it but hope to visit it again. Admission is free so that is a plus!!
"Written August 2, 2022",It would take you days and days to run out of things to see,"The diversity of exhibits is almost overwhelming.  Large, well -lit spaces with beautifully curated rooms. Crowds well-managed; plenty of staff available to answer questions.  Reading between the pages, the exhibits from Greece, Egypt and the ancient near east make clear the hubris of British collectors who, during the halcyon years of the Empire, stripped those countries of their antiquities. As unsettling as it is beautiful."
"Written March 22, 2022","Wonderful museum, but confusing layout","This is a world-famous museum for many reasons.  In general, the displays are easy to understand.  However, it is not always easy to find the room you are looking for.  We kept missing the room about Mexico, and finally discovered it was closed, though no reason was given.  We concentrated on British history and were fascinated by all of the objects found all over the country.  I thought the gift and book stores were great and I absolutely loved the afternoon cream tea!  Best scones I’ve ever had!"
"Written January 28, 2020",Couple of days worth!!,"There is *so* much to see!! Definitely plan your visit, get a hold of a map/collections. This museum is HUGE, as are the incredible collections.  Just the Egyptian collection is enough to keep you mesmerized for a while. One tip, though--avoid the weekends. "
"Written April 18, 2022",Great family activity for partial day.,"This is a lovely museum, best of all it is gratis! Very easy to get too. It is a great place for kids. Plenty of bathrooms and activities for children. They offer a family area with lockers and eating tables. It’s definitely I’d say a 3 hour activity. Beyond that kids can become very uninterested. With children you also got to fast track entry. Food options are basic but plenty to eat outside near museum. Don’t forget to prebook your slot!!! No entry no access. Our kids are 7&8. A total family of 6 had a very nice time."
"Written April 2, 2023",Great museum with so much to do and see,"This has to be a must visit if your in London and want to enjoy seeing some of the most interesting antiquities in the world.Such a wide range to enjoy, in lovely surroundings and a great cafe too !Be it wet, cold, windy, sunny put it on the list and anyway it’s free so what’s not to enjoy!"
"Written August 8, 2021",Great day out,"Fantastic museum with good staff. The gift shop had so much we wanted to buy, which is rare for us as we never buy things from gift shops. The history in this museum was very good. The floors are well layered and there's good information on each floor.One minor negative is that there needs to be more lifts for people with buggies or those in a wheelchair/mobility scooter."
"Written April 10, 2023",Always nice to go visit,I have been going to the BM for many years. Now that we no longer live in the UK we always go to it whenever we are in London. The place has only got better over the years. It is a great place to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon with the family. 
"Written March 2, 2022",Brilliant Stonehenge Exhibition ,"Visited the excellent Stonehenge exhibition, which surpassed expectation. Beautifully curated, full of information & drop dead gorgeous exhibits. The experience was enhanced by the subdued sound & lighting, which ensured that the visit was a calm, contemplative experience. Highly recommended."
"Written April 9, 2022",Superb Stonehenge ,"We came to see the Stonehenge exhibition. It was fabulous in that it has some amazing exhibits and excellent explanations. The only thing I would say is that the exhibition doesn't major on Stonehenge itself but on contemporary life   around Stonehenge, in the UK and Northern Europe."

"Written June 21, 2021","Pots, pots and more pots","Worth a visit, who doesn't love a museum.Managed to spend a couple of hours here. What I found most interesting was the mummies and un-decomposed bodies.Plenty of pots. They certainly loved making pots in history."
"Written June 30, 2021",First time at the British Museum,"What a wonderful experience.  So many amazing exhibits displaying some fantastic historical artefacts.  You could spend a whole weekend exploring.  A few restrictions and a one way system at the moment, because of Covid precautions, but it did not spoil the experience.  A fabulous place to visit."
"Written February 24, 2020",Amazing,"I'm not a huge history fan but I can completely appreciate what is on offer here, it's actually overwhelming how much there is to see and learn about. Would recommend to anyone, definitely worth a visit for anyone. Suitable for all ages, couples and families with children."
"Written November 17, 2022",Such a stunning collection of history!,"I enjoyed visiting the museum but did not have the time to do it justice.  The rooms are full of amazing icons and tidbits of history.  Soak it in and learn.  I loved seeing all the crosses, the tools from long ago, the cultural items...... just fascinating. "
"Written October 9, 2022",Excellent museum and exhibition,Absolutely love this  museum which is a beautiful building to wander around in even before seeing any of the exhibitions. Attended the new hieroglyphics exhibition which was outstanding. The curator's talk was excellent and really helped to make sense of the exhibits and put them into context. There is a mixture of large and small items and the history of how Egyptian writings were deciphered and the process was absolutely fascinating. Would like to return to visit some of the other exhibits. Was very privileged to have seen this exhibition. Highly recommend.

"Written February 14, 2007",One of the Greatest Museums in the World,"We planned a day at the British Museum, but it wasn't enough. You could literally spend a week walking it's halls and you wouldn't see everything. The trick is to be selective with what you want to see and focus on that. With a background in art (and a longstanding desire to study Egyptology), I limited my focus to the classical Greek/Roman and Egyptian wings.My short-list for the must-see artifacts/exhibits include the Rosetta Stone; the Parthenon Scriptures; ALL of the Ancient Egyptian Culture wing; and, the authenic Easter Island statue. But there is so, so much more. Buy a guidebook and get lost in the richness of this museum. The only downside of the museum is the pricey cafeteria...yes, the British Museum is free to the public but make a contribution in the form of a monetary donation, not towards a stale muffin that cost an arm and a leg. There are plenty of foodstops around the museum to satisfy your hunger after a long day of education & appreciation."
"Written February 3, 2019",The worst experience ever,I had the worst experience here. Im a mexican and i came as a tourist with my boyfriend from bulgaria. It was our first time here and the people on the entrance didn 't allow us to go inside the museum because they claim we look like pick pocketers. This is the first time we are discriminated like that. They didn't let us talk to the manager and they ask us for an ID. I am so upset at this people. The worst experience ever!!
"Written January 17, 2019",Worst customer service.,"I understand having to go through security to get into such a big museum but the security guards were horrible. They barely checked the bags so what's the use of having the queue in the first place. Then I was directed to a donations counter where a rude bald man basically forced me to donate. As I walked off he sang mongoloid under his breath at me, very uncalled for and racist. This man should be fired."

I lived half a year in London and half a year in NY City. I enjoyed to visit the interesting places in NY City/ USA and in London/ U.K.In 1985, I went several times into the British museum.

Then she threw away one of our teenagers lunches that was in a clear plastic bag claiming it could have been a bomb. Im not sure why she picked it up and threw it in the bin, instead of clearing the area and calling the police, if she truly believed it was a hazard. She then refused to give it back. We live in London so pay for this museum out of our taxes so we don't expect to be treated like this by the staff. "
"Written April 7, 2014",Boring and old fashioned exhibition.,"Oh dear British Museum! The Vikings exhibition ...where do I start? We were so looking forward to this exhibition having visited Viking museums in Denmark, Sweden and Finland. We had heard so much about it. Obviously we knew it was going to be mobbed as all such exhibitions are now, but if this is the case and the museum wants to maximise the number of visitors it will also have to radically review its design and layouts for the exhibition, perhaps maximising digital technology more. Shuffling round cases with 100’s of other visitors is not pleasant or instructive; neither would I rush back for another exhibition like this. Many cases and labels could not be read due to the crush. People took long periods to read and study exhibits and this meant others could not do the same. There was no decent introduction to the exhibition. No drama, just fairly dull cases of exhibits and some, very brief footage. Given the subject matter “Vikings” surely there could have been some more drama and excitement injected into this exhibition? The Viking museum in Stockholm is a far more entertaining history of the Viking age. The queues subsided a little by the time we got to the boat and finally there was better use of visuals and film footage. But with all the technology available today surely an institution  like the British Museum could have created a far more exciting, interesting exhibition, which was much more accessible to the large numbers you wanted to go thorough it each hour. Museums have come a long way since the days of glass cabinets and signs. Come on British Museum as one of the pre-eminent museums of the world you need to be moving with the times. Some of our smaller museums in the UK have understood this and moved with the times. You need to do likewise."
"Written March 24, 2014",Vikings,I have enjoyed many special exhibitions at the BM - the Vikings is certainly not worth the entrance fee. As other reviewers have said it is ridiculously overcrowded and it took 20 minutes from the entrance to reach the first case. It was crowded the whole way through and about halfway around I just gave up as I was thoroughly frustrated. Poor labelling meant I came away with no further knowledge of the Vikings. It's almost as if the exhibition had been put together by amateurs. This has made me seriously consider whether I go to any future exhibitions. Very very disappointing.
"Written August 19, 2019",So busy!!! ,"We visited here at peak time so was extremely busy, so busy that we couldn’t really get to most of the things we wanted to see, the things we did see was really interesting but if I was to go again I would go at a quieter time as it ruined the experience. "
"Written September 7, 2016",One of the best museums in London – and it’s free!,We just had to pop into the British Museum again while we were in London.  It is full of interesting exhibits and we had such an enjoyable couple of hours.There is so much to see and admission is free.  We had a look at the Ancient Egyptian display again while we were visiting as we had enjoyed it so much on our previous visit.The British Museum is definitely worth a visit and there is something of interest for everyone.
"Written June 5, 2005",Great tour of museum,"I used the guide book ""London for Dummies"" and found lots of good tips for visiting London.  One of the suggestions is to take a guided tour of the British Museum.  It costs us about 12 US dollars but was well worth it.  The museum is huge so this let us see the highlights.  The guide was excellent and told the stories behind the displays that you otherwise would never know.  It lasted about an hour and a half.  There are different tours you can take, some more in depth or that focus on particular periods of history."
"Written February 8, 2014",British Museum – Tips on How to Visit,"The British Museum is the oldest national public museum in the world, first opening in 1759 to display Sir Hans Sloane’s collection of 71,000 objects, which he bequeathed to the nation upon his death in 1753.  The museum has provided free admission since the day it opened its doors and has expanded its permanent collection to over 8 million pieces, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive museums in the world.  The British Museum is also the second most visited museum in the world with almost 6 million visitors annually. It is an attraction that is a must-see for first time visitors to London and a place that many English and foreign visitors return to visit time and time again. Because of the size of the British Museum, it is well worth having a game plan in mind before your visit.  The museum is simply too large to visit in a single day and if you only have a few hours to spend here, it is important to do a bit of planning ahead of time to maximise your visit.  Below are some tips for how visit the British Museum 1.) Know the opening days and hours. The British Museum galleries and shops are open from 10.00am to 5.30pm daily with extended hours until 8.30pm each Fridays so you can spend more time in the museum on that day.  The Grand Court area where you can buy tickets to the special exhibitions and pick up Museum maps opens at 9.00am each morning. 2.) Do I need tickets?   The permanent collections at the British Museum are free to visit.  If you feel inclined, there are donation boxes at the museum entrances allowing you to contribute and show support to the museum.  Consider dropping a few £s in the box or perhaps spending some money in the museum shops or cafes to help offset the costs of operating the museum. While the permanent collections are free, there is fee for tickets to the special and temporary exhibitions.  You can buy these tickets online or at the ticket desks in the Grand Court during the time of your visit.  Refer to the British Museum website ‘Whats On’ section for special exhibition ticket prices. 3.) Benefits to visit early or late in the day?Interestingly, and perhaps because admission is free, we’ve never encountered queues entering the British Museum, either at the main entrance on Russell Street or the back entrance on Montague Place.  This comes with a great sigh of relief and theoretically allows you to plan your day more flexibly, knowing you won’t have to wait to see the museum once you arrive (just think of those dreadful queues outside the Louvre in Paris or the Vatican in Rome). However, while entry queues are not an issue at the British Museum, this doesn’t mean that you won’t encounter large crowds once incise. For example, we have visited and witnessed shoulder-to-shoulder people into the Egyptian galleries.  This makes for a much less enjoyable museum experience.  As such, it is still worth considering an early or late visit, when the bulk of the crowds can be avoided. Some attractions in the museum, like the Rosetta Stone, just seem to always have a crowd lingering.  Be patient and you’ll be able to eventually get close to these items to see up close.  4.) Know what you want to see before you arrive!  The number of galleries, antiquities and artworks at the British Museum can seem daunting at times, especially if you arrive without knowing what is available to see and how to go about your visit.  In this regard, one of the most useful things you can do before arriving at the museum is to simply familiarize yourself with the museum layout and determine what galleries and specific items you want to see while you are there.  There are several simple ways to do this. First, we recommend spending a bit of time on the British Museum official website, reviewing the ‘Visiting’ Section and ‘Floor Plans and Galleries’ pages of the website so you can get a feel for the layout of the museum. For those with limited time to visit the museum, you might also want to review the ‘Planning Your Visit – Object Trails’ pages.  Here you can find a variety of suggested walking tours, covering different combinations of museum highlights.  Secondly, it is well worth purchasing a good travel book for London (we like the DK Eyewitness London Guide).  When doing this, have a look at the written section for major attractions like the British Museum, which should include at minimum – a map and layout of the museum, descriptions for the important galleries and highlight attractions within the museum.  A good guide book can go a long way to helping you plan your time at the museum and you can use it along with the free museum Map to help navigate your way around during your visit. 5.) Use the free foldable British Museum Map:  In the Grand Court you will find free foldable Map, which are the single best resource for you to use when navigating your way around the museum.  The map includes not only the museum layout but lists the regional galleries and room names along with some of the most popular museum highlights.  While the layout of the museum is quite intuitive, it remains a vast complex of rooms and it can be easy to lose track of where you are at times. Having the handy folded Map can help you stay on track and navigate your way through the museum. 6.) Wear comfortable walking shoes.  Museums like the British Museum require you to spend a lot of time on your feet.  Wearing comfortable walking shoes can make a big difference in the quality of your visit and your overall experience.  7.) Coffee, snack and lunch breaks!  There are several museum cafes and a restaurant within the British Museum.  They are a bit pricy, as you would expect when visiting museum eateries.  However, it can be a good idea to take a break at some point during your visit and let your feet rest.  This can make a difference if you are intending to spend several hours or more at the museum.  8.) Save the museum shops until the end! There are four different shops within the British Museum where you can pick up souvenirs of your visit.  However, we suggest holding off your purchases until the end of your visit.  The Great Court Shop and the Collection Shop found in the Great Court have a large number of items and you’ll likely pass back through the area just before leaving.  In the end, the British Museum is easily one of the very best museums in the world and it is free to visit.  It’s one of those places that you really should try to make time for when visiting London.  We have been numerous times and always find a reason to go back."
"Written August 24, 2004",Amazing!,When visiting London we always tend to head straight for the Natural History Museum but this time we thought we would take a visit to the British Museum. We were not disappointed. Many of the artifacts I had only ever seen in books before and it was great to see them before my eyes. The best exhibits by far are the mummies. They are fascinating ( and quite gruesome!). I also loved the peat bog man who I'd seen on television so many times before. The elgin marbles are also worth seeing ( after visiting the Acroplis a few years ago and being disappointed that they were missing! ). All in all a great day out ( and you do need a whole day to see all of the collections ). Recommended!
"Written November 10, 2019",Must visit,"This is a must visit museum in London. Hours and hours of history and exhibits. You can easily spend one full day and you might have not seen everything they have there. A real gem to be visited if you are into museums, arts, and archeology."

The way i see it, and i am a history major, is that the artifacts housed in the british museum are interesting, and have value, but, they are the historic artifacts of other places. If you want to see London, go to the tower of london, or a pub, or anywhere, if you want to see some really cool prehistoric stuff from other places like egypt and greece, go to the british museum."

"Written March 22, 2014","Viking Exhibition - overcrowded, overpriced and underwhelming","The British Museum’s Viking exhibition is a disgraceful shambles.    It must be the most crowded exhibition ever experienced.  We were very disappointed to find the queues unacceptably long.   Immediately on beginning the queue we were advised by the BM staff to move to another part of the exhibition.   We decided to queue for a while but after waiting 15 minutes and not even reaching the 1st display case, we decided to move on.   However, the remainder of the exhibition was also completely packed, full to bursting.  At each and every exhibition case the customers were 4 or more deep and no-one was moving.  As for the centrepiece of the exhibition:    Where was the impressive boat prow?   All that was exhibited were a few pieces of wood lying at the base of the 21st century steel structure.   A vivid imagination is required.  It was definitely unimpressive.We made the difficult decision to abandon the exhibition.   But actually it was with relief that we left after spending a frustrating 45 minutes in the exhibition without actually seeing anything of note because of the mass of people.The BM appear to be more interested in making money than in providing an enjoyable  and enlightening experience.We’ll be avoiding any future exhibitions at the BM unless we are assured they have made significant improvements.  Perhaps, the organisers should take a little trip to the V & A or British Library to see how it’s done."
"Written March 17, 2014",a complete waste of money. Vikings.,"What is the point of having timed entry if there is no control of the numbers of people inside the exhibition. The British Museum have completely overestimated the numbers of people this exhibition wold comfortably absorb, at least on a Sunday afternoon. I should have feared the worst when the attendant at the entrance said 'you might want to skip the first room, and rejoin the start of the exhibition later!'....... how about, ""Tell you what the British museum have just fleeced you of £49.50 for 3 tickets, the whole exhibition is very overcrowded, but we have got a shop at the end fully of tacky presents for you to buy to go home with. Have a nice day."" What the British Museum should adopt is attendants at staggered/ strategic stages of the exhibition making sure there is a good flow of people, as ably demonstrated by Durham and the Lindisfarne Gospels exhibition. And BM - don't going telling me that the numbers for that exhibition were smaller and far more manageable.   I would be saying don't go to the Vikings at a weekend. Unless you want to may money to stand in a claustrophobic crowd."

After being denied admission to the exhibition, we moved to a space that would allow other visitors to pass us, which this staff member took exception to and called security. She then accused us of attacking her!The security guard dismissed these allegations and let us enter the exhibition but our experience was ruined by the untrue allegations made against my wife and I."

"Written March 17, 2014",Viking exhibition,"Went on Saturday 15 March through a timed ticket allowing entry at 11.20.Hugely dissappointed! There was little in the way of queue management from the staff other than suggesting that we go to a different part of the exhibition then returning later for the exhibits. This showed a complete misunderstanding of the problem because when we tried to get back to the start we were confronted by other visitors and it was like walking against a river current. In general all exhibits were poorly displayed with NO identification (simple numbers would have sufficed) in the text which was always poorly sited at the bottom on the exhibition cabinet. National Museum you should be acutely aware of the queuing problems we witnessed last Saturday as the exhibition has now been running for a few weeks and yet, so far as I could tell are doing nothing about it. The place was so crowded that we left after just 30 minutes to take in the rest of the museum which was as a museum should be tranquil, uncluttered and informative. The Vikings was a complete waste of money and will bear in mind this rather unfortunate experience when we are contemplating another 'special' British Museum you MUST learn and act on the many adverse comments which have been posted from visitors "
"Written August 4, 2013",British hmm maybe not,I may be a liitle confused but I went into the British museum really expecting to see British history and items from the past.  What I saw was Egyption history and Indian OK maybe the latter was part of the empire but so was Britain so why such limited information about our history.
"Written May 4, 2013",Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum - exhibition only,"I was quite excited at getting the opportunity to view this exhibition having visited Pompeii and Herculaneum several years ago and hot having had chance to get to the museums there to see the artefacts.Purchased ticket online, you don’t need to queue at the ticket office, just head for the Herculaneum queue with the print out.  They will ask for your surname (not the credit card you paid with) and with a surly attitude they will say you are 10 minutes early and you have to go back at the end of the queue.So the slots for groups are every 10 minutes which ensures a constant thick flow of people which explains the huge bottleneck on entrance which continues throughout the event.  Initially you crowd around a poor dog which has been eternally captured twisted in agony but don’t expect the rest of the exhibition to follow in this vein.   You shuffle around for the next hour bumping shoulders and on tiptoes to try and look at the usual jewels, crockery, hairpins and oil lights and the struggle to read descriptions before the next person treads on your toe or tuts in your ear.The one exceptional piece, not for the feint-hearted, is a statue of Pan fornicating with a goat, it is in pristine condition and gives you a sense of the humour, craftsmanship and beliefs of the Romans, and this is echoed in the murals, inscriptions and friezes giving you an interesting look into Roman life at the time.You finish off with another moving piece, the display of people in the throes of death, holding their nose and in the boxing position as their terrifying death is captured forever which makes you imagine their death and marvel at the actual size of the person.I left this exhibition a bit deflated.  It wasn’t the lack of value for money £16 I’d spent and not having even a piece of paper to explain in depth what I was seeing and indeed seeing things of which better examples are displayed even within the museum itself; or the fact I had been the sheep in a flock which had squeezed around some silly dead-ended layouts which couldn’t accommodate the swarms.  I think it was the fact that I had pushed, shoved and fought to see some poor soul and their loved ones scalded and burned to death that left me a bit deflated and voyeuristic but then again that’s what I paid for.Please note this review is for the exhibition only and does not reflect on the excellence of the rest of the museum.I am de-selecting wheelchair and buggy access, because of the amount of bodies, lack of space, the narrow lanes to some exhibitions without turning space and taking into account that most displays are above 4'."

To each his own.The collections are absolutely amazing.  The Assyrian Gallery fascinating, as are the Greek, Roman, and Egyptian exhibits.  I satyed close to the mueum, and went 3 different days for a couple of hours. I also thought the building itself was beautiful. If you are in London, missing this museum is a crime. The amount of items housed here is truly overwhelming, I will definitley return."
"Written June 7, 2006",The British Museum - a must see!,"This is one of the great museums of the world - a must see if just for the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles.  You enter through the very impressive Great Court and the scene is set to be overwhelmed by the treasures contained in this museum.My first time there I was lucky enough to be invited on a guided tour of the Elgin Marbles by a very knowledgeable and engaging volunteer guide.  Her presentation added immeasurably to my enjoyment of the museum.  Look for one of these volunteer-led tours.Admittance is free, so you can spent a few hours in the morning going through the Egypt exhibits, including viewing the famous Rosetta Stone, leave the museum to return to the modern world to see some of London’s other sights, then come back later in the day to view other exhibits, especially  on Thursdays and Fridays when the museum is open later.See the Elgin Marbles soon, as the Greek people are seeking to have them returned when renovations of the Parthenon are completed.The museum has a cafeteria in the Great Court, but the lines are usually long, and the seating scarce.  Much better for a quick snack is the coffee shop, near the Greece wing, west of the main entrance.Don’t miss this museum!"
"Written March 15, 2008",A Magical Place For My Son and Me,My son and I both love Egyptian things and this is the best place to see because they have the largest collection of Egyptian artifacts outside of Cairo.  It was very overwhelming for me to see all of these wonderful things.  Some of the artifacts are huge and you can actually touch many of them.  I couldn't believe I was actually looking at the Rosetta Stone.  There are entire halls lined with carvings from Iraq which tell tales of great battles.  This is a great way to see artifacts from countries which are dangerous for westerners to visit.  If this museum didn't exist we might never have gotten to see these beautiful things.
"Written January 10, 2007",Egyptian artifacts,"The British Museum is an extraordinary walk through the past. The Egyptian artifacts (mummies, drawings, urns, et al) are magnificent. It does seem to be rather an unorganized presentation, but I loved it all because we were fortunate enough to have a guide who was an archeologist. She was thorough and delightful. We were mesmerized by her every word."

"Written November 3, 2023",The Most Amazing Thing About The British Museum,"Nothing in it is British. Virtually every artefact was stolen at some point in history from another country somewhere around the globe. Egypt, Greece, China, Iran, Iraq, India, Japan, Malawi, Zambia. So to all those bigots and racists that say “we should send all the foreigners back”, maybe we should send all their stuff with them, eh?"
"Written May 16, 2020",Not British....,Excellent museum......but there is nothing British about it.With Brexit time to Greek marbles to... exit.Acropolis museum is much better and more appropriate for the conversation on the Greek Parthenon marbles.
"Written August 22, 2019",A magnificent repository of the world's wonders,"The British Museum is a special place in the world, where history and culture have been collected and curated for over a century, and where an unmatched set of artifacts exist and are protected and displayed for nearly free. On this level, one can give thanks for the opportunity to come here. For almost nothing, you can see many wonders of the world. On the financial level, I donated the requested 2 pounds based on the sign on the first floor...they asked for 5 pounds on the 3rd floor! Don't forget to donate some money if you are able.Finally, if you are inclined, you might want to consider the politics and ethics of archeology. Museums (and British museums in particular) in the West have come under fire for taking things from other countries and bringing them to the West. At the obvious level, that is exactly what happened to some of these artifacts. I would suggest that one think about the preservation and display that has occurred, as well as the easy-to-criticize expropriation. I myself would be in favor of returning some of these items to the countries where they originated, if they have functioning museums and the ability to preserve the items. However, many of the nations that created these items are no longer in existence, and the great British archeologists and explorers that found them and preserved them deserve at least one cheer for saving them from the fate of too many historical artifacts. In the last decade, entire tableau of irreplaceable elements of ancient history have been destroyed in Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq...to name a few of the cases that are known. The Rosetta stone, lest we forget, was once installed into a wall of a fort, and only later became preserved and studied the world over. Shall it be repatriated to Egypt? This is a question to consider at length. If you do so after seeing the benefits of its preservation, realize the benefit you have received before rendering judgement."
"Written May 30, 2018",A Joke of a place,"The Museum as a British Institution of artefacts that have been 'rescued' or generally just plundered by the British, is a beautiful place. Yet the most important facet of the Museum is the people. Of course you may find those in Galleries a little bit strict or the Box office staff a tad enthusiastic. But i think those who made my visit at the museum the most strenous and slightly embarrassing on their part  was the main managers/ supervisors. Watching them deal with a woman having a fainting fit in the Celts exhibition reminded me of something out of an old Benny Hill movie. One man saundered out of nowhere dressed in an outfit that even a politician wouldn't wear to work- Spats that clearly look out of place unless he decided to break into dance, he looked at the lady in question, nodded quietly to himself then saundered away almost hitting himself against a door. meanwhile the first aid staff were sufficient in helping the lady up and getting her to a first aid room. The box office staff were really nice and reassured the rest of us entering the exhibition that everything would be alright. However other supervisors who were there still chatting as the woman was on her way out of the exhibition decided to have an impromptu laughing session about the heating. I'm not a judge of character but clearly having a person who just fainted in front of you, the last thing you need is a senior staff acting like the three stooges (another tv reference) This was mostly because one of them had a weird hairstyle and Mr Spats returned to see the lady led out. I mean seriously, you have people like that in charge, it is an odd sort of management."
"Written January 29, 2016",The best museum in London and it’s free!,"We popped into the British Museum again for a short visit while we were in London.  We always find something of interest whenever we go there - you never have time to see everything in one visit, it is just not possible.The museum is separated into sections for various regions of the world.  There are so many treasures on display here which were ‘collected’ by the British from all over the world.  I particularly liked the ancient Egyptian and ancient Greek displays, they are simply amazing. The British Museum is definitely worth a visit if you are in London and it’s free!"
"Written June 30, 2017",Fascinating,"While the arrangement of exhibits is a big eccentric, I find that to be a good part of the museum's charm. Seeing the Rosetta Stone a room or so away from the Elgin marbles (and both on the ground floor!) was fascinating. The new ""King's library"" exhibit, demonstrating the age of enlightenment's awakening to a true study of the past is a unique insight into how the Victorians and pre-Victorians viewed their world as well as that of others.As to crowds, we found that going late in the afternoon on Thursday or Friday (when its open until late) was the best way to avoid the multitude (who seem to leave about 4 heading to tea)."
"Written February 5, 2004",Storehouse of History,"The British Museum is one of the most fascinating experiences in London. I visited the Museum on the first Friday of April for four hours in the late afternoon and early evening. The Reading Room in the center of the Museum is incredibly beautiful and historically significant; the new enclosure surrounding it is stunning. The Museum's collections are fabulous - I only saw the Roman, Roman Britain and the Medieval areas during my brief visit. You should plan to see only a small portion of the collections during your visit - plan ahead and you'll have a great time. The shops and the cafe were also very good!"
"Written April 9, 2004",Best Museum Ever for History Lovers,"I'm a history fan and this museum is not going to be of much interest to those who are not fans of history.  So...take my review for what it's worth as a novice history fan.  Toured in September, 2008.The British Museum is a FREE museum and also open into the evening on Thursdays and Fridays.  Located within a few blocks of a couple tube stops.  Have audio tours.  Has a cafeteria on main floor and a nicer sit down restaurant on the upper floor.  Couple gift shops.Yes, it has its controversies, but from a pure “want to see as much as you can in one place” type of vacation I was on when there, it could not be beat.  Should it return some of the items it acquired at the height of the British Empire to the countries they were removed from?  I don’t know.  There are two sides to every story but after a visit to the Museum, I can certainly see why some countries want some items back.  They have been incredibly preserved and taken care of and are priceless.  Another reason it’s the best museum ever?  You can take photos.  I do love museums where you can take photos.  It's a huge museum.  The courtyard is beautiful as well.Here are some of the items I saw that were on my favorite list:Rosetta Stone:  Stunning.  One of the most important pieces of history ever.  Discovered in 1799 it is of great importance because it broke the code of Egyptian hieroglyphics which had been lost over time.  On the Rosetta Stone is the same paragraph/decree written in hieroglyphic, Egyptian script and Egyptian cursive.  This allowed for the hieroglyphics to be translated again.  Huge breakthrough.  The Stone is broken and not complete.  It's under glass and always surrounded by people so hard to get a great photo.  Make sure you turn off your flash to try to cut down on the reflection.  Stunning.Cyrus Cylinder:  The so-called Cyrus Cylinder is believed to be the first document on human rights.  Dates to 539 B.C. and was an order issued by Cyrus the Great that states his respect for the religious and political traditions of his conquered lands (in this case Babylonia).  Could be propoganda so take it for what it's worth.Parthenon Sculptures:  Date back to 5th Century B.C.  HUGE room at the Museum containing a number of pieces from the Parthenon.  This is also one of the controversial displays as Greece wants them back because they are an important part of their history.  The Brit’s side is that if they would not have taken them, they would be destroyed like the rest of the Parthenon.  Incredible pieces of history regardless.Halikarnassos Mausoleum:  One of seven wonders of the world.  So important to see since so many of the wonders have been lost.  There are several remnants of the tomb of Maussollos (where the word mausoleum comes from) who ruled Halikarnassos in 4th Century B.C. Cleopatra’s Body:  You see her mummy.  Apparently, the modern day analysis they can do shows she was very attractive.  The Museum has a very large Egypian collection.  Several other mummies also on display as well as other items.Amarna letters:  Clay tablets of correspondence between Egypt and other kings and queens.  They date back to 14th Century B.C.!Crystal Skull:  Saw the fake crystal skull (those who have seen the latest Indy movie will hear him talk about it).  At first, the skull was thought to be an ancient artifact but over time it was found to be a hoax created with modern tools.  Still cool to see.Classicianus’ tombstone:  The British minister appointed by the Roman emperor Nero.  His tombstone dates back to 1st Century A.D.Alexander the Great:  Marble portrait of Alexander the Great which dates back to around 2nd Century B.C.  Good looking guy.Sutton Hoo Ship Burial:  Anglo-Saxon burial tomb pieces which date back to 7th Century A.D. Flood Tablet:  Clay tablet telling the story of the Babylonian flood.  Dates to 7th Century B.C.  Ramesses the Great:  Bust of Ramesses II dating back to 1270 B.C.  The Ramesses line were responsible for the construction of the pyramids.  Nereid Monument:  Turkish tomb dating back to 390 B.C.  It is believed to have been broken up by an earthquake and is put back together at the Museum in a way they think makes sense.  Assyrian Gateway Figures:  Huge figures dating back to 710 B.C.  Made of marble.  Very big.  Assyria is now in what we call Iraq.  There are 5 at the British Museum and they adorned entrances and buildings.  There are also several Assyrian reliefs at the Museum dating back to 7th Century B.C.  Easter Island:  One of the Easter Island statues is at the Museum.  Looks just like you think it will!I spent several hours at the Museum and want to go back again some day.  I had a list of things I wanted to see and that was really the only way you can tour the Museum in any kind of limited capacity.  I hope to go back again and be able to really wander and see more of the treasures this Museum holds."
"Written October 7, 2008",Slightly Disappointing,"After all the wonderful things that I had heard about this museum, I was rather disappointed at its actual content. The things that they do have are rather amazing and impressive, but the manner in which they are laid out does not seem to necessarily be the best possible way to me. Many things seem to be very spread apart with not quite enough explanation unless you rent a headset to guide you or have your own guide with you. Definitely the best part of the museum for me were the Greek and Roman rooms, but other than that, it felt as if we needed a guide just to tell us where to go first or how exactly to make the best use of our time there."
"Written September 20, 2003",Wonderful Museum ,"The British museum is one of the best I have ever been in so many artifacts to see & so little time to do it. You could spend weeks  there and  not see it all, well worth the experience."

"Written February 17, 2012",Go at your own pace,"This is a great museum, much of it refurbished several years ago and its free. It is impossible to cram it in a few hours. I go there every few years and concentrate on a few things only.In my recent visit in June 2006, I went with my family. There was an Arabic exhibition and related activities for kids. My two kids got stuck on the activities and had to be later dragged to see the exhibits.My daughter will be doing Egypt and Greece soon at history lessons at school. Therefore it was important that we saw the exhibits such as the Rosetta stone and the Elgin marbles.Also this is one museum where they are happy for you to snap away.This is also a busy museum. Go at your own pace."
"Written February 4, 2006",Great and Varied Collection,"Although not a history expert I found it interesting to spend a couple hours browsing the many exhibits at the British Museum. Next time I visit I'd like to take a guided tour since I'm sure they can provide additional background. However, even without a guide I still enjoyed looking around to see what could be found. The Elgin Marbles and the Egyptian Artifacts are highlights, there were many other recognizable exhibit (like the statue from Easter Island). Also be sure to stop by the reading room in the very center of the museum The museum was busy but not overly crowded. You can cover the highlights in an hour or two, but it would easily be possible to spend much longer here. I noticed that other reviewers mentioned the layout of the museum. For 2 pounds I bought a color map that showed the different sections and listed the locations of many of the more populate pieces and had no trouble getting around."
"Written April 3, 2019",Racist & Glorifying Colonialism,"This museum was free, but I want money back for being subject to this disgusting display of thinly veiled racism. Every exhibit is essentially ""look what our friends in Canada/Australia/Africa/etc gave us as gifts""--when it should be accurate to history and admit that millions of people were slaughtered for those ""gifts"". This museum is shameful."
"Written July 23, 2018",Stunningly awesome & huge diverse collection of exhibits,"Being a fan of museums and having been to over 100 countries, This was my second visit to the British Museum, and I’ll likely return on another London visit. I’ve visited many museums. Certainly, this is one of the ten best museums in the world. It is dedicated to archaeology and ethnography. There are 94 galleries, all with excellent exhibits, spread over 807,000 square feet of museum space. The total collection is comprised of over 8,000,000 works of art, prehistoric bones, Egyptian mummies, the Rosetta Stone, and other pieces of our world’s history and people. The largest collections are those dedicated to ancient Egypt, ancient Greece and Rome, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. This is an easy place to spend an enjoyable half or full day, after which at best, you’ll only have seen 20% to 40% of the exhibits. Admission to the Museum is free (donations accepted), but occasionally they charge for entry to some temporary exhibitions and events. Before or after entering, look at the free map of the layout, and plan your tour. Also, I recommend getting the audio guide, to get a better understanding of the things you are viewing and their significance. Museum staff are friendly and helpful."
"Written July 26, 2015",Seriously needs to review its policy on drinking water!,"I visited the British Museum with entire Primary School year group on one of the hot summer days. The pupils had brought water bottles, but naturally the galleries were very hot and very crowded. I went to the toilets to refill the pupil's water bottles for them and found the drinking water sign on the wall but the drinking fountain panelled off. I asked a security guard where the drinking fountains were and he said there were two outside. I walked all the way outside to find the drinking fountains broke. I went to the information desk and asked where the drinking water was and I was informed the fountains were broken and they only provided bottled water for sale in the shop! The children had to go without, I was not about to buy 120 bottles of water! We left instead!I think this is a disgrace. There are those on social media up in arms against the CEO of Nestle saying he does not believe clean drinking water is a human right, and now I find the British Museum in the same camp. Pure commercial opportunism - outrageous."
"Written February 10, 2013",Frustrating left-luggage rules,"This is not a criticism of the British Museum itself nor of its exhibits which are, of course, world-class.Be warned though that if, like us, you have checked out of your hotel and are on your way to a station or the airport with a suitcase, you may be refused entry to the building or will have to take stuff out of your case to bring its weight down to 8 kg. The excess items will then be put into a plastic basket and you will be charged another £1.50.The British Library has a left-luggage facility where you can leave a suitcase, so why can't the British Museum have one?"
"Written September 16, 2008",Audio tour for faster people,"There are at least two different types of museum people:- The sort that read every card and truly delve into the mysteries of the past.  They ask deep questions and want to know history- The sort that prefer to proceed quickly through and ""see"" everything, reading the cards for things that interest them, skipping entire rooms if the contents do not appeal.If you are the later, as I am, do not schedule the in-person highlights tour.  Do the audio highlights tour instead IMO. I did both tours in a recent visit to London.  I found myself listening to an incredibly knowledgable guide (14 years at the museum) talk slowly through each nuance of a single piece of history. That is great, but I also about died when we walked by the Rosetta stone and saw 4 people in front of it. Yes, only 4.  We were going in a specific order, so the fact that there would be 50 people later did not (nor should it have) phase our guide one bit.So, we switched to the audio tour. It said the same thing (basically)!  Wow, we were happy. We heard almost the same depth of knowledge, but could approach a piece of history, enter a number, hear the dialogue, then proceed quickly to the next artifact, even room. We saw the entire museum in about 3 hours. We went to every room that was open, and listened to every ""highlight"".  The museum is amazing and incredible.  I especially like the occasional photos beside items of when they were preparing the item for shipment to Britain.  It made it come alive that these items truly came from somewhere, and it took a lot to get them to England.One hint, sometimes the audio tour line in the main lobby is huge.  Go back by the Parthenon area and get the same headsets there with no line.  You do need to leave photo ID to get a headset."
"Written May 20, 2006",Heaven for history buffs!,"The British Museum was one of my Must-Do's for London and I was not disappointed at all.  For years, I'd wanted to see the things like the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon and the Rosetta Stone and other Egyptian artifacts in person and they were amazing!  A definite don't miss in my book.  Also, I donated a few pounds (even though it's free to enter) just to do my part in maintaining such an awesome collection.  It's worth it!"
"Written January 11, 2019",Go EARLY and PLAN AHEAD to skip the insane queues!!!,"If you haven’t been to London since Instagram took over the travel industry, you need to know that London tourism has become INSANE in recent years, with Disney-level hours-long “queues” at every tourist destination. If you are coming during any sort of holiday period (we were here between Christmas and New Years, but apparently this is also true for... pretty much the entire spring, summer and fall!), you MUST PLAN very carefully to avoid spending your vacation waiting on line. We did this and we felt like we had the “Disney Fast Pass” to London! The British Museum is a great example. It’s free, so you’d think there’d be no ticket line. In the past, you could just “pop in and have a look” as the British say. Ah, but you forgot about security checks and crowd control. Today the queue, after forming accordion-style within the gates, continues in concentric circles around the block. I knew about this in advance and therefore was able to avoid it. How? Well, our only chance to see the museum was on the Sunday between Christmas and New Years—pretty much the worst possible time for crowds. So I planned. First, I downloaded all the maps and children’s activity trails (we have four kids ages 6-13) and printed them at home. (The things marked as the museum’s “highlights” form their own lines inside, so you have to plan ahead to avoid those too. Plus, there are even more lines to buy the maps and activity trails that are free online.) I also knew the museum opened at 10am, but I figured the queue might form earlier, so we got there bonkers-early—at 9:15am. At 9:15am on this busiest day of the year, not many people were there yet and there was no queue at all. We walked in, and of course the main galleries were not open yet. However, the gift shop and café in the Great Court were open, as were the already-forming queues for audioguides. So we took care of those things first, and by 9:40 I parked myself by the door that leads to the Rosetta Stone (something you can forget about seeing if you don't get there at that hour... and which is a must-see for historic reasons, but which isn't big or beautiful enough on its own to merit any kind of wait), and summoned the rest of the family to join me some ten minutes later. By the time they opened that door at exactly 10am, an IMMENSE queue had formed behind us. They opened the door and this mass of people surged toward the Rosetta Stone like it was the last flight out of Saigon in 1973. We checked out the stone (and then had trouble squeezing away from it with all the people pushing behind us!) and moved on to the Elgin Marbles (which are about two rooms in, and another thing that generates massive lines), which were totally deserted at that hour. We enjoyed those and then went up to the Egyptian galleries (another major highlight), which were also still pretty empty. By the time the mixed multitude reached Egypt within the next hour or so, we had already completed our exodus from Egypt and had moved on to various promised lands which other visitors hadn’t discovered yet. In this way we continuously beat the legendary crowds. By the time we left the museum around 1pm (yes you need that much time inside!) the queue to get into the building was well around the block. If you come to London during a busy time, do not even consider coming to this museum at any time other than 9:15am. The other tourist places that require first-thing-in-the-morning priority are Tower of London (buy tickets in advance and print at home, get there at least a half hour before opening, and go DIRECTLY to the Crown Jewels... otherwise, that Crown Jewels queue is something for the ages) and Windsor Castle (for this one you MUST get advance print-at-home tickets.... and then tell the security guards that you have them and you may be able to jump to the front of the queue, which without exaggeration is a full mile long around the outside of the castle). You also need advance print-at-home tickets for Westminster Abbey (but those, thankfully, are timed entry, so save your early-morning visits for stuff that doesn’t have that advantage). And of course Harry Potter Studio tickets must be bought months in advance. (Hot tip: I missed my chance to buy those tickets and was still able to get them from something called Golden Tours. A rip-off, but it got the job done and it at least included a bus so we didn’t need a car.) You will have a marvelous time in London, but unlike in years past, you won’t have a marvelous time if you don’t plan ahead. Plan ahead and have a great time!"

"Written April 7, 2014",Viking Exhibition - don't bother,"Today we visited the British Museum to see the Viking exhibition. Despite the timed tickets and the rigorous enforcement of the timings, with a double check before entry into the exhibition itself, it was almost impossible to see many of the artefacts due to the amount of visitors. Small children were being pushed aside so that the older visitors could see the exhibits whilst listening to their audio guides. There is much to be praised about the moving walkway at the Crown Jewels exhibition in the Tower of London, at least this gives every visitor (old and young, tall and small) the opportunity to view the exhibits.We left the exhibition disillusioned and disappointed. The young people in our party felt that they were not welcome and have indicated that they would rather not visit the BM again. By a stroke the BM have not only left me feeling cheated as the timed tickets cost each adult in our party £16.50 plus £1 booking fee - to have the opportunity to enter the exhibition, but not to be able to see the exhibits: they have also made 2 young people feel that they would never want to return to a BM exhibition again.The staff at the information desks were really helpful and enthusiastic with our young people, they went out of their way to give us the information to make our visit a success. The sheer volume of visitors in the Viking exhibition, sadly, made this exhibition a huge disappointment.If you would like your children to develop a fascination and curiosity in history - most definitely do not waste your money on this."

"Written April 28, 2008",Try the Highlights Tour,"I have been to the British Museum many times, but this time (April,2008), I took the highlights tour at 10:30 on a Sunday morning. It was a real eye-opener, and an excellent way of spending an hour and a half exploring the museum with a knowledgeable guide. I booked online for STG. 8 (which I thought was very reasonable), and picked the tickets up at the tickets desk on the day.The group was small (about 9 people), and the tour covered many civilizations, from the Egyptian, to the Roman, the Assyrians, the Greeks, etc. Many interesrting facts were pointed out that would have probably slipped unnoticed by the casual visitor.I highly recommend this tour for someone who would like to visit the BM and has only a short time to do so."

However, they do ask for a £5 donation, which we were more than happy to pay.  The museum is huge and home to a wonderful collection of artefacts – a real treasure trove.  You really are spoilt for choice because there is so much to see.  We learned about the Egyptians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings and a multitude of others – all very interesting and educational.  I particularly liked the ancient Egyptian display.  There are many permanent galleries and exhibitions in this museum, as well as some special exhibitions which you do have to pay for.  Definitely worth a visit – there is something for everyone here."

"Written September 27, 2006",Don't rely on the evening hours.,"The Rosetta Stone is worth the trip all by itself, but I have to give the British Museum a Terrible rating for what I view to be false advertising.Hey I'm a tourist.  I relied upon the hours posted on the museum's website when I planned my trip.  The posted hours for Thursday and Friday are 10am - 8:30 pm.  I think many people planning trips to London will do what I did and wrongly believe they can work in their visit to the British Museum during the evening hours since so many other places of interest are closed at night.  Bad idea.  The Museum doesn't tell you that at least half of the museum is closed to visitors during their evening hours.In my mind, the failure to have this disclosed on websites and travel media negatively impacts British tourism."

Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, this Museum has it all. It contains millions of artifacts.

It's basically when a museum volunteer would actually let you hold various items from the collection. When I was walking through the Greek and Roman halls there was this lady sitting behind a small table in the corner. She had a bunch of different coins and some pottery in a box in front of her. At first I thought she was rearranging part of the display. As it turned out, you could actually come up to the table and pick up these things (REAL ancient coins and pottery), and the lady would tell you about them. Here's a picture of the Athenian silver tetradrachma and the Greek 1 euro that has the same owl design. The tetradrachma is 2400 years old."
"Written January 31, 2006",Day filled with history,"The British Museum is definitely a worthwhile addition to any traveler who intends to spend several days in London. The museum is free although donations are accepted at any of the donations boxes located near the entryways to the museum. The exhibits are filled with a wealth of historical information and artifacts, making it virtually impossible to see all of the exhibits in one day. With every turn, one is surprised to see yet more artifacts, statues, and even whole facades of buildings. I spent almost six hours exploring the museum, wandering through all the wonderful exhibits of Roman, Egyptian, Irish, Medieval, African, American, and also some modern projects. I highly recommend a good pair of walking shoes as this museum covers a lot of space.  A guided tour could be well worth it if one would prefer to listen to someone pointing out the highlights about the historical exhibits, items, and stories rather than reading about them by themselves.  Evening times toward the end of the week draw quite smaller crowds than visiting the museum on the weekend or in the middle of the day."
"Written December 31, 2003",Madhouse Museum,"Visited The British Museum two days ago & was underwhelmed. The content is quite interesting, one of my favourites was the Family Tomb - wow! However I agree that the layout of the Museum isn't well thought out, especially considering the HORDES of ppl visiting. I'm from NYC & while in this museum I felt as if I was in Grand Central Station during rush hour, it was that mad. That isn't the environment I prefer to view art installations in."
"Written May 28, 2015",Rear Entrance on Montague Place Much Quicker,"Few people would disagree with me that the British Museum is a must visit for visitors to London -  because its collection is so rich, its exhibits organised and explained so well, access is so easy and, it is FREE, except areas/rooms marked for special exhibition.Access is easier and quicker through its rear entrance on Montague Place as compared to the main entrance on Great Russell Street.  From the Russell Square underground station, it would take less than 7 minutes to get there after passing through Russell Square.  See photo uploaded."
"Written March 17, 2014",Badly curated and badly organised,"I have been going to exhibitions at the BM for 40 years and this one was an absolute disgrace.  Despite booking two months ago the earliest time I could get on a Sunday was 12.10.  The 12 noon group was large and the 12.20 group were waiting as we did.  The girl on the search bags desk suggested we skip the first room as there would be a scrum in seeing anything - 4 of us paid £70 at OAP rate to skip some?Anyway, the first room was so dire that one of our party did go ahead to see if this was good advice he reported back - that room was just as backed up.I agree with other comments that the contents of the exhibition are excellent but the layout is impossible and frankly, if I were part of the Sainsbury family, I would not want my name associated with it. I heard one young child make the comment ""This is the most boring thing I have ever been to"" and I had to have some sympathy as I was bored waiting to see each new exhibit - not a feeling I have EVER experienced before.The main room with the boat was the first time it was possible to enjoy oneself but even that was too busy.  One of our group found the heat and waiting and scrum just too much and gave up and left - he is not old and ill - this was just unacceptable.We were not the only ones unhappy - we heard nothing but complaints.I have never had to write a bad review of the BM in all these years but I really do feel that someone needs to be hauled over the coals for this disgrace.  I had already made up my mind to write a scathing review so it was so encouraging to read the previous reviews that so many people feel the same way.  I sincerely hope lessons will be acted upon.  For the 4 of us 2 travelled from Northumberland and 2 from Suffolk for a weekend in which this was meant to be the highlight and which proved to be the utter disappointment. The BM should be ashamed."
"Written December 19, 2006","Private, Audio, vs Guided Tours","I've been to the British Museum a couple of times on various trips to England.  I recommend taking the extra time to plan your trip ahead by reading the museum's website.  Some galleries do close early even on the late open nights, so if there's something you must see, plan accordingly.    A previous visitor stated that he went by the times on the website and was led astray, but he simply didn't read carefully enough.  I've coordinated multiple trips to the British Museum, and know that the website clearly lists every gallery that is open/closed on the late entry nights (See http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/visit/lateopening.html).  Gallery closing information is also found on the printed visitor brochures from the British Museum.I've been on both the free EyeOpeners tours, and the paid Highlights tour.  While the EyeOpeners tours are hit or miss (I blame the volunteer guides), the Highlights tours are exceptional.  You'll find each Highlights tour is slightly different as per the interests of the guide you get, but even when the subject matter isn't something I'm particularly interested in, the guides are always exceptional.   The Highlights pace is slow enough to accommodate guests with disabilities.  The size of the tours are limited, so if you are planning your itinerary down to the last detail from abroad, definitely book your tour ahead of time.  You can book these online at the museum's website.I've also been on a private guided tour of the museum by a local historian, which was also excellent.   Our guide  took the time to find out what we were interested in and led us to some of the less-visited gems of the Museum.  Be prepared to hike on  this type of tour as it might take some long walks and hiking up and down stairs to get to the galleries. Of the tour options, the audio tours are my least favorite, mainly because you can't ask questions, and the audio tours make it nearly impossible to converse with your traveling companions.  I wouldn't personally ever use  the audio tours unless you are visiting the museum alone or are a non-English speaker."

"Written August 13, 2021",NERO EXHIBITION,This is one of the best exhibitions we've been to at the BM with a range of well-explained and presented artifacts providing an alternative look at one of Rome's most well-known emperors. Informative and laid out so that it was accessible to those in wheelchairs. An excellent couple of hour's worth!
"Written June 5, 2022",A fabulous museum in the heart of London,"One of the best museums I’ve ever seen.  Very impressive collection of Greek, Roman and Egyptian artifacts. It also is home to the Rosetta Stone-which I found to be absolutely incredible. So much to see and the museum is free to enter. "
"Written May 16, 2022","Great exhibits, tea service is ok","We went there for afternoon tea and then saw a few of the exhibits. It is free. Tea was tasty, service was ok. Our waitress spilled Prosecco all over me and my husband. Accidents happen, but it was uncomfortable. The location for tea was noisy. Would not go for tea there again even though the food was nice, would have preferred a more Intimate setting."
"Written June 16, 2022",Great exhibition,We went specifically to see the Stonehenge exhibition which was very good with some fantastic artefacts. Far more emphasis on the people and contemporaneous sites - rather than the building of Stonehenge itself. Good to go at opening time on a weekday - when likely to be less busy.
"Written January 1, 2023",One Could Spend a Few Days Here,"We visited twice during our Xmas holiday week in London.  It can be tiring to try to hit everything in one shot.

"Written September 4, 2019",Review on African Art,"Fun fact - if it's a rainy day in London, everyone goes to the museum, sooooo this means long lines!! With that being said, the museum is massive and would probably take a good 6 hours to explore. With my African studies background and previous visits to various African countries, I had an interest in visiting this section of the museum. It was on the smaller side, but I still thoroughly enjoyed looking through various artifacts (most from former colonized areas in West Africa). I found it fascinating to visually examine the items and read the historical accounts of each artifact. Loved it!"
"Written September 3, 2019",The most visited museum in London !!!,"If you’ve got a few hours to spare in central London. Then you must visit the British museum, it’s free entry & a great place to spend a few hours. The nearest tube station is Russel square, like I said not only is it free entry, it’s got some fascinating artefacts on display. It never fails to amaze me every time we visit."
"Written August 20, 2019",Nice visit,"The British Museum was really nice, many different sculptures from different countries around the world. I loved it and it was very interesting. I surely recommend this place if you like art and if you have kids of age 8-15, even if you don’t like art you can still have fun there. But the only problem there is that they don’t have any air conditioning. But the building looks gorgeous !!!"
"Written August 19, 2019",A MUST. No similar museum I have ever been,"No matter how interested you are in art or history, you will find more tan one ""WOW"" during your visit. Perfectly arranged for quick or alternatively detailed visit, even your kids´attention and fascination will be catched. In may case, special emotion came from Roman and Egyptian áreas."
"Written August 18, 2019",NOT TO BE MISSED ,Spectacular museum which guard historical treasures from all over the world. The heritage of the great conquers of the massive British empire. Absolutely a must see in London that deserves several visits to truly explore it.
"Written July 26, 2019",Fantastic experience ,"We arrived early in the morning. The lines were low. After getting through the doors, the learning began. We didn’t have time to explore all the rooms. We chose to do a self guided tour instead of a guided one. The gift shop was massive with many options. So enjoyed our time. Next time back, we’ll have to explore the areas we failed to see. "
"Written July 25, 2019",Everything You've Ever Heard Of!,"The British Museum has all the things you've heard of: the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, Cleopatra's Mummy (no kidding!) A full day will only barely get you through the Ancient Civilizations, Ancient Greece, and Rome. You will NOT be disappointed! Only complaint: the weather was perfect outside 70 degrees F, but the Museum ranged from warm to hot."
"Written July 23, 2019",Something for Everyone,"First of all, the British Museum is free, so you already go in with a smile. Secondly, the lines are not very long (at least not when we went in). Having waited two hours in the rain to get into the L’Oeuvre, I appreciated the accessibility. The museum is large, and there is much to see, so it’s nice not to feel that you don’t have to get it all in during one visit. It’s so easy to get in, you can just come back. The art here is mostly 3-D, with an emphasis on classical antiquities. If it’s paintings you want, you’re in the wrong place. They did have an interesting collection of Rembrandt sketches (free) and a special exhibit of Edward Munch ($) but otherwise it’s all sculptures and artifacts. The map includes a “must see” list, which made it easier to navigate. The biggest treasure here would have to be the Rosetta Stone. Try to see it early in the day, because it does get busy. Some of the other recommendations were a bit disappointing, but we found other unexpected treasures along the way. I especially enjoyed the clock room, which had beautiful, intricately designed automatons. Having seen Hugo, I have developed a soft spot for these machines. There’s something about the marriage of art and science that seems so complete. If you have a day in London, I recommend you go to the British Museum. You’ll find some unexpected treasures in a relaxed atmosphere. "

I thought my favorites were the Greek artifacts until I saw the Egyptian artifacts and the cat mummies. But then again the Roman jewelry and the watch/clock exhibits are so cool. Wait! The dinosaurs! You have to see the dinosaurs! Plan to spend the day here and when you need a respite, there is a cafe for refreshments. "
"Written June 1, 2019",Crowded. ,"Great museum, quite a large collection of well-known pieces, however - very crowded, which is understandable - the place has lots of stuff to see and no entry fees. Instead of begging for donations it'd be much better off having a day or two when there are entry fees. I'd much rather pay and have fewer people that just came by because it's free. Other than that - all good. "

"Written January 29, 2019",It was only a matter of stealing!,"The hole museum was filled with exhibits for other cultures that has been removed for their origin countries. Seeing those exhibits remote from their home countries was very miserable and the guests receives a feeling of nervousness. Additionally, when we try to enter the part of the museum that the stolen Cariatid from Athens was placed, it was close to the public as the security guard should be there at 3:00 but he arrive after 3:15. It was the most disappointing museum that I have never visit."
"Written September 13, 2018",Ian Hislop I Object: Dissent exhibition - I object too!,"I object to having to pay for this exhibition which was sponsored by a bank and with a celebrity ‘curator’ when the disparate pieces were all found in the basement of the archives. So nothing was spent on acquiring more interesting stuff and very little on the cramped minimalist display. It was a very poor experience with some of the items hsvjbg only the most tenuous link to the very broad subject of dissent. Having gone to excellent exhibitions at the National Scottish Museum, our expectations were high but we left very disappointed and wished we had spent more time in the museum itself. Don’t bothering going."
"Written February 28, 2017",How is this free??,"The British Museum is an amazing place.  While part of any visit should include a discussion on imperialism and the impacts of cultural appropriation, the amount of history in this place is astronomical.  From the Rosetta Stone (yes, the real one) to Viking treasure, you could spend weeks in the British Museum and only scratch the surface.The building itself is gorgeous, and any one of the rooms would be worth the price of admission (did I mention it's free?)  This was hands down my favorite place to visit in London, and since it's free (right??  free??) you can visit for only a couple of hours and still see some truly amazing history."
"Written November 20, 2016",British Museum,"We knew that the British Museum is home to exhibits from all over the world, but we did not expect there to be so comparatively little from Britain. The main areas on the ground floor are devoted to Egyptian artefacts, the Parthanon display and a few other pieces (Greek and Roman) which are spectacular (Especially the temple). However there were so many pieces in the Egyptian section that were spectacular and impressive that many actually seemed lost amongst each other. In contrast the Parthanon display was a breath of fresh air, there was space to enjoy the exhibits, controversy about them aside. Sadly a couple of the rooms and routes in this maze of an area were closed.The african art display was fascinating, room 1 reassuringly traditional, reminiscent of a stately home perhaps, we enjoyed the Mexican room for it's simplicity of arrangement giving clarity to the exhibits. The death display was similarly clear.Upstairs we completely missed the Japanese gallery, were awed at the spectacular decoration of the coffins and mummies as well as the other artefacts in this egyptian gallery. Found connections with home in the coins exhibition, and sought another in the roman one (found it as well). These rooms are very traditionally laid out with Glass cases and labels, they could do with a few more seats for those of us who have a limited mobility and find carrying the folding stools awkward. We found the Sutton Hoo display with the vikings, leading to a display of pottery from the last couple of hundred years, which was odd. The sutton Hoo display was fascinating and well presented, the vikings was sparse, but being resident in York I guess I am spoiled in that regard. We spent three hours perusing the 90+ rooms, the staff we approached were all helpful, especially the security guard at the gate. The left luggage office has a weight limit of 8kg per bag, but is a useful facility. There are several shops, the ones in the great court offer most interest, we didn't use the cafes.We enjoyed our visit, though we feel that many of the displays concentrate too much on the spectacular and are confused. There also seem to be thousands of orange and black greek urns around the place. We left having enjoyed ourselves and certainly having feasted our eyes, but somehow disappointed. We had learn't little of the cultures represented, but had seen many of their treasures. What about the people though. In addition there was so little about Britain itself, which seemed odd. indeed the British Museum has only half a dozen rooms of British artefacts it seems,is this really all the British museum can muster to show visitors to our country our history? It seems to me a missed opportunity."
"Written January 6, 2016",The history of the world under one roof - for free!,"The British Museum is one of my favourite places to visit in London. It can often be very crowded, so take your time if you can, and if you only have a short amount of time to spend inside I would recommend you go early so you can get round before the crowds descend! The main galleries are completely free to enter, and the museum has some of the most beautiful objects from all over the world and across the centuries. Egyptian mummies, Roman treasures, Saxon finds, Chinese curiosities and the unforgettable Parthenon marbles are all on display. I would suggest you try to plan your visit ahead of time using the museum's website if you can, or buy or download one of the highlights booklets so you're not wandering aimlessly. There is a LOT to see inside and you can't see everything if you are short on time, so pick a few essential things that are your 'must-sees' and then enjoy the rest of your time exploring the rest of the rooms."
"Written August 13, 2015",Horrificly disappointing disabled access!,"I would have loved the exhibits if I could see them!  In the ENTIRE Museum there are only 3 small lifts (elevators) and they are clogged with primarily Asian and middle eastern tourists who could walk fine and are just lazy; forcing the disabled to wait and wait through numerous trips because there were already full when reaching my level.  I never saw one person other than me in a the elevator with a wheelchair, walker or even using a cane.  They have no qualms about it either and I finally told some of them off for what I thought about it.It took 30 minutes on average (once 45 minutes) to get an elevator to move even a half floor down because of stairs!  1 lift (yes 1 lift not a bank of lifts) is in the back half and 2 are near the front entrance and that is it for a 7 level massive museum.Further all of the lifts required me to get out of my wheelchair to go through the entry.  There are also numerous changes in level that require a lot of navigation to find a way there where there are no stairs.Also all the print for all the objects is tiny that even with 20/20 vision you can't read it.They were all out of maps for sale and the signage is poor.Also many isles are too narrow, even in the rotunda area they built in 2000 where they could have put a huge bank of elevators they only put 1 more tiny lift.Sadly this was to be the high point of my trip to London, now I am so upset at trying to get around I may not go back for the 2nd day I planned there.This was a Friday early afternoon but not too busy in general, I can't imagine what it would be like if it were any busier I couldn't even get through a hallway.  Sadly the exhibits look awesome but I guess I won't get to enjoy them like I was hoping.As a Lodnon landmark it is a testament to the superiority of the Americans with Disabilities act of the United States."
"Written April 9, 2014",Viking exhibition - a lot of fuss about nothing spectacular,"From the moment the pedantic member of staff turned us away from the queue for being a minute early, to the throngs of folk peering at the unremarkable objects in poorly set out displays this was a real let down. Save your money and look around the other far more noteworthy exhibitions in this fantastic museum."
"Written July 20, 2019",You could spend hours to days here,"Really enjoyed the British Museum.   Great to see the Rosetta Stone.  Word of caution. The second floor restaurant is reservations only, but the Cafés on the main floor where you pick up your food then walk to a table served good sandwiches. Also back elevator to floors 3,4,5 had long lines. If you can do the stairs that’s the way to go. If you are in a wheelchair there is only this one elevator to those exhibits so be prepared to wait.

"Written June 27, 2019",At British Museum looking at the Rosetta Stone,We were at the British Museum looking at the Rosetta Stone. People were calmly working their way up to the display taking turns and everyone was getting a chance to get their photos and view the artifact. Then a C Tour group rushed in and started shoving everyone and trying to push everyone out of the way. A man put his hands on me and tried to push me out of his way.  I am a foot taller than him so that did not work for him.  The museum needs guards to protect the other visitors..
"Written June 5, 2019",Unfriendly and unhelpful staff,We were looking for a quiet room and were given misinformation a number of times.  We were eventually advised to go downstairs where a very unfriendly staff member told us to move on. She then started to speak to someone on the phone clearly speaking about us. The whole episode left me upset and has put me off going to the British museum ever again.

"Written October 31, 2018",Halloween 31.08.2018,"The Halloween evening event was rather disorganised from the beginning. All members had to queue outside for 30 minutes or more before being allowed to enter (when they could have used the time to hand out the programme for the evening which took time to understand - what was on, at what time and which room). We entered the building provided with a plastic chip (purpose unexplained) and not knowing where to go except guided either towards a bar or a ticket desk. We found out the chip was to be used for 1 drink at the bar. Then on to the ticket desk. The reason for the ticket desk was also unclear - not explained in the programme until you arrived at the queue itself. Standing in one of the two ticket queues we suddenly had to select 1 of the 3 tours on option (not knowing what the 3 options actually were(unclear from the programme) and explained to us very quickly in a hasty manner. The personnel also seemed somewhat stressed and appeared to not handle the crowd too well. By this time you walked around seeing more queues to activities that were not yet open and not knowing what to do except to head towards the car to eat something which of course took time and then finding out we only had about 2 hours to go around the activities with having attended 1 tour which lasted 40 minutes leaving little time for walking around to find a space to join in on activities. Due to this, we actually didn’t manage to join in on any activities just became a mere standby observer. For the money and the expectations we had of it being an event organised by the British Museum, I would have expected a better organised event. "

"Written September 22, 2018",Fabulous Museum ,"I would like to spend much more time at the British Museum. The collection seems to be so extensive that I think maybe visiting it one full day would be preferable, if not two days. Seeing the Rosetta Stone was a treat and getting to view so many treasures was additionally terrific."
"Written July 28, 2018","Poor traffic management, inadequate facilities, toilets, and equipment, and overcrowded","My wife and I are avidly interested in ancient history and antiquities. We had heard about the marvelous exhibits in the British Museum. The visit to this institution was to be the highlight to our trip to Brittan, Indeed, it was the primary motivation for our trip. However, our visit to your institution was a great disappointment. We arrived at 10:30 one weekday morning last April (2018) and waited in the rain for 45 minutes in a queue that went around the northeast side of the building. When arriving at the gate, we discovered there was another queue going around the southwest side of the building. There were some brief arguments at the gate as individuals in each queue claimed that theirs was the “proper” queue. Each wanted the others to go to end of their queue. Upon entering the building, we followed the signage to the restroom on the southwest side of the building only to discover it was inexplicably closed. The restrooms on either side of the Great Court had forty or more women and children waiting in queue going down each staircase—a disgrace. In one of the men’s restrooms, three of the six stalls were out of order, in another, two were not functional.My wife waited in queue for quite some time to obtain audio guides, only to be told, as she neared the desk, that they were all out and none would be available until the afternoon.The overcrowding and jostling by other visitors was prohibitive; we were not able to get even close to many of the principal exhibits. For example, we were only able to see the top few inches of the Rosetta Stone over the heads of the other visitors. In addition, the overcrowding that I observed raises safety concerns. In the event of an emergency, I seriously doubt that the building could be evacuated in a safe and timely manner.I have generally been very impressed by the museums in Brittan and Ireland: the National Gallery, the Roman Baths, the Petrie Museum at UCL, the Roman Army Museum and Vindolanda in the north, as well as the National Museum of Ireland, the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, etc. Typically, when my wife and I visit a major museum, we arrive at opening and stay until closing. Indeed, we had planned to spend several days at this institution. After an hour-and-a-half of this frustration, we left the British Museum, not to return. This museum is characterized by poor traffic management, inadequate facilities and equipment, and overcrowding. As these largely prohibit viewing the antiquities, we really don’t see the point behind opening this museum given these circumstances."
"Written July 27, 2018",Does anybody even work here?,"We decided to spend the day wandering around the British Museum on our last day in London. Unfortunately, both the lack of staff members around the museum, as well as their sheer ignorance (i.e. standing around talking to each other about the weather) meant that several tourists we saw were either touching the artefacts or just plain leaning/sitting on them. At one point, I was so sick of seeing this (and with staff members turning a blind eye) that I took matters into my own hands and told a couple who were posing on a 3000 year old stela to stop touching it. To which I was told “Oh I just touch a little, you have problem with that?”Yeah I have a big problem with that. To the British Museum management - either put all of your priceless artefacts behind ropes/glass or employ more people who actually care about what they’re supposed to be guarding.To my fellow tourists - if you’re going to disrespect priceless historical artefacts, just don’t come here. You clearly have no appreciation for what a museum is."
"Written January 4, 2018",First person to see the Rosetta Stone,"Photos are allowed in the museum, and admission is free!  I was in the British Museum at 9:45AM, walked around for a few minutes, then stood by the entrance to see the Rosetta Stone.  As soon as the doors opened, which were preciously at 10AM, I was the first to see it and get a picture without any other tourist around, very special.  I suggest if you want the same experience that I had, do the same thing."
"Written March 18, 2014",Viking Exhibit is a waste of time and money,"I think the British Museum in its entirety is a wonderful experience, and highly recommend it. HOWEVER, the current Viking Exhibition is a fiasco.It's poorly designed and poorly regulated; the timed tickets appear to do nothing as the front rooms of the exhibit were packed. We had to skip the first section because we didn't want to queue for an hour to read a few captions. The exhibit could have been spread out a little more, and the number of people in it should be better regulated. Very surprised by how bad this exhibit was because the Pompeii exhibit was excellent. But definitely give the Viking Exhibit a miss; it's not worth the time or money."
"Written March 14, 2014",Viking Exhibition sunk by overcrowding,"I visited the Viking exhibition at 1pm today Friday,14th March, 2014.  I went first to the museum's central ticket booth at 12.10pm and was advised that I would not be able to enter this exhibition until 1pm earliest.This delay was easily managed because there are plenty of other things -wonderful and free - to see in the meantime.I paid £16.50 for a standard, adult entry ticket and was admitted punctually at 1pm. I was actually astonished to find that the outside entry queue continued within the exhibition, only now much worse; not moving; immediately restricting me in within a confined space, looping back on itself in order to view the first, early exhibits and stretching out of sight, around a further right hand  corner.At no point in the exhbition -which is a good size -did the crowding ease at all, except in the vicinity of the exit area.There were, of course, some great items and groupings of items in this exhibiton - but I noticed that two thirds of my focus was taken up negotiating the crowds; trying to see the exhibits; manoeuvring to try and get close enough to read the signage - often failing to do this - and, as is the custom, taking some care not to block everyone else's attempts to do the same thing.I may have this wrong, but I could find not find feedbacks forms or other outlet to let the museum know they had  a problem with this paying customer's experience of their service. I inclined to the intepretation - perhaps wrongly - the museum's management is just complacement about it's paying exhibitions - it's highly prestigious; full of happy and excited people (in the free areas) and very successful, so - why should they care?"
"Written March 10, 2014",Went  to see Vikings exhibition but didn't,I had a booked timed entry to the Vikings. However when I got in it was so ludicrously crowded couldn't see a thing.I complained and got my money back but would not recommend anyone to go to this unless you receive assurances that there is better monitoring of crowds. I would have thought that the British Museum would be experienced in dealing with bookings as people pay a lot of money for  these special shows. Extremely disappointing.Also took a day off work to go to this.
"Written March 10, 2014",Vikings: Life and Legend,"I booked a timed slot. Walked in and walked out. I asked for and received a refund. Exhibition is laid our so the viewers form a queue to look at each object. The queue resembles a winding snake. Could not view anything in comfort. Too crowded. Too claustrophobic. Too hot. If the British Museum is going to charge £17.50 (£1 booking fee online?) then it needs to provide an enjoyable experience. To me, they're more interested in making money than providing an enlightening experience. They've done the Vikings a disservice with this exhibition. I was so much looking forward to the visit and was extremely disappointed."
"Written December 20, 2011","Overrated, and Immoral","I typed a review much like this a week ago, and it was removed. I don't appreciate the 1984 approach, as what follows is very much my experience, and I feel I should be able to voice it. I cannot be the only educated, and liberally minded, person who feels the same.* * *Norman Foster’s ceiling is much lauded, and it is very good at being sympathetic despite being hyper-modern. However, the museum displays depressingly little and seems to circulate their exhibits far too seldom. My favourite hall is the Sainsbury's African Hall, featuring an amazing sculpture of a tree made entirely out of used ammunition, guns etc (I believe the artists are Mozambican).It's appalling, however, how so many of the world's great treasures are kept in so uninspiring and boring a space - rather than in their places of origin. In the African exhibit there was a magnificent, ancient, Nigerian Mask. The thought that it is in a petrifying building in so lifeless a city depresses me greatly.   I realise it's a tricky debate, but I think the British should be absolutely ashamed that more has not been done to rectify their past atrocities around the world, and much of the museum acts as a document to their rape and pillage just because they happened to have might once upon a time. There is insufficient seating, and the museum is overcrowded. Often the information displays are positioned low, making it impractical to read them amidst the throngs of people."
"Written November 21, 2008",Rosetta Stone Alone Made London Trip Worthwhile!,"About 15 years ago, I went on a tour of London that didn't include the British Museum so, having had a lifelong fascination with the Rosetta Stone and knowing it was there, I took a break from the organized tour and walked to the museum on my own.  I floated back on Cloud 9, however.The day I went, and I have no idea what day of the week that was or what time of day, the museum wasn't all that crowded and I easily found what I was looking for on a pedestal, ""guarded"" by a woman who sat nearby in a uniform, knitting.  The pedestal had a velvet rope thing around the area so you couldn't get closer than about three feet.While I stared at the artifact that made reading the hieroglyphics possible, thinking about Napoleon and everyone else involved, a little girl darted out of nowhere, ran under the rope, and set her fingertips on the granite slab.  Electricity shot through me.  It was as though I touched the cold granite myself.  I was so moved by the experience that I had to go hide in another aisle and wipe away the tears.If you love history, the British Museum is the place for you!"
"Written March 17, 2008",Selecting a cafe when visiting British Museum,"As a avid museum goer I would rate British Museum as big or huge (albeit with nice architecture)You can spend a lot of time at the BM and YOU will become hungry or pekish and you have many choices I will give you two tips for how you should spend your quids in that case.1) On the inside - The cafe/restaurant at the top floor of BM - go there for afternoon tea, order champagne and tea and just relax from the hustle and bustle of the museum.2) On the outside - The cameracafe on Museum street 44It is almost always empty its kinda quirky, cosy and with excellent choices and very personal service.You'll find their website at->  http://www.cameracafe.co.uk/and they do have wifi and where else do you get your camera questions answered while you order your latte? It's a unique place indeed!"
"Written October 13, 2007",The Greatest Museum in the World (that I have visited),"The British Museum is the best museum I have ever visited, and makes a good case for the #1 London attraction.  The amount of artifacts is simply staggering, overwhelming for first-time visitors.  It can be hard to decide exactly where to start.  Admission to the galleries is free, but I took a 5-pound Highlights tour, which was a good way to see a lot of the famous pieces in a short time (90 minutes).  The information presented is top-notch and the tour covers several different areas of the museum, including some you probably won't find on your own.  It's not necessary to know a lot beforehand about art or history because the guides manage to cover a lot of ground.  The only complaint I had was that the tour guide was late in showing up and seemed distracted throughout the tour.  I do think it is necessary to either take a tour (human or audio) or buy a guide book, because otherwise you could get seriously lost and lose track of time.The content of the museum is what makes it one of the greatest in the world.  Where else can you see the Rosetta Stone, Parthenon marbles (which Greece wants back), Assyrian reliefs, and multitudes of artifacts from practically every area and culture of the world?  The fact that I have seen several pieces from the British Museum in my art history class just confirms how important it is.  And, the whole thing is free; it can't get better than this.The only drawbacks to the British Museum is that it is popular and large.  It was extremely crowded on the day I went (in July), so much so that it was hard to get a glimpse of the Rosetta Stone, much less take a picture.  The volume of pieces in the museum is impossible to cover in one visit.  For a first visit with limited time, I would suggest taking the Highlights tour and then going through the galleries on the first floor that have the most impressive and famous artifacts: Egyptian, Near East, and Greek."

"Written March 10, 2014",Viking exhibition,"We visited this exhibition yesterday, the British Museum have missed a wonderful opportunity. Like everyone else we would agree that the amount of people spoilt many things. The exhibits need a second information label higher up so that people not listening to the audio can read them easily, sometimes you can see some of the cases but not read the information as it is too small and too low.The first exhibit is a big let down, so small after queuing for some time, it needs something startling to make you want to go on! Models of viking life, home, clothes and games would have been great and more interesting for the children. It needs to be much more exciting. Simple museums in Norway and Denmark are much more enlightening, informative and atmospheric. This exhibition was very sterile.The toilets were a disgrace and we had to complain, obviously no one had been to check them for hours, I can't imagine what visitors to Britain think.What a shame. The British Museum should be able to do much better!"
"Written April 6, 2013","Poor Customer Service, but do they care?","Went there today to see the Pompeii exhibition. Had the London 2 for 1 voucher printed off and 2 adult National Rail travelcards. The girl at the ticket desk was rather surly and said that the offer was not valid at weekends. I pointed to her the terms and conditions that I had printed from the website showing nothing which stated that this was a weekday-only offer. She took a leaflet out and showed me it was a weekday offer. Fine. My sister who I was there with showed her Eurostar pass and knew from colleagues that this had been accepted for the 2 for 1 for staff members. The girl refused this too as she was adamant that we would pay full price.Unfortunately, it is very much a case of luck with who you end up being served by, as I'm certain that a customer-focused employee would have been friendlier and flexible.As far as the exhibition went, it was good, but not worth £15. It took me an hour to see from beginning to end.The organisation of the entrance to the exhibition left a lot to be desired. The screen outside shows the ticket time, but when you queue up you are told to wait (or even worse instructed to go to the back of the queue!) as there are others in the queue with earlier ticket times. Very crowded and messy way of getting people in.Apart from that, the food and gifts in the museum are vastly overpriced, however, this didn't seem to deter tourists from emptying their pockets."
"Written January 3, 2013",we called it the 'british loot museum'.......,"..............as almost everything in it seemed to us to  be something precious stolen from somewhere else. On the up side it is a superb building with a massive range of artifacts. It is free admission which is to  be complimented in  this day and age.  They provide helpful maps and we did the 10 item 1 hour tour and in so doing you get to see a lot more than the 10 items set out in brochure. My favourite were the reall mummies ancluding mummified pets which weren't listed in the 10 at all. On downside it was raining day we went and was very very busy. crowds were almost intimidating and on basement floors th heat was uncomfortable. Still, a worthwhile visit even if we do think they should be giving a lot of the stuff back to it's original owners"
"Written February 5, 2012",Excellent free attraction - too much for one visit,"I only visited the free parts of the museum (the majority of it to be fair) and still I felt a two and a half hour visit hadn't done it anywhere near true justice, with still loads to explore and exhibits to look at. The place is absolutely huge and split up into various sections broadly based around different regions of the world. I particularly enjoyed the Egypt sections. There are lots of guided tours, I caught a bit of the Japan one and it was quite informative, didn't have time to see it all. I personally felt the paid for sections were a bit steep, but if I lived in London I'd probably purchase a membership, which is relatively cheap for the under 26s. Didn't try any food, it was pretty expensive, the toilets were clean. I'd happily visit again to see some of the other areas."
"Written February 27, 2009",Good museum,"If you only have a few days in London, I wouldn't recommend that you spend all day here: just hit the big exhibits, and by big exhibits I mean Egypt, Assyria, and Greece. Very impressive collection of Egyptian mummies, Assyrian reliefs (including the epic winged lions at the entrance to the exhibit), and Greek sculptures from the Parthenon. And of course, don't miss the Rosetta Stone. It's the big black rock that everyone's crowding around in the entrance to the Egyptian exhibit.Three exhibits took about 2-3 hours to see. To avoid crowds, don't go in the weekend afternoons like I did!"
"Written February 14, 2008",Take your own food/sandwiches!!!!!!!!,"My wife and i visited the museum just four days ago, we were very impressed with the wide range of exhibits and in particular the department of egyptology where there was a huge variety of artifacts, the rosetta stone display was very disappointing though with the stone being displayed in a dark area with no lighting in the display case!!!!!!!, the rosetta stone is hugely important and one would think it could have been displayed in a prominent area in a custom made case with the correct lighting to properly highlight the text.The cafes in the courtyard were an absolute joke and a total disgrace to the museum, the food on offer was disgusting and horrendously expensive the cafe staff were foreign and downright ignorant and there was NO BRITISH FOOD AVAILABLE!!!!, The so-called restaurant on the upper floor was equally laughable with only a couple of foreign (and very expensive dishes) available, again no british food available????? all the cafes shops and restaurant are manned by sulky, ignorant and ill-mannered foreigners peddling cheap tat and cheap food at ridiculously high prices, this is not the way to attract repeat visitors!!!!!!, and the moral of this story? take your own food/drink/water, give the souvenir shops and their (made in china) rubbish a wide berth and you should have an enjoyable visit to the british? museum."
"Written February 5, 2008",Wealth of the Empire,"Family of four(parents and 17 and 15yo) visited at end of December 2007; museum was packed with fellow tourists.Simply put, the British Museum has an amazing collection of artifacts from around the world-it's also free!  To see so much, from so many places, it was breathtaking.  From Egyptian mummies to Summerian stone reliefs to the Elgin marlbes, anyone with even a passing interest in ancient history could spend days here-and that's only one part of the museum.In a city known for its high cost of living, to find a treasure-trove of pricelss objects available for viewing for free is a great break for a touring family.Strongly recommend it for all."
"Written January 27, 2008",Dissapointed,"Having a masters degree in history, I've always wanted to go to the British Museum.  However, I found the staff disinterested when I tried to rent an audio guide. The were similarly uninterested in telling us when the guided tours would take place. The museum has an embarrassment of riches, but unfortunately, the way the items are displayed lack cohesiveness or much educational value. The glass cases are often smudged and difficult to view, and are placed so closely together that you end up getting knocked down by people trying to see the cases on the other side of the walkway. The display text is often at the bottom of the display, adding to the congestion when people have to bend over to read what the exhibits are about. The lighting is poor and the overall affect is that someone took a 1960's hospital and dumped a ton of historical crap in it. When compared to the displays in the Louvre or the Kunsthistorisches in Vienna, the British Museum is a mishmash of cold displays with little narrative. The Egyptian exhibit would be better if they modernized the display cases, moved things about so it's not all cattle rows of items and found a more organic way to have viewers move about the objects.Overall, very disappointed with the experience.  If the Brits insist on stealing world treasures, then they need to display them all, instead of keeping most of them in storage, and find a good way to exhibit them."
"Written July 27, 2006",The building alone makes it worth a visit!,"I've read the reviews so far, and I agree with just about all of them. The British Museum really is a must see in London. I've been there twice and both times it's the building that still impresses me most!Yes it contains countless treasures (plunder from the British Empire days!) from around the world, and yes it looks fairly normal from the outside, but the glass covered central court is just stunning. It's the best example of new complimenting old that I've ever seen. (Unlike that monstrosity out the front of the Louvre!) Don't miss it.Also, the book shop in the middle is VERY good, loads of great titles that I've never seen elsewhere, including online. I managed to get an excellent David Roberts book."

Beyond a small sign not to touch these priceless artifacts, I saw nobody stopping English speaking tourists from touching these items. "
"Written April 15, 2017",A 125-item Scavenger Hunt,"For a museum of this scope - several million objects under curation - you need a plan.  There are many: audio guides from online sources; the ""top 10"" booklet from the museum; or the ""a short history in 100 objects"" podcast/book by the museum.We tried an app that closely matched the 100 objects that had 125 items. My daughter, 20-ish, and I gave it a decent shot, but in the end had to admit that 10:30 to 5:30 just wasn't enough time even though ~20 of our items were in closed halls.So, make a plan. 100 items is probably too many unless you know ~exactly~ where they are.A couple of notes:~ the Egyptian halls are tremendously busy…all.the.time.~ there's a replica Rosetta stone in hall #1 that you can touch and has no crowd~ there is a restriction on the maximum sized bag you can take into the museum~ the did at the cafés is surprisingly good~ they start closing halls well before the actual closing time. So if you're interested in Japan, don't leave the halls on the 5th floor until the end~ read a history in 100 objects beforehand, I wish I had, but only had Tim for ~1/3~ allow all day, but children, even 20-ish children get tired…50-ish feet get tired too :-)~ there's a great Turkish restaurant 250m towards the tube station which is quiet to allow reflection on what you've seen over a glass of wine."
"Written March 31, 2017",Ten Stars!!! But Sadly only One,"Yes the British Museum should receive Ten Stars but perhaps some one will read this and agree it needs desperately to be cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and maybe brought up to date...when was the last time the walls were painted, the floors really cleaned, the lighting on the exhibits brought up to date, the bathrooms ..ugh!! ..it appeared more effort has been devoted and more precious space to the selling of trinkets...I know its""free"" but maybe, just maybe you need to charge £5 ..or more...its worth £20 .Perhaps get the attention of a guy like Bill Gates to buy some paint and cleaning tools. Such beautiful awe inspiring historical artifacts...what wonderful learning ..im still at loss on how to describe all that the museum has to offer but it was so depressing to see the sorry shape of the buildng itself. Recently we had the opportunity to visit the Metropolitan Museum in NYC....someone please from the British Museum visit there, each exhibit thoughtfully thought out in placement and lighting, every room and hall and yes the bathrooms too, clean, dusted and painted. The eating areas say, ""welcome, sit and relax and enjoy a drink, snack or food"",as you walk around there is always a place to sit and look at the exhibits...yes one can buy trinkets but the Museum store does not operate in a prime location. The British Museum can and should be the most beautiful museum in London....every piece of history that this Museum has deserves no less...the British People deserve a beautiful awe inspiring museum."
"Written March 20, 2017",One Day Wasn't Enough!,"Wow.  Wow wow wow.I could not get enough of this museum.  We arrived when it opened thinking we would stay just a couple of hours.  We closed the place down - they had to force us out.  Honestly I could have spent my entire ten day trip here.  If you are a museum fan, you will love it here.  There are so many wonderful exhibits and amazing pieces.  The museum stores are fantastic and plentiful - everything from little souvenirs to an amazing bookshop to more luxurious items.  I highly recommend the tour which gives you highlights of some of the museum's most famous pieces.  This is a great option if you don't have a ton of time to spend - but buy tickets early - they sell out.  The cafe was also wonderful and super reasonable.  This is one of my favorite experiences from our trip."
"Written January 1, 2017",Parthenon Gallery,"For all the claims that the Parthenon Marbles can best be shown and understood, in relation to other human achievements, if left in the British Museum and not returned to Greece, the state of this gallery belies it all. Having visited twice in the space of 12 months and also visited the Parthenon and the Acropolis Museum I would make several points about the British Museum display:Having appreciate the strength and intensity of the Attican light bathing the Parthenon, the dinginess of the Parthenon Gallery is upsetting.The skylight is filthy and had not been cleaned between the two visits as it had the same marks on it.Climatic controls in the gallery are inadequate and on a hot summer's day a side door must be opened to cool things down. Labelling is inadequateThe elements of the Parthenon are in an incorrect alignment relative to their original geographic arrangementThe elements cannot be understood in dynamic relation to the building they were cut from.Although the gallery has free admission, any in depth information about the exhibit  must be purchased.This is a shoddy relic of an exhibition, little more informative than butterflies in a glass case.  Certainly the beauty is obvious but it's been rendered passive, the active religious, aesthetic, architectural and contextual meanings of the marbles tripped away rendering them into artefacts. This museum is a sad hangover from the imperial era attempting to rebadge itself as a place of relevance in the world, it's not. Time for the Board of Trustees to move into the 21st century and start shifting things around.  For starters, return the Parthenon Marbles"

There's so much to look at, and the rooms are so vast that even if there are a lot of people, it will never feel crowded. You can take your time to see the exhibitions, take one of the guided tours (they have different lenghts depending how much time you have) or using the audio tours. They have one for kids as well!They have hands-on stations, with museum items you're allowed to touch. I got to touch a 350 000 year old hand axe, the mind boggles! There are many of these stations around, and a lot of interesting information to be had, for adults and kids alike. The museum is free to enter, and I heartily recommend giving The British Museum a visit, whether it is a rainy day or not. You will be awed by the beautiful collections and inspired for years to come! I have been there 3-4 times now, and I still haven't been able to see everything, there's so much to discover - and all for free!"
"Written December 20, 2014",Sunday Morning - Should have taken a walk in the Park,"Possibly the most disappointing visit to a Major Museum I have had...ever.Free entry does not offset the facts the Museum was difficult to navigate, the staff looked poorly motivated, I witnessed some being quite short tempered with the visitors (excited kids), some huddled around portable electric radiators, guess it's hard to be enthusiastic when you are cold. Some galleries were shut, many of the exhibits were missing from there places in the display cabinets, so much so that I thought the Viking and Sutton Hoo exhibit had been burglarised...This Museum needs to get back to what it used to do very well, educate and excite young minds, the administration appears to have lost its way.Also the Acropolis / Elgin Marbles exhibition is an EMBARRASSMENT, these should be returned to Greece and viewed in context at the new Acropolis Museum, which incidentally should any of the Museum Managers read this, is a modern museum which gets it.Visitors should take a minute to read the exhibition notes, I really have not read such politically incorrect and patronising drivel since the 1980's. What a disappointment, I really should have gone to the park."

Be sure to not miss this wonderful experience.  It is maintained in an excellent state.
"Written May 6, 2014","Key exhibitions are superb, rest less so","Wear comfortable shoes as this museum is vast.  It covers pretty much every civilisation since early man. Its breadth is in part its weakness as some of its exhibits are simply too small to do justice to every facet of human history and I felt there were a couple of surprising omissions from some of mankind's formulative centuries.  But its main exhibitions and those rooms for which it is justly famous are breath-taking.Must-sees are of course its Egypt and early civilsations (Greece, Rome) rooms but it also has some fascinating tangential exhibits such as its one on clock- and watch-making from the very earliest to the present day. Access for less mobile visitors is so-so.  There are elevators but spaced far apart but they've done what they can with what is an antique building in its own right.  Food - from Benugo - is good by museum standards, and seating in the main court area plentiful.  It's worth visiting just to see its 'floating' glass roof but don't rush your visit or you'll leave feeling like you missed something - which you probably will have done!"
"Written March 22, 2014","too many crowds, couldn't see the exhibits!","Oh dear!  Most of us had travelled a long way and spent our money on trains and petrol to get there:  only to be confronted by hordes - and not Viking ones, but hot and discontented visitors - attempting to get close enough to the glass cases to see their contents!British Museum, you should be ashamed of yourself.  You have sold far too many tickets for each slot.  The overall atmosphere, rather than being a pleasure for your visitors who have all paid an entry fee, was one of annoyance and phrases such as, ""This is not good enough"", ""Well really, who do they think we are?  I feel like part of a herd of cattle"" were echoing through the halls.   Not an encouraging indicator of a good day out!So, I am afraid, along with many others, I shall never know what was in those first cases.  Get to the boat after struggling through the crowds and missing a lot of exhibits and things fan out so that you can breathe at least.   But then you begin to realise that the contents of the cases are not fully covered by the captions next to them.  Questions such as, ""Well, what is that thing on the right then?"" were also heard.   And the whole exhibition lacked any atmosphere or any excitement over who the Vikings were.  One thing I did love was the Norse audiotrack ricocheting over the whole exhibition. Even that perhaps could have had translations interspersed to give the excitement of the content being read.So folks, if you are going, be prepared to fight your way through heaps of bodies to get to the cases and don't expect a seat to collapse on until you are three quarters of the way through the exhibition.  This is not for the faint hearted, but then the Vikings never gave us Brits an easy time!  Perhaps the British Museum thought they would recreate that for us - and have certainly succeeded!"

"Written March 18, 2014",Viking Exhibition,"What should have been a fascinating exhibition was spoiled by the large numbers of people being allowed in at once. Surely the point of having timed entry is to prevent this? Wouldn't it be possible to display the exhibit captions above the cabinets in some way? The great crush of people, particularly in the first room, completely blocked the captions (which, being grey on grey were difficult to read in any case) so I didn't know what I was trying to see. In other exhibitons I've visited, magnifiers have been provided to see the intricate detail of pieces of jewellery, but not here. The entire exhibition was laid out to be enjoyed by a small number of people: how many people get the opportunity of a private viewing?"
"Written March 18, 2014",Vikings - beware!,"I would advise anyone planning a visit to this exhibition to buy the catalogue instead and avoid the frustration of possibly the worst visitor experience I've ever had at any exhibition. I had a timed ticket for 12.30 on Monday 17 March, and expected that visitor numbers entering the exhibition would be regulated. Instead, I was met with crowds of people, three or four deep, some attempting to look at the exhibit, some bending to read the low level labels but most looking at, and fumbling with their audio guides. It was impossible to see anything in the first room and I moved on, only to discover that this was the pattern throughout this extremely poorly designed exhibition. As a result, I missed many of the exhibits entirely. When I was able to focus on something which caught my interest, it was almost impossible to work out what the exhibit was since this was unclear and too often the ill-matching ""description"" simply referred to which museum had loaned the artefact. The museum authorities should take steps to immediately reduce numbers entering the exhibition, remove audio guides which add considerably to congestion, replace the signage and perhaps employ a more competent exhibition designer in future."

"Written December 29, 2019",As If One Needed A Reason to Go to the British Museum – The Troy Exhibit Certainly Beckons You,"The British Museum—dedicated to worldwide culture, art, and history—is overflowing with unique exhibits and some 8 million objects; enough to keep one busy for several days. Open since the late 18th century, the museum owes much of its collection to the days of the British Empire and so there is some controversy over the ownership of specific pieces in the collection. Regardless, the British Museum is a beacon of cultural and historical knowledge that inspires. I’ve been to the museum multiple time and come away more and more impressed by the permanent collection and the special exhibits. One of the current exhibits, on Troy, is a fascinating take on a classical story; weaving together both legend and fact into a comprehensive exhibit of classical and modern artistic representations of the fabled story. Well worth the extra cost for the exhibit; otherwise the museum is free (but excepts small donations from visitors).  Keep in mind this is a very large museum and would realistically take more than a day to do it justice; the highlights, however, are manageable with 2-3 hours time."
"Written December 28, 2019",the most amazing museum,I know that people complain and say that a lot of the stuff was from other countries and should be given back but I think that because its here at the British museum it was preserved so well and taken such good care of. Probably in the native country it would have been looted and ransacked and destroyed or never maintained due to lack of funds etc. but that being said i think the collection is wonderful. From the Athens Acropolis artifacts to the Rosetta Stone all were presented so well and all for free. So its a joy to be among so many artifacts from so many countries and to see it showcased and categorized so well. I did give a donation to them coz i was impressed with their works.
"Written March 17, 2014",Poorly organised viking exhibition,"When we saw that this exhibition would be coming we immediately booked our trip to London from the Netherlands. We were really looking forward to it, and the disappointment  was therefore enormous when we were let in just to enter the back of a non-moving queue. After about 10 minutes we decided to give up the wait (we had not yet reached the first display), and walked on to try to get a peek here and there. Which was not very successful either. My personal opinion is that for special exhibitions like this no audio tour should be offered. People tend to stand still and listen until the soundtrack for that particular object is finished, they then move on to repeat the process. This means that they are hardly moving, leading to insane queues.So if you are going to London and consider visiting this exhibition - don't!"
"Written March 12, 2014",Atrocious overcrowding,"In the main rooms there were crowds 2 to 3 people deep around every display.  With no formal queuing system inside the exhibition and the amount of people it meant one would have to spend a great deal of time waiting and jostling to get near any item rather than simply enjoying the visit.  We tried skipping a number of cases, thinking to see a display that was less busy and then return once the other display had become freer - however it was so busy around every item this strategy would not help. The only conclusion is that too many people have been allowed in..  After a few minutes in the exhibition we gave up and left.Either the museum has made a huge mistake and/or they have decided to pursue revenue at the expense of the visitor experience.  Very disappointing."
"Written March 10, 2014",Viking Exhibition,Interesting viking stuff.  But much of it is impossible to see. It's a slow over-crowded shuffle through dimly lit rooms past poorly displayed artefacts.  Explanations and presentations are minimal. The big viking ship is impressive at first glance - then you discover almost all of it is a steel reconstruction.  I left early and disappointed at having been able see little and learn less.
"Written December 14, 2019",Sad decline of a once great institution,"It's been a couple of years since I last visited this precious place and how it has gone down hill! From the overkill of the security barriers and checks, then straight into a row of people lined up to take your fiver ""donation"", then the highly overpriced cloakroom, 2 pounds for a basic map, 6 for a guide, and the final straw 22 pounds!!! for the exhibition on Troy. Shame, shame, shame on you, whoever's decided on this money grabbing policy. Hey guys, you are custodians of these treasures, which were robbed all over the world, let's face it. How can ordinary British people and visitors gain rightful access to what belongs to us all. I won't be back to be robbed by the old colonial, imperial power. Good luck from a proud Irish woman!"
"Written December 9, 2019",A must see in London,"A great wow for all the artifacts from around the world which is in this museum. You can learn so many things and be mesmerized by the vast number of artifacts in this museum. I personally loved the Egypt collection of mummies, tombs, statues and other artifacts. You can take history trip of the whole world when visiting this museum. If you are not in a hurry you will need a whole day to see the museum."
"Written December 2, 2019",The best museum in the world!,"I was told by a man older and more knowledgeable than I that the British Museum has the largest and best collection in the world. I can only say I was impressed and I loved it. It is free so why not go and see real mummies, check out the Rosetta Stone that helped humanity decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphics, among other countless artifacts from whichever time in history interests you. It is the history of mankind and lost civilizations in one museum. Plus it is a good place to walk around and reflect. If nothing else remember it’s free and go for one hour."
"Written November 30, 2019",One of the Best in the World,"Due to limited time, we hit up the best collections per the Museum's recommendations and was glad we did.  The highlight of course was the Rosetta Stone.  If we have more time, we could have spent a full day here.  The entrance was free and very orderly.  They have an extensive gift shop on the ground floor with very unique and interesting stuff.  Will definitely comeback."

"Written November 22, 2019",Quick access,"It was the last sightseeint on our must-see list. Sunday forenoon, right after the opening. There was quiet much people but we pass through the security.The sight of the hallway is unique! Like you are a part of something big :) and the feeling of seeing the Rosetti stone is indescribable! And so many artifacts too.We visit this place but still have time to catch the plane :)"
"Written November 17, 2019",Needs thought,"Brought a neighbour here for her first visit to the BM. She was very keen to see the third floor Egyptian exhibits. Much enjoyed - but - peace was shattered within 20mins by hordes of schoolchildren. 2 schools, both from Tower Hamlets, had badly behaved children, a handful or so each but they endangered others - and us - by running around, shouting, flash photography, swinging each other by the backpack, knocking into people including my chum who has mobility issues. The accompanying adults were either oblivious or unwilling to deal with the problems. I hasten to add, most of the children were well behaved and well escorted. Children need education but we adults also have rights too. I felt sad for a number of people who had made a journey to the BM and had their visit spoiled. What about overseas visitors...what on Earth impression would they have got? Do schools get guidance from museums? Do the children get advised of expected standard of behaviour?Our suggestion is: the BM reserves one weekday each week for no organised school visits. Publicises the school free day and then we adults get choices. I for one am fed up with not seeing the Egyptian exhibits because kids are lying all over the floor in front of displays. Plus the noise, plus being pushed, it’s just not safe or pleasant. This needs sorting out."
"Written November 7, 2019",Beautiful ,It wasa kind of dream to see so closely the best arts from all over the world. You can enjoy with the best artists works in the museum. 
"Written November 2, 2019",A must visit,This is an iconic museum and a must see while in London. There is only one Rosetta Stone. Their collection of ancient artifacts is unrivaled except perhaps for those things that are still in situ and in Egypt. So much has been lost to destruction and war - particularly in the Middle East in recent years - this museum holds on to some of the evidence of humanity's past.
"Written October 24, 2019",Off season but still crowded.,"Wonderful museum with so many treasures.  Loved the friezes from Athens but really wondered if they should be here.  From what I was able to see of the Rosetta Stone, it was amazing.  Don't miss this site, but pack some patience."
"Written September 14, 2019",Disappointed,When viewing the Elgin marbles I felt a great disappointment in the British museum. It struck me they have basically received stolen goods and are refusing to return them! I expected more integrity from what should be an institution above reproach! Not impressed... I almost felt like organising a boycott. I'm sorry I went there!
"Written September 10, 2019",Great display - mind blowing ,"Loved the amazing displays. Was blown away with the history here.    Who knew Britain had a lot of Egypt’s relics ? Word to the wise - The toilets are hard to find. The boys are up the stairs and the girl are at the bottom. Also closing time isn’t announced, they just closed doors after you walk through. I got seperated from my party so check closing time "
"Written September 4, 2019",Stunning and Enormous,"Amazing works of art, including The Scream! The museum is physically stunning but it’s vastness is almost overwhelming. It’s a place you could easily spend several hours wandering through and leave knowing you missed a lot. If you enjoy art museums you should visit this one, it’s well worth it."
"Written August 19, 2019",Great museum !,"A lot to see, great place to visit with your kids , you will at least 2 to 3 hrs. I would recommend to take audio tour or guided tour"
"Written August 18, 2019",All the tragedy and honor of Western history is captured in this collection.,"What ARE the Brits doing with the gorgeous marbles that were part of the Parthenon???  A British archeologist shipped them to the UK with some degree of Greek permission. In truth, they have been well cared for...but the story of who really ""owns"" something this ancient is an important discussion.  You'll have your own internal dialogue on this same subject as you marvel at the incredible collection here. I'm grateful to see it all under one roof, and well managed.  This story and struggle is part of our history, too.  Hope you go and decide for yourself who owns human history."
"Written August 18, 2019",Nothing Like It In The World!,"It has become my tradition that, upon arriving in London in the early morning hours, my first stop is to drop luggage at my hotel, the second is the British Museum, where I spend the balance of the day.  I particularly love the Assyrian and Egyptian exhibits, although truthfully, it is all priceless and ... if it's a word... unmissable!"
"Written August 18, 2019",Always a hit,Always something to see. From the special exhibits and regular galleries with space to sit and draw iteo
"Written August 16, 2019",A Zoo - Not a Museum,"As you approach the zoo-museum there are hundreds - maybe a thousand - people being herded through cattle chutes waiting to be examined before entrance (waiting out in the rain). Once inside, you look around. There  were probably six thousand people in this place today - sitting on the floor, in the restaurant, blocking every ingress and egress, not really looking at anything but each other.They are fish out of water: ""Now, why was I loaded up on a bus with a hundred other people and drug over here?"" Answer: ""Because it's the British Museum.""And - interestingly - do you know how many toilets there are for those 6,000 people? Six male and six female. After you descend into the crypt under the once famous - now incarcerated - Reading Room (encased in a Carrera marble mausoleum for posterity), the line of women goes out the door. On the men's side, you might only have to wait twenty minutes, but at least you get to wait inside the restroom.The one handicapped toilet located in an obscure alcove up on ramp is out-of-order. Funny thing if you looked around. With all that security outside, nobody is working inside. Not a guard, an attendant, nobody. (Keeps the overhead down.) Just the zoo-scape of visitors. At the one information desk, there are two people. Their job is to sell the audio-tour devices. When I asked one of them a question (other than ""Where's the bathroom,"") he told me, not being able to answer the question: ""They don't tell us much.""The British Museum is a significant part of Britain's patrimony, a national treasure, or it used to be. Now it has devolved into feeding time at the primate cage."
"Written August 14, 2019",This is a very busy place.,"I though one rainy day i would go in to The British Museum and see what was on, one this was with it being bad weather, I think everyone had just thought the same, never mind. As i walked round the place it stuck me, what a lot of artifacts in there that were not ours to have but very interesting all the same, then i thought id just go see the Magra expo, again standing in a que for ages was not my thing, then i saw it was £19.50.That's a lot for that so unfortunately did not go. Its a wonderful space, great to have but its a overcrowded public venue that you have to deal with that's not really for me."
"Written July 26, 2019",Hot/Stuffy and Overcrowded,"We went there one hour after opening time, and there was already a hefty line. The line moved quickly, but the problem is this: they don't seem to have a cap to the number of people inside, so and the swarms all flock to the ""famous"" or most popular sights, essentially ruining the experience, because it is no longer like being in a museum -- more like being at a rock concert, people bumping into or elbowing past you, trying to take selfies and photo shoots with the artifacts, etc.  This is not a problem everywhere in the museum, but is especially problematic in the Egyptian rooms (especially the funerary room)I first came to the British Museum over 20 years ago, and then again about 17 years ago, and it was nothing like this.  Times have changed, and overpopulation combined with the popularity of traveling (and photo-taking) means that some things should probably change at the British Museum:For one thing, it is free. As much as I love that, I think maybe they should start charging an entry fee. This would help them raise funds, and it might be a deterrent to some people, making the crowds more reasonable. I would gladly pay 10 pounds if it meant I could actually see the exhibits and read about them. (if the argument is that British tax dollars support this museum so it should be public, then fine... make it free for UK citizens and charge a reasonable fee to everybody else)The collection is great and the museum itself is cool, but with this level of discomfort, it's not worth visiting (at least not during peak tourist seasons, like summer)"
"Written October 20, 2019",Unparalleled Exhibits,Let me just say this - I believe this is probably one of the greatest museums in the world with unbelievable historical exhibits. We just happened to go in July and it was a cluster with crowds and noise and the hustle and bustle diminished our experience. The museum is worth taking your time and really exploring. It was just too busy for us to really be able to do that and enjoy it. If you're in London 100% you should visit but be aware that in Summer it will be mobbed.
"Written October 16, 2019",Amazing Museum,"We visited on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowdy.If you are visiting the firts couple of times, I would recommend to take a tour or something, because the museum is too big.They have everything you want to see, and you can easily get lost there.We went for 3 hours and it wasn't enough, so you can easily spend a whole morning here.They have bathrooms and the museum is free, although you can donate some money.Tours are paid though."
"Written October 10, 2019",Amazing place,The British Museum was amazing for anyone interested in world history. You could spend an entire day here and would not see everything. We did not intend to visit this but we are glad we did.
"Written October 7, 2019",Great Museum,"We visited this museum to see two things: the Rosetta Stone and the pieces taken from the Parthenon.  Of course, we saw both and much more, including an interesting exhibit of clocks."
"Written October 5, 2019",HUGE! Know what you want to do there - or be prepare to spend the day :),"Wonderful! Each room is spacious enough for a huge crowd to move around in. When my husband and I got there, each area had different classes of kids. It was very crowded. In a couple hours, by lunch time, it spaced out a bit. SO much walking! I believe they have portable chairs if you can find them at the beginning. That would have helped me. There are some benches here and there, but I didn't think there were enough. ANYWAYS - The exhibits are amazing! The Egyptian rooms were our favorite. Mummies, tombs, amulets, all sorts of things. Then there is the Greek section, the Rosetta Stone, the gladiator stuff, etc. Down on the first level is a giant circle and there are two cafes. A bit pricey, but did the trick for a snack. It seemed like you could pack your own lunch if you wanted. Bathrooms were on the first level, too. We knew exactly what we wanted to see, found a map, attempted to follow it and saw what we wanted. It still took us a few hours. Security to get in was typical. They did a simple bag check. It's free to get in! Donation based. Totally worth dropping in 5+ pounds per person."
"Written September 26, 2019",Fantastic visit,"There is so much to see here, no matter what period of history or region of the planet you are interested in.  We took one of the free 40 minute tours (of the Greek exhibit) which was excellent, and added tremendously to our understanding of what we were looking at."
"Written September 25, 2019",Rainy day ,"Free to get in, plenty of interesting things to see! Artefacts from most parts of the world, something to interest everyone. A bit of a queue to get in, but it moved quickly and the bag search was quick and easy. Gift shop had plenty to offer, and food available in the cafe, cakes looked great! "

We reviewed the map and picked out what we most wanted to see and did our best to see it.  I have to say the building itself is beautiful, outside traditional and stately, inside modern and impressive.  The displays were great, the accompanying explanations were well written.

"Written June 23, 2019",Most amazing arqueological museum,Needless to say this is one of the greatest museums in the world. An incredible collection that explains the key highlight of world's ancient history. A total must for any traveler in London.
"Written June 1, 2019",Always a pleasure ,The museum speaks for itself. If you go 3h before it close you avoid the queue. But attention some exhibitions close a few hours earlier than the museum (Japan). In front of the museum you can buy caramelised almonds and peanuts for £2. Delicious 😋 
"Written May 28, 2019",Impressive,"If you are in to history and cultures the british museum is a must. The most impressive sections are the Egyptian civilisation, the Assyrians, and the library. For other civilisations, the collection is a bit small. The interested visitor should plan a 2 hours visit at least.There is also a pizzeria inside and two street food caravans in the external patio where you can eat or have refreshments or maybe a beer 😉"
"Written May 25, 2019","Funny Place (just not funny ha, ha)","There is no doubt this is a comprehensive and well chronicled collection. The British were running around pillaging other nations and claiming stuff as their own for centuries. Given the comments about being the “worlds” museum and representing all nations you can’t help thinking that the collective conscience is catching up with the, except the refuse to give anything back. The layout of the museum is fairly old fashioned and as a consequence even truly special things get lost in all the other exhibits. The British Museum is really overwhelming in magnitude yet underwhelming in terms of impact. "
"Written May 19, 2019",Never see it all !!!!,"I gave the museum 2 days this time as I did not think I gave it enough time with my last visit.Well, I still feel I have not given it enough time. I always have mixed feelings in museums as I sometime think of them as plundered goods from other nations or stealing from people's grave, but the magnificence that you see of the ingenuity and creative ability  of our species shines like a beacon.I will be going back this trip for a third day and I wonder if that will even be enough time....."
"Written May 19, 2019",Tours,We took 4 Bible tours here. It was such an informative experience.  I felt like we learn so much more than just wandering thru the museum on our own.  I highly recommend bible tours.com. Matt was the best tour guide.  Meander tours also did a great job but the tours were larger and not as intimate. 
"Written May 18, 2019",Crowded but worth a visit for the best of the best ancient artifacts of world history!,"Be ready for lots of tourists everywhere all clamoring to get a view of things, such as the Rosetta Stone.

"Written May 10, 2019",British Museum never fails to impress,"The British Museum is definitely a “must-see” when you visit London. You could spend months in there and not see everything. I used their website to see what was highlighted with the room location number and created a list so I could at least have a plan. It is an overwhelmingly huge museum and that strategy paid off. The museum location is at the picturesque and historic Trafalgar Square, very convenient to the Underground, Leicester Square/West End shows, restaurants galore. The museum as are all of the museums in London is absolutely free. Special exhibitions are an extra charge but there’s plenty of free art to explore! We did pay a little extra (2 for 1 through our Underground weekly pass) to see the Sorolla Spanish Impressionist exhibit which was fabulous and came with a lecture. Go- you won’t regret it!"
"Written July 25, 2019",Too hot and too crowded,It was very hot this July in London and it was even hotter in the museum because of all the people there. It was thus difficult to see the master pieces we had planned to see.However it is an interesting museum to visit.

It is absolutely impossible to see all the exhibits in one visit. I went strictly to view the Rosetta Stone the Greek artifacts. I spent approximately two hours reading and taking in these two exhibits. I am looking forward to my next trip to London and another visit to this awesome museum!"
"Written November 20, 2018",Arrive with a Plan and See the Highlights!,"The British Museum is full of treasures from across the world.  You could spend an entire day here and only begin to appreciate the depth and breadth of the collection.  It is perhaps the finest collection of artifacts anywhere in the word. We had allocated 3 hours to tour the museum and we were able to see everything that we wanted to see because we had mapped out a plan.Be sure to check out the museum's website before you arrive and become familiar with the collections and what you most want to see while you're there.  We purchased a guidebook that had a map of the museum (maps are not free at the museum) and planned our trip in advance.  It is had to overstate just how massive the building is.  Without a plan, you'll just end up wondering around like a zombie following wandering crowds from room to room.We arrived just after 2:30 and we were able to do everything we wanted to do by the time the museum closed at 5:30.  We didn't have to rush either.  In fact, we were able to ""walk through"" all of the museum; meaning we saw the different areas and collections, but didn't stop to admire every piece or read every plaque.  However, we did see much more in 3 hours than we expected (on top of the highlights that were our ""must-see"").The museum has a sit down café that looked nice and overlooks the central lobby.  They also have some stands where you can buy snacks and drinks.  They have several gift shops around the lobby area where you can buy souvenirs.We did have to queue for about 15 minutes or so to get inside the museum.  The queue is for security, not tickets as the museum is free.  If you have time in London, the museum is a must-see."
"Written October 25, 2018",It’s become a circus,"I’ve never before felt the need to leave the British museum. I couldn’t quite believe how much it has changed since I last came here, a year ago. You can no longer just walk in from the front of the building, which is really quite an important part of the experience. You have to weave your way through huge amounts of metal fences to get to an outdoor bag check that was about as friendly as airport control. There was absolutely no need for it as if there wasn’t a huge queue. However, surprisingly, once inside it was so busy you couldn’t actually see anything!! I’ve never seen it so busy before. I went on a Thursday in order to avoid the Friday tourist crush, but apparently the British museum is now just a place tourists go to take photos of everything in hoards. Merely a year ago you could see things. Which is surely the whole point of even going!Now it’s comoletely unenjoyable for a Londoner to go there.What a shame."
"Written October 19, 2018",A must see...countless times!,"The British Museum has something for everyone...of all ages. Entrance is free although special exhibits charge and the charges can be quite steep. The current exhibit on dissident art is fascinating and well worth the money. We spent several hours looking and reading about art through the ages that creative and clever people have used to express their dislike, opposition, and scorn for political leaders and regimes. Towards the end of the exhibit look out for Banksy piece...genius."
"Written October 18, 2018",Wonderfull visit - take free guidet tours,British Museum has so much to offer and so many different collections from all over the world. We had especially a wonderfull experience participating in the free guidet tour through the Greek history of Parthenon. Thank you to our guide Rosemary for making the remains from Parthenon vived and exciting. Based on this we higly recommend participating in these tours by the voluntary guides. 
"Written October 17, 2018",This review is of the BRITISH MUSEUM COURT CAFE not available to choose on TA,"This is one of the worst restaurants in London. It was convenient so we lunched here mid way through our day at the Museum. I had a Caesar salad which had about two pounds of chicken and virtually no lettuce. Also no croutons so I went over to the serving desk and asked for some. He gave me a pasta bowl full of just croutons so I went from none to about 150. My husband ordered a different salad but they brought a mozzarella and tomato one by mistake. She took it back to the serving desk and I watched as she dropped the mozzarella, which rolled along most of the counter before she picked it up with her hand and put it back on the plate. No-one could speak English so we struggled to be understood when we needed to query the food, and the person preparing the food wasn't wearing anything resembling cooks clothing. I have a feeling it was someone drafted in to help out who had no clue and did not look like cleanliness was something he was bothered about.British Museum is a 15/10 place, but don't on any account waste your money in here."

"Written December 31, 2016",Parthenon marbles: waste of time ,"Whether you are aware of the controversy surrounding the Parthenon marbles or not, seeing them here is a waste of time and disappointing. 1. They are poorly lit and displayed in a dark room. 2. The information placards are tiny and demonstrate little awareness of Greek culture and their importance to the Greek people. 3. The brochures explaining the controversy were eventually found thrown on the floor, rather than being accessible to visitors. It was also unsettling, for how it characterised the British acquisition of the marbles from the occupying Ottomans as legal. It did not explain the fraught history of the Ottomans and the Greeks. 4. Most sadly of all, no displayed information and no audio guide was available in the Greek language for people visiting an important part of our cultural heritage here. The Acropolis museum in Athens is superior in every respect. It is a huge new building, with incredible amounts of information and of course - all available in the Greek language. Skip the British museum if you want to see these marbles. Go to Athens, the home of these treasures. Take in the scale of the Parthenon on the hill and then see the copies beautifully displayed at the museum. "
"Written December 7, 2016",Do not miss The British Museum,This was the highlight of my trip to London as I just Love History with all its details ! I went Twice to the museum during my trip because this museum is gigantic.The Egypt section was absolutely Amazing. Do not miss The British Museum. It really is the Best Museum in the World.
"Written October 13, 2016",So much to see and free!,Tons of great artifacts to see and free!  Highly recommend visiting.  We used a guide that directed us to the top 10 items to see.  Was perfect for my wife and I.
"Written September 9, 2016",Tips and Tricks in visiting British Museum  ,"This is my second visit to the legendary British Museum. It is a must visit when you come to London. However, it is a big building and there are too many things to do in London, you need to have a plan and execute it smartly.There are some tips and tricks I would like to share with other visitors.1. With its rich collections of national treasures, British Museum could charge an admission fee. However, it is still free entry which is good for most people. Thus, you don't need to rush and maximize your time there, it is free. If you like it and appreciate it, make a donation.2. Despite it has a big collection of artifacts and many halls, be focused on the areas you are interested. It is advisable to spend £2 to buy a guide book, which shows you all the popular exhibits. 3. British Museum has a rich collection of Egyptian exhibits; if you like mummy, prioritize on it.4. Rosetta Stone is just on the ground floor, it is a big piece stone with a story behind; and is significant in Hunan history.5. You can enjoy a good lunch inside the museum, yes, it is a nice sit down setting with good services. It is just on top of the iconic cylindrical building, walk up the beautiful and elegant staircase, you will find it. The price is reasonable and the food is nice, we spent £25 per head for main course and drinks. You can also enjoy the beautiful ceiling of the museum.If you are focused; you can have a good trip in about two hours included shopping in the museum shops.Enjoy!"
"Written September 7, 2016",Rosetta Stone and a whole lot more,Visiting the museum was at the top of our list and it did not disappoint.  And free.  I wish US museums were free.
"Written September 7, 2016",Fantastic Egyptian and Greek Collection,You hear so mush about the Egyptian and Greek antiquities collection.  The collection is even better.   We were also fortunate to see the Sunken Cities - Egypt's lost worlds which enhanced our trips and provided a greater understanding of how Egyptian and Roman civilizations merged.
"Written September 1, 2016",Humongous collection of cool stuff,"It's what you might expect-- a ton of amazing artifacts & exhibits-- but it's great nonetheless. I'd reserve at least several hours per visit to make it worth your while. At least admission is free (thanks, London!) so you can spread your experience across multiple visits if desired."
"Written July 13, 2016",Not worth the time.,"Very full and poorly ventilated. Accosted by rude security staff searching bags for no good reason. Building full (FULL!) of tourist groups with no sense of personal space. Seems to be no capacity at which they close the doors. A shame, as I'm sure it's very interesting, but a hoard of sweaty Yanks all shouting at each other to ""come an' lekkit diss"" really ruins ones day."
"Written July 11, 2016","Incredible museum. Unfortunately, it should be avoided...","I have been there three times, once in the ""distant past"", circa 1987 (to be honest, cant even recall this first visit).  More recently, I had the opportunity to visit this great museum in Jan 2015 and July 2016. Sadly, both experiences were horrible, for the museum was incredibly overcrowded. The level of noise and commotion made the entire experience meaningless even though for my last attempt I arrived just as the museum opened! I had hopes this strategy would work, but I suppose world tourism is now so huge that it is impossible to go to this museum and not face an enormous crowd. I love going to museums and have visited some of the most famous ones, but have never had any experience remotely close to these two visits. I’m sad to say that the British museum was one of the few negative experiences I had while in London.  Waste of time, much rather visit the V&A or The Wallance Collection..."
"Written September 24, 2018","Not a great day out, really awful wheelchair facilities","Not a great day out, really awful wheelchair facilities. Lift at front unmanned and unloved. Once inside fighting for lift space and no automatic doors (too heavy to open in wheelchair). meant I couldn't independently enjoy this place."
"Written August 31, 2018",Free tours are excellent,"This place is huge with so much to see. It can be overwhelming. The best advice is to get there early and pick up the schedule of free ‘eye opener’ tours that they offer throughout the day. They tend to overlap so you can’t do them all, but you can manage four (maybe even five) if you plan well. They are given by volunteers and are usually very informative. If you are lucky enough to be able to visit on multiple occasions then try and do one gallery per visit so you can really take it all in. If you have only one day take time to decide what you want to see. Trying to cram in everything is impossible.  "
"Written August 30, 2018",I can actually find my way around this museum,"Great museum!! It is set up quite logically, with plenty of good directions to find whatever you want to see. I've been to all the great museums in Europe and this is my favorite. "
"Written August 30, 2018",Great place for anyone who loves history (even a little),"I visited during the hottest summer in 40+ years and even though this museum like the others in London didn’t have AC, it was still great. The sheer number of artifacts and historical items was astounding. Both of my teenage boys love history so it was a perfect place to take them. We didn’t spend a ton of time in any one area and the crowds were thick but we still managed to see it all in about 3 hours but again, we skimmed over some areas and didn’t linger long. You can absolutely do it in a morning/afternoon as 1/2 of a day’s agenda or if you don’t mind missing some of the stuff, you could even do it faster. Obviously there is plenty for history buffs to gawk at for many, many hours so if you’re that, plan for a day with a break in one of the cafe’s. "
"Written August 26, 2018",Beautiful museum but super crowded,"This museum has some outstanding exhibits and the staff does a wonderful job in assisting visitors.  The line for entry through security was quite long.  Once entering the gate, families with children were sent down a separate line with a much shorter wait.  As a parent - Thank you British Museum!  Once inside, navigating through multitudes of tourists proved challenging at times and we had a few conversations about proper museum manners because proper examples were few and far between.  The showcase exhibits were almost impossible to see.  A favorite however was the King's Gallery which was not crowded and very peaceful.  It was a beautiful room full of treasured books, art and collections of specimens from around the world.   "
"Written August 19, 2018",So busy!!!!,We went today and was delighted to discover that it was free entry!It was absolutely rammed full of people. Pushing and shoving in every room.The museum itself was very clean and the staff were very welcoming.Bags are checked before you enter. You can not take food and drink in with you. There are cafes where you can buy food and drink and plenty of toilets - but be prepared to queue for 25 mins to use the loo.The most interesting part is where all the Egyptian mummies are. Fantastic section. The rest we found very boring.There are no interactive areas and we found ourselves walking around and then left pretty quickly.We did sit at the cafe outside for a drink and a snack which was very nice 
"Written August 19, 2018","DO THIS: ""Before the museum opens: an introduction to ancient Egypt""  Rating: 10 of 5!!!!!","We cannot give a high enough ranking to the hour we spent with our guide in the Ancient Egypt area before the museum opened. Our small group of 18, led by a highly knowledgeable museum docent, enjoyed an entire hour alone in this area.We were able to avoid the throngs of people around the Rosetta Stone once the museum opened. After it opened, the place was an absolute zoo. The audio guide line was eternal. Moving in and out of different areas was a madhouse. Once our tour was over, we spent another hour dodging other visitors and hit the highlights on the Things to see list provided on the free museum map.I would spend even more money for more time with a guide before the museum opened. Incredible experience and highlight of the trip for all 4 of us, ages 18-58!"
"Written August 19, 2018",Amazing ,"I always go back to the British as the collection itself is amazing. It would be worth it just for the Rosetta Stone or the Assyrian part, but for lovers of history it has endless things to offer (leaving aside discussions as to whether or not some things should be returned to their home countries).A must see. Planning the visit helps but otherwise you can also decide to stroll around and get lost. "
"Written August 19, 2018","Great building, great history; so much to see, so plan your time","There can be little doubt that the British Museum is one of the world’s greatest.  The building itself is spectacular, if understated from the street.  Lord Norman Foster’s dome, installed over the Millennium is particularly impressive (for American visitors, this is the same guy who designed the glass ceiling over the courtyard at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art and National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC).  The collection is mind-blowing.  From the Rosetta Stone to Anglo-Saxon burial hoards, there is so much too see. For me, some of the highlights include the Assyrian Sculptures - these are particularly valuable as many have been destroyed in the Syrian Civil War.  Also well-worth seeing is the Sutton Hoo Hoard - a treasure trove recovered from an Anglo-Saxon burial mound in Suffolk, England.  My personal favorites, though, are the Lewis Chessmen - carved in the 12th century from Walrus ivory with fantastic detail and character; they were re-discovered almost 200 hundred years ago on the Island of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of North-West Scotland. Here are a few suggestions that I have found useful for dealing with the size of the collection and other facts of life with large Museums I have visited.Like all great public museums in any major city (London, Paris, New York), security screening is a fact of life - it is essential for our safety.  You will need to plan a little additional time for the line to get through security.  The collection is vast and is spread over several floors and wings around the Millennium Courtyard.  So it’s worth taking a few minutes to sit in the Millennium Courtyard and plan your visit - what do you want to see the most?  Unless you have most of the day, you will need to be a little ruthless about selecting some key highlights that will be your personal priorities.  The Museum’s map suggests some highlights and there are staff in every room who can help direct you to your next must-see.  London’s Museums are built to keep visitors warm and dry in colder months.  This means it can be a bit warm inside, particularly at the height of the summer tourist season.  So plan on taking it gently (you’re likely on holidays anyway aren’t you?) or slimming down your list of must-sees.  For example, prepare to wait a few moments to get a clear view of the Rosetta Stone.  The British Museum will get almost as busy as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York or the Louvre in Paris but it’s worth the wait.  This is a must-see collection, one of the world’s finest.  "
"Written August 16, 2018",Security Threat,The major problem in all these venues is the employment of second rate customer services on the cheap who provide 'security'. They have no customer training and make the whole 'experience' dismal once you are herded through some plastic antechamber. The oversight of the trustees of the place is dismal and offers a poor representation to the world.
"Written August 10, 2018",Great experience ,The attention for families is extraordinary!Lovely place to hide from chaos and rain just for families at floor -1Where is Tutankhamun???
"Written August 6, 2018",Recent visit on Sunday.,"To be avoided at all cost!!The queuing started on the pavement along the walls of the Museum. Some tourist became aggressive,probably frustrated at the poor organising of the crowds. The numbers of visitors, their selfie taking activities made any serious viewing impossible. The ladies loos had a 30 min plus wait.Unfortunately we rated the visit as a complete waste of time."
"Written July 9, 2018",One of the best,This must be one of the best museums I have ever been in. There is just so much to see. Absolutely worth a stop if you are in London.
"Written June 28, 2018",Simply amazing,"This museum it is just amazing, it must be the most important collection to understand humankind.There are so many treasures and iconic pieces of history that you can be there forever. It is a huge museum, so prepare your visit, you could be around 2 hours...or the whole day.  Audioguide is a must, with you will seize the opportunity to visit.Special recognition for a free admission, this is something remarkable in an over-marketed world."
"Written June 18, 2018",Worst musuem i’ve visited,"What a waste!Although there are very impressive pieces on display that was the worst museum visit of my lifeExhibits are messy, not even put together.For example to visit the Egyptian collection you have sculptures on ground floor then mummies on the top floor in a room behind medieval pieces and a third part on the other side of the museum!The atmosphere is more like you are visiting a farm fair with lots of noise, people everywhere and just a global messy display of art pieces instead of cows or goatsIndications inside the museum are as eratic as the rest.For example to access the roman antic sculptures turn left at the entrance where the sign indicates cloak room and pizzeria only!Well pizza is from Italy so the connection is obvious maybe?!The pieces on display are very poorly treated as well. It is shocking to see over 5000 year old relics being left right there for everyone to lean on or touch.Finger marks and stains are plenty on the egyptian or assyrians statues.That just reinforces the feeling the museum gives of not giving a damn about conserving what is on display or respect to vistors and making the place enjoyable to visit.The shop is full of way overpriced stuff made in chinaOk there is a lot of people, but if the museum would enforce a policy of relative silence and respect for the pieces on display then it would be a great place to visitAs it is now with what feels like thousands of chinese tourists groups at the same time all shouting and crowding around the displays making it impossible to see anything untill they are gone, the museum is clearly a place to avoidToo bad because the collection they have is clearly impressiveAlso the lack of clear visiting route and will to organize proper tours makes you feel like England displays every notable prize it took back home from around the world and the museum is not intended to show history but war prizes.Forget tour guides, they are free yes but run just a few times during the day and the museum is so noisy you won’t hear what the guide say anyway. (We tried two times)I enquired about private tour guide, they are not available even with advance booking or whatever money you are ready to pay they just won’t do it.Also, as nearly everything in London, you have the few guided tour of some galleries right at the same time as every other activities in london, namely 11am and 1.30 or 2pmIn fact London is a big city but as each and every spot to visit has the same timing for guided tours you can’t visit properly more than one or two place per day.All in all that museum was the biggest disapointment of our trip.Will return the day order and respect is restored there....Most likely never then...."
"Written June 2, 2018",Distressing,The museum was very huge and very clean. But they don't have something to show us! They don't have history. They collect the civilisation of other counties to show!
"Written April 7, 2018",Astonishing,A must to go! An history and world special  tour !!Lot of rooms with art pieces from.all the world and all the times
"Written April 1, 2018",Sunday trip ,There should be a limit of how many people are let  in to this museum How anyone is meant to see anything when you are squashed in like sardines  is beyond me .Also just outside the museum should not be a smoking establishment .Some people might like to sit outside to get fresh air without breathing in smoke !!!
"Written February 24, 2018","Sadly, you have let yourselves down","How I would have loved to give this amazing venue five stars for being an outstanding free museum attracting visitors from across the world with brilliant speakers leading guided tours.Alas, you fell down on the basics.  It was very cold outside.  There was a long queue for the necessary security check.  Once inside, a call of nature was necessary.  The wall display led me to the nearest toilet.  For some reason, it was closed.  That's one star lost.  Back to the wall display to find the second nearest toilet.  For some reason, it was also closed.  Another star lost.  Back to the wall display to find the third nearest toilet which required some of my finest navigation skills to locate a tiny door halfway up a staircase.  This toilet was hardly the most convenient.  It was a small room which was packed owing to the other toilets being closed.  Almost another star lost but I will give you the benefit of the doubt.  This was very bad planning to have the two main toilets closed at the same time.My final complaint was the poor signage.  I spent ages trying to locate the rooms and displays.  In fact, I reckon that I spent a longer time looking for what I wanted to see than the time I spent enjoying looking at what I wanted to see.  That's another star lost.Two pieces of work required please:1. Have a plan that if you are going to close one main toilet, make sure that the other one is fully operational;2. Find a willing helper who is not familiar with the layout of the museum and ask them to find their way to certain rooms and you will discover that the signage needs improving."
"Written February 11, 2018",spectacular museum,this wonderful museum need many visits. there is so much to see & do here. always busy . the staff are very helpful & friendly with directions & information.
"Written May 8, 2019",Overwhelming,You could easily spend a couple of days in the British Museum and not see everything.  I would recommend studying what you want to see before you go especially if you were going with children or teenagers so that you get to all the galleries that you want to go through. This Museum is chock-full of antiquities and history from all over the globe so it is definitely worth going if you were visiting London plus it’s free!!!
"Written May 1, 2019",Busy brits,"Wow! What a collection of collections from all over the world. This is a massive museum and I recommend you get some sort of guide... I downloaded Tourblink that had 120 minute your with ""a selection of outstanding artifacts"". You get the essentialls that way otherwise it might get a bit overwhelming. Amazing museum with good displays and storytelling. I like the fact that one museum hold so many artifacts from so many different cultures but on the same time it feel a bit awkward with so much from so many places. Busy busy almost hoarding artifacts. But on the other hand its kept safe and with no entry fee it's open for everyone.A must see museum."
"Written April 19, 2019",Mummies!!,We had a fantastic time at the museum! It’s free to enter and the staff are helpful and welcoming! Make sure to get there early as it can get quite busy!
"Written February 25, 2019",The steward of the Elgin Marbles,"If you've ever heard Frank Sinatra sing ""A Foggy Day in London Town,"" you've wanted to include the British Museum as part of a visit. I finally returned after many years with a simple goal: the revisit the Elgin Marbles. It's difficult to put into words the importance of being able to visit them ... (just as it's difficult to rationalize why they remain in London rather than being repatriated)... and that alone would be a reason to visit. In addition, though, there are treasures at every turn from the Rosetta Stone to the Lewis cheesmen to the Staffordshire Hoard. At every turn there's a well stocked place to have a cuppa and a sweet to insure that you stay fresh. Allow time."
"Written February 10, 2019",I’m sure it’s interesting but...,I’m sure this place is full of interesting and cool things but I’m afraid my experience was terrible. The museum is just rammed wall to wall with people so you can barely see the exhibits then there’s the gift shop... Unbelievable! I found a few things I wanted and ventured to the till when the trouble began. Would you believe I dared to try and pay with Scottish money? Not Chinese or Russian but Scottish. I was told “We can’t accept that” Apparently because the till girl hadn’t seen sterling from Scotland she wouldn’t accept it. Ridiculous!  Utterly farcical!! How about properly training staff in cash handling positions? The lady in the tiny cafe down the road had no problem with Scottish money.
"Written January 18, 2019",WOW!!!,Amazing museum that I visited 2x during my 12 day stay in London!! Top notch museum! Loved it- especially the ancient Egypt section. I took several of the free guided tours.  There’s a cloak room to drop off your coat and plenty of places to eat inside! Highly recommend!!! 
"Written January 12, 2019",School topic,My sons topic at school this term is Egyptians so took a visit while visiting London. A lovely museum. Not so much interest to our 5 year old but she did enjoy looking at the mummys. Lots to see. We only paid a flying visit so hope to visit again one day and spend longer as so much to see.
"Written January 10, 2019",a real success after its renovattion,"so pleasnt to be in the glass covered courtyard with its shops, cafes and reception desks; the galleries are often renovated with atste ! I love the Sutton hoo treasure, and the sumerian galleries among others: you can exit by the north entrance and walk to bloomsbury or to coram fields, a small museum of an orphanage patroned by Fielding, haendel and captain coram; you will find shops and cafes at the south entrance"
"Written January 6, 2019",Beautiful building ,"The architecture inside this building was a highlight. The displays were not really my thing and i did question how appropriate it was for valuable antiquities from Greece and Eygpt to be sitting in London, but i can see why people who love ancient history would enjoy the place. The toilets were disgusting and it was very crowded too!"
"Written January 4, 2019",🏛Best History Teacher⏳,"This is a great Museum, a teacher of human history from ancient times until today.Paths are well defined, starting from the most ancient civilizations, passing through the Phoenicians, Etruscans, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, up to today 's society.You can admire countless relics of every civilization, well preserved and of great value. All accompanied by detailed descriptions on uses, customs, wars, the arts of every civilization.Some rooms are home to beautiful remains of ancient buildings, like some temples recomposed in their originality.The library area is rich in fossils and other curious and interesting objects, such as the first instruments for measuring time and stars.Even here the entrance is free, some shows are paid and you can make a donation to the exit.This Museum absolutely deserves a visit, as it makes possible a fast learning of what has been the history of man from the dawn of his knowledge up to today's human society, with all its peculiarities."
"Written February 11, 2018",Some spectacular exhibits,The reason for four stars rather than five is the toilets. I have rarely been to somewhere with such totally disgusting toilets.There are some world-unique exhibits that have to be seen from Rodin’s Thinker to the Rosetta Stone to the Elgin Marbles (that must seriously annoy any Greek people that see them). There are mummies and sarcophaguses galore that leave you in open-mouthed astonishment.The building within a building structure is an architectural delight.Think I would try to go back during the week rather than at a weekend when it is heaving.The restaurant seemed far better than the cafe and at £16 for fish and chips seemed like better value than the cafe too.
"Written February 5, 2018",Fabulous - as expected,"Visited with husband and son while in London for a concert. Stayed a few streets away in freezing cold weather and wanted to spend a morning under cover. None of us had visited the British Museum before, oddly, and knew less than we should have about it. We loved it: it has so many stunning collections. We headed first to the Egyptology exhibitions as we're all big fans of ancient Egypt. There was plenty to see, including several mummies. There are bigger collections elsewhere, in the Louvre in Paris and in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, but this one is very accessible and easy to see in a relatively short time. There are excellent ancient Greek and Roman collections too. We wanted to see the Rothschild exhibition, and were impressed with that. Apart from the exhibits, and the comprehensive information provided, there are lovely cafe areas, with good coffee and extremely tempting cakes, as well as baguettes and sandwiches. Great museum."
"Written December 15, 2017",It is FREE and you SHOULD visit this Museum!,"There is a security check before entering the museum. Sometimes the line could be really long, good thing we went there just as it opened at 10:00 am.  CHEAT: There is an entrance at the side (i think left) of the museum where there is no line. The place is so huge you need more than an hour to see everything. They have a lot of valuable colllections from around the world."
"Written November 19, 2017",A GREAT MUSEUM,I visited the British Museum four times.It remains a WONDERFUL experience!I cannot succeed in saying better.
"Written August 22, 2017",Amazing,"Incredibly amazing museum! You could come here every day for a week and still not see everything. Reserve AT LEAST half a day.Yes, there are always a lot of people, but it is free after all. I recommend renting an audio guide with tour suggestions."
"Written August 13, 2017",Simply. Outstanding.,Thank you British Museum for the excellent work being done to keep the world's treasures safe and well-preserved.

"Written August 10, 2017",Must visit,"Must visit Museum. Enter by the 2nd entrance on the back of the building (less queues). If you want to see treasures from all over the world, this is the place."
"Written August 9, 2017",Quick tip to avoid the queues,"I visited the British Museum recently to see the Hokusai exhibition to find long queues outside of the Great Russel Street entrance waiting for a bag check.  I was thankful that I had a exhibition ticket which enabled me to avoid the queues.For anybody who does plan to visit, that there is another entrance on Montague Place at the rear of the museum which is much quieter.  If you use that entrance you might save yourself 30 minutes or so which you can use to enjoy the many fantastic items on display."
"Written August 8, 2017",Extensive collection,"The collection is very extensive and overwhelming. Make sure you know which period you would like to visit and make that a priority. The crowds in August are huge. I recommend getting there early, at the start of the day."
"Written July 27, 2017",HORRIBLE ,"This museum is dirty,  crowded and hot. I am appalled to see people touching exhibits. Not one employee in site and if you did see one they were on their phone! Do yourself a favor-- charge admission fee. Maybe you get more people working to clean and do their job.  All the Greek artifacts need to be back in Greece! I don't recommend this place at all. "

"Written May 30, 2017","Rosetta Stone! Egypt, Nevina, Babolyn, other historical highlights","Perhaps the best world history museum in it.  The British Empires and indeed the worlds oldest purely museum.  Well worth setting aside at least a 1/2 day.  We arrived at 5pm on a day that it was open until 8pm (Fridays) so we had to rush and only do a few areas.  Glad I didn't swing the ""American Pop"" exhibit because you don't come to England to view Warhol exhibits (do you???).  Bottom-line stick with the history and stay away from the political history rewriting stuff and you will have a great day in this incredible museum."
"Written May 10, 2017",A must see when visiting London. ,"This is excellently an curated museum filled with numerous famous works. Although having a grand exterior, it's very easy to navigate and doesn't take 3 weeks to get through like the Louvre in Paris. "
"Written April 29, 2017",One of the Classic Must Dos in London,"Went in to see the Rosetta Stone and a few other iconic items.  Very crowded but well planned.  Security line was a block long but moved very fast.  It is free, so it is worth it to stop in, or stay the day."
"Written March 17, 2017",One of the world's great museums,"I work just a few minute's walk from the British Museum, and I pop in at least once a week; there is always something different to see, and I love coming back over and over again to view its incredible  permanent exhibitions which draw in the crowds.  The museum  houses millions of artefacts from all continents, and provides a very comprehensive and  concise documentary on human culture through the ages to the present time.  Hence it's a vast place, over a number of floors and in a number of different wings.  So my first suggestion, if your time is limited or if this is to be your only visit, is to plan your visit carefully.  Use the comprehensive  museum map (donation required) to priotitise  the particular exhibits you want too see, get an idea of their location in the museum, and go for it.  Helpful staff will be on hand to offer assistance.  My second suggestion is to keep in mind, when planning your visit, that on week days the museum is a very popular place for school visits, so there will be numerous school groups everywhere you go.  My third suggestion is to make sure you see some of the museum's star attractions:  the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, the Egyptian Mummies,  and the glorious Chinese antiquities, sculptures, and carved jade. There are also regular (and always outstanding) temporary exhibitions, so check out current listings.The central internal space, built around the old reading room of the British Library when it was housed here, is a visual architectural treat, and houses a number of cafes, the museum shops, and toilet facilities.The museum is free.  There are two entrances.  The main entrance is on Great Russell Street (Take Exit 2 from Tottenham Court Road  Underground Station and follow the signs); there is another entrance on  Bedford Square (not far from Russell Square).  To enter, you will need to pass through security tents and have your bags checked."
"Written February 14, 2017",Don't miss the Assyrians,"This museum has a great collection and it's free.  So you can see it at your own pace.  I limp a bit and prefer to spend no more than two or three hours at a time, and that is not enough for this museum.The museum is famous for the Rosetta stone, but I have to say if you miss it you won't have missed much.  There are lots of things in the Egyptian collection that are worth a visit, there is a collection of Greek art made in Italy by Greek colonists that I haven't seen anywhere else (although for some reason it seems inferior to the things Greeks did in Greece), and in fact it is probably safe to say that whatever you are interested in this museum has it, but the standout to me is the Assyrian section.  This is simply incomparable.  It isn't just that you don't see it anywhere else, it is that the artistic standard is so high.  People don't think of Assyrians as great artists but they were.  Just look at the lion hunts...nobody could invent those wounded, suffering lions.  Whoever carved that stone had seen lion hunts and recorded with great skill what he saw. "
"Written February 2, 2017","This is Suppose to be a 'British Museum"" !!!!!","The building is amazing, great historic architecture - but it does need some attention as it looks dirty from the outside.As a British National, I was appalled by the contents of the Museum, mainly archeological interest of Egyptian, African and Greek Heritage.What are we doing with all these artefacts. This would be ok in a Archeologiocal Museum BUT not the 'British Museum'.It would be highly beneficial for tourists or even us British to learn about our History and Heritage at this museum. New leadership please!!The Restaurant at the top of the stairs looks very nice!"
"Written January 16, 2017",Amazing Collection ,"This is an amazing museum with an incredible collection of ancient artifacts. Of particular interest is the Egyptian collection, which includes the Rosetta Stone. As with all attractions like this in London, the museum has no fee for entry. "
"Written June 21, 2016",Top notch museum,We just arrived in London from Paris and asked our local hosts about sights to see. It was great to know some museums remain free to the public. Easy to get to by underground subway. The crowd was manageable. Wonderful works of art and history abound . Helpful staff. I didn't feel overwhelmed unlike the louvre. We just didn't have time to see the exhibitions. A must see for tourists and locals alike.
"Written June 2, 2016",Easy to Find and Tour,This museum has some truly amazing artifacts. The Assyrian pieces were mind-boggling. The employees were helpful and the gift shop was top notch. They even sell postage stamps!
"Written May 7, 2016",You need a whole day... or three,"I've been to three major museums (including this one) and each one has its ""thing"" that it offers. If you go just for the Rosetta Stone you're in for a cool treat. However, I doubt you'd be able to just walk in and walk out, because there is a lot to see. There's a lot of Old Testament history from Assyria and other empires from that time that was neat to see. There was also a lot of Ancient Greek and Roman exhibits. I went through it for three hours and only saw half of it. I'd love to go back. "
"Written February 28, 2016",THE Museum.,"So much of the world's treasures are housed under this roof, it is in my opinion an absolute must-see on any trip to London.  I came here straight from Heathrow.   Vast, and completely amazing.  The freaking Rosetta Stone is here.  'Nuff said.  Admission is even free!!!    NO excuse to miss this amazing museum"
"Written February 12, 2016",Great place to spend a day to learn,"Love this musuem. It's free of charge, contains amazing artifacts and is well maintained. I urge visitors to give back at least a token sum as money is needed to run this lovely musuem.I enjoyed taking my time walking through all the rooms and picking up new things (not literally of course). There are people stationed in various rooms with artifacts you can touch and feel while they explain to you in detail about the item. Thumbs up! "
"Written January 20, 2016",Impressive collections!,"I strongly recommend this museum to anyone who visit London. This is a must see museum. We went visit the museum in the afternoon. With no proper research before we visit, and without knowing the museum actually bagged with impressive collection from all over the world. A great place to see the artifacts and pieces that were been trough so much through their journey before settling in this museum. I totally love the fact that a lot of museums in London are free, and you are encourage to give a donation when you visit the museum. Love this concept a lot. It is a great way to encourage people to visit the museums, and a way to attract more youngster to have the opportunity to expose to such a impressive collection. They will have some special exhibition for a few months period from time to time, which will cost some money to go in. I am sure it's worth the money to visit as well. Plan at least half a day or more than 3 hours to visit this museum. We went late afternoon, and regret that we didn't get to finish visit all the exhibition rooms in this museum. The museum open till late on Friday till 8:30pm. (SUPER AWSOME!)You will be able to find this museum quite easily by taking LondonTube. Underground station to this museum is Holborn Station, but it is also accessable from Russell Square Station. The museum is within 5-10mins walking distant from all these two station. Enjoy your visit and be blow away by their impressive collections."
"Written September 14, 2015","I was so surprised at the volume of ""only read about"" world histpory treasures that this museum holds.",Don't miss this world treasure! The exhibits are unforgettable and bring history to life.  The crowds are well managed and enough room for all to see everything.
"Written September 10, 2015",Wanted it to be better.,"I wanted this to be better than it was. Maybe it's just too busy, or the layout doesn't suit me, or the information on items was too sparse, but I always leave feeling unfulfilled.That said, their special presentations are usually very good indeed, though you have to pay extra for them.You should definitely go (and I love the work they did on the main concourse with the new roof etc), but for me? Not my favourite museum, sadly."
"Written September 8, 2015",Top attraction,one of the most important sights to visit while in London. the British Museum - although not so British - is a sight for sore eyes. Artifacts from all over the world that can take your breath away. You definitely need half a day to enjoy it  and delve into the history of every time period or civilization.  A MUST SEE for everyone especially for first comers. It's always in my itinerary every time I visit London - although the treasures of the Parthenon always send shivers down my spine! I'm Greek you see....
"Written August 19, 2015",time is beautiful,take and your time and learn as much as you can. this is a gem of a place with beautiful art from all over the world. wow. i say wow.
"Written February 7, 2015",Nothing british,"A lot of things in there was not british , though we would see how the great empire was , seeing the iron age and railways"
"Written December 27, 2014",Gives me butterflies,Please do not pass up the British Museum. It was the highlight of my trip. I would fly back to London just to go back to to this Museum. Truly wonderful. And I'm still heartbroken I didn't get to see everything.
"Written November 15, 2014","If possible, visit several times","The museum is free, except for special exhibits.  If you have the time, visit more than once for a couple of hours and return to another portion.  There is WAY too much to take in during one visit.  If you only have time for one visit, talk to the information staff and they can direct you to the areas of your interest.  It is an incredible museum - one of the best in London."
"Written August 28, 2014","Hot, boring and crowded","I know this is very subjective, but I thought the majority of the tour was boring. There were only a few things that were interesting. This place is so big, I thought we would never get through it. There was still a lot that we didn't see. It was SO crowded, and very HOT. No A/C in most of the rooms. That made it even harder to enjoy. i just wanted to get out of there asap."
"Written August 5, 2014",Filled with Amazing History!,"Wow, this place is big and filled with so many amazing artifacts from history. There are mummies, samurais, a rosetta stone, what's not to love? A must see when in London.Tips:- Entrance is free but there are many places to leave a donation.- It is hot inside during the summer. I don't believe London believes in air-conditioning, which can make for quite an uncomfortable experience. Use the map as a fan.- There are bathrooms, and there are large lines for those bathrooms. Did I mention it's even hotter in the bathrooms?- This place is so big that you will not be able to see it all on one visit. Pick the most important things you want to see, or wander around aimlessly enjoying all the amazing artifacts, but do not put pressure on yourself to see it all.- There are multiple places to get food. It is fine. There are even vegetarian options. - There are tons of gift stores. - There are so many stairs! Be prepared for a workout. In the heat, because as I previously stated, London does not believe in air-conditioning, or cold drinks."
"Written June 12, 2014",Viking Museum,"Very disappointing exhibition - crowded and no queue or crowd control from museum staff - not sure why there was timed entry when there were such large crowds entering each time. Very difficult to read any of the information because of the crowds in front of each item and I ended up skipping some of the artefacts as I couldn't get near them - at a mere 5 foot tall, I really had no chance against some of the pushier (and taller) visitors. Given how much I spent on tickets, I am actually quite annoyed at the poor quality of this exhibition. My advice - don't bother."
"Written April 26, 2014",Mixed Feelings,"The exhibition has two main elements - the first two rooms are small, cramped, overcrowded, and it is difficult to see anything.  People stand for ages in front of the cabinets listening to their guides.  We, got hot, tired, and frustrated, and could see little point in timed tickets, if seeing the objects was going to be so unpleasant.  Some parents were taking young children around, and it was very difficult for them to see the exhibits - even though adults were letting them through to the front.  I would not have blamed the children if they had started crying, I'm sure a lot of the adults felt just the same. Then the exhibition opens up dramatically into a large room with a Viking ship and viewing platforms.  We found that much less claustrophobic, and hot, and at last we could start to see things properly and take things in. Overall,  there are some fascinating exhibits worth seeing, and a great deal of poor curation.  We came up with a number of ways that the items could have been displayed in a more interesting and informative way. (The 2013 Pompeii exhibition was much, much better.)   Around the walls are a number of photographs and quotations - these are worth looking at. The theme of the exhibition is the Vikings penetration into Europe and Asia, and how they interacted with different cultures, but it is done in a very bitty way.  You will get more out of the exhibition if you read up something of their story beforehand -  otherwise trying to put together a framework from  the way the items are displayed will be next to impossible. Finally,  the staff are rude.   You have to follow the process exactly otherwise expect to be shouted at - there is no excuse for not knowing what the staff want you to do !!  There are no photographs allowed even without a flash,  not even the wall posters.   The good bits :-  The room with the ship,  the viking skeletons,  the wall quotes,  and seeing such a variety of items which emphasised the Viking's reach into different cultures. The poor bits:- the overcrowded rooms, the poor curation,  the loss of a 'story' of the Vikings, contextual information, rude staff. Overall - poor value for money, try and to at the start or end of the day when crowds may be less.  Do not go on a hot day !!"
"Written April 7, 2014",The Vikings need to raid it,"We visited the Viking Exhibition with high hopes. Too many people, too little to see, badly laid out. What more can I say? The Curators of this exhibition need to get their act together and display the artefacts as they deserve to be displayed. There seems to be no account made of the number of visitors already in the exhibition before the next horde are let in and this happens every 10 minutes. Some poor person was trying to wheel a pushchair round. I!m all for youngsters visiting museums but it needs to be a pleasant experience. There was no way for small children to see most of the displays as it was so crowded. I'm very tall so could at least look over the heads of most people except the descriptions for each case are only done once and placed in such a position that it causes bottlenecks with people trying to read. I became so fed up that quite frankly I gave up trying to learn anything and just looked at objects. I can't say this exhibition added much to my knowledge of the Vikings except that originating from the south of England I am unlikely to have inherited any Viking DNA. Shame, as I could have battered my way round."
"Written April 6, 2014",British Museum : Vikings Exhibition,"I visited the Vikings exhibition on Friday with my family and we were all disappointed with the whole exhibition – adults and  children alike. In summary – far too many tickets sold so it was impossible to see anything in the first third of the exhibition (individual queues at every cabinet), and a very poorly designed exhibition, both in terms of physical space ( tiny crammed rooms at the beginning were awful, cabinets with low down small signs which meant only the people at the very front could read what they were looking at, terrible experience for those in wheelchairs) but also in the intellectual journey – no story, no theme,  no wow factor, no revelation…just nothing. It felt like an exhibition from 40 years ago and is not up to the standard we have grown to expect. My party of ten ranging in age from 11 to 52 were all equally disappointed.Our experience was shared by everyone there. The entire crowd were disgruntled, unhappy, discussing the cynicism of selling so many tickets and the poor design values. I think this is one 'blockbuster' exhibit I would recommend you avoid."
"Written April 4, 2014",Vikings Life And Legend,"We have attended a number of the museum's exhibitions over the years and these have been very good. For example Pompeii, Terracotta Warriors and the Egyptian Book of the Dead. But this exhibition was a huge disappointment. It consists of two rooms only of poorly laid out exhibits. Most if these are very small. On the day we visited (12.30pm on 4th April 2014), the rooms were packed with people. So many were being admitted that it took ten minutes to gain entry. It was virtually impossible to see anything in detail due to the crush of people in the rooms. Give this one a miss."
"Written July 28, 2015",The Vikings - too crowded,"I did not enjoy this exhibition as it was far too crowded.  As I am short, I had to wait until I could find a space in front of each exhibit.  It was difficult too, to find a description of each item.  Numbering the items and the text would help.  Museum fatigue set in very quickly.  The only one of our group that enjoyed it was over 6ft tall and could see over the heads of other people."
"Written March 17, 2014",Viking Museum,"What a shame! This could have been so good, but the British Museum has been overtaken by greed - they pack so many people into the Viking Museum, it was a painful ordeal for all 3 of us.  We've been to a few of these 'special' exhibitions this year and last, and this one was the most overcrowded by far, making the whole thing a waste of time.  Not sure we'd want to try another one after this experience,ánd really can't recommend this, even though the actual exhibits (those we managed to see through the crowds) seemed to be good."
"Written March 15, 2014",Vikings furious,"The Vikings exhibition at £16 per adult could have been an expensive treat but was a fiasco.  Overcrowded is an understatement.  Queuing and shuffling crocodile style to see the exhibits was the form for the visit.  After 5 minutes of not being able to see a thing, and a husband at 6ft 2 who also couldn't see anything we made the difficult decision to abandon the exhibition.  Admittedly the British Museum gave us an immeadiate refund.  But after the cost of train fares at £100 for three people and coffee, lunch etc we spent over £160 to go to London just for this exhibition.  It should be noted I work in the museum and heritage sector as a manager and I felt that this exhibition could have been organised much more efficiently to pulse visitors through the area.  To be honest it struck me that the British Museum were trying to put as many people through the space purely for financial reasons.  It left a bitter taste in my mouth and I won't be going back for a long time."
"Written March 14, 2014",Viking Exhibition,"The wonderful Viking artifacts deserved so much better than the way the the British Museum organizers displayed this exhibition. Complete Chaos due to the overcrowding and poorly laid out exhibit cases and information signs. These signs should have been positioned at eye level. The organizers should be made to write out a thousand lines  "" I must try harder ""  All in all it would have been far easier rowing across the North sea with a Viking Long boat crew than trying to sail through this poorly laid out and  managed exhibition.Odin would not be pleased."
"Written March 14, 2014",Vikings exhibition,"A truly awful experience, the worst I have ever had in a museum or exhibition. A very long way from the Vikings in 1980 or Tutankhamen in the early 1970s. Poorly designed as an exhibition, causing excessive overcrowding, claustrophobia and immense frustration. It took us 25 minutes to see the first exhibit. Without the audio-guide we would have seen even less. The staff on hand did nothing to relieve the situation. And all this with timed tickets!"
"Written March 13, 2014",VIKINGS - yet another badly curated BM exhibition,"Great artefacts, rubbish display.  I complained about the presentation of the last blockbuster (Herculaneum and Pompeii) - too crowded, and very badly captioned. I got a very pompuis response which basically said 'get lost, we know what we are doing'.  Well you don't chums, and you have repeated the error with The Vikings.  The problem is simple:  captions at waist level in very small point size which only one or two people at a time can read, and at that, they have to bend down to read them.   This means other people can't see into the display cases, and an unholy scrum results.   And The Vikings starts off with a series of displays where this crowding is at its worse.  The answer: simples!!  Additional eye-level captions, and multiple captions per display case - there's plenty of space to do this in this exhibition.   And do some wandering about and see how the punters are actually getting around the exhibition.  And don't be so dashed pompous 'we know best' - because you assuredly don't.  And this is a great pity, because the artefacts in this show are very interesting, and the story reasonably well told.  I was left mystified at the end, however, with a dialect voice explaining the building of the longboats (at least I think that's what it was all about) - but no explanation of what the dialect was (? Shetland) and why it was being used.  Brits and foregners alike stood around loooking confused......"
"Written March 13, 2014",British Museum,Vikings great disappointment. Labels are at knee height but of more than 100 visitors only 3 were in wheel chairs. Labels should be at eye height. Delays in trying to read them resulted in huge blockage at the beginning. Advice - only book for a v early visit.
"Written March 12, 2014",Too many people,"Overall the British Museum is a great place to visit with many extraordinary exhibits but please don't cram so many people in to the special exhibitions. I unfortunately I visited The Viking Exhibition at the weekend and the queues are long, by the nature of the exhibition many of the early artifacts are small and require a closer inspection. This meant many heads peering in to get a look. This was not helped by there being exhibition cabinets on both sides of the room, therefore not giving a clear path to follow. If you left the queue to look at a cabinet the other side it looked as though you were pushing in to get back in position. Also the labelling was not always clear as to which exhibit it was explaining. None of the items had numbers next to them, and not all were described seperately and so you didn't always know which was which. This wasn't helped by the writing often being at the begining of the cabinet, and there was no posibility of stepping back to reread it after you'd got to the item due to the number of people. The exhibits were of a high standard and very interesting but it was not set out for the number of people present. This may just have been my bad luck on the day, but it made a good exhibition average."
"Written March 10, 2014",A Truly Awful Day,"We paid to see the Vikings exhibit. There are timed tickets so we assumed that they would be able to manage the flow of people going in and out to make it reasonable for people to be able to view the exhibits. We experienced the following issues which impacted our enjoyment of the day:1- Members are allowed in at any time - as this was the first weekend of the show - there were many when we were there making the gallery overly crowded.2- People who get the audio guide (we were discouraged from getting one by the ticket taker as it was ""so busy"") simply stand in front of the exhibit cases (some very small) until the audio guide finishes without any consideration for the hundreds of other people wanting to view the exhibit. Some of the audio presentations go on for several minutes. This means that one person is monopolising the space for up to 5 minutes whilst everyone else tried to peak around them. I am not sure if they are clueless or just extremely selfish but I am afraid this is what happens. We were recently on holiday & went to an exhibit where there was ""standing space"" at the front and ""channels"" for people to move freely behind as they went along - greatly improving the ease of movement for people. I think the museum should really adopt this approach for crowded galleries to improve the flow of people. We have decided that no matter how spectacular the subject matter, it is extremely unlikely we will go to another show here. They are just not worth the frustration and disappointment."
"Written March 9, 2014",The Vikings,"Unless you enjoy queuing for an extremely long time to no avail, don't bother going to th British Museum to see this exhibition, where a timed ticket means nothing and, like us, requesting a refund in order to not waste any more time is far more preferable."
"Written March 8, 2014",An absolute must visit - When in London,"We visited particularly to explore the Australian Indigenous Exhibition curated by a friend Gaye Sculthorpe and it was great.  Well laid out, easy to follow and most interesting and informative.  An exhibition to be proud of.  That of course led us to further exploration, particularly of the Enlightenment Gallery, which I had not seen before.  This gallery is amazing - one of the best I have ever been in and well worth a long and extended visit."
"Written July 27, 2015",One of the best archaeological collections I have seen,This is an amazing museum with some world famous pieces. I especially enjoyed the ancient Egypt section.

Or, enter, turn right and see the greatest wunderkammer in the world, a multi-room exhibition called Enlightenment, which uses the museum's treasures to show how British collectors during the age of enlightenment developed a curiosity for the world, established collections, and endowed the museum.  The Enlightenment Gallery is divided into seven sections that explore the seven major new disciplines of the age: Religion and ritual, Trade and discovery, the birth of archaeology, Art history, Classification, the decipherment of ancient scripts and Natural history.Upstairs, don't miss all the amazing stuff that has been dug up out of the ground in England, the fabulous hordes like the one from Sutton Hoo that have so intrigued us about archaic civilizations.  Or the amazing Royal Tomb of Ur, dug in the 1920s by the British Museum and the Penn Museum (in Philadelphia) of Archeology.  Wonderful wonderful stuff, you can't see it all no matter how many times you visit."
"Written June 21, 2015",Do your history homework before you show up,"This museum covers so much history that you literally should have a plan in hand before you get there. We visited with 4 couples, and those who weren't prepared came away overwhelmed. There are so many cultures and historical eras represented, it's almost impossible to know where to start. I worked off of a Top 20 list (with room numbers!) that I had compiled a month before, and even then I had trouble tracking down some of the more famous finds; everything is displayed the same way.Plan ahead to allow all in your party's get the most out of the visit - and split up if your tastes vary!"
"Written June 21, 2015",The Best!,"You must see the Rosetta Stone, and the Easter Island statue, and too much to mention. Hard to find a good place to eat around the museum so I would suggest eating before you go. Tours available as well. You can see special things if you bring your passport and know what you are looking for. I wanted to see one of Redon's paintings- The Spider. I took my passport to the counter and a woman led me to a room where they let visitors see special things that are not on public view. It was really cool. They take your passport, and then they bring the painting out with gloves on and set it about two feet from your face. You then sit in a chair and stare at it....really cool!!"

The collections are just breathtaking. I could easily have spent an entire week there. My advice would be to get a guide book on arrival, sit down and have a cup of coffee in the  court cafe and spend half an hour planning your tour. You just wont have time to visit everything so be selective. I checked the website after i visited the museum which was an error as there is a useful facility to allow you to plan your visit on-line - www.britishmuseum.org. The architecture of the building is also worthy of note. I particularly like the glass roof!"
"Written February 8, 2015","Charge for entry and pay more to staff, who know what's going on.","At the subsidiary entrance in Montague Street, there was a list of timed activities, with the instruction to go to the ticket desk for tickets and locations.  At the ticket desk, the woman said there was no such thing and she had no such tickets.Feedback.  Either train the staff or pull down out of date notices.There were large numbers of people just loitering and having conversations in closed circles (none of them looking at exhibits).If you charged for entry, you'd be able to pay enough to get staff who knew what was going on in the museum.  And the museum would be used less like a last choice loitering/getting out of the rain place for people who've got nothing better to do.A museum's job is more than providing free lavatories and a cheap caff for everyone, who passes by.  There are plenty of eateries in the area, so there is no need for the museum to compete with them."

After 25 mins gave up and skipped the lot to go and see the ship.  That was better.  The whole experience was shoddy.  We are pensioners and paid 36 pounds to see this. Money aside what a let down.

"Written March 20, 2014",The Vikings are too crowded,"I am an archaeology buff. As a great BM fan I hate to mark it average….almost everything it does is just outstanding but the presentation of this exhibition is not good. My wife and I have seen Viking sites, artefacts and boats in Denmark, in Orkney, Dublin, York and other places so we were really looking forward to this.This exhibition has almost everything you would want to see to understand the Viking culture. It is wonderfully curated. For us the whole experience was downgraded by two factors.First. There are simply too many people there. The points about the entry clog up made in other blogs matched our experience. Second, the signage is very poor. I can understand why it needs to be a hip height for children and for those in wheelchairs, but why oh why isn't it repeated in larger print above our heads?I e-mailed the BM this morning (we visited yesterday) and was amazed to receive a rather sympathetic reply within three hours. Reading between the lines of what they said, I think they know that they have got something very wrong here…They would be better to publicly own up, close down for two days, and re-arrange the exhibition - at least the first rooms. Or at least the signage. Great pity because again, I emphasise that the contents of this exhibition and the way they tell the story are - as you would expect from the BM -  first class."
"Written March 20, 2014",Vikings,"Like many of the other reviewers we were very disappointed by this exhibition because of the problems caused by the poor layout of the exhibits and the overcrowding. Friends warned us they had had a bad experience with crowds but as they'd gone on a Sunday soon after the exhibition opened we thought a Wednesday afternoon booking would be ok. Unfortunately not. Arrived there on the dot and found ourselves in a huge queue moving at snail's pace. People with headphones doing the audio tour all moved at the same pace and made everything worse. We couldn't cope--too claustrophobic and couldn't see the exhibits--so, with difficulty, pushed through to the end. The boat was wonderful but we missed out on seeing lots of things. Ridiculous layout--no sign of common sense at all. Packing in as many people as possible. A relief to get out. We sat down to have coffee and opened Private Eye to find a cartoon about the queues for the Vikings ('Thor legs') so there's obviously a lot of discussion about this but nothing at all being done to remedy the situation. An enormous pity as will put people off future exhibitions. How can they have got it so wrong?!"
"Written March 19, 2014",Far too busy - overhyped,"This exhibition was ruined for us by the crowd.  Like other visitors, we skipped the first few rooms because of the number of people crowding around the small displays.  The first three rooms were far too small relative to the number of people being allowed in every ten minutes, resulting in a bottleneck.When we got into the main room there was a bit more room to move around, but I felt that I had missed out on the build up to the Viking ship.  Whilst the scale of this was certainly impressive, I don't think this justified the high entrance fee.  Some of the other artefacts were interesting but the exhibition didn't totally hang together for me - it felt quite sparse.This is the second time in 3 months we've visited paid for exhibitions at the British Museum, only to have the experience marred by the sheer number of people allowed into the rooms at any one time.  As a result of our previous experience (on a Sunday) we deliberately took a half day off work on a Monday in the hopes it would be quieter.  If anything, it was even busier.I won't be rushing back to pay for another exhibition anytime soon."
"Written March 18, 2014",Disappointing Viking Exhibition...,"Terribly disappointed in this exhibition! They let way too many people in, the space was too small and claustrophobic, we were unable to see any of the artefacts, our children saw even less and we were not told that there was an audio tour option. Ended up getting a refund!"
"Written January 24, 2014","Why British?It should be called ""Greek museum"" !","The biggest part of the museum is covered with the Greek Sculptures.They are really beautiful,though the ""Akropolis museum"" in Athens -were they belong- is much better and newer.I also liked the egyptian exhibits,they seemed so interesting!!I didn't see anything that was british.Everything was stolen from other countries.So,why is it caled ""British museum""?The admission is free for everyone.Most museums in London are free so eveybody can visit them!"
"Written October 16, 2013","So much to see, plus they have free WiFi","My goal was to go see the Egyptian collection, which includes several mummies. I was not disappointed, and I found there was a lot more to see than I had time for.I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had free WiFi available."
"Written September 10, 2013",Rude cloakroom staff,"Having visited the excellent Pompeii & Herculaneum exhibition in April, I travelled from Glasgow with a group of 36 pupils yesterday to visit it.  Since the sign said we had to leave our baggage at the cloakroom, we attempted to do this.  When we arrived there, the male attendant was extremely rude, aggressive and unhelpful.  The message he was giving (that they could not accommodate so many of us) was fair enough, but he was extremely unpleasant in his delivery of this message.  When I asked if he could suggest an alternative for us, he said ""go to a train station!"" This was not possible with 15 minutes until our time slot for the exhibition. I asked for the man's name so that I could complain, but was told they do not give out names.  The staff at the entrance of the exhibition were extremely helpful and accommodating and allowed us to take our bags in."
"Written September 8, 2013","amazing museum, rude and distracting visitors","first off the main reason my girlfriend and i visited the museum was to visit the Life and Death of Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibit but we spent most of the day here so will review in two halves.The museum itself - The museum itself is amazing, the items on display are stunning to see, everything from the rosetta stone to the elgin marbles, to egyptian sarcophagi and roman frescoes, infact thee is so much to see id say you need more than a day. the fact that it is free to enter is still amazing and although donations are welcomed theyre not expected. like most tourist sites, especially somewhere like london, its advisable to get there early, in fact the earlier the better as im sure the crowds are less and you can actually get close to the exhibits with no one in front of you. you can pick up a map which helps but it only shows the theme and no listing of the actual items on display, but you can get listings for that from the museum shop.The life and death of pompeii and herculaneum exhibition - after visiting both pompeii and herculaneum last year, being a big fan of mary beard and her tv shows both my girlfriend and i were very excited to see this, especially as there are a number of items which have never been shown outside of italy before. although we had planned visiting earlier in the year work commitments meant we were unable to get down to london until september and when we came to book tickets for the exhibition the museum didnt have any for the dates we were in london so we booked through an external ticket website. the only tickets available were for an 11:50 or a 13:50 entrance so went for the 13:50. im not sure if it was because the exhibition is in its last month or that we went in the afternoon and there was lots of people from earlier entrances still there but it was packed. Im amazed that they were letting people in every 10 minutes, id of thought it would be better allowing 30-35 people in every 30 minutes as that would mean less crowding. The rudeness of some people (especially it seems the older generation surprisingly - the WI types, and also it seems that visitors from certain european countries have no manners either) amazes me, both myself and my girlfriend experienced people literally shoving in front of us (at one point one visitor had been doing this to me so much i actually told her what i thought of her), both had our feet stood on and walked into and although it clearly states that pictures are not to be taken i saw plenty of people doing so. the exhibition is great and exhibits themselves stunning and im sure everyone who is interested in the story of these two towns or roman history and has been lucky enough to visit them and this exhibition is thankful to the curator Paul Roberts for the hardwork he has done in pulling this off.for anyone thinking of visiting the museum go early, and those thinking of visiting the exhibition again try to go early but prepare to be jostled about but rude people who have no desire to actually study the exhibits but merely want to be able to say ""ive seen it"" so i would say wear steel toe capped boots and maybe use an offensive perfume or aftershave to make people steer clear of you and give you space"
"Written May 12, 2013",Need eyes in my belly button!,"Life and Death in Pompeii and HerculaneumA really wonderful exhibition somewhat spoiled by two things, the first difficult to change, the second quite simple.1. Far too crowded -- yes I know that the more people who are let in the fuller the Museum's coffers, but the numbers they let in at one time half spoils the pleasure of seeing (or struggling to see) the exhibits. It feels exploitative to find that after paying an entrance fee of a good amount of money and booking a time weeks in advance you are jammed in almost as tightly as in a rush-hour tube.2. Do curators ever think of what it's like trying to read exhibit labels that are at waist height in a crowded room? Even if your eyes were at waist level you'd not be able to read much with two to three rows of people between you and the label. I'm sure it's all very lovely when there are only three or four curators in a room admiring the aesthetics of the display's layout, but when there are 300 or so people trying to look at things it's appalling. Why, oh why, can't  labels be mounted above the exhibits? If they were 6 feet or so above the floor and in a reasonably large font people would be able to read them without bending low and peering around other people's bums."
"Written April 20, 2013",They don't like bag ladies,"I truly wish I could tell you about the treasures in the British Museum. I haven't been there in about 35 years, so was very much looking forward to visiting. But I made a terrible mistake: I turned up with an overnight bag on wheels which I wasn't allowed to wheel because of health & safety regulations. With an injured arm, carrying was not an option, so left luggage was suggested. But my tiny bag weighed 0.5kg too much so they would accept it. Given all it had in it was a MacBook Air, a pair of jeans, some toiletries and a change of underwear, it gives you some idea what a paltry weight of bag they accept. The staff were unhelpful and asked me to leave. Goodness alone knows how they expect to attract tourists who may be fitting in a last visit prior to leaving the capital. Not impressed, and I say that as someone who works with arts and cultural organisations for a living, so knows how right others get customer services. "
"Written April 7, 2013",Pompeii exhibition,"The exhibits deserve more than one star - they were superb - but the experience was horrible. There were far, far too many people allowed inside. To make it worse, much of the signage was in a small font and about 3 feet off the ground making it very difficult to read."
"Written March 23, 2013",Several visits over a number of days,"The British Museum is incredible.  It is so vast and has such an extensive collection of all types of things from prehistoric times to the present day.  Since there is no admission charge (they request a donation) it is best to visit for a couple of hours over a period of days.  That way you do not experience ""museum burnout."" It would be difficult to list all of the highlights, but some of the ""must sees"" are the Rosetta Stone. the Elgin Marbles, the Sutton Hoo hoard and the priceless collection of Chinese pottery in room 95.It can get quite crowded.  You may want to consider going first thing in the morning when they open or on Friday evening when they are open late.  This is a definite ""must"" when you are in London."
"Written September 27, 2012",Fantastic.,"Truly a wonderful museum - this is what museums around the world should aspire to be like. The layout - information given - artifacts are second to none. I went mainly to visit the Egyptian artifacts and honestly, for information, the British Museum is better than Cairo's. It's all catalogued and just done properly... and best of all it's FREE. Go and enjoy it - 99% of you won't be disappointed!! I spent most of the day there and I'll defo be going back!!"
"Written December 13, 2011",The whole world collected under one roof.,"I absolutely loved it. It has large collection from the whole world, you can walk through the exhibition rooms and have a feeling you are travelling in time.  One moment you are in ancient Egypt with mummies and old sculptures from Thebes and next one you are walking through the streets of Rome. It is great way how to spend a day, but you might need more than a day to see everything, and to be very honest, at the very end I could not pay more attention, rooms started to look the same labyrinth like. I could see myself going there often if I lived in London, but when visiting there are so much more to see of London, than just the museum.It is defiantly worth seeing and visiting, plus it is for free as many museums in London. But you will be overwhelmed by the size of exhibitions, so don’t worry I you don’t see all of it.I really liked the round middle part if the building, which gives the old building somewhat of modern twist."
"Written July 30, 2011",Plan ahead to see the 'wow' exhibits,"Having not been to this museum for several years and never before with children, I had forgotten how spread out it all is. It is not aimed specifically to interest young children, however there is plenty there to fascinate a reasonably bright child who has an interest in history. The Egyptian Mummies are still a crowd puller, as are the Rosetta Stone and 20 foot tall totems, but there are also many other rooms which link into the British school history curriculum, for example the Mexican displays, African and Islamic artworks and Celtic torcs. We spent two hours there on this visit which was enough history in one day but only saw a few of the rooms - you would need several visits to appreciate all the galleries. A quick visit to the British Museum website prior to going was invaluable for locating the exhibits we wanted to see and the printable floor plan was much cheaper than the £2 ones for sale in the entrance hall. Overall a good (and free) afternoon out for the school holidays with far less crowds than the Natural History and Science Museums."
"Written June 8, 2011",Great museum with fascinating exhibits. A must see in London!,"The British Museum is a must when in London. Do yourself a service and put it on your itinerary. The museum houses artifacts from three of the greatest civilizations in history: Egypt (Rosetta Stone), Assyria (Lion Hunt Panels) and Greece (Elgin Marbles) and much, much more. What is even more astounding about this museum is that it is FREE! My favorite part of the museum was the display of Egyptian mummies. Earlier in the week I visited the Louvre in Paris, which also had lots of Egyptian artifacts; however the British museum has a greater display of mummies. There were mummies in sarcophaguses, mummies in wraps, mummies unwrapped, unintentional mummies - bottom line: Lots of mummies. Kids also seem to really like this exhibit. They were all over the place (esp. since we visited during a school holiday) Tip: arrive early to avoid the crowds.Also the Sutton Hoo burial treasure is also in the museum. I must see for a medieval nerd such as myself.Rick Steves' has a great audio tour of this museum. If you have an android/iphone you can download his app with the tour for free. Just pop in your headphones and you have a personal tour of the museum! We especially enjoyed it because he points out the ""must sees"" of the museum in about 45 min which then allows you the peace of mind to explore the museum at your own leisure, knowing that you won’t run out of time and miss something essential (The place is enormous and you can easily spend a whole day here!)The courtyard outside is a nice place to have lunch. We picked up a sandwich at a local Sainsbury's and had a little picnic. Also the pubs across the street are a nice place to drop in for a drink after you visit the museum. To round out your visit, consider taking the Tube about 2 stops north to visit the British Library. It is also free but doesn’t take nearly as much time to tour."
"Written February 10, 2010",Worth a week,"Don't think you are going to get away with just one day in this fabulous place!  The architecture is stunning, the exhibits exhaustive and the information fascinating.  If you have an information junkie for a child (as I do) they will be in seventh heaven.  Be prepared for lots of walking and excitement.  Cameras were allowed in all the exhibits we visited which is good because we came a long way to see and the memories are very special to us.  The souvenir shop was pricey (but what do you expect?)  We brought a packed lunch which was a very good idea.  We saw the copy of the Rosetta stone, the original was 'downstairs' so I guess it's worth asking about the things you really want to see at the start of the day as the museum is vast and you could easily miss things.  We saw amazing artworks from all over the world and all throughout history.  This day was one of the highlights of our trip and I would love to do it again."
"Written December 3, 2008",Fantastic Musuem,"First - be warned - you will NEVER get round the musuem in a morning, or probably even a day as you will be completely worn out and unable to appreciate anything after about 3 or 4 hours at the most. People who get round the 'whole' place in less than this time clearly do not appreciate the depth of the collections on display.The highlight for most people is the Rosetta Stone - amazing to be able to see it up close. The Egyptian collection is also fabulous but the highlight for me is the Elgin Marbles, having studied them in Classics at university.The exhibitions here are also worth a visit if you can book well enough in advance or are prepared to get there early. I went with a friend to the Terracotta Army exhibition which was superb and well worth getting up at 5am for (well, in my opinion anyway!).No visit to London is complete without some time spent at the British Museum. Choose your favourite sections and spend your time in them, rather than trying to rush around and see everything."
"Written August 7, 2008",Wow!,"Wow!  What a great museum!  I think that there are more things to see here than a person could get through in a week.  My family loved this Keep in mind that my family consists of 2 parents, and 3 children (2 teens and a 7-year-old), and you have to be impressed that this mueum could hold all of our interests.Hoa Hakananai'a, the Easter Island moai, was one of the high points of the visit for me. The Rosetta Stone is absolutely awe-inspiring.  The Egyptian, Roman, and Greek displays are totally thrilling.  The English historical artifacts are just plain amazing.  You get the picture - the displays are wonderful.  The down side of our visit was that we found that we had to pick and choose which displays we could spend our time visiting, as we lacked sufficient time to explore the entire facility.  You really should go there if you're visiting London.  We spent a little extra (25 GBP or $50.00 CDN) to go through the Hadrian exhibit.  We were expecting more insight into the man and his time (beyond what we've seen and read previously) and, in my opinion, it would have been nice to have had some more dramatic settings for some of the displays.  Nonetheless, we're glad we toured the exhibit and feel that it was worth the additional expense.  One of our children (the 16 year old) even thought it was more impressive than 'King Tut and the Golden Age of the Pharoahs' at the O2."
"Written August 5, 2008",Fanastic Time at the British Museum,"I visited the British Museum in July 2008. I happened to go on a very rainy day in early July and the place was jammed with tourists and school children. The museum is so large that seeing everything in one day is impossible. I spent several hours and only saw a few exhibits. Best suggestion is to get a map, plan what you definately want to see and head there first. The crowds around the Rosetta stone are insane and it make take a few minutes for you to get a picture. Also, the crowds were heavist in the Egypt exhibit. The pieces shown were stunning and definately worth seeing. I tried to have lunch there, but there isn't much in the way of places to eat. There are two food counters on the main floor with some seating, that got filled up quickly. There also was a sit down restaurant, but not great for someone that wants a quick and inexpensive bite. I took one of the free guided tours of specific exhibits and went on the one for ancient Greece. The tour had around 15 people and looked at pot making and statues in Greece. It was a very informative tour, you could ask questions and was free. These tours were held all day in various halls and if you didn't want to pay for the museum highlights tour, these smaller tours are an alternative. The gift shop there was also great. If you are a history buff, there were tonnes of books on Egypt, Roman Britan, Greece etc. Overall, I had a fanastic time at the museum. It was one of the highlights of my trip."
"Written October 24, 2007",One of a kind,"Truly a great collection of artifacts that have been taken from all over the world. The main downside is that the place is so massive - you could easily spend all day in here if you wanted to go through everything. As with many other museums, admission is free.For time management I suggest you decide what collections you want to see and check those out first. I found the Egyptian (mummies) and Greek exhibits especially amazing, but maybe just because they were larger in general. There are special exhibits that they rotate through the central area and you need to buy these tickets in advance if you want to go. Be sure to check the website if you are a big history buff or like this sort of thing.There are low cost places to eat (cafeteria style) in the central area and slightly more upscale establishments (cafe and restaurant) on the upper two levels. The cafe food was decent with reasonable prices."
"Written April 10, 2007",INCREDIBLE,The British Museum is absolutely incredible.  One can't help but to be totally awestruck by the vastness of this museum.  The exhibits are wonderful and allow you to actually feel as if you are part of the period represented.  Without a doubt this is the finest museum on the planet.
"Written October 18, 2023",Not Very British.,"Don't bother going here to learn anything about Britain and its history, There wasn't a single British thing on display. It's just a whole bunch of random stuff that was liberated from other countries and cultures. It only served to reinforce the view that being British is not something to proud of. The only thing British was the massive Queue to get in."

"Written August 28, 2020",Bringing together cultures of the world,"Hooray - the British Museum has re-opened its ground floor galleries, shop and cafe.  When you visit, you wonder why it ever had to close given the scale of the spaces and the ease of social distancing, especially with face-masks.   It is much safer than going to the supermarket. It might be called a museum, but it is really a place for us to explore and appreciate the different cultures of the world, all the more relevant at the moment when travel is seriously curtailed.  This perhaps is the Museum's USP and one that will increase as other galleries on other floors open up over the next few months, There is a one-way system, but it falls apart with an entrance which is relatively hidden to the Americans and Mexico, so it pays to study the map in the Great Court before you go on your exploration or you may miss something. One of the great successes of the Museum is the connection between ancient antiquities and modern/contemporary art, which is seen in the African gallery and also in the two installations by Gregson Perry and Edmund de Waal, excellent ways of bringing the historic collection into the 21st century.  Grayson Perry celebrates the creativity of unknown craftsmen through the centuries with his ship sailing into the afterlife, carved with replicas of objects in the Museum, placed in front of the Nereid Monument while, in the space of the former British Museum Library, Edmund de Waal reflects on libraries lost through the ages, often through war or religious or political vandalism, and on what it means to be in exile, with 20,000 books from authors all around the world, framed by four vitrines with perfectly-placed ceramics of his own, along with pieces of marble and steel.When the exhibition closes, the books will be donated to the new library in Mosul, rising out of its total destruction a few years ago. Now we need other floors in the Museum to open up so we can explore other parts of the world.... More exhibitions are promised at the end of September."

Once in the building, it is a wonderful site and I was not disappointed as we quickly found the Egyptian exhibit. Next time in London I will have to make time to go through the entire museum."

We didn't leave until 4:30PM - exhausted but worth every minute.  It got rough duing day with so many school classes/kids.  Cafe food was very good coffee/sandwiches.  There is a fancy upstairs restaurant but it didn't open until later in day but looked very nice.  If you like museums, don't miss this one."
"Written November 12, 2019",learned quite a bit,"went on a Friday evening, as they close late on Fridays. saw the Rosetta stone. Egyptian antiquities collection was impressive. Museum has free admissions so we made sure we purchased some things from their gift shop."
"Written November 10, 2019",Great day out,Really enjoyed the museum very educational my son loved it. The Egyptian mummy’s being his favourite part.
"Written November 7, 2019",Amazing place,"There is no much to say about the British Museum. Missing to visit it while in London, it's a real shame! "
"Written November 7, 2019",Overwhelmed ,So much to see and not enough hours in a day. Good place for all to go. Give yourselves lots of time.
"Written November 7, 2019",Good museum with great variety of history and culture!,Did I mention that it is free?! This was a no-brainer as I love museums. They are obviously making a lot of money from the gift shop because it’s huge. 
"Written November 7, 2019",So much to see!,"We visited the British Museum for the sole purpose of seeing their Ancient Egypt collection, but couldn't help walking through Ancient Rome, China, and even Mesopotamia as well. The sheer amount of artifacts on display is astounding; it would be impossible to explore even one level of the museum in less than a year!It was a little crowded, and finding a bench to rest on for a moment was a bit of a struggle, but otherwise our visit was amazingly educational and fun. We still can't believe all that was available for free! They do ask for a donation of five pounds, which is very little for the worth a visit to the museum provides.Definitely take a look around the museum when you are in the area; if you are interested in history we would recommend skipping other museums just to spend more time in this wonderful place."
"Written January 25, 2020",Fascinating collections from around the world.,recommend visiting a pre-opening highlights tour (30 pounds) or joining a tour during the day (free) . Egyptian mummies are amazing. 
"Written January 24, 2020",Keep going back,"Every visit, no- twice every visit. The more I know these precious exhibits the more I want to see them and treat them like old friends. It is an education. The audio guide is superb."
"Written January 21, 2020",Must see for all curious minds,"Amazing tour of the Sumerian civilization, and incredible insights into so many ancient cultures. This museum is a must see!"
"Written January 20, 2020",Wonderful Worlds ,This museum stands on 260 years of collection history and contains centuries of objects.  Explore its many interesting displays.  Written descriptions are well done.
"Written January 17, 2020",Mesmerizing,"If you are into archaeology and history, this is a must!!!!! Yes, some people get upset about some of the pieces being out of their country of origin, but the collection is amazing and the conservation is impeccable. If you have little time in Lo din, make sure this is one place on your list."
"Written January 14, 2020",Amazing,We loved the British Museum and the architecture was totally unexpected and wonderful to behold.A great place to visit anytime of the year
"Written January 13, 2020",Could easily spend a week here.,It’s free and a wonderful experience. You could spend days on each floor. Easy to get to via Underground. I want to go again when I have more time. 
"Written January 8, 2020",Stunning display of artefacts,"The sheer number of historical and ancient artefacts here at the British Museum is astonishing, each individual item gives you glimpses into the history and culture of countries around the world. But together they also showcase the true profits and benefits that unbridled 18th and 19th century British colonialism* can offer. The fact that these artefacts, violently acquired** from around the world, still remain on British soil is really something else. I am really grateful and appreciative for the chance to see all of these items, as long as I ignore the gnawing moral and ethical guilt I feel as I peer through the glass at the items tainted by the blood of their acquisition. *(the control, occupation, settlement and exploitation of another country, or in the case of the British Empire, many, many countries)** Read: Stolen"
"Written January 7, 2020",A most wonderful museum,"An almost limitless display of some of the world’s most important and impressive pieces, especially those dating from medieval and antiquities. A place to return to countless times. "
"Written January 6, 2020",Superb,"All free , amazing collection u walk through history , south asia, eighteenth century europe and new themes all amazing . You need a few days to really go through it but for a toursit a few hours work ok."
"Written January 6, 2020",Gain great knowledge,A wide collection of artefacts in the British Museum which is well preserved. Learn about a wide variety of civilisation and cultures. One of the most interesting places to visit in the UK for history lovers.  I would spend hours there.
"Written January 4, 2020",History,It’s one thing to learn about ancient history in school and quite another to see its artifacts in person. Awe inspiring . . .And there are so many other photos I didn’t have room to put here-

"Written December 30, 2019",Excellent exhibitions ,"The Troyan exhibition is outstanding in all aspects: Information, exhibits, pictures, archeology, art, etc. The drawings exhibition was very good, especially the works of Kate Kolwitch. The Islamic influence on western art is less embracive. The shop and food are very good. The museum has many more interesting unique exhibits, so one needs to dedivate a few days to see it all... "
"Written December 29, 2019","Very interesting,very tiring",On of the best museums ever but also very tiring if you are accompanied by children. Also really small café....
"Written December 29, 2019",Wondwrful,"Had a wonderful visit here, so much to see and do.  Large crowds and there are cafes to get a bite to eat."
"Written December 29, 2019",Return visit to one of the World's most famous museums,"I've visited London six times and ensured that each itinerary includes the British Museum, which is one of the world's most renowned institutions . Its collection of artifacts from civilisations across antiquity is  superb and a visitor can become immersed in ages past. The BM was the first public national museum in the world being established in 1753. Entry to the BM is free but do collect a map /floorplan (you will need it) and leave a suitable donation. The ground floor has a range of sculptures, artifacts and other objects from Ancient Greece, Rome, the Middle East and some Egyptian items. The upper floors have medieval Europe, Roman Britain and more Middle Eastern items. The BM has a large collection of Ancient Egyptian mummies and of course the famous Elgin Marbles from the Greek Acropolis. There are various cafes at the BM but if you just want a snack and a drink, then there are various options in the Great Court in the centre of the BM. This is a very busy museum with tour groups and school groups coming through during the week so its best to be early during peak times but less so off-season."
"Written December 28, 2019",Visit ,"It's a great place for people who are I interested in history for others it's like a car boot sale, lots of stuff with an odd highlight It would be a great improvement if the top highlights were detailed on a guide for the general visitor Queuing process in place through security to enter but very quick and well organised"
"Written December 25, 2019",Very impressive!,"We were only in here for 1 hour due to a time crunch during our time in London.  However, we did the free Rick Steves Podcast Audio Tour, and it was perfect for some highlights.  I can imagine that I could spend a TON more time in there, even not being a museum person."
"Written December 25, 2019","Why I did not donate to the British Museum, and why I will not visit it again","On my latest visit to the UK, I had on my wish list to visit the British Museum, which I did. Although it was not my first visit, I was yet once again impressed by its lavish and impressive exhibits. The range of cultures and nations represented is incredible, and that of artifacts is staggering. Dedicated to HRH, Queen Elizabeth II, it lives up to the standard befitting royalty. 	However, there was something wrong, something was missing. There was no mention of or representation of Judaism or the Jewish people. Judaism, the bedrock of Western civilization, the origin of Christianity, by the standards of the British museum is--insignificant: not significant enough to receive a token of recognition for its role in the world history, or of the innumerous contribution of my people then and now to humankind.	It is an insult to my people's history and heritage, and to me, the daughter of the Jewish people. Politics and personal opinion aside, there is a place for the Jewish people and nation among the peoples of the world. I wish, request, and expect for this wrong to be rectified. That is why I did not donate to the British Museum, nor will I revisit it, until this absurdity is remedied.	I would like to see more of my peers do the same.Kind RegardsEvelyn MayesEvy.mayes57@gmail.com"
"Written December 23, 2019",If you’re looking for a quick visit ...,"If you’re looking for a quick visit, look online to see what will peak your interest most and it’s location, so that you can see it first. The museum, which opened in 1753, was the world’s first national public museum. It is so large and filled with so many things, that it would take several days to properly appreciate everything they have. If you want to see the Moai from Easter Island or the Rosetta Stone, or the very large Egyptian items, they are all on the first floor. Impressive and impactful, these areas are very busy. If Egypt is especially important to you, there’s the Petrie museum, located in University College London, a small but beautiful museum with lots of great things to see. It’s also only a short walk from the British museum. "
"Written December 23, 2019",A Must See,"If you are at all interested in history or culture The British Museum is a must visit when in London. There are so many treasures and artifacts here. Will it be crowded? Probably but don’t let that stop you. This museum is worth the time you spend there. Also, since it is a free museum you can choose to see only the big items (like the Rosetta Stone) or you can take your time and go through the whole place. Either way it is time well spent."
"Written December 23, 2019",One of my favorite stops in London,"This is such a pleasure to visit. I must confess that if only to see the Egyptian section it merits the visit. The Museum can be overwhelming, so pick your section carefully to avoid being overwhelmed. There is much to see for all ages and tastes."
"Written December 23, 2019",Perfect outing for the family,"If you’re fascinated with history, this will be the place...The museum is massive and you could take all day to immerse yourself with artifacts and collection of antiquities.You must spend at least a full day to truly enjoy and absorb all the various areas in the museum."
"Written December 23, 2019",A Great Experience,A must see in London. There is so much to  view here that you probably need to spread it over a few days. 
"Written December 22, 2019",Among the World’s best but not for Celiacs,"This museum must be one of the best if not THE best broad spectrum institution in the world.   It’s artefacts, styles of presentation and it’s ability to provide historical and contextual interpretation is second to none.Having said that the governors need to consider catering arrangements for a small but significant sector of the population who suffer from Celiac Disease.   No where among the pastries, salads and snacks on offer on the ground floor was there anything apart from the outrageously priced mineral water was gluten free.    In the level three restaurant the maitre d’ politely told me that although the food could be modified to meet a broadly gluten free description they could not guarantee that it was indeed gluten free.   It is clear that little or no thought has been given to this quite serious matter - Celiac Disease can be distressing and very unpleasant.  Effectively the BM is saying to gluten intolerant visitors from far afield that it has no interest in your attendance unless you bring your own food.  The museum could demand a lengthy visit particularly for those engaged in academic work but finding nourishment would require eating out and then joining the interminable queue to gain re-entry."
"Written December 21, 2019",Get lost in time,You can spend whole day here experiencing the history of mankind. I decided to Focus on Egypt this time and not to try to see everything. 
"Written December 21, 2019",Mind blowing ,"This museum owns one of the largest, if not the largest selections of antiquities anywhere in the world.  Egyptian, Persian, Assyrian, Chinese, Greek and many other ancient civilizations were represented and in abundance.  Entrance is free, but I’d recommend renting the audio guide and wearing comfortable shoes.  If you’re into antiquities and ancient civilizations this museum is a must.  By far my most favorite museum."
"Written February 12, 2020",Troy,"Well curated and displayed exhibition.Could have been stronger on the basis of the myths, and rather pricey, but nevertheless worth visiting."
"Written February 9, 2020",Troy exhibition is amazin,Visit the Troy exhibition. Very well laid out and good information and displays. Totally loved it. It's a lot to take in so give yourself at least 1.5 hrs to see it leisurely

"Written January 30, 2020","Nice, a lot of history in one place",Imprescindible museum. They have part of the history of world. from the parthenon and even the Rosetta Stone.Pay attention at the special exhibitions (maybe you have to pay some pounds for its).
"Written January 30, 2020",one of my favourite museums,"Just a great experience! the exhibitions are incredibly interesting. Loved the atmosphere.If you want to skip the queues, make sure you go bag free"

"Written December 19, 2019",Free free free ,"Once you walk in after giving a donation since the museum is free we walked around and explore part of the museum since it’s pretty big and packed. Enjoyed the Greece and Egyptian rooms along with North America and México rooms. You cannot bring with you a roller bag, saw tourists being turned away. Overall if you love history it’s a good place to visit. "
"Written December 18, 2019",Good museum,"The lobby as seen in pictures, is a great view. Worth the trip itself.The amount of items in this museum is extra ordinary.You can walk here for hours and study them.A lot to see and a lot to learn.Coffee shops are ok, and I like that there is several ones spread out. Toilets are clean and nice.And did I mention, its free :-)"
"Written December 15, 2019",So good! ,"Went here early in the morning (at 10) when it was still pretty quiet. After an hour museum got more crowded. Everything is well kept and information is great. Didn't realize this museum was so huge, can easily spend days here. "

"Written December 10, 2019",A MUST SEE,Every time I visit London I make it a point to visit this outstanding museum. Easy walking distance from Totem Court Road.
"Written December 8, 2019",Must visit museum in London,It deserves a great ‘wow’ and ‘excellent’! Go visit! It won’t disappoint you. But prepare it would take you days to review every piece of item in the museum. Suggest to spend at least few hours there if it’s your first visit!
"Written December 8, 2019",Fabulous exhibition ‘Troy’ - shame about the facilities,"It would have been 5stars but for state of the loos. It might seem petty to complain about the state of the toilets but the British Museum is one of the top sites in London if not in the country but what impression do visitors leave with if their experience is anything like mine? BM you need to try harder in providing visitors from all over the world with basic amenities. It’s not the first time I have been to a fantastic exhibition at the BM and then wandered off down dirty and grubby unswept steps to the toilets which are frankly disgusting. Blocked up with piles of used loo paper, dripping soap dispensers, the paper towels placed underneath to catch the drips were absolutely sodden and were dripping onto the floor which was also pretty disgusting. Cubicles were left empty because they were just too horrible to use. The coffee chain in my high Street can do better! The Troy exhibition is fantastic. The way the exhibits are displayed was amazing. The way the visitor was challenged to see both the beauty of the objects and reflect on the horror of war was very effective. But my last impression, well is wasn’t great..."
"Written December 8, 2019",Plan Your Time Well,"One day is never long enough to explore the British Museum. It. From the moment you enter - a day is not enough. Speed viewing will leave you feeling you missed something. We planned a full day with breaks a various exhibitions. Enjoyed the currency exhibition and Troy currently showing. The must sees - Rosetta Stone, the mummies of course personally loved the art. Situated in a good area for restaurants and public transportation."
"Written December 6, 2019","Impressive, very Impressive","Somehow over the years I hadn't managed to get to the British Museum, seems it's slightly outside the cluster.Well have made up for that now, spent hours wandering it's halls, from Korean and Chinese pottery, to meandering through the history of Egypt. There was still more to see when our legs ran out of steam...should have done 2 days.My favourite (aside from the importance of the Rosetta Stone, of course) has to be the completely pointless but completely exotic clock cum ship which meanders across the table shooting things of a quarter hour basis, you may ask why....but really it's why not.Worth a visit, educational and interesting, I'll go again one day."
"Written December 5, 2019",Impressive,The museum has an impressive atmosphere. Here you will find many precious exhibits worth seeing. Free entry. Usually there are many tourists. Bags and backpacks are security checked before entering. It is not allowed to make video recordings.
"Written October 8, 2019",So Much to See,What an enormous collection of history.  You can spend a couple of days here but you're usually wiped out after a few hours.  I recommend buying tickets online to avoid lines.  Try to go early before the tour and school trips arrive or later in the day after they leave.  I recommend taking a break halfway through.  We had audio guides but found we didn't need them because we just read the displays.  I found the Ancient Egypt exhibits to be the most interesting.

"Written October 8, 2019",Honest Review- Visiting with Kids,"So I went twice in the last year- once with my 6yr and 8month old. The second time was with just adults. I will focus this review with visiting with kids.  MOBILITY:If you have a small stroller take that! Just make sure you can fit your goodies in a good under-basket. They do have a few elevators, but it’s easier to lift if you can.FOOD: I was able to feed and give snacks at a few locations. You can go in-and out from the museum to the outer courtyard, that freedom was great. They also have a cafe area where you can stop a few times, nurse or snack. I brought my own snacks, the cafe did not have a great selection of kid friendly food. PREPARE:I wanted to see everything. It helped before visiting, to map out the different things they have. My 6yr old picked 4 things she really wanted to see- and then I told her we would do one thing I wanted, then one she wanted. Having clear expectation, and making her an important part of the planning was crucial. Taking turns in what she wanted to see was a great heaven sent idea. She had a blast, and the whole family was able to see most of it. Plan for at least 4 hours. "
"Written October 8, 2019",A must see!,The building itself is a work of art especially the lobby!! The Egyptian exhibit was amazing!!! Could have stayed all day! Next time we are in London we will go back!!!
"Written October 8, 2019",Amazing !!!!,Debating between Natural History Museum and this Museum. Was tuff. Only have time for one and I glad chose this one.Having interesting pieces of art including some better then New York Museum of Natural History. Like the Greek pavilion love it!!! Roman era and Egypt awesome. Well rewarded.
"Written October 7, 2019",Museum Must See,"If possible do take advantage of the late Friday openings, we sailed right in. Have a plan, known the “must see” items to suit your taste and see them first. Grab a museum map upon entering. The Rosetta Stone, The Lewis Chessmen, Ancient Greek artifacts and all things Egyptian are amongst the most well known and popular exhibits. A very manageable scale museum. "
"Written October 7, 2019",My favorite Museum in London,We went to the science and the history museums yesterday. This was my favorite. Not my favorite layout or entrance though.
"Written October 6, 2019",Love the British Museum!,great time spent wandering down the hallways of the British Museum -> especially love the Egypt and Rome exhibitions.best of all - its free! 
"Written October 6, 2019",maybe NONE better,Epic in a word.  If you are not wow'd you have been sleeping under a rock.  Worthy of 6 hours over 3 days.  Don't 'fire-hose' yourself.
"Written October 6, 2019","Crowds, Crowds, Crowds","The crowds on the day that we were there were almost frightening in a claustrophobic way.  We went later in the day hoping to avoid some of the guided tours, but it didn't seem to matter.  We manhandled our way to the Rosetta Stone, saw a few mummies, and then left.  There was no way to get to the Elgin Marbles unless we could have run on top of the crowds. There is also the issue that we were seeing the spoils of British Empire, and it felt as though the treasures that we were seeing should be back in their own country.   This museum is free, although a contribution is suggested.  However, at the entry point, a worker attempted to ""sell"" me a ticket to get in.  You do not have to do this.  Free is free."
"Written November 6, 2019",Great experience,When to the museum for half a day and didn't see half of the exhibits. Free entry with security check on the way in. Well worth it to explore the past.
"Written November 5, 2019",A must on a trip to London,"There are few museums like the British Museum, and it is a must on any trip to London.  Not just an few stutues from antiquities, but room after room of antiquities.  And none of them ordinary, but rather the most extraordinary.  It's an impressive and unique experience, and frankly more than one can absorb in a single visit."
"Written November 5, 2019",EXCELLENT!,"I love the British Museum. It is free and every time I go, there is just so much to see. So well laid out and just such a treasure. you can spend all day in there. "
"Written November 5, 2019",TIME CAPSULE,"Went to the British Museum and I completely and utterly enjoyed the experience.The share size of the building is amazing, even when approaching it from the outside it already gives you an idea that you are going to experience something really unique.The differnt eras are dispayed in such a way were you really get a beatiful sense of the time and place you are just after getting yourself into.It would take hours to write properly about everything that you see and witness while visiting.I would definitely advise anyone visiting London to go to the British Museum, you will not be disappointed."
"Written November 4, 2019",Superb ,Must see especially the Egyptian section. Admission is free and camera allowed. When I was there they had a themed section entry for a fee. You can rent headphones which we did for 7£ each. You can spend a good few hours there. 
"Written November 4, 2019","Huge, Beautiful","Plan on a couple of hours to see the offerings, OR plan carefully to see the few you want. Huge place! Easy to get lost!! Our picks were the Rosetta Stone (360 degree viewing access, and a good explanation of how it was translated), the Easter Island statue, and the gorgeous lobby. Looking forward to returning...already have a short list!"

"Written November 3, 2019",Spend all day,This place is incredible- I paid for a private guide to show me the “hot spots “ but they never showed ... so I bought a guide and rented an audio guide and did just fine on my own ..... it’s amazing the stuff that’s in there! (And I’m sure I didn’t even scratch the surface! I will say that one of the lifts (elevators) was not working - so if you have any difficulty walking up steps you’re in trouble .....  the bathrooms are down a couple flights of stairs and for the ladies - the lines are always long. But - I will definitely go and spend the day again!
"Written November 2, 2019",Hungary,We really enjoyed.as per my 12yrs old son it was more intresting than National History Museum. We saw an Intresting and widespread material from different ages and places.
"Written November 2, 2019",Perfection,"I definitely recommend arriving promptly just prior to the opening at 10:00 AM. The exhibits are nothing short of amazing. There is no charge for admission, but a definite expectation to donate a bit, which should not be an issue folks. 5 to 10 pounds should do nicely. For me anyway, it is a must see."
"Written December 4, 2019",It’s free! ,"For a free museum, it is pretty packed with artifacts. We loved seeing the Rosetta Stone and other exhibits. One could easily spend hours looking at everything. We visited this museum a few days after going to the Louvre, and we still had a great time exploring. The only con was that many of the larger statues didn’t have heads. Other than that, it was fabulous, and best of all, FREE! "

"Written December 3, 2019",Free and interesting,"There's quite a lot to see and the 'main' attractions can get quite crowded- it was difficult to see the Rosetta stone, for example. It's worthwhile to get a tour so you don't miss some of the key items like the Sutton Hoo viking stuff and the Easter Island head. There was no security line when we came in the morning on a Saturday. Very good for a free museum."
"Written November 30, 2019",One of The Best Stops in London,"No trip to London would be complete without a stop to the British Museum. We heeded the research and went after 3 pm. There were no lines to get in, the galleries were easily navigated and few exhibits had a wait— except the Mummies and The Rosetta Stone. The Museum offers its greatest hits if you only have 2-3 hours. We did our own list, matched it with the free guide and then spent a most wonderful afternoon of exploration. BRAVO to Great Britain and preservation of these amazing antiquities. We were wonderfully overwhelmed! THANKS. "

They are wonderful, but we found the ceramics galleries contained treasures we had not imagined. It is a challenge to find descriptions of many of the items as they are often only laminated papers located in obscure locations. The jewels are a must see here. We enjoyed them more than the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London. It took us about 5 hours and we didn't get to everything."
"Written September 19, 2019",Truly magnificent place,"An incredible museum for history lovers and for everyone really, a glorious testament to human history and to the British empire 'visiting' different places around the globe. A must see in London. "
"Written September 19, 2019",Amazing museum and waffles at terrace,"British Museum is a must in London. Rosetta stone and mummies upstairs are great. Nice restaurant upstairs, but a BIG recommend to waffles from car outside museum. Mmmmm, so gooood!"
"Written September 19, 2019",Amazing ,We loved every aspect of our visit. The treasures are beyond spectacular. We felt especially privileged to see the actual Rosetta Stone. We’re New Yorkers and have access to extraordinary museums right at home. Still - we were blown away by the extent and depth of the collections. We will definitely return!
"Written September 18, 2019",Awaken your inner archeologist!,This place is a draw each time we come. From the enlightenment room to the Rosetta Stone--we keep coming back. Don't miss seeing some of the most important artifacts in history!
"Written September 17, 2019",Overwhelming Museum but Great Tour,"We did a 2-hour tour with Natasha of Universal Tour Guide.  She was a terrific guide.  She had a great personality, was friendly, answered all our questions, and tried to show us how different civilizations through time independently formed similar beliefs.  You could easily spend a week at the museum and not see it all.  The only disappointment was that a couple of the galleries we wanted to see, especially the Japan exhibit, were closed."
"Written September 17, 2019",Wonderful Museum,"Loved this wonderful museum!   So much to see! Since my husband has difficulty walking, I wish the elevators were a little more prominately positioned."
"Written October 24, 2019",Best Museum !,This is by far the best museum we have seen in Europe and the US.Anyone interested in history of various civilizations over the world may find the best artifacts here.
"Written October 24, 2019",We love this museum,"Where else can you see the Rosetta Stone , the Sutton Hoo treasures, the Parthenon marble reliefs and so much more. This easy to reach Museum from Russell Square or Holbern on the Piccadilly underground is a must see. It holds  the wonderful treasures from. Ikings to Romans and more."
"Written October 24, 2019","This is the best archeological museum in the world. It has everything that you’ll ever want to see,","Should treasures be returned to where they came from? I’m not too sure. Natural and man made disasters can happen anywhere and treasures can be lost.  This museum is very respectful of the treasures it stores. Without this beautiful museum, people possibly wouldn’t have access to the treasures from their countries. It was a life long must for me. You need at least a day to enjoy what the museum offers. Bus stops and the metro are a short walk away."
"Written October 23, 2019",Wow.. mindblowing,"This place is so impressive.. the historical artifacts are absolutely mind-blowing.. free entrance, but I know everyone visiting is more than happy to give a donation for this marvelous museum!"
"Written October 22, 2019",British Museum London,"Worth spending a couple of hours at this museum, at least 2 hours.A multi cultural experience for young and not so young."
"Written October 22, 2019",Amazing,This is a freebie and well worth the time. There a re several floors with lots of artifacts. A few to note are Rosetta Stone and a whole floor of Ancient Egyptian mummies.
"Written October 21, 2019","Rich, Fascinating, Free! [needs planning]","The British Museum is a palace of culture. it is so rich and divers that you can really spend there days. On the other hand, even if you have 1 hour it's worthwhile to enter. It's recommended to plan your visit. you can do it by visiting the internet site or by asking advise in the museum. Of course some of us prefer a journey without any plans...Since it is wonderful and free expect some rooms to be crowded. [If you are very tired or much in a hurry, do what we are doing sometimes (we do not tell friends): Visit the shop of the museums to get a compact idea about the place...]"
"Written October 20, 2019",So much to see!,"The museum's collection is truly impressive! A number of famous pieces are housed there, including Rosetta Stone. The Egyptian section is fascinating, especially the mummies. The gift shop is quite nice too, it offers a number of options which are not your typical run of the mill stuff, though it's a bit on the pricey side."
"Written October 19, 2019",Honeymoon,"My wife and I visited on our honeymoon. A unique building, layout, and exhibits. We enjoy history and it contains a LOT of history. Give yourself at least 3-4 hrs to navigate through."

"Written October 17, 2019",Mummy ,If you want to see mummy and discover the interesting things about culture and civilization this is the best place to visit. The British Museum is organized and beautiful.  Have a big store to buy souvenirs and places for have a meat. 
"Written October 16, 2019",fabulous museum,"We only had 2 days in London so we did not have a ton of time to spend at the Brittish History Museum.  We were able to view the Rosetta Stone, Moai, great display of mummies and the Lewis Chess pieces.  Definitely worth the trip!"
"Written October 15, 2019",Get there early ,"The British Museum is in an amazing building that’s worth checking out in itself.  The museum is divided by parts of the world, the highlights for me where the Egypt and Ancient Greek sections.  The Parthenon exhibition containing the Elgin Marbles is quite awe inspiring.  The Great Court as you enter the building is a nice area with shops, a cafe and toilets etc.  The museum is very easy to find, turn onto Great Russel Street as you leave Tottenham Court Road tube station then after about 5 minutes turn left onto Museum Street and you’ll see the main entrance.  Tip, get there early, we got there before it opened at 10am and when we came out there was already a significant queue building."
"Written October 15, 2019","If going with children, remember to download and print the family trails at home!","We went to the British Museum with our two daughters, ages 7 and 4, who were longing to see the mummies. I had done some research on the museum's website before going, and downloaded the ancient Egypt trail for families pdf. It includes a few description of what you will see in different rooms of the museum, and pictures of objects you are supposed to be looking for, as if you were doing a treasure hunt. The girls really appreciated this way of looking at the different rooms, and although we obviously did not see everything in detail, it was a nice way to discover the Egyptian's realm of the deads. I would say the Egyptian trail will take you anything between 30 to 60 minutes to complete, depending on the childrens' age and how many things you look at aside from the ones specifically mentioned. There are other trails available, but remember you have to print the leaflets at home!"
"Written October 14, 2019",A MAZING!,"Turns out the British collected historical relics from the Assyrians, Egyptians, Romans, etc. put them all together in a MASSIVE museum with free admission.  Nothing special, just the ROSETTA STONE and multi ton statues.  Some of this stuff looked like it was dug up from times when the earth was still warm.  It was an unbelievable sight."
"Written October 13, 2019",Great muesum,Great museum. Especialy greek and egypt history. Lots of people . Very crowded.  Upper floors with lift.
"Written October 10, 2019",Just wow! ,"Right when I walked in I was already amazed by the museum. Such a beautiful foyer area! The museum itself is huge. I was able to spend around 3 hours there and see everything I wanted to, but definitely not the whole museum. Went during a weekday morning to afternoon and it was busy, but the crowds were not super overwhelming. There were plenty of school field trips, however. Loved seeing the Rosetta Stone, and loved all of their historic collections - simply beautiful!! "
"Written October 10, 2019",Vast amounts of history,"How many places can you go and have free access to all that history.   It can get a bit confusing inside as to what you have seen and what you haven't, but do allow for a minimum of 2-3hrs.  If you enjoy history put this place on your to do list!"
"Written October 10, 2019",lots of history,"quiet compared with Science Museum which was  full of screaming children running around.Found the mummies display a bit unnerving, the Aussies and Americians  I was talking with, left the lenses on their cameras in respect. A bit difficult to find from Oxford Street, down a small side street, no signs."
"Written October 9, 2019",An astonishing array of artifacts,It is almost stupid for me to have to make this post;  The British Museum is home to some of the most important human artifacts and creations ever known to Man.  To have them under one roof and accessible (for free... no charge to get in!) is a miracle.  If you are in London for more than a day it is worth parsing out some time just to walk through... you are bound to catch a glimpse of something that will set your mind wondering.
"Written October 31, 2019",Certainly awesome,We visited British Museum as a family. Mediterrean and Middle East civilizations' remainings were very attractive. Egypt as well.
"Written October 30, 2019",Amazing but crowd was nearly unbearable,"We planned out visit for a Saturday afternoon, which turned out to be a misake, as there were far too many people at this time, and as it was mid term holiday, many kids as well. My children and we, adults as well, were amazed by the immense collection of beauties in this museum. This is not my first visit but I was trilled to visit again!"
"Written October 30, 2019",Tour of Egypt Room,"Was very happy that I booked the 9am tour of the Egypt room, the guide was very knowledgeable and provided a comprehensive overview.  Having access to the Museum before it opens is worth the price. Will book future pre-opening tours the next time I’m in London. The online booking was easy and the price is reasonable.  "
"Written October 29, 2019",One of the best museums,It’s really a great museum. But it is impossible to see the whole museum in one visit. It’s huge. Many places to eat and rest. Lots of space. We entered by 3.30 pm from the side entrance and there was no queue at all. Egyptian part was amazing. One of the museums that you must come at least 10 times if you want to see all. It’s free entrance.  
"Written October 29, 2019",Wonderful Way to Spend a Saturday,"Spent from mid morning to early afternoon on a Saturday at The British Museum with my 10 year old and 8 year old.  We felt like we just skimmed the surface but has an amazing time seeing almost all that was on display from Ancient Egypt, Greece and Roman civilization.  Make sure to go on the early side as there was a large crowd and line by the time we left around 2 pm.  Highlights for us were the Rosetta stone; Parthenon Marbles; the mummies (specifically the cat mummies) and everything Egyptian.  Next time we will get to Mesopotamia, Renaissance and the Medieval galleries.  Hidden away near the ancient Greek galleries is the Pizzeria (that's its name) which was perfect for children to stop and have some pizza for lunch.  Ample choices for young children as well as adults."
"Written October 29, 2019",Interesting exhibition on influence of Islam on Western Art,"Came to see a specific exhibition, but also made sure I visited the Sutton Hoo gallery, which never ceases to fascinate. The exhibition on the influence of the Islamic World on Western Art was excellent, although not one of the bigger ones I've seen at the British Museum. This was good, because it meant that visitors can spend time exploring the exhibits and the very informative explanations. Seeing the work of Western artists trying to capture Islamic scenes and images is both a puzzle and a revelation. There's a wide variety of styles on display, with most of the exhibits from the 19th century, but the first items you see as you go in are from earlier times. Well worth seeing."
"Written October 28, 2019",One of the world's best,"A truly world-class museum, with one of the finest collections on the planet. Many may argue that quite a few artifacts were obtained by questionable means (such as the Elgin Marbles), but regardless, there are few places around the world where you can find so many exceptional artifacts to explore and learn about, particularly around Sumerian, Greek and Roman history."
"Written October 28, 2019",Lots to see here,The antiquities are outstanding. Egypt and Greek areas the most interesting. Be aware of queues to get in but they do move fast
"Written October 27, 2019",Well worth seeing ,"Actually I went with my sister, but she counts as a friend and there’s no category for just “family”!We met for a day together as she lives in Yorkshire and I live in Kent, and the British Museum was convenient for us both to walk to from meeting at London St Pancras/Kings Cross stations (about 20 minutes each way). Once there we got a map of where everything was (you make a monetary donation, suggested £2), sat and had a very early lunch at one of the several eating cafes, and planned what in particular we wanted to see. This proved useful as there was a fire drill at 2pm (it was a Thursday - don’t know how often they do this, but I think it does say on the website) when they did a full evacuation of the premises. It was obviously going to take a good half hour before we could get back in, so we decided once elsewhere we would return another day. There is just so much to see, most of it fascinating. I wanted to see the Easter Island statue, the Rosetta Stone and the Clocks and Horology, my Sister wanted to see some of the really old artefacts. We managed to see the most important things we wanted to see. In conclusion, well worth a visit but to get the most out of your day I suggest:1. Check their website. 2. Get a map when you enter so you can plan what you want to see most so you get what is most important to you viewed, as you can easily run out of time with so much to see. 3. If you’re taking pictures, what I do is also take pictures of the captions/descriptions/story of what I’m looking at, as there’s so much to take in, I can then look at it all at my leisure later and enjoy it in peace! 4. The shops are worth a look round too for mementos. "
"Written October 26, 2019",Plan ahead or go with lots of time at hand.,"British Museum is a huge archeological Museum with tons to explore and learn. We reached the Museum late just about 1 hour from closing time, you need about 3+ hours to just explore the Museum superficially. I was able to view the Rosetta Stone, Greek, Egyptian Era exhibits and the Islamic section in a brisk manner. Most of the areas were missed. The museum is quite central and a walking distance from Tottenham Court Road Station and Holborn Station. It's a beautiful building and one of best  Museums in the world albeit huge. You need a full day to enjoy this fascinating place. If you have shorter than 2 hours, better Google or explore their website before visiting to pinpoint the exhibits that interest you."
"Written September 30, 2019","Awesome!  Remember, It Was The British EMPIRE!","Why so great?  Incredible things BECAUSE collected when it was the British Empire!  So, they had access to everything and the foresight to collect it.  The ""audio tour"" is fine, but do yourself a favor and book a private tour - you'll not regret it as this truly is a lifetime experience!!!"
"Written September 30, 2019",Remarkable,"A visit to the British Museum is a visit to the history of England.  The collection of objects gained (taken? stolen? acquired?) by the Empire is amazing.   Wherever the British went, they returned with all manner of art forms.  Whether it was Egypt, India or some other far away land, treasures were brought back and are on display in the halls of the museum.  One can spend hours or days and still not see all that there is.  Truly an impressive museum."
"Written September 28, 2019",Absolutely amazing ,A must museum if u love history and in London. U need to have time there in order to see and enjoy/admire history. The Egyptian and Greek sections are absolutely mesmerizing. 
"Written September 28, 2019",If you like museums and history - Go,"Many, many years of historic art and archaeological artifacts from the golden age of exploration.  We thoroughly enjoyed seeing art from the golden ages of England.  The museum is free."
"Written September 26, 2019",Awesome!,Give yourself at least a whole day.  Do not rush your visit here.So many fine exhibits to see. A must for all.
"Written September 24, 2019",A must during travel to London,"Everybody can find here something interesting but without doubt, if your time is limited, it is good to focus on ancient Egypt section. It is located on two floors and takes you about one hor time. At the end you can enjoy good tea or coffee in a nice bar."
"Written September 24, 2019",Worth visiting again and again,It has a very large collection of artifacts. One cant see everything within a day... Probably would take me at least 2 whole weeks! This isn't my first visit. Will be back again! 
"Written September 23, 2019",Amazing!,"Plan on spending 2-3 hrs here and you still won’t see everything.  The Egyptian area is mind boggling.  Free admission, be ready to stand in line to get in.  "
"Written September 23, 2019",Awesome ,"Spent a bit of time here rather interested in the artefacts collected. The Parthenon Marbles was indeed quite a highlight. There are too many highlights to specifically mention. We were looking forward to the Japan exhibition- however after following all the signs, and finally asking an employee, the exhibit was closed. This was not well sign posted."
"Written September 22, 2019",Such Great Collections and Learning Experience,"Its difficult to see everything in One day but we tried. Pick out your favorite things to explore by looking at the Brochure before you start. If you love jewelry like I do, do not miss the jewelry collection through the ages . I liked it BETTER than the Crown Jewels My boyfriend loved the Music room as he is a musician but we both loved the statues and the first floor was excellent. Eat before you come or after as the food is terrible just maybe get coffee or soda and a muffin. Do not miss this museaum"
"Written October 6, 2019",Huge Museum,"So much to see and so little time. Dedicated to human history, art and culture. Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence.  And it’s all free! It's wonderful how well kept the museum pieces are displayed and kept.  A whole day may allow you time to see and enjoy most of it.  Nice, clean cafe area."

"Written October 5, 2019",Huge place lots to see,This is a must see but so huge you could spend many days here and not view all the exhibits.. Do a little research and don't just wander or you will tire quickly.
"Written October 4, 2019",beautiful,this museum has an embarrassment of riches! it is totally overwhelming in size and scope so we took a 2 hour tour which helped see the highlights.
"Written October 1, 2019",The One to See,"If you only visit one museum in London, this is the one to see.  Mummy's, facade from the Parthenon, Shakespeare's folio and Queen Victoria's coronet, there is too much to see.  We spent the day here and hobbled thru!"
"Written October 1, 2019",Where to start,"Well. I go there almost every time I'm in London. I have been there probably 8 or 9 times already. And I will go there few more times.It's so big. That I always say. Don't go there to see everything at once. I always just pick part out and spend more time at that part to get it all in. Then next time I pick some other part. You can run over everything, but you will then not see everything.It has so much history. It's one of the must see things when you are in London"
"Written September 30, 2019",Massive!,Truly amazing collection of items and perfect for a rainy day! Endless galleries and certainly great for foreign tourists and locals alike
"Written September 30, 2019",Always so inspiring!,The British Museum is never boring and always showcases incredibly interesting historical pieces. For primary school children seeing in person all the ancient Egypt and Greece objects was like giving life to what they had only read in books and their excitement was a real treat for us adults! Recommended for all ages!
"Written September 30, 2019",a great place to visit,"City museums are free in London, so if you have time to visit any of them, spend as much time as you can to see both art and historical exhibits.  We saw the Rosetta Stone here and a few of the exhibits. Most of the items are very old and would be appreciated by those who have studied their history.  I was very impressed with the size of this museum and all that it contains. Beautiful displays and a nice gift shop."
"Written September 30, 2019",Crowded,"A must see.  The Elgin marbles, the Rosetta Stone and so many more priceless items!  And free!  Though, it's crazy crowded "
"Written August 21, 2019",An endlessly vast museum ,The best part about Britain when it comes to museums is that they are free. That’s what brought me to the British museum. A very large museum with lots of collections from around the world was on display. The collection was so vast that I couldn’t finish all in one day. It’s not even practical. I met a guy from Albania who said he has a historian and had been visiting the museum for the 11th day in a row just to study the exhibits. Imagine if the museum wasn’t free!! If ever I come back to London again I would definitely visit the museum for exploring the rest of it.
"Written August 21, 2019",great collection,"It is a very big and beautiful museum, the downhill is it is too big, I went 5 different occasions to explore it, otherwise, it is too much to take in."
"Written August 20, 2019",One of the top museums in the world—just go!,"The British Museum is an amazing place to learn about the history of the world’s culture. They have artifacts from cultures around the world, from Easter Island (Rapa Nui) to Ancient Greece to Egypt to the Maya. Don’t miss the hall that shows what museums were like 100-150 years ago—it’s very interesting understanding the history of museums and collections.You could spend days here, and the good news is that it’s free, so you could afford to. It’s very crowded, but well worth spending a day or more."
"Written August 20, 2019",Museum not to miss,Wonderful museum with multiple exhibitions all worth seeing and best of all admission is FREE.  Plan on spending at least 1/2 a day to see many of the exhibits.  Don't miss the Rosetta Stone on display.
"Written August 20, 2019",A trip through history,I went to spend time at the British History Museum. Much to my amazement and to my surprise I found that there was a huge section of technology which included a replica of the first computer designed by Charles Babbage in the mid-1600. It was called an analytical machine and close by was a display of his brain. May be a little off putting for some but I was enthralled as I have been involved with technology most of my working life. There was also a display of Lord Byron’s daughter Lady Lovelace who is credited with developing the IF statement still used in programing. This was just something that I able to see and it did distract me from all of the other wonderful displays in this landmark in London.  Well worth a visit; be prepared to spend a few hours wandering around the exhibits.
"Written August 20, 2019",Amazing but super crowded,"This place is legendary and has numerous amazing items. Plus it is free. So of course it is covered up with people. They could really use some crowd control to eliminate bottlenecks, because there are too many rude people standing blocking exhibits, doors, and staircases. I couldn't get anywhere near the Rosetta Stone, for instance. It was low to the ground just inside a door from the main courtyard, resulting in huge crowds jostling near it and trying to get past it. Very disappointing that they didn't put it up a bit higher, make people stand a bit farther back, and perhaps also mount a huge blown-up image of it in the wall for those who wanted to see its details. The whole place could use a redesign to open up doorways and eliminate confusing dead ends and so many, many stairs. The lifts are super slow. I really feel sorry for the elderly and handicapped trying to get anywhere inside. So, although l think this is a fantastic place, I'd recommend getting there right as it opens if you don't want to be fighting the tremendous crowds."
"Written August 20, 2019","Marvelous collection, must visit",You could walk here for hours and days... great collection and I totally understand why people are queuing every morning to get in!
"Written August 19, 2019",Huge,"Huge museum, with thousands of items. If you have limited time, make sure you at least see must see items on the brochure."
"Written August 19, 2019",World class!,"This magnificent museum houses a collection that is rather unbelievable, particularly due to how it is displayed. If you wanted to, you are close enough to four thousand year old relics to touch them (unfortunately, a lot of people did during our visit). As many people have said, it was incredibly crowded during our visit. We were still able to stop and see the displays we wanted to. We had to stake out a table for lunch and obnoxiously hovered as a family finished their meal, but that's what everyone else did, too. The lunch we ate (sandwiches and salads) was tasty, and everyone who worked at the museum was very kind and helpful when we had questions. The best discovery was that down one floor to -1 is the family floor. It's really just a giant locker room with tables, but it was nearly empty. There are places to sit, and a toilet that is always free. You are only allowed access if you have children. I know we missed tons of exhibits, so we will definitely be back some day.  You can't beat free! A must see in London!"

"Written September 15, 2019",Kudos to the British Museum,"Visited the British Museum, once again.  This time, the agenda was the new China and South Asia Gallery.  First stop: security.  Be sure to bring a purse or man purse (no backpack) to enter the short line to avoid long queues.  In the museum, marvel at the Grand Hall.  Wow!  Brilliant use of space and natural light.  Enter the China and South Asia Gallery.  I'm entranced by the blue, ceramic dragon.  The displays share a high standard for museums with clear signage, well-lit displays, and fascinating stories about the items on display and the history of the region.  I’m crazy about the British Museum Chinese Tang Tomb Figures with people, camels, and horses.  A highlight!"
"Written September 14, 2019","Must-see in London, though I missed the Chinese painting/calligraphy collection (not open for some reason)","The British Museum is on my 'bucket list', and finally I got to cross it, though I'll come again. One of the biggest and finest museums in the world, and it doesn't need recommendations.Being a linguist and a translator, I was amazed by the Rosetta Stone. A souvenir is a must takeaway.The Chinese painting/calligraphy collection was being renovated or maintained or something. But it was not open to visitors, which is a big pity. Maybe a good reason to come again next time."
"Written September 13, 2019",Family visit ,"A must see , if you go to London & have the time . It will be crowded though & possible long lines to get in . There is so much to see , the Rosetta Stone is here . We picked out our favorite things & sought them out as we were there about two hours only . You could stay for days . It is free . "
"Written September 11, 2019",Amazing artifacts; take a special morning tour if you can,"Our family of five (two parents and three teens) splurged and purchased tickets to the Introduction to Ancient Egypt special morning tour, in an effort to to avoid the crowds. Although it's not cheap (£30/adult), we thought it was well worth it, as the tour takes place at 9;00 AM, an hour before the museum opens to the public, and our small tour group had the entire Egyptian gallery (including the Rosetta Stone) to ourselves. Our guide was very informative, although it was difficult to hear her at times, particularly when other museum employees who were walking past us were talking/laughing quite loudly. She/we did not use wireless earphone headsets. As our tour was wrapping up at 10:01 AM, the gallery immediately filled up with the other visitors and tour groups, and there was a huge crowd, 5-6 people deep, trying to take photos of the Rosetta Stone.We spent the next hour and a half, viewing the Egyptian mummies, which surprisingly wasn't too crowded (perhaps because they are located on the third floor) and the Greek galleries. We didn't realize that the Elgin Marbles referred to the collection of sculptures and other pieces of the ancient Greek Parthenon. It was amazing to see them."
"Written September 11, 2019",Plan a whole day,"This place is huge and there is so much to see. Incredible displays of artifacts from ancient times to present day, many countries and cultures represented. Not a place you want to rush through, as we unfortunately had to. Bonus is that it is free (of course a donation is welcome, and worth it)."
"Written September 9, 2019",Could spend years here.,You can get quite an education at this amazing place. The exhibits are thoughtful and well laid out. 
"Written September 9, 2019",Rosetta Stone,"The Rosetta stone is one of the most important discoveries in interpreting Egyptian artifacts. It perimits translation of Greek, Dometic, and Heiroglyphs.  It was displayed in a very nice stand, and the work by Champollon was expained."
"Written September 9, 2019",Wow,The museum is incredible. Takes a few hours to see. It has quite an extensive collection covering pretty much all ancient civilizations. Absolutely stunning! 
"Written September 8, 2019",Worth at least a day,"A decade after my first visit, I spent an afternoon at the British Museum and covered only about a quarter of the Museum. The Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece rooms are must-sees, but it is difficult to point out anything that is “skip-able” in here. Do take your time. And learn. Stop the silly selfies."
"Written September 8, 2019",A must see,"The British museum is the home of the Rosetta Stone, the ancient Greek/Egyptian translation system. The museum host a wonderful collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts. A must see."
"Written September 7, 2019",Amazing - very large,Incredible artifacts and display of world history. Allow at LEAST 2 hours. 3+ hours if you want to reach all areas of the Museum since it’s VERY LARGE.Very crowded so plan accordingly.  We arrived later in the day and that helped. Air conditioning is light in some parts of the building so consider that during the warmer summer months.  
"Written September 7, 2019",Excellent - Wide variety for any interests,"Exceptional museum.  Easy to navigate through the building and collections.  Lots of individual artifacts of different periods and cultures. Detailed explanations of each item.  One of the best I have visited in Europe for simplicity, yet informative and lots of content.  One of the best facilities and presentation I have seen."
"Written September 6, 2019",Great place to browse,Entry is free but they ask a 5 pound donation which we thought very reasonable.  Get in early (it opens at 10) to avoid the crowd who h builds up by 12.  The Rosetta Stone is a must-see but the Egyptian and ancient English history are fascinating too
"Written September 5, 2019",An absolute must,"An absolute must when visiting London, from the Elgin Marbles, Ancent Egypt and all the way up to a recent exhibition on the development of Manga. This is the place of preservation of World culture.Try to arrive at opening to avoid too many crowds, or towards the end of the day and come back. You need a lot of time to visit so do try to plan ahead to know what you want to see as rooms are a spread widely. Great advantage is the fact that the museum is free but does need donations, although certain temporary exhibitions are paying."
"Written September 4, 2019",Dont miss,"If you like travel in history of mankind this is a place to go. They have a numerous times of archeological collections from different eras of mankind. Of course, you can still wanna look the rosetta stone."
"Written September 4, 2019",Wow! Something for everyone here.,"This is perhaps one of the best museums in the world. Free to enter and floors of exhibits (benefiting from years of British Colonial activities). My husband and I separated to look at our own areas of interest and were both blown away by the range and quality of exhibits. Set in a light airy build, easy distance from Russell Square or Holborn tube station, well worth a visit. "
"Written September 4, 2019",Fabulous A Must See,Most wonderful point was its enormity but not overwhelming. Surprised there were museum monitors everywhere which was relaxing. Fab cafe and restaurant on the second floor. Gift shops (2) were stuffed with all kinds of things . Free Free Free. Elevator but not as many sit down benches though. ALL exhibits were fabulous and well described. 
"Written September 3, 2019",One of the best civilization musium,"My main interest to visit this museum is to see main sections of Islamic art and Egyptian history.I can’t count how many visits I had in the past years,but  certainly I will keep visiting this great museum every time I come to London. every visit I see new things and learn few information.The presentation is excellent and well presented.I have seen many Egyptians Exhiption around the world ,but the British Museum  is the best"
"Written August 26, 2019",Get There Early and Plan to Stay for As Long as You Can!,"The first time we tried to go to the British Museum it was on a Saturday and when we arrived there were lines that spawned around the block and it was raining!  We decided that since the museum opens at 10, we’d arrive at 9 and that was a smart move since we walked right in. To our surprise the lobby was open so we were were able to get the feel of the museum even though most of the exhibition doors didn’t open until 10.  I wanted to see the Rosetta Stone and  heard that the crowds made experiencing the early Egyptian artifacts a challenge. Ironically, now that our vacation is over, I was looking at the British Museum’s website and we could have booked a tour to visit the museum before it opened. These tours cost money and if you go on your own it’s free but I regret missing this opportunity and will definitely take advantage the next time we are in London. We loved our time in the museum. Architecturally the Queen’s Court is extraordinary and that’s the “ Lobby” that you enter once you pass through security.  We loved the exhibits on Money, their Watch collection and just about every other exhibit we saw. You really could spend days just trying to learn about all the history that this vast museum encompasses.  I really loved their Mummy Collection. They have lots of cafes throughout the museum to get coffee,desserts and sandwiches. They also have extensive gift shops so you could bring home your own Rosetta Stone mouse pad, magnet or jigsaw puzzle along with hundreds of other gifts and books."
"Written August 24, 2019",visit in the evening or before closing time to avoid the crowds: Learn something new every visit,"This was our 3rd trip to the museum since our last trip 5 years ago.  We visited around day of a heat wave in July and the museum's air conditioning could not keep up with the heat.  It was so hot the doors to the room holding the Elgin marbles were open.   We arrived around 5 pm, it was crowded, there were loads of people, just sitting on the floor camped out in the main rotunda, By the time we left near closing time, the museum had emptied of the large tour groups, the museum had cooled and it was much easier to navigate.  There is a back entrance which we used and did not have a line.The museum map has about 12 highlights marked - some of which we had not seen on previous visit, - we used this as a guide to visit the highlights some of which we had not see before (the astrolabe, the reliquary, the oxus treasure.   Also saw the room of Enlightenment which was a favorite, \ which was blessedly cool and had interesting exhibits. We went back a second day since our apartment was less than a 10 minutes walk and visiting the museum twice made it more manageable than one long visit."
"Written August 24, 2019",Terrific museum,"Arrive early to clear security.  Be selective on what you read & view, only what really catches your eye.  Egyptian area crowded & busy, go there early.Enough to see to fill the best part of the day.Easily reached by metro & then on foot"
"Written August 23, 2019",a place to travel in time,"a place to stay long the a couple of hours , so please organise your day considering to stay in the museum even to have a bite. from Greece to Rome and from Rome to the Nile sailing with Cleopatra. just to mention something but you also can visit history from other places like Mesopotamia and Far East , let history talk to you I  strongly recommend to take your time to enjoy this jewell .children only if they want and they are interested in learning."
"Written August 23, 2019",Crowed and a bit overwhelming - but very worth it...,"We arrived just before 10:00 am opening (free admittance) to find a long line down the street to get through security - that said it was well managed and moved quickly - took about 15 minutes. Once in it is very overwhelming and terribly amazing - so it is best to bit of homework before you go in - the most popular areas are the Egyptian displays with the mummies (it is very interesting and worth a walk-by at a minimum through the crowd) and then the Asian – Chinese areas. The Rosetta Stone is also one of the most famous artifacts in the museum – mush like the Mona Lisa there is a bit of a mob scene there. There is no way that one could see it all and in my opinion any of the areas can be fascinating and worth just spending some time at any area. You can spend as much or little time as your itinerary will allow and it will be worth it. Note that the restrooms/WC are located on the main floor and you have to go down stairs from there – there are elevators down but take a long time and there is a line for both men and women. There is great areas for sell of museum books, clothing, and many other items. There is coffee service in different areas, pizza shop etc. You really could come on many visits and would be worth the visit. Highly recommended."
"Written August 22, 2019",Incredible Museum,"We spent the whole day here and enjoyed every minute. Highly recommend Room #1 which offers a history of the Museum and, implicitly, a history of the West’s growing knowledge of ancient history and non-Western cultures.  "
"Written August 22, 2019","So much to see, lovely building.",We visited on a recent trip to London. We really didn't have enough time to do the museum justice and only saw a few of the large displays. The exhibits are well set out and easily accessible even though the museum was quite crowded. The building is nice to walk through and feels spacious. We saw a lot of the Ancient Egyptian area and it was all very interesting and well documented. Would visit again if staying in or near London.
"Written August 21, 2019",Fantastic and overwhelming museum,Everyday is apparently a busy in the British Museum. The only fault with this great museum is that is is always crowded but you can't fault the exhibitions.
"Written August 21, 2019","Mummies, rsoetta stone, Pergmaine Altar.","The mummies are a big draw and we made sure to see them. In summer things get a bit hot on the upper levels so be warned. I never realized the Rosetta Stone was in the British Museum so when I found out, of course we went to take a look. Must see!I also had never viewed the Pergamine Altar and other Greek temple statuary so that was a treat. The museum underwent a renovation not too long ago and the galleries we visited all looked brand new. Lots of great stuff here. You could spend days in the museum. Of course we were on a tight schedule and did the big stuff to say we saw it."
"Written August 21, 2019",A cornucopia of treasure and enlightenment,"Amazing ! We were there for over 2 hours, and only got thru rooms 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8. We were overwhelmed by the vastness of the collection. You would need at least three visits to even roughly skim the exhibits. I advise you get a map (gratis) and tick the rooms as you go. Some of the cased exhibits are too high to view. Also orientation is most difficult as the rooms do not appear to be numbered. This makes for a challenging assignment. As you pass thru the museum you come to the realisation that without being collected, stored and exhibited much of this preserved history would have been lost."
"Written August 18, 2019","After Greece, Had to Make a Stop Here to See the Parthenon Marbles","It's truly amazing to me that a museum of this extraordinary caliber is still operating on a ""pay as you wish for donation"" basis.  Amazing collection and you could literally spend days and days here - but the great thing about not charging an arm and a leg to get in is that you can even squeeze in a worthwhile stop for 45 minutes like we did and not feel like you didn't get your money's worth...."
"Written August 18, 2019",great museum,Go early when it opens. The museum gets crowded. Expect to spend a few hours or a whole day . Very expansive
"Written August 18, 2019",Manga Exhibition ,Manga exhibit was pretty good. Mostly discussed the origins of manga. There is a fee to see it tho. They have other free exhibits that are great too 
"Written August 18, 2019",Great museum but avoid the crowds,"The British Museum is of course one of the most important museums in the world. So a trip to London will be incomplete without seeing the British Museum. However, if you visit in a crowded time, I can guarantee that your visit will be very unpleasant and unproductive. The queue is usually not a big problem as it moves fairly quickly but the towards the middle of the day, the museum itself tends to get really busy. It gets really difficult to move around and enjoy the collection. I highly recommend going early to avoid the crowds.Otherwise of course a magnificent place to visit."
"Written August 17, 2019",Manga exhibition ,"Great place to visit, been many times to the different exhibitions they have shown.Wheelchair accessible and main part is free. Exhibitions generally have an additional charge."
"Written August 17, 2019",recommended,"Another obligatory stop in the stays in London is the visit to this beautiful museum, both for the architecture of the building that houses it, and for the amount of material of various historical periods, magnificent the abundance of Egyptian objects, sculptures, objects, artifacts of every type and culture. And all this is also free, highly recommended."
"Written August 17, 2019",Amazing place,"An amazing museum to visit, so much to see and do. Outstanding exhibits bring history to life. Gets very busy going thru security, but once thru it's worth it. Allow upto 3 hours to explore, only downside if its raining the museum is packed and you don't get to see everything."
"Written August 17, 2019",World class museum!,"The British Museum in London is an amazing place for the entire family. We were there with our daughter and granddaughter (aged 8), and she thoroughly enjoyed the Egyptian mummies and artifacts. Entry to the museum is free, although a contribution is suggested by the management. It’s usually very crowded, and it’s best to arrive early."
"Written August 16, 2019",It had a lot to see but it was super hot inside,It was definitely one of the coolest museums I have see I love that it has different areas and don't forget it's free.
"Written August 16, 2019",Wonderful ,"The British Museum In Holborn/ Bloomsbury is A Great Alternative To The Tower Of London. Admission Is Free But ask for a £5 Donation. Which is is a Bargain to the £32 Admission Price To The Tower Of London. Historic Artifacts From The Middle East,Latin America North America and The UK of Course Will Be On Display Ranging From The Mesopitamian era to The Antibellum Are always interesting To See."
"Written August 7, 2019",One of the best,The British Museum is one of the best museums in the world. It's free to visit and there is so much to see you could be there all day.
"Written August 6, 2019",I never miss stopping in when in London,The long lines outside move super fast! With 2 million exhibits there is something for everyone! It’s spotlessly clean -how is that even possible and how many popl must work there after close each day?!
"Written August 6, 2019",Amazing place - must see in London!,"Can't believe that there is no entrance fee for this, one of the greatest museums in the world. A massive collection and a beautiful place. We took a guided Bible tour (through an independent company, not the museum itself) and it was worth every cent as the museum is so massive it could easily be overwhelming."
"Written August 6, 2019",Lots to see!,"We always visit museums when we travel. The British museum has a tremendous number of artifacts from all regions of the world, most from the ancient world but some closer to our time period. There is just so much to see that in my opinion pick a couple of time periods or geographical areas that you want to see and concentrate on them. We spent just under 5 hours and by that time we were just spent! Our legs and minds could not take in anymore. Well worth the visit for sure."
"Written August 5, 2019",Bible tour,"Highly recommend this museum with a guided bible tour. It was amazing to see the rossetta stone, and other artifacts that pertain to Bible history and the true God Jehovah. If anyone is a bible student, take it!"
"Written August 3, 2019",So much to see!!,Great museum!!! We enjoyed seeing the museum-- even with our super bad jet lag. The Egyptian items and the chess sets were or family faves.
"Written August 3, 2019",Too much to see in one day,It's breathtaking how big the collection of this museum is and therefore it is quite impossible to see everything in one day. I would recommend to make a list of things you want to see in the day that you are there or to do the highlight tour which the museum also recommends.
"Written August 2, 2019",History at its best,I have been to many museums and this is one of the best. It has a collection of world artifactes very few can match. I have visited Egypt and the number and quality of the exhibitsare on par to those in Cairo. To see the Rosetta stone was special.You could easily spend a day exploring but a good 3-4 hours is a minimum to appreciate the wonders here if you are in a hurry.  The exhibits are well presented and organized.
"Written July 31, 2019",Shame,"Of course you have to visit the museum, but be prepared to get very very angry. The place is a huge restaurant, with gift shops in the middle. No respect for the marvels that are there. No order, no security, they just asked us if we were carrying weapons, we said no of course, no air conditioning, people are running up and down with no plan. Do something for heavens shake"
"Written July 31, 2019",Amazing but so crowded,"The British museum is amazing with collections dated back 3000 BC. The mummies were so cool to see in person! But be aware it was SO crowded and hot! We rushed trough the museum because of this. But its free and worth it in our opinion! When we walked around the building we saw that you can actually enter at the back of museum, which had no lines!! It seemed to be for regular visitors too, so I would recommend visitors to try that entrence before the main one!"
"Written August 16, 2019",Go!!,"A fascinating, fantastic museum replete with surely some of the most awesome items anywhere.  It is huge (8,000,000 items with only a small portion on display at any given time) and it was crowded when we went.  We had done our research and knew what we wanted to see (Rosetta Stone, Easter Island statue, the Egyptian exhibits, ...).  The museum is categorized by culture, which made it easy to discriminate our browsing.  Don't expect to see everything unless you have several days and nothing else to do, more if you're a slow browser who reads all the postings.  Don't miss it!"
"Written August 15, 2019","So much to see, so little time.","My favourite spot in London. Things to bear in  mind, in the Summer and at weekends it can get very busy and it will be hot inside. Save yourself time by using the little used back entrance on Montague Place and make a plan of what you'd like to see as its big! It's free to enter but donations are requested and needed. Recently the museum banned wheeled luggage of any size. My highlights are the Egyptian rooms and the Aztec and Inca exhibits (Rm 27). A lovely semi hidden spot can be found in the corner of room 21 takes the stairs down into the basement for some great Roman exhibits and an Alexander the Great inscription, see if you can find the inscription about the dog! Alos lovely is Nereid Monument (Room 17) walk behind the temple for some more hidden gems.Enjoy!"
"Written August 15, 2019",Torture,"London is too hot. British Museum is too crowded. I have been to British Museum many times before. For the very first time, I found it so hot, noisy and full of bad smell. Everywhere is visitors. It looks like a market. I would say it is a torture. "
"Written August 15, 2019",Was expecting more of a British feel to this but very little British or even European,"OK the title is probably my naivety, but I was expecting this museum to more about the history of the UK, but there is a LOT of non-UK stuff here. It is HUGE! There is so much to see and to my untrained and non-artistic mind, very confused and complicated. Not to put people off a visit as there is a lot to see but this 9at 4pm on a Saturday) wasn't a pleasant trip - it was heaving with people - you could hardly move! If we go again I would try a quiet time and more time! We were pretty much herded out at 5:15 - quite rude in the manner. So if you do go find a quiet time, mid week maybe and early morning to ensure plenty of time to see it all - there is one heck of a lot  of stuff!!"
"Written August 14, 2019",If you enjoy queing for hours to get in this is the place for you.,"No idea whether the museum is any good as we gave up due to the queue being literally 500 meters long, mostly made up of tour groups. If that many are allowed in it must be as many reviews describe, absolutely unbearably and chaotically crowded. We went elsewhere instead as queing for 2 - 3 hours and then fighting to get near enough to look at exhibits is not our idea of enjoyment."
"Written August 13, 2019",Allow for lots of time!,Security lines are pretty long if you just show up. I recommend getting advanced tickets. By the time I got in I only had time to see the rosetta stone and the Elgin marbles. It was what I wanted to see but there was so much more it was overwhelming. For sure allow for lots of time and maybe don’t go in the summer because it was PACKED.
"Written August 13, 2019",A fantastic visit ,"We had a rushy itinerary visiting London this time. We spent 2 hours to visit the museum, so we chosen some themes to take a look such as Europe & Asia for flipping. Very crowded with long queue! I do hope I can spend enough time to visit next time. I suggest spending one day to visit if you do like to discover history.  Then we had a good lunch @Great Court Restaurant. Please refer to my post if you want to know the restaurant~"

"Written September 2, 2019",You Could Spend Days Here,"Talk about an amazing museum.  If you have more than a mild interest in history and different cultures, you will find this to be incredible.We spent over 4 hours here and barely scratced the surface in all the exhibits.  Of course, we saw the Rosetta Stone and plenty of ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman artifacts.  Give yourself plenty of time and you may want to scope out what you want to see before you go to make sure you get to see everything that is important to you."
"Written September 1, 2019",Marvelous Museum,"The amount of artifacts and exhibits is incredible. If you don't have alot of time, get the museum brochure upon entering and it will list the 10 items that are highly recommended to see.  Very interesting and informative, you will not be bored."

"Written August 27, 2019",Best museum of the world.,"Who said best things are not free? Thanks UK and London for making my visit memorable with this museum. It is free. We went around 5pm and was able to cover most of the artifacts. Best highlights were Rosetta stone, Renaissance arts, Greek , Egyptian mummies including Cleopatra(don't know if it is true), story of money, collection of clocks, China, Japan, India, Arabic artifacts. Don't miss this, if you are in London. Take the map (it is free, but suggested donation of 2 pounds)."

"Written August 26, 2019",A must see in London,"Get there early. The lines can get crazy long. We got there to the back entrance about 30 mins early and got right in. Later they were quite long, even in the rain.Allow for several hours if you want to see everything. There's a lot in there. It's free the way we did it, but there's a paid tour where you go in before it opens. Might be worth it."
"Written August 26, 2019",British Museum is a must visit,"This is one of the must see institutions for any visit to London. The permanent exhibits are never old no matter how many times we have been. There is so much to learn about humanity across centuries.Do try to miss holiday periods and weekends though. It is incredibly popular and the entrance queue can get pretty long. Once inside, it is still possible to get lost and away from crowds depending on the gallery or exhibit you want to see."
"Written August 11, 2019",So much to see!,"We came here twice and felt as if we barely scratched the surface of all the exhibits. Especially interesting was the store of ancient treasure (everything is a ""hoard"", it seemed!) on display from excavations around Britain. Really helped to get a sense of history here. And it doesn't hurt that it's free!"
"Written August 11, 2019",Outstanding,The collection is great of course but in early August the place is extremely crowded. The standard highlights are obviously worth seeing but wandering into less criterion’s has a big payoff. 
"Written August 9, 2019",Could visit this museum over and over,"We were on a British Isles cruise and the London excursion was more of a drive by of iconic places. My husband suggested we ditch the tour midway and head to the British Museum (our tour guide was great - suggested we taxi there and then taxi to the train station to catch our ship).  It had been decades since we had been to the museum, and I’m so glad we went.  The ancient Egyptian artifacts are absolutely stunning, as are the Ancient Greece items.  There was a flyer available discussing the request of Greek government that the Parthenon sculptures be returned and the museum’s position. I found it thought provoking. We also enjoyed the clock room.  I so enjoy this place and hoping I’ll be able to return someday. Definitely worth waiting in line to get in."
"Written August 9, 2019",Mummies ... Not Moms... Real Mummies!!!,"After many years and many visits to London on business trips, I finally had a chance to be a tourist. I stayed the weekend in my home away from home City of London, and the British Museum was my first stop before visiting the Crown Jewels. The Egyptian artifacts are absolutely mind-blowing.  An absolute must see."
"Written August 7, 2019",A childhood favourite is still relevant in adulthood,"I grew up with The British Museum. It was near where my Nan used to live and we went their a lot. I’m now several years older with a child of my own and I’m getting him to love it as much as I always have.Whatever your reason for visiting, this is the venue for you. A family visit, a solo day out, perhaps a date, the BM holds so many treasures of cultural relevance that you’ll learn every time you go. Best to see the highlights early: the Rosetta Stone, the Egyptian mummies and the like get packed after the first hour. Go check out the Lewis chessman and Sutton Hoo, smaller British artefacts which tell amazing stories about our country’s past, and the Abyssinian treasures are beautiful.If you love a gift shop, the BM has several: there’s a wide selection of books in the large book shop in the middle of the new central hall, and another dedicated to jewellery."
"Written August 7, 2019",Always a great place to visit,"This is always a great stop for anyone interested in world history.  The museum contains a treasure trove of relics - Rosetta Stone, Sutton Hoo, mummies, etc.  However, this time we visited with our grandchildren and bought admission to the Manga exhibit.  They are into anime and were thrilled with the exhibit.  They were able to see some objects they had only read about and were able to have a unique experience.  Of course, there are always crowds at the museum, but admission to the Manga exhibit was controlled by ticket entry times."
"Written August 7, 2019",Excellent museum and a must see when in London,"We took my six year old daughter and she was fascinated with the mummies and other artifacts. It was a long visit but so good to see the worlds items all in one place. Expect a super long wait to get in as the crowd goes out the gate, down the street and around the corner. But it's free so what do you expect. I'd recommend going in the afternoon around the 2ish mark."
"Written August 7, 2019",British Museum - A Biblical Perspective,"The British Museum is extraordinary and so vast, that you would have to camp there for a week and still not see it in its entirety. Best advice is go with a plan of what you want to see. You will find plenty of unexpected treasures on the way, but at least you will not have that sense of being totally overwhelmed. On a recent visit with friends, we chose to concentrate on exhibits directly linked to the Bible. It is amazing how many finds confirmed Biblical facts that some had held as 'myth'. Well worth a tour!  The Museum sells a guide called 'Through the British Museum with the Bible' (also available on Amazon etc.) which points out the significant exhibits and also their location, which is helpful. There are a good few online articles also about these particular exhibits. We did it in 2 hours, which for us was just enough and left us with plenty of ideas for future visits. Entrance is free, unless you are going to any of the special exhibitions. This is really a worthwhile thing to do if you are in London!"
"Written August 7, 2019",Great Anceint artifacts throughout the museum!,This was a free attraction...yes...free....and as such it was a very crowded hot mess the day we went. Spend the couple pounds and get the guide so you know where to focus your energies. It is a HUGE place and you can get lost. Be prepared to fight your ways through the crowds to get a close-up look of the Rosetta Stone. You have to be patient and sometimes a little pushy here....don't bring a stroller!!
"Written August 7, 2019",Great to visit,The British Museum is one of the most exiting place to visit in London and in the whole world. There only two disadvantages: No. 1 is that the Museum is too big to see all exhibited treasures on one visit. So have to come back. No. 2 the queues at the two entrances can be very long. So an early bird ...  (and choose the right entrance (Northern side) since main entrance is always busier)!
"Written August 19, 2019",Beautiful Museum with something for everyone,"I went specifically to see the Rosetta Stone which was amazing in itself. The museum houses so many treasures it is not possible to see it all in one day. No matter what your particular interest, you can find treasures that will satisfy. It is crowded, but if you bear with the crowds you will see some of the most beautiful human creations.And you can have a nice cup of tea and a scone in the central lobby!"
"Written August 19, 2019",Amazing museum,"I have been here before, and I missed the Rosetta Stone so wanted to come back to refresh my memory.It’s free to enter however donations can be made easily when you enter. It was very busy on Saturday as the weather was cloudy with some rain predicted. I heard one female parter suggest they should get a refund as it was so crowded but her male partner reminded her it had free entry....Whilst crowded you can still move about reasonably easily with only the most popular exhibits have too many people.I started high that is went to the top level and came down level by level. There are so many categories however for me it was the middle eastern art, the Rosetta Stone and the Greek areas that impressed me most.I liked the portable folding chairs you can take free of charge to enable you to rest as needed. Acts as a walking stick as well.There are lifts if needed.So an amazing afternoon. On this trip been to the Louvre and the Hermitage museum and this has less artworks but is in the same class of museum."
"Written August 19, 2019",Maybe the best museum in the world,"The artefacts in this museum are some of the most famous and astonishing you will find in any museum. The Rosetta Stone is worth the trip alone but the other big attractions include The Elgin Marbles and the Mummies.If you're travelling from abroad, dont miss this museum."
"Written August 19, 2019",Heritage of the world,"What can one say about BM that has not already been said? It is not just a London, or British but a full-flown world institution in every sense of the word. The content, exhibits, organization, the venue, the building, the historyb the courtyard with the glass roof, the free admission.Only, it takes a lot of time, focus and stamina to see it all. It is better if one has a plan what to see, or a special field of intetest. Or come again, and again."
"Written August 18, 2019",Fabulous!,I could have easily spent two or three days in this museum. Never have I seen such an extensive collection of ancient artifacts in one place. Amazing!
"Written August 18, 2019",One of the best museum in the world,"Incredibly vast collections of artifacts on the history of human kind and cultures. Very fascinating. All national museums in the UK are free admission, including this one. There were donation boxes requesting £5, which I think was totally appropriate.Our highlights were definitely the Rosetta Stone and the mummies. Both our kids learned about the rosetta stone from their elementary and middle school teachers; they were amazed getting to see it in real life."
"Written August 18, 2019",Awesome ,Great experience and have some amazing artifacts from early Britain and the world to see.  Plus it is free.  Expect to spend a lot of time looking around 
"Written August 18, 2019",To the Victors go the spoils....and here's the museum to prove it!,"Visited with our three boys (15.14.11).  Amazing museum of artifacts from all over the world.  England ruled much of the world for a long time....and here's the spoils of war and their rule...all in one place.  Boys loved the Greek section, amazing pieces from the Parthenon.  Rosetta Stone is impressive.  Mummy exhibit is amazing.  take your time there.  Depending on how interested you and your group is, you could spend full day (or more!) here.  Guided tour would be a great idea.  We visited in the summer and it was a madhouse of tourists and selfie-taking groups.  Do some digging on recommeded times to visit.  Not sure if they do a ""late night"" like that Tate does, but if they do, hit it!  With the vast colllection and the seemingly endless crowd, our visit was a bit overwhelming.  If returning, would plan out our path a bit better and get a guided tour."
"Written August 18, 2019",Amongst the best museums in the world,"Definitely a must when you are visiting London.A few tips :- they have free eye-openers sessions throughout the day in different areas- families with small kids can go directly to the entrance, there’s a dedicated fast lane 😉- in the Parthenon gallery they have an amazing game for kids based upon augmented reality."
"Written August 18, 2019",One of the great museums in the world,An amazing collection of archaeology Items acquired when the British Empire ruled the world. Spend days going around or limit yourselves to specific areas.Laid out and displayed superbly A must for tourists and UK residents
"Written July 21, 2019",Great museum and it’s free to visit,Tons of history from hundreds and even thousands of years ago. A huge building with many different parts of human history within. Best part is that it’s free to visit. A must see if you are in london
"Written July 21, 2019",Well worth a visit ,Had a good day out here .. and learnt a lot more than I thought I knew .. definitely worth a visit .. the staff are really helpful and all we will be back 
"Written July 20, 2019",Walking off our Jet Lag,"We spent a few hours wondering through the different exhibits like the Rosetta Stone and the Parthenon friezes.  For the latter, the Museum needs to work on their displayed explanations on why they don't return objects to Greece (temperature control (it was hot in the Museum) and allowing visitors to see at eye level).  After walking around, we decided to pickup some postcards and were really excited about seeing the reading room.  We looked on the map and didn't see anything identified as the reading room so went to Information to ask.  Apparently, it is inside the the white circular building at the center of the Great Court, but were told that the reading room is not open to the public.  On the map you can buy, it actually is just a big white blank circle in the middle of the Court.  They can do a better job of communicating what is going on with the reading room.Overall, we spent maybe 2 hours here.  We found it too warm and crowded for us to prefer spending time inside than walking through different neighborhoods."
"Written July 20, 2019",A wave of humanity,"It’s a wonderful collection, and how cool is it to see the Rosetta Stone??  The museum is beautiful and clean.  We went on a day of summer rain and all of us tourists descended upon the museum.  Wow.  I must say that the reader boards are light on details.  There are some good ones in the Greek areas, but I left several areas wanting to know more.  Also, did you know that Cleopatra’s mummified body is in the museum?  They could easily devote a room to her detailing ‘her’ unique story, and her intersection with western civilization.  Not a hint."
"Written July 20, 2019",So Much History,"This museum houses some of the world's most significant artifacts, including the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles.  The museum entrance hall is bright and airy and leads to many and varied exhibits.  It is impossible to see everything in one day so you should do some research and decide which areas have the most interest for you.  One of the best things about this museum is that it is free!"
"Written July 19, 2019",5000 years of history in an afternoon ,"The Rosetta Stone - appropriately shown first for this unlocked so much of what we know. Statues of Ramses II (probably Moses’ Pharaoh), mummies of people and cats, Assyrian temple statues, collection of Greek pottery illustrating evolution of fluidity in art. Not least, the Parthenon friezes statuary (The Elgin Marbles). Stunning and beautifully displayed. We visited at a busy time ( mid-July) and in the busiest time of day (noon - 3PM) on a Friday ( a day the museum stays open late ) but it was amazing anyway. There are guided tours every 30 minutes and a self- guided audio tour. Rick Steves has an excellent audio guide to the highlights through his app. We broke for lunch halfway through our visit in the cafe -surprisingly good food. We heard the restaurant was very good too. "
"Written July 18, 2019",Great Museum.,"This museum houses some seriously famous pieces like The Rosetta Stone, The Lewis Chessmen, Hoa Hakananai'a Statue from Easter Island, Egyptian Mummies, and more. Admission is free, except for special exhibits, like Edvard Munch (The Scream), Manga, and more. Get tickets for the special exhibits in advance, since they sell out. The building is an architectural treat as well."
"Written July 17, 2019",The Morst Outstanding Museum in the World!,"You could literally spend weeks in here! I saw people with little folding stools and they would move from exhibit to exhibit and sit down to read all of the information. The highlight for me was seeing the Rosetta Stone, but in tack pottery from the time of Moses is also spectacular. This is well worth any time you can give to it. "
"Written July 16, 2019",Outstanding ,"Get there early for opening. It gets very busy by lunchtime.Go straight to the Egyptian rooms. You won’t be disappointed, and they seem to be the most popular.You can easily spend all day here."
"Written July 15, 2019",Massive permanent collections plus lots of temporary ones,"This is a place to visit everytime you have a chance.First of all, it is free!!!, for such an incredible place, works based on donations, so please, considering you are in London don't be cheap ;)For that donation, you have access to some of the greatest history collections in the world, Greek, Roman, Pre-Hispanic, Pacific, etc... beautiful... and the temporary collections are also great. You should spend there at leastttt, half day, easily a full day to see everything. Pity seeing people taking a picture of Rosetta Stone and leaving without probably understanding the meaning of that stone.... Go there if it is your first time in London, go back if it is not."
"Written July 22, 2019",Very educational!,"This is a fantastic opportunity to see the Rosetta Stone and many famous sculptures and artifacts. Bring the kids! Oh and bring your sketch pad! Great gift shop if you aren't an artist and want to bring home a piece. plus, they have a special library. "
"Written July 22, 2019",Not in the summer ,Too warm and too crowded on a summer day. If we go again it will be out of season. Not worth the long wait.
"Written July 22, 2019",Kind of wish I lived here,Cannot visit London without visiting the Museum. With exhibits from around the world and across the centuries it has near enough everything you could want to see. Went for the special Manga Exhibit and loved every second of it.
"Written July 22, 2019",The British Museum,"A great place to learn about the Ancient World in London.  Learn all about Ancient Egypt and how we used the Rosetta Stone to crack the Egyptian hieroglyphs.  Clean, informative, light, fun.  Not a stuffy museum."
"Written July 21, 2019",Museum Highlights Tour - very worthwhile,"Our family (inc 2 teenagers) visited and had rebooked the 90 minute highlight tour, through the British Museum site. This is definitely the tour to do during peak times as it gets you through the crowds and you get see the 'highlights'. You of course then are able to see more after the tour, but at least then you have your bearings and can work your way around the museum and what it has on offer. For teens (ours anyway), 90 minutes of highlights covers the main bits !Most crowded area was the Egyptian Mummy area.. Try and book a morning tour."
"Written July 21, 2019",Lots of amazing information,This is a must see when in London (it's free too). So much history on Europe and Africa that the Brits took over the years.  
"Written July 21, 2019",Elgin Marbles should be on your bucket list,"The British Museum is not to be missed.  Between the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin marbles, the Easter Island head and the fabulous Greek amphorae, you have a good share of the items that define Western civilization.  "
"Written July 21, 2019",The History of the WORLD,The British Museum is a must on any trip to London.  HUGE collection of all the major civilizations of the past.  It is warm there in the summer (fans in the corners of the rooms did not help) and very crowded.  Take your time and plan what you must see and bee line there.
"Written July 21, 2019",Big!,A beautiful collection of a variety of important artifacts around the globe.  The Rosetta stone was pretty amazing but very hard to get a good look at!
"Written July 21, 2019",Never tired of it,Must see collection on every visit to London. The museum map indicates highlights that can be followed on quick visits.Try to go on the opening time.
"Written June 12, 2019",Awesome but crowded,"This place and their collections are awesome! We arrived at 10, so crowded. Lot's of school kids 😁. Apart from the situation, it's really fun to spent half day in the museum"
"Written June 12, 2019",Good but not great,"My husband and I visited the museum on the 10th of June. It was a wet dreary day. The queue snaked around and pretty much doubled up. Fortunately one of the museums employees came around and told people that if we went around to the back street entrance, there was no queue, which was fantastic. We got in to the museum in no time at all. The exhibits are good. They are grouped based on countries and culture. The Egyptian section was the most interesting, but extremely crowded. The Japan, African and Chinese exhibits were also very interesting as they dated back quite a bit. Some of the artefacts were exquisite.The layout is a bit confusing. They have numbers at the doorway to each country section, but when we went looking for the additional parts for the Egyptian section, they were nowhere to be found. So we gave up. Go prepared with water and some munchies, as I at can be quite tiring. They do have benches dotted around the place on each floor, as well as lifts, which certainly helps. I think there is a cafe in there somewhere as well. It’s free to visit, which is an added bonus 👍."
"Written June 12, 2019",Need another visit (or 2),"This was our first trip to The British Museum and it was wonderful! Although I'm not a huge museum ""buff"" it was totally amazing to visit and the exhibits seemed almost endless. To do it justice you really need a few hours here or even dedicate a full day. Even then, it would be tough to be able to see ""everything"". We managed to see many of the highlights and main exhibits so were very satisfied with the visit. Next time in London we'll do another visit and see the areas we missed the first time."
"Written June 11, 2019",Amazing Place,"Apart from the fact one needs at least a full week to appreciate all that is here, it was a remarkable set of exhibits.  We appreciated the maintenance and upgrades of the Egyptian exhibits"
"Written June 10, 2019",Fabulous for those who like ancient history.,"Track the evolution of civilisation, the start of cities, the start and evolution of customs such as burials, from the middle East, Egypt, Africa and Europe.  Marvel at the technology and metallurgy of the time.  Admire the craftsmanship of the spinners, weavers, artisans and jewellers from 4000 years ago.  Can you make the same things? I am wearing an Italian gold chain with an interesting spring-loaded clasp I saw on an ancient Egyptian necklace. Go to the toilet wherever you can because they are very few and far between and located mainly in the modern renovations to the museum.  Staff always seem to be helpful and understand the difficulties you might be having. Five stars for the staff."
"Written June 10, 2019",Wonderful Museum,This is a wonderful museum to visit and holds many of the world's treasures. Be prepared to be mobbed as the crowds are quite heavy. The price is well worth it...free. :)
"Written June 10, 2019",Waited a lifetime,"This was a bucket list trip for me. Blocked out the entire day to spend here, and I did.You can seriously get lost in this place, even with a map. "
"Written July 30, 2019",Must See,The British Museum is a definite must see.  It has so many different items to see and experience.  Some of the exhibits are an additional cost.  We did some research before going to get a good idea of the items that we wanted to see at the museum.  Definitely doable without a guide if you like just wandering around.
"Written July 29, 2019",Great with Kids,I had first visited this museum as a kid myself so going back as an adult with my own children was so much fun.  My girls 12 & 10 loved it.  They especially loved all the Egyptian artifacts.  This is a great place to visit with our without kids.  And the free admission is a bonus 😉
"Written July 28, 2019",Best part of the vacation,We easily spent half the week working through the exhibits. The only thing I would suggest to them is more fans in the summer time in the ancient areas on the second floor.
"Written July 28, 2019",A great museum,The british museum is one of my favorite museums in the world. Endless exhibitions ranging from ancient Egypt to a room about modern currency. Everyone can find something they will find interesting.I visited during Edward Munch special exhibition on its last day and it was incredible.
"Written July 27, 2019",Massive free museum,"We spent over four hours here and still missed large portions of the place.  Best to space out over a couple days if you can afford the time.  Very educational and impressive.  The museum is free.  On the day we went the line took only 5 minutes to get through.  After two and a half hours we decided to take a break and went across the street for some tea.  We then went back to the museum for another two hours.  Same quick entry and again free.The Assyrian collection, the clocks collection, and the Nereid Monument (in the Greek collection) were among the greatest highlights.  This museum is a must if you have more than a day or two in London.  The gift shop here is enormous.  You'll want to set aside some extra time for the shop if you're looking for a gift for anyone.  Impressive amount of cool history books for kids and adults."
"Written July 26, 2019",A fab museum,"So much to see, needs more than one visit. Beware it gets incredibly busy so looking at the exhibits can be tricky, especially the more famous ones and especially for children. So go early or at the end of the day.The Egyptian rooms are obvious favourites! Such things to see."
"Written July 25, 2019",Rosetta Stone and the mummies,Great place for children.  We decided to limit our visit to delve deeper into what we saw instead of broad shallow gaze at what the great museum can offer.  This gave us the real example to touch upon a part of history with the Rosetta Stone.  The mummies were completely different from what we have in Louvre.  It gave the children different feel of the mummies and how it looked like.  The preserved mummies gave us another topic to touch upon.
"Written July 24, 2019",Vast Collection and beautiful architecture,"We went in July during 25 degree weather. Inside the museum, only those rooms with fabric or paper are air-conditioned. Can’t imagine how some of those workers coped with the stifling heat. It was 28-30 inside. The collection itself is impressive, especially the mummies, the Egyptian artifacts, and the Greek rooms of the remnants from the Temple of Apollo. My son was especially impressed with the Manga exhibit. Be sure to check where the bathrooms are, because the ones beside the central bookshop are always crowded. I walked over to another one and it was empty. The workers there are very kind and helpful, especially the gentleman in the jewelry shop who wrapped our treasures well and gave us recommendations for further explorations in the city."
"Written July 24, 2019",Great Museum,"So much to see. Especially loved the mummies. The museum is bright, exhibitions are wonderful. There are guided visits who h we did not do."
"Written June 9, 2019",Magnificent,The British museum remains one of my favourite museums and I have been world wide. Try to go to a lunchtime gallery talk which are free and fascinating to broaden your knowledge to areas maybe you haven’t looked into. The security is vital so I’m afraid you have to put up with it and most museums abroad charge hefty ticket prices so I think they should be applauded. They have children’s activities at weekends and holidays too!
"Written June 9, 2019",Lots of artifacts,Was not on our original plans but as it was free we decided to check it out as not much else in London is free.  Well worth the visit as there is a lot to see and you could spend a lot of time there if you wanted to.
"Written June 9, 2019",Plan extra time!,"If you love museums, culture and history, ignore all the “suggested time to spend” recommendations for this museum. They are much, much too short. We spent 4.5 hours here, and only had time for 1 gallery, 1 short, free tour, and a quick lunch in the museum. That being said, we didn’t have any children/teens with us...The only negative thing I have to say is that the tour groups were somewhat overwhelming. There were a lot of them, and they were large, making it sometimes difficult to view items, or finish viewing items. The museum docent-led tour we did was informative (and free). The tour times are posted in several locations, and there are several different ones. We also enjoyed the audio guide, which is available from the information area for a small fee."
"Written July 23, 2019",Don't go on a hot day in summer!,"Sadly our visit was marred by the heat and lack of air in the building.  No attempt to help visitors - not a fan in sight anywhere!!  Food for sale was out in the heat, including things with chicken in and cream .  Cakes, etc all out with no covers on so could be coughed and sneezed on by people waiting to be served. Then nowhere to sit down.  It's quite frustrating to have so many attempts to sell you food without providing sufficient places to sit and consume them.  Many people ended up sitting on the stairs, which made getting past tricky at times.  Not enough ladies loos so queues there too. One I visited had the only two hand dryers out of order and no paper towels. Also I saw a visitor try both sanitary products machines and neither worked. I felt totally ashamed at the service we were offering foreign visitors.  More attention needs to be given to the visitors experience.Lastly, although it says bags will be searched, with is fair enough for safety, it would help if they also told you that some items will be confiscated.  I was not allowed to take in a small pair of scissors used for crochet.  I got them back at the end of the visit but it meant going back across the museum to get them.  Such a shame as what little we were able to see was good. We won't be returning though."
"Written June 7, 2019",Budget for a day if you want to see it all!,"We went back specifically to see all the Egyptian rooms, and they were as impressive as I remembered.  I especially appreciated that they added several documents proving providence of the works.  The collection is stunning."
"Written June 5, 2019",One of my favorites,You can't go wrong with a free visit to the British Museum. Even if you on skim the surface and stay for an hour. Check out the Rosetta Stone and the Lewis Chessmen and some of the other highlights or spend a few hours and see a lot more.  
"Written June 5, 2019",All world in the one place,You can find here the whole collection of the most precious things from around the world. Such an important place to visit. The architecture is also wonderful.
"Written June 5, 2019",So much history in one place!,"Don’t miss this museum if you’re in London. I loved how much you can learn about the world in such a short window. If you have limited time, it’s worth downloading an audio tour (like Rick Steves) to see the highlights efficiently. "
"Written June 4, 2019",Best antiquities museum,"If you’ve been all over Europe and seen enough art, this is the museum for you.I could spend a lifetime just looking at the Egyptian artifacts.  Mummies and sarcophaguses were a site to be seen.  I can’t wait to go back - and by the way, it’s free.  How can you beat free!! "
"Written June 4, 2019",Amazing Collection,"We went on a Friday and the line outdoors was probably 300 people long. One of the guards noticed my cane and opened a pathway directly to the door or outdoor lift which we used. Loved the Egyptian Rooms and the timepieces, many dating back to the 1500s to 1800's. Elevators available and benches scattered for those who need a respite. We tried the cafe; had a very nice pizza and lemoncello flavored poundcake. A delightful day."
"Written June 3, 2019","Saw the China Exhibition, missed the Manga","There are always new exhibitions on show, I went there recently to catch the Manga exhibition, however due to poor planning on our side, it was sold out. Learning, if you really want to see something book in advance!"
"Written June 3, 2019",For anyone interested in Egyptology this is not to be missed,"A very extensive collection of Egyptian tomb relics as well as items from  neighboring areas.  Could have literally spent days there, so much to see and take in.  Best part is admission is free.  "
"Written June 1, 2019","An All-Encompassing, Overwhelmingly Jam-Packed Review of Human Civilization","We're a curious pair, my wife and I, and we revel in learning new segments of knowledge that make human civilization for comprehensible and the British Museum accomplishes that more than any other we've visited, with the possible exception of the Met in NYC.   When the British Empire ruled most of the world, their soldiers and explorers surveyed the remnants of prior empires and brought back to England the choicest samples of what was accomplished long ago.   We learn about ancient Egyptian culture through the Rosetta Stone; Greek gods and art through the Elgin Marbles;  the glories of ancient Assyria, Babylonia, Persia and others through artifacts and relics saved from oblivion by intrepid Englishmen in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.   To really delve into the contents of the British Museum, be prepared to spend many hours and to devote much of your brain capacity to the extraordinary treasure trove of materials on display. "
"Written May 31, 2019",Lots to see from all over the world,Great selection of stuff from all over the world.  Need to have a plan before entering or you will get overwelmed by all the differnt things to see.
"Written May 26, 2019",Well presented but exhausting,"The British Museum is great, but it's even too great - trying to see even the shortlisted rooms is impossible during one visit. When going, be prepared for the safety inspection at the door!"
"Written May 25, 2019",Awe-inspiring,"The British Museum is amazing. There is so much to see and do you either have to devote a full day or plan your route accordingly - due to a time constraint we only were able to spend a couple of hours and devoted it to a few areas. We started with the Egyptian areas as we knew there would be a lot, and boy it did not disappoint. It is sad to realize most of this stuff was “looted” back in the day. But we loved viewing it all and reading the history. Our next area was Ancient Greece and it too did not disappoint. Due to time we did not look at more modern Europe or other areas. Overall well worth the visit."
"Written May 24, 2019",Awe-inspiring! Too much to take in,"Whatever interests you is likely to be found here.  Exhibits are wide-ranging, with opportunities for hands-on learning with museum docents.  A gem!"
"Written May 24, 2019",Visit through history,"The place is huge, entry is free but you need to pay for the temporary exhibitions. One can easily spend a day in the museum, or just visit the part of history that interests. "
"Written May 23, 2019",Excellent place to visit,The British Museum is a great place to visit for both locals & tourists alike. Great exhibitions & items on show - the building architecture is also amazing and you can easily spend the whole day there as I have done on several occasions. Worth a visit for 1 or several hours.
"Written May 21, 2019",A must in London for history lovers,"We visited these rooms with a couple of friends and in spite of our time limitations spent there more than an hour.The exhibition is well organized, you learn a lot, you get a feeling of what people having lived there experienced.In short worth visiting, particularly for history lovers."
"Written May 20, 2019",Amazing,Don't miss this museum.  Have a plan or make one when you get there as there is too much to absorb in one visit without it.  The Museum has handy maps/booklets which help.
"Written May 19, 2019",Inspiring. ,"Big and beautiful. Full of wonders from around the world. They really do push the ""donation"" on entry but it is voluntary. Drinks are expensive and few for a hot day in a near all glass central building but with so many floors of fine exhibits its worth it. Real mummies. Egyptian statues, fine art. Guided tours throughout. "
"Written May 18, 2019",Pleasant visit!,"The collection is huge and really well organized. Using the free map you can move around pretty easily. Moreover, the shops are lovely!"
"Written May 18, 2019",Everything I expected,"We came for the Egyptian display.  We stayed for the Greek, Roman, Iran, Viking, etc collections.  Once we started wandering, we just kept going. There’s so much to see and read.  All displays had descriptions along with dates.  It was fascinating."
"Written July 15, 2019",Expansive Collection Worth Visiting,"The British Museum is amazing. So many artefacts from civilisations around the world. It is a photographer’s delight - Greece, Egypt, the Roman Empire, Africa, etc, etc. Mind you whilst there is a lot to see, there are lots of people there as well. Lots of groups and individuals all walking in different directions. Simply amazing. Entrance is free but they ask for a 5 pound donation. It is worth every penny."
"Written July 11, 2019",Wonderful museum,"I loved visiting The British Museum.  There are so many wonderful things to see and experience.  I paid to visit the special Edvard Munch exhibit, and it was well worth it.  I only wish I had spent more time here."
"Written July 11, 2019",Amazing museum with a myriad of exhibits,"The museum is huge, so plan on spending an hour and a half at the very least. The mummies are not ideal for squeamish individuals."
"Written July 10, 2019",An Excellent Musuem,"The things you can view in the British Museum are unbelievable and they have spaced them nicely so you can go around them in many directions instead of just past a perimeter.  The museum welcomes many people and it didn't seem too crowded when we went.  You must come through security which took about 10 minutes.  There is no admission price, but you can make a donation, if you wish to.  Some areas do not have air conditioning and they are quite hot.  We were told this is due to the harm that AC can do to the artifacts.  The cafe on the 3rd floor was serving beautiful trays for High Tea.  Had we not recently eaten we would have loved to have had the chance to stay.  "
"Written July 9, 2019",One of the best but most crowded,"I really appreciate the fact without paying you can enter the museum to see most of the exhibition, however, having too many visitors in the museum kind of made the experience less good. A stunning collection of Asian treasures."
"Written July 3, 2019",So much to look at,If you are spending a lot of time in London this is worth a visit as there is so much to look and it is a interesting building. If you’re only in London for a few days it wouldn’t be at the top of the list 
"Written June 26, 2019",American Mom and 12 Year Old Son,Free- Gorgeous.  Extended hours on Friday.  Many unique displays.  The Rosetta Stone in person.  A little crowded.
"Written June 23, 2019",Everyone should see this!,"The amount of history packed into this museum is amazing. It's free to get in but I recommend buying a map for a couple pounds. You will need it unless you just plan to walk through every area which could take hours. We didn't have enough time to spend all day there so I looked online at the top things to see there and used that to focus on the general areas that I wanted to concentrate on. The Egyptian, Roman, and Greek areas were my favorites. I couldn't believe I was actually looking at THE Rosetta Stone. The Elgin marbles which came from the Parthenon were also spectacular. There were so many breathtaking things to see from small artifacts to huge statues. "
"Written June 23, 2019",Museum is great,Wow!  There is history here that I do not think you will find anyplace else.  What era are you interested in?  It is there.  Most (if not all) of the globe is covered.
"Written June 22, 2019",Great Exhibits & Exhibitions,"We went to see the Edvard Munch Exhibition at the British Museum. The Exhibition was easy to find and well crafted, with many original works by this influential artist. There were clear descriptions of Munch’s main sources of inspiration, with several touching backstories. We also had a quick look at some of the other impressive exhibits, including the Egyptian mummies and the Chinese and South Asian artefacts. Well worth a visit!"
"Written May 31, 2019",So much to see,"World famous collection of artefacts from different civilsations. Can get very crowded. Search alternative loos e.g. in the basement as the queues can be long. Not particularly child friendly unless the child is happy to look but not touch. Great shop for history gifts. Exhibitions are generally wonderful but go early to avoid crowds. Allow time to go through security check at the entrance. There can be a long queue. Cafe in main hall, pizza cage near main entrance."
"Written May 31, 2019",Wonderful place,I love the Buildings and each exhibition part. Was going 16 km inside the museum. The pizza in the reastaurant is very good.
"Written May 30, 2019",Vast collection of ancient art and artifacts.,The museum hosts a vast collection of ancient art and artifacts.  We spent most of our time in the anciect Egyptian section.  We especially enjoyed the mummies and elaborately painted sarcophagi.
"Written May 30, 2019",A must-see for everyonw,"The British Museum is a true international treasure. This amazing collection of historic and historical artifacts is second to none. The Greek and Roman collections alone could consume a full day. In addition to the main collections, the Museum regularly has additional collections available to visitors for an extra fee. Depending on your interests, this may be worth investigating before your visit. In fact, visitors should do their homework before going to ensure they see their areas of interest first. Not surprisingly, the crowds are constant at the Museum, so make sure you know where you want to go in advance. It’s also possible to buy tickets in advance, which is a good idea. "
"Written May 29, 2019",So much to see!,"This was my 2nd favorite stop (1st being the Tower of London). Best bang for your buck, since it's free! They ask for a small donation, and I would suggest doing so. The museum is out of this world. The sheer size of the collection is astounding dating from the earliest humans to current art. I dreamed of being Indiana Jones as a kid, so seeing the Egyptian and Greek/Roman collection was by far my favorite. There is so much to see - make sure you carve out enough time or break it down into a couple of days."
"Written May 29, 2019",Embarrassed,Museums used to be a calm place of reflection and education - this has turned into a concrete monstrosity with begging bowls at every turn and doorway - from being directed at the entrance to a donation line to every twist and turn of the building it screams gimme gimee - what happened to a cultural experience - embarrassed to be British!!
"Written May 28, 2019",Too much to see,It's crazy how many items the museum has. A flight of stairs is its own attraction. The audio tour is worth it (£7). The gift shop is fantastic. Just do it.
"Written May 28, 2019",The British Museum is much more than that.,"The British Museum is a fabulous place to visit and it is free to enter. The museum has a staggering amount of artifacts to see and one day just isn't enough time to get round, but if that is all you have, don't be put off by that, choose the things you most want to see and do that. Eating and drinking on any tourist site in London will cost the earth, so if you are happy to pay the over the top prices all well and good, if not make other arrangements.I can not recommend this museum enough, if you haven't been, you must."
"Written May 27, 2019",Large and munch,"Came here more for the edvard munch exhibit admittedly. The musem itself is beautiful and the great hall designed by norman foster in 2000. The 8 million artefacts here dwarve the lourve’s 300,000. Sadly a section was donated by the opiod sackler family"
"Written May 26, 2019",Amazing Museum!! ,If you love world history and artifacts then this is the museum for you. I must admit I didn’t know much about this museum however it was recommended by a friend so I figured I’d try it out. I’m so glad I did! There are 70 different galleries and exhibits to see from all over the world. You literally need a day or two to see it all. I found myself amazed by everything I saw. If you’re short for time they have a suggested guide/map that tells you what exhibits you should see and where they’re located. Oh did I mention that it’s FREE?! If you’re in London it’s a must see! 
"Written May 8, 2019",Great museum,"Worth a visit, plan your day so you have at least 4h, hudge museum, great for adults and scool kinds. Free entry. "
"Written May 8, 2019",Holding the world's treasures in escrow,"The BM is literally a trip around the world in 80 days. In the space of a lazy afternoon you will gain an appreciation for the histories of many countries the British Empire has ""visited"" and the beautiful items these cultures produce. Almost all of the exhibits are interesting in their unique cultural context; many simply are breath-taking. To experience all of this in a single location; I can hardly think of a better place than the BM. "
"Written May 7, 2019",Amazing collection of Human History,"Went to this Gorgeous Museum on a Friday morning in the month of April, 2019. It was packed, and lots of people on line (remember, entrance is free). Nevertheless, the lines moved quickly and they have special lines for families with children. There is a Map that you can purchase when you enter the facility for 2L. It indicates in a precise way on which levels are the countries collections placed. They have places where you can deposit contributions for keeping it modern, clean, and entrance for free. The collections are so well organized, and so complete, that you just can't believe they have such artifacts, images, preserved mommies and bodies in just one place. You should go first to the Egyptian Site. It is huge and very complete. Then, the collection of stones, tombs and all kinds of crafts built in the ancient world is hard not to remember. In sum, you should plan at least 2 days to spend in this Museum, in order for you to be able to take a glimpse of what they have acquired and preserved for the humanity in all these years. Again, I thank the British Philantrophy for providing such an educational experience to the tourists and their natives for free. You won't regret visiting this historical and well-preserved place."
"Written May 7, 2019",Great Exhibition,"We visited the Edvard Munch love and angst exbibition of prints, including a number of prints of/related to the iconic The Scream.  Well worth a viewing. Catch it before it closes on 21 July 2019."
"Written May 6, 2019",A must see in London if you love museums,"A lot of incredible history.  If you have children, watch Night At The Museum 3 to get inspired.  They have the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles amongst many other collections.  As well as special exhibitions that you can look ahead of time.  We did a scavenger hunt sponsored through an independent organization called THATMuse.  Check it out.  Makes it quite the experience"
"Written May 5, 2019",Exceptional,Wonderful museum. One of my favorites. I wish I had more time to see everything but I was glad it was open late on friday. Make the time to visit. 
"Written May 4, 2019",Very massive and interesting museum,"It's a massive museum! They have huge collections of the Roman's, Egyptians, history of money, clocks, etc! What interested me most is the mummy collections! This is recommended for all ages! "
"Written May 3, 2019",amazing collection of the world's historic artefacts,"Huge museum with unique pieces from history. Personal highlights were the Rosetta Stone and The Elgin Marbles. Expect crowds and give yourself time to get from room to room. Free admission, donation recommended."
"Written May 3, 2019",Just as fascinating no matter how many times I go,"I visit the British Museum every time I am in London.  The building, the collection, the atmosphere - all are awe inspiring.  The Egyptian collection can be seen over and over again.  It is large enough that you never feel squashed by crowds and you can wander off and find quiet corners.  On top of all this admission is free."
"Written May 3, 2019",Very interesting,Has some very old stuff in there!!!Really worth a visit.Allow at least 2 - 3 hours to have a good look around.
"Written June 22, 2019",Huge Museum Great Egyptian collection,"Of course you have to take a photo of the Rosetta Stone! I was hoping the Magna Carta was here too but I didn't get to the British Library where a copy is kept, bummer. It has amazing Egyptian collections but we really enjoyed the Asian section - small but well curated and very well represented of the many cultures of the East, not just China and Japan. We spent almost the whole day there and my 12 year old was not bored at all."
"Written June 21, 2019",So much to see!!!,We planned to spend about 2 hours at the British Museum and take in as much as possible. The galleries go on and on and on....I’m sure you could visit many times and still discover something new! The museum certainly is a national treasure.
"Written June 20, 2019",A Day at the Museum,"It would probably take at least 3 full days to see all that is at this museum.  We spent our day mostly in the Egyptian, Roman and Greek areas.  It was very educational and amazing."
"Written June 20, 2019",Great!,"First of all it’s free so if you have the time why not go? There are a lot of amazing things here such as Egyptian, Roman and Greek artifacts. "
"Written June 16, 2019",Crack for history makors,"I cannot possibly type enough here to justify the scope of this museum.  It is unlike any other in the world.  All historical era, ages, and regions are accounted for here.This is the mothership of history.  Due it justify and spend a whole day here.  5-6 hours minimum.  "
"Written June 16, 2019",Come in the quieter north entrance to avoid criwds,"You’ll have tourist crowds her no matter when you come (for good reason-it’s amazing!) so avoid the main entrance and come in the north side, not the south. There’s a cursory security bag check but it’s fast.Once inside, pick up the map to help you focus your visit. It has a guide for highlights in an hour that’s good for a quick tour.Even better, do your research ahead of time so you know which areas to visit. You can’t see it all in a day so don’t run around trying. My approach is to pick 10-12 areas/items of interest and make a scavenger hunt of sorts out of it. Once done, my visit is complete for this trip. Next visit, I’ll choose another focus area. No one gets cranky this way!"
"Written June 16, 2019",London May 2019,There is SO MUCH history to see her.  One could easily spend and entire day here and still not see all the amazing artifacts.  The Rosetta Stone is a must see as well as the Egyptian mummies.  
"Written June 15, 2019",Amazingly educational,"We loved the British Museum. So much to see, I would recommend taking the whole day here. The collection of Egyptian pieces was great and it was amazing to see the pieces of the Parthenon and learn about it."
"Written June 13, 2019",Must See when in London,"The museum is overwhelming, but outstanding. There are very valuable tours to take advantage of. We had a guide to see biblical areas in the museum. It was fantastic. For a person interested in Biblical history, I highly recommend it."
"Written June 13, 2019",Spectacular treasures from all the world,It is amazing the number of antiquities that the British have accumulated over the years from all around the room. There are artifacts from just about every Ancient society. You could spend a month here and not see everything. We especially enjoyed the huge number of Egyptian and Iranian relics and artifacts. I don’t believe there’s anywhere else in the world that has a collection like this.
"Written May 17, 2019",Worth a visit,This is a place you could easily spend a whole day in if you wanted. So many interesting and informative displays. It gets extremely busy so good to get in early. 
"Written May 17, 2019",Glad we visited during our short visit to London from Australia,With only a short time in London we had to prioritise what to visit and we are so glad we chose the British Museum. It was extremely busy however we loved seeing extremely famous exhibits such as the Rosetta Stone however equally as interesting seeing lesser known artefacts such as the game of Ur. We finished our time at the museum with high tea which was splendid.
"Written May 17, 2019",Must-go,"A lot of collections and i guess one should plan ahead which zones you are interested in and if you are in a hurry, just grab the map and go to find the must see!"
"Written May 17, 2019",For everyone,"There is something to see for everyone at the British Museum. You could spend the week in this amazing museum but if you do not have much time let your children guide you and make some new discoveries, it more fun for them!"
"Written May 16, 2019",Unbelievable space,Enormous light filled atrium welcomes the visitors.  A huge variety of exhibitions and displays.  Well laid out. Could spend several days here.
"Written May 16, 2019",British ??,"Sorry, to me it was a collection of ""prizes"" the British empire plundered whilst on a series of jollies, quality material, rather, in my opinion, placed thro-out the museum with no real start/end, much more enjoyable at the Imperial War museum, every-body to their own!!"
"Written May 16, 2019",Yet another great one.....,British museum is another great place in London to spend an afternoon.  Elgin Marbles a MUST SEE.  But so is everything else.One of the BEST gift shops around.
"Written May 16, 2019",London ,All museums are free in London. The British Museum is very good. Beware they set you up for a donation as part of the entry process s d there are donation boxes everywhere throughout the museum. We made a donation on our way out once we had an appreciation of it. We also go sucked into buying a map between the entry doors and the information area inside. There are free maps inside! The Egyptian section was my favorite. I’m biased as we were in Egypt last year. Allow a few hours for this one.
"Written May 15, 2019",Worth the wait,"Big lines on the weekends. Don't carry a bag and you will pass thru quickly. The different areas are amazing and the centre glass roof is awesome . Greek, Roman, Mummys are all on display. . Grab a map."
"Written May 14, 2019",A must see in London,"I took the audio tour, the one that had 20 stops around the museum. For 6 pounds I got a great exposure to most of the exhibits in about 3 hours.  I loved this museum but I highly recommend a guided or audio tour otherwise it may be overwhelming. I plan to go back with my son when he is a little older."
"Written May 13, 2019",Amazing ,"There is so much to see, you can easily spend a whole day there. There is also a couple of cafes inside to keep you going. "
"Written May 13, 2019","Impressive, endless, very interesting.","One of the most spectacular museums in the world! They have a complete collection of all cultures, but what impressed me most were those of Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia."
"Written May 12, 2019",Munch exhibition,"I went purely to go to Edvard Munch special exhibition this time (travelled 200 mi). Excellent collection, thoughtfully presented (I’m not arty one by the way). The space was well planned, pleasant place to be & informative, interesting display. I thought whoever planned it had a lot of thoughts into it & made a fantastic job of it. I recommend booking tickets online in advance. I’d seen a lot of tourists just passing by & wanted to get in, only to be turned away at the door as the tickets for the day had sold out already.While you’re there, the new(-ish) Japanese gallery on the top floor is worth a visit. The last time (summer 2018) we were there, it was closed, so visited for the 1st time. I was impressed they had “Haniwa” & other items rarely seen nor known outside Japan."
"Written May 12, 2019",Amazing place!,"If your intention is to see the whole museum, you may need a week.  I particularly enjoyed the Egyptian galleries.  Many great pieces to see from all over the world.  We used the hopper bus to travel there."
"Written May 12, 2019",Great antiquities! Schedule time for this museum.,"We have centered several trips to London around a visit to the museum. The Brits have acquired some of the world's most prestigious ancient artifacts from Egypt, Greece, and Rome.The centerpiece of the museum, the Rosetta Stone, is a must-see!  "
"Written May 12, 2019",Definitely worth going!!!,Great collection and definitely worth visiting. I do recommend arriving early when the museum opens as there is usually a long line outside. The entrance is free. I loved the entire Egyptian and Islamic World collection.
"Written May 11, 2019",Hartwig! Bring back the Paleolithics!,"Among glitter and gold, priceless artifacts, and unimagined treasure, I saw a lady at a stand holding a simple rock. She told visitors that it was the oldest thing they would ever hold. I took her up on the offer. She told me it was nearly half a million years old and from the site that defined the Acheulean industry. I felt deeply connected to this ancient homo erectus as I realized that this is the tool that built all other tools. The flintknapped hand-axe was perfectly balanced in my palm. I’m a software developer doing the very same thing today. Thank you British Museum for this truly magic moment. Hartwig Fischer – please bring back the paleolithic exhibitions in full."
"Written May 9, 2019",So many things to see,"You can easily spend whole day here. To make it more fruitful, focus on a few items that you targeted to see."
"Written May 8, 2019",Amazing,"Get a good grasp of prehistory by visiting the outstanding British Museum. Be prepared to look at many wonderful little things, and read! You will learn much!"
"Written May 8, 2019",Perfect activity on a rainy day,"Loads to see, sometimes would be nice to have interactive displays rather than old fashioned things behind glass displays. We loved the ancient Egypt display.  Very crowded on the weekends, however its completely free. Lovely restaurant on the mezzanine in the large hall, serving excellent cakes and light meals."
"Written May 2, 2019",Worth the time spent,"This is a wonderful place just full of exhibits and information and it is free!   In order to do this right you need to plan in several hours so you can enjoy the artifacts and information, not to mention this is a beautiful building!  It would be a wonderful way to spend a rainy afternoon!  Worth the time invested."
"Written May 2, 2019",Best museum ,I'm highly rated this museum over Louvre as you can learn more things from the museum. In Louvre ypu couldn't find any details in English but in British museum they took maximum effort to ellustrate historical details. Don't forget to see the Thara devi sculpture from Sri Lanka. 
"Written May 2, 2019",7 hours well spent,"The best collection of artefacts from Britain and around the globe in one central location. Many people have noted how these were acquired over the centuries, however, the expert care and attention to preservation is something that I appreciate.I recommend getting there early, it’s busy. Wear layers of clothes; some galleries are hot. Also, bring water. Food places throughout had small but well made food and cakes for pit stops. "
"Written April 24, 2019",Huge musuem,"Second time there and we found new stuff to see. The museum is huge and covers many centuries, a real must if you like history."
"Written April 23, 2019",Wow,I spend two days combing the treasures of this marvelous place. At the time there was an Edvard Munch exhibition on. Easy to lose days here. Just loved it.
"Written April 21, 2019",I Love This Museum,"Honestly, I’m not a fan of too many museums even though I’ve been to more than 50 of them. However, I absolutely love this one and I tell everyone to go if in London.  It’s large, free and easy to navigate with such interesting artifacts. I would highly recommend it!"
"Written April 21, 2019",A must when visiting London,"It was a great experience to come here for the first time and see their expositions, and the Egyptian and Greek rooms, Many families come here to admire and walk around the exhibits. Do not miss it!"
"Written April 20, 2019",Beautiful buildings ,"These buildings are stunning outside and in. Although it was a hot bank holiday when we decided to go, the que’s looked long so we almost turned around and left but actually only lasted around 15 minutes.As it was so busy inside we literally only saw 2 sections (Egyptian and European) before deciding that we had enough and decided to escape the boards of people walking in different directions."
"Written April 16, 2019","Lots of exciting exhibits, extremely well presented.","There is so much to see! Everything is well presented and organized, in numbered rooms.All the Egyptian relics is a must see in its own"
"Written April 14, 2019",book a private tour to beat the crowds,"History of the world, and it's free.  Booked a private tour (several available topic/period specific).  Good way to avoid the lines.  Would also recommend non holidays or weekends.  It is so amazing to see in person the worlds antiquities.  A must for any visitor to London!"
"Written April 14, 2019",The Rosetta Stone and so much more,"We could spend days in the British Museum and not see all there is, but the 3 hours or so we invested there were richly rewarded with photos and memories of a lifetime"
"Written April 14, 2019",Still the best museum I have ever visited,"Revisited for the first time in 15 years, still blows you away with the artifacts from around the world, my favourite of course being Egypt! Amazing place for historical knowledge, no other comparison...yet!"
"Written April 13, 2019",Wouldn't miss it,The British Museum is a must-see when in London. So many fascinating exhibits spanning thousands of years. We really enjoyed it until the entire building became overrun by hundreds of students on field trips. Time your visit carefully! My favorite part of the museum had to be the many Egyptian artifacts as well as the even earlier Mesapotamian and Sumerian artifacts.
"Written April 11, 2019",overwhelming but so amazing,"Those Brits- they have treasures from every corner of the world, and they are all in the British Museum.  It's a great museum to visit your first jet lagged day in London, because there is no way you can be bored there.  Simply amazing!!!"
"Written April 9, 2019",There is so much to see,This place is pretty big.  There are so many interesting items to see.  You definitely need more than just an afternoon to check it all out.  I loved seeing all that we had time to see.  If I ever get another chance to go to the British Museum I definitely would visit again.
"Written April 7, 2019",Amazing,"Simply amazing place.  The collection of antiquities is mind blowing, especially when the cost of the museum if free.  The Egyptian collection of mummies are incredible, but to stand in front of the Rosetta Stone absolutely is a breathtaking experience.  The museum is very crowded, even early in the morning and there are lots of school children, but Hubby and I were not in a hurry, so we were able to take our time and see everything we wanted to see.  A definite stop while in London."
"Written April 5, 2019",Why is this such a secret,"Loved every minute of our three hours here and had to rush the Victorians onwards as it was closing. Have to go back and do this wonderful museum justice , hope to bring my grandchildren , they would love it ."
"Written April 4, 2019",Quick visit...,"Only had about 2 hours to walk through parts of the Museum.  I takes a few minutes to get oriented but, staff was very helpful and it was a great visit and the museum is truly amazing. "
"Written April 2, 2019",Absolutely  love this place,Amazing architecture and great exhibitions. Everything is so well thought towards visitors. Go back every time. 
"Written March 31, 2019",Amazing Treasures,This beautiful building contains a mind boggling amount of displays from all over the world and its free to visit. Its must see attraction.
"Written January 1, 2019",A simply “must do” on your London vacation punch list,"One could argue that vacationing in London and not taking in the British Museum would be culturally criminal.  There are few places on the planet where one can take a half day out of your vacation time to see some of the world most exceptional marvels and masterpieces….Van Gough, Picasso, Monet to name a few.  Then there are the historical exhibits, the Egyptian the most impressive.  There is something for everyone, including the dubious “Crystal Skull” for all you fellow Ancient Alien freaks.  Yes, the line is around the block, but it moves fast (2 blocks and I got in in 42 minutes), its free and you will be a better person after your visit…not to mention now owning one of the better lead ins into party conversion: “Well yes, while visiting the British Museum in London recently……”"
"Written December 31, 2018",Tremendous Collection Spanning Centuries,Most impressive collection of Egyptian mummies and artifacts. Great collection from Persia and other parts of the ancient world. Gets very crowded as the day progressed.
"Written December 30, 2018",Alway a wonderful place to visit while in London,"I try to visit this museum every time I am in London. Other than being free, this museum offers a wonderful collections and history to experience worthy of multi-days stays."
"Written December 29, 2018",Great place to visit,One of the best museums I have visited in the life. Great collection of Mesopotamia and other civilizations. I could spend only half a day. Will go again to spend a couple of days
"Written December 28, 2018",My favorite London visit,"This amazing Museum, next to MoMA are definitely my most favorite museums in the world.You can spend hours and hours inside the galleries, enjoying every single display. I always go back to this lovely place."
"Written December 28, 2018",A special visit for my dad's 70th to one of the greatest world museums,"I think this is one of the greatest museums in the world, for four reasons:- the quality of the collections- the architecture of the building itself- the amazing free tours- the fact that entry is free!You could easily spend days in here- or, like I have, discover it over many years. When I first moved to London more than ten years ago and I didn't have much spare cash, one of my favourite treats was to go to this museum and access culture as if I was a king. The best thing I used to do was to go on the free tours, staffed by volunteers- I must have been on about 10 different ones. Every one was fantastic and sometimes there were few other visitors on the tour- I think once there were just three of us. The volunteers are real specialists in their subjects- for example the Egypt specialist could read hieroglyphics- and their passion helps to bring the exhibits alive in a way I can seldom experience just from wandering around on my own.For my Dad's 70th birthday I was taking him on a trip and we were passing through London, so my wife and I brought him here. He loves learning about history so I knew he would enjoy it. We easily got onto a tour (you just turn up at a meeting point in the relevant gallery, you don't need to book) and had a fantastic time.We are so lucky to have this amazing place in our country."
"Written December 27, 2018",Well Worth a Visit,Absolutely brilliant place to visit with many interesting exhibits to see I would highly recommend.  To see such pivotal Items as the Rosetta stone really made my day I could easily have spent several days looking around instead of the few hours I actually had.
"Written December 21, 2018",A Trip Through History,"The British Museum has so much to see, you have to make choices.  I would advise getting to the museum when it opens and plan on spending as much time as you feel necessary to see all the exhibits you want to see.  The museum visitor's guide is very helpful.  Visiting the British Museum is a trip through history and a ""must see"" when you visit London."
"Written December 12, 2018",Please give me more!!! ,"A difficult place to describe in one post. An eclectic mix of the recent millenia of human history, this museum houses artifacts of almost every civilisation conceivable ('acquired' through various means one might add). It can be quite overwhelming initially and so a guided tour on specific civilisations or on a specific theme is a must. It ties everything together well with a cohesive story that one can follow instead of just roaming by oneself (which in itself is enjoyable depending on your personality). Hours or days can go by but it is exhilarating to learn about where we've been so that we may know where we're going. "
"Written December 11, 2018",Always something interesting to see,"Loved the way the 'I am Ashurbanipal' exhibition brought the reliefs to life, explaining the story they represented.There was a massive queue at the front of the building so we went to the entrance on Montague Place and got in immediately."
"Written March 31, 2019",Plan on spending time here,"We did not allow even close to enough time to visit the British Museum. It is quite impressive and large.  From the Rosetta Stone to countless ancient artifacts, their collection is amazing.  I believe they only present 1% of their collection at a time which is a little disappointing because they have so much room,  but it was still overwhelming.  Most impressive is that it is free to enter and even though we went on a Saturday afternoon the crowds were tolerable.  I only wish we had given ourselves more time as 2.5 hours is not enough.  Disclaimer - We are big history buffs (especially Ancient Greek) so if historical things aren't your cup of tea this might not be the place for you.  "
"Written March 26, 2019",Well organized and infomrative,"We did a whirlwind tour of the museum using the Rick Steve's audioguide to Europe app and it was very informative and best of all, free. The museum is lovely and well organized. The biggest draw is no doubt the Rosetta Stone. We went in the afternoon and there were a lot of people but we got to see everything we wanted to see. Make sure you budget time before entering to have your bags searched for sharp objects. I think in high season the line can be quite long."
"Written March 26, 2019",Fantastic and huge place,"The best museum I've ever been! Place is huge, and take 2-3 hours to see all these fantastic stuff. If you want to avoid crowd, I recommend to be there early in the morning. Also, buy a map for easy navigation."
"Written March 25, 2019",Extremely big,This place is extremely big! There are so many different types of historical venues from countries around the world. Not only is it free but you could probably spend an entire day and not be able to visit it all.
"Written March 22, 2019",What a collections,"Well what are you know... wooow what a collection of history in one place, make you whana realize we are all dust in the wind and what's the point of the lust for power and money?!"
"Written March 19, 2019","Very nice museum, takes time to see it all","Huge complex of rooms and items on display, very easy to get lost, most of items are from around the world (nothing from British history...), an access is free of charge, there is a free wi-fi, last entrance is at 17:00"

"Written March 11, 2019",Loved it.,By far our favorite museum in London... We spent about 3 hours wandering and saw so much. Highly recommend this attraction.
"Written March 10, 2019",Excellent venue and it's free to get in !!,Superb and very interesting exhibits.Very child-friendly where they can touch certain exhibits. Helps them to be time and history into perspective too.Do not take too many bags else it delays entry due to obvious security measures.

"Written January 25, 2019",Always worth a visit - choose your are of interest,"Visited the Japan exhibition and also the new collections gallery - as usual a great visit and very busy on a rainy day. You now have extra security to enter and no bags allowed, so prepare first.  A good visit and the bookshop in now even better - great selection"
"Written January 23, 2019",Guided through the past,My technology oriented children weren’t enthusiastic about visiting the British Museum and I knew we’d need help to appreciate the riches of the museum properly. Dan was fun and got the children to absorb so much more. I’m not sure they are history enthusiasts yet but I feel like their history classes at school will have more meaning for them now. Thanks Dan!
"Written January 21, 2019",Amazing museum,The British museum was great way to start my trip to London. What an amazing collection! The audio guide was a real treat as well. Get there as early as possible! Security queues build quickly and the crowds become significantly harder to manage later in the day.

Pieces of some of the Seven Wonders...This is a place to visit repeatedly, you can not take it all in in one visit."
"Written January 15, 2019",The Best of the World!,"OK, so the sun never set on the British Empire, and it's like they took every single cool thing from everywhere they ruled and brought it back here, in one place, for you to see.  Is it wrong?  Yeah, probably.  Greece would really like half the parthenon back.  On the other hand, when you're walking through the recreated Syrian palace and looking at the hand carved walls that have been safely preserved for posterity, you might think, ""Hey, this is pretty cool that I don't have to worry about ISIS jumping me into their gang right now and I can just see this stuff.""  So go...see the Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon, gigantic coins and an Easter Island statue all together in one crazy visit!"
"Written January 13, 2019",Must-see,"If you come to London, you must see the British Museum. The Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, etc. Fabled in song and story, this is the apex of British Civilization and empire."
"Written January 6, 2019",A window into the glories and pillage of the British Empire,"You could spend an hour in here, or all day.  The Rosetta Stone, what used to be known as the Elgin Marbles, and the Egyptian collection would make any short list.  "
"Written January 6, 2019",Amazing ,Excellent galleries on ancient Egypt and ancient Greece. The collection of mummies are fascinating! You will need to spend most of the day here to make the most of the musuem. 
"Written January 4, 2019",A Treasure to Discover,So many amazing exhibition there! Rich of history and culture learning! Easy to find in the city center! convenient traffic!
"Written January 1, 2019",One of the Greatest Museums in the World,"In my humble opinion, visiting the British Musuem is the #1 ""must do"" experience in London.  If nothing else, seeing the Rosetta Stone and the engravings from the Pantheon is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  Even if you can just swing by for an hour or two and only see the highlights, it'll still be worth it. Of course, you could spend all day in there and not see everything. "
"Written December 2, 2018",Incredible,"I wasn't able to spend a lot of time going through every room and every item here, but what I did see amazed me! Being from Canada, it blew me away that you can see so much in such a well-known museum for absolutely free. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting London."
"Written December 2, 2018",A good place to visit,I was surprise when I visit tha museum. I is large and pleasend to see. It is free to enter. I stay more than 4 howers there. All good
"Written December 2, 2018",Queues,"Tip - use the back entrance. Huge winding queue at the front, walked straight in at the back! Don’t dress too warmly as some of the galleries were sweltering. So much to see and take in. Who knew they used tiny ear spoons in Roman times to clean out their ears. They could catch on now. So much more environmentally friendly than cotton buds!"
"Written December 1, 2018",Magnificent mummies,I went here with a group of school kids to see the Egyptian displays! Wow! Didn’t expect to see quite as many artefacts as we did. The kids loved it! 
"Written November 27, 2018",Pick and choose your exhibits,"The British Museum is a vast, and I mean VAST, treasure trove of antiquities and artifacts from around the world. The ground floor houses what I would consider to be the ""main"" exhibits, which basically takes you on a historical survey of western civilization from Ancient Egypt through Assyria and through Ancient Greece and Rome. I recommend picking up the museum-provided audio tour (which is free), or if you're a Rick Steves groupie, like my wife and me, you can download his excellent audio tour to your mobile. An audio tour will let you just wander from room to room throughout the main floor without feeling like you need to read every single panel next to every single piece. Then you can just breathe everything in and listen. An audio tour will take you through the main floor in a little more than an hour, not counting pauses to examine things more closely. We visited The British Museum on our final day of a week-long London trip, so we were museumed out and decided not to venture to the upper floors. I don't feel cheated though, because the main floor was more than enough to take in on our visit. Anything you visit on the upper floors is, in my humble opinion, just bonus.Rosetta Stone tip: Even on a weekday in November, there was still a huge lingering crowd of people that didn't seem to move surrounding the Rosetta Stone. There is an identical mold of the stone in another gallery on the main floor (I don't recall which room, but I just stumbled upon it, so keep walking through the galleries and you'll find it). I was surprised that no one was giving this mold any attention, even though it looked exactly like the real thing. If you want to take in the stone and really examine the carvings on your own, find this mold, and you'll have it all to yourself!"
"Written November 26, 2018",Better than I expected,"We've been flying through London for 30 years and never done the tourist thing, so decided that it was time to make up for it and the British Museum was on the list. So worth it but make sure you set aside a few hours to make the most of it."
"Written November 18, 2018",Great visit,Very interesting museum with a little bit for everyone.  I really enjoyed the Egypt exhibit and was amazed to see the Rosetta Stone up close and personal.  I wasn't expecting to see all the displays of treasure hoards found throughout the UK.  I also really enjoyed the interactive exhibits.  The staff was very knowledgeable and I liked being able to touch real history.  I spent over four hours walking around and I still barely saw half.  It was a busy Sunday morning so the crowds were thick but it was still worth the visit.   
"Written November 17, 2018",Worth a visit,The British Museum has a great collection of extremely valuable artefacts from all over the world.I've spent 3 hours in there and I do not regret any minute of it.
"Written November 15, 2018",Very interesting place to visit,I can recommend this Museum.  You need at leat 3 hours to visit the main attractions.An on top of this : it is for free.
"Written November 12, 2018",Best of the best.  Best!!,This surely has the largest collection of Egyptian artifacts anywhere out of Egypt--fabulous with the Rosetta Stone highlight. Very nice restaurant for lunch.  Great for use of wheelchair for handicapped as I am.  Takes a whole day.

"Written March 8, 2019",What a great museum!,"If you love antiquities, you will love this museum!  It is jam packed with all sorts of interesting finds and information.  I really enjoyed the Egyptian section the most.  This museum is huge and overwhelming - we were here for 3 hours and didn't see everything!  I wish we had more time, and had been able to come back another day (since entry is free!).  Take advantage of the late closing time on Friday nights!"
"Written March 8, 2019",An Excellent Visit,"My family and I went for a short trip to London this winter vacation.We arrived there in the morning.It was really cold there.So remember to bring enough clothes.After we arrived there,we went to the British Museum.We saw many historical relics.Those relics are from many countries in the world.There are the mummy that come from Egypt,to the Diamond Sutra that come from China.I learned a lot of things about history.It was an excellent trip."
"Written March 8, 2019",Fantastic day at the museum,"We have tried to visit the British museum today and say tried because this place cannot be covered even in a week!!! Such incredible expos, particularly impressed by the mummies and the Assiryan collections. But really, each collection is rich with so many impressive items and everything is so well presented!! Our day was long and tiring , but, oh, what an incredible experience!!! A total MUST during your stay in London!!"
"Written March 5, 2019",Always a new experience,"I go here every time in London, and it's always a new experience. Go when it first opens and hit the Rosetta Stone and mummies before the school groups get there.The museum is massive, so you could easily spend a full day or more checking out the plunder of the British Empire, plus actual British artifacts. This last time, we just spent a couple hours, tops, because most of our group had been there before and because we were traveling with a toddler. Short trips are doable if you know where you want to go or are willing to just wander through a random room or too. With free admission, you don't feel guilty about popping in and out either.In terms of traveling with small children, it's admittedly better for slightly older kids (as the many school groups demonstrate). There are rarely hands-on activities, so it can be a bit of a slog unless you're good at engaging kids' attention to make the history come alive (which can be kind of exhausting when you want to look with grown-up eyes). My son got worn out pretty quickly, but he lasted longer than he might have otherwise because we prepped him with the book Ottoline at the British Museum. I think it's out of print now, but you can get copies online. It's a cute book about a cat at the museum from back in the days when they used to feed all the strays. The cat encounters lots of real-life artifacts that the museum still displays, and my son liked tracking all these things down. In other words, you can certainly bring small kids here, but you have to do a bit more ""work"" than, say, at the Natural History Museum."
"Written March 4, 2019",Recommend the escorted pre-opening tours ,Certainly worth the £30  and a great introduction to the Museum.  Book them on-line a do as many as you can.
"Written March 4, 2019",You can revisit History here,"A wonderful place to refresh your knowledge of Britain and some of their old colonies.

"Written February 26, 2019",Exceptional options for any preference,"Every time we go to London, we have to pay a visit to British Museum.  You can spend a whole day at the museum to see just a couple of exhibitions.  "
"Written February 24, 2019",Enter at the back entrance ,No line at the back entrance. We walked straight in while the line at the front of the museum went around the block. Also go early or late afternoon. 
"Written February 21, 2019",It's a must.,The British Museum is well worth a visit.There are civilizations from all over the world one needs more than one day to visit all the floors and explore the different cultures.My favourite wing of the museum is the Greek one.The parthenon Marbles are exhibited there since the have been removed from the Parthenon in Athens.The entrance is free if one wants they can donate a few pounds and it is open on sundays.I feld dissapointed because i realzed that all the exhibits were taken from various cultures however one must not miss the opportunity to visit this museum.
"Written February 20, 2019",History fun and safe ,There is lots to see. The older kids can wonder round on their own. Take as much time as you need or do multiple visits. It's free but you can make a donation. There is food in the museum. There are lots of resting places. 
"Written December 10, 2018",One of the best museums in the world,"Perhaps one of the world's most complete mounds. The British Museum is one of the largest and probably the most beautiful museums in the world. If one visits it, he can see exhibits from all over the world, from various peoples such as ancient Greeks, Egyptians, Japanese, Chinese, Sumerians, Europeans, Indians, Africans etc.As in most English museums, access is free, and it is worthwhile to visit someone to see past work.Most important of the exhibits are the parts of Parthenon, Karyatida and other ancient Greek statues."
"Written December 10, 2018",Best museum I  have been to,"I thought the Mets in New York was good but the British Museum is still the best. I love the Egyptian, Alsyrian, Greek and Roman section. I could spend the whole day there and not able to finish looking at everything. I manage to spend 2 mornings to cover these sections. I’m sure there are many more things to see."
"Written December 6, 2018","Excellent Museum, a must visit in London","If you even been in London, this is the first place that you have to visit. It is outstanding how much history can fit in a museum.Ancient Babylonia, Greece, Egypt, Roman empire....."
"Written December 5, 2018",Ashurbanipal exhibition,"The penalty that British Museum visitors pay for this museum being free is that it is always full. Even when you have to pay, it's sometimes full too. It is well worth putting up with the crowds to experience the latest exhibition of Assyrian art and ephemera. ""Ashurbanipal"" (to give it the shorter and less irritating title than the full version) is in a different league from most of the BM's recent offerings. It is something to be experienced in the real world, rather than Hokusai and Ian Hislop, which work just as well online or on the printed page.Rarely have I seen a display as imaginative and effective as this. With the minimum of gimmickry another world is opened up, almost as dramatic as that of Nineveh. There's education as well as special effects galore. A shame it attracts so many visitors. It can't be the title that did it."

"Written November 4, 2018",Always amazing,"I've been twice in 6 years and it's only gotten better. It's so easy to get wrapped up in the mummies but there's so much more. Make for at least a few hours. Even outside there's a lot going on with performing artists. The difference between now and 6 years ago...security. You now have to have your bags checked and I'm sure the line early in the day can get quite long, but we went around 3ish on a Friday so the line was shorter. Afterwards, find a small quiet restaurant in the neighbourhood to rest your weary feet."
"Written November 1, 2018",Museum tour,This was a fascinating 90+ minute tour of the highlights of the museum. Our guide was a wealth of information and amusing at times. He had a great perspective of history and could explain the part the treasures we saw played in the overall progression. Our tour went longer for those who were interested so our guide could show us more. It was wonderful and well worth the fee through the museum!
"Written October 30, 2018",Not to be missed,"The British Museum is a wonder, with so many outstanding treasures.  The Rosetta  Stone is the first treasure that greets you as you enter.  After tha, t one gallery after another will astounded you with their wonders. The Elgin Marbles Room is truly amazing and the marbles are mounted so as to allow a close up view.  The Egyptian mummies are another highlight, as is the Piltdown Man.  There is far to much to see in one visit, but even a small taste is rewarding."

"Written October 24, 2018","If you have time for only one London attraction, this is it.","What can I say except that it is by far the best museum I've visited in my whole life. And I think it bests even the Cairo Museum of Antiquities.Even if you're not particularly turned on by history, the magnificence of the displays (and the way they're displayed and the information given) are spectacular. (Don't miss the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus!)However, don't depend on the free guide they give if you're looking for just the highlights. There are some notable exclusions. Try looking up online or at Frommer's Easy Guide to London for better information on the key exhibits.If you ARE a history buff, half a day may not be enough. What you can do is to allocate the whole day. They have a sizeable cafe in the museum where you can get fed. Don't expect gourmet food though. Of course, you could bring your own food and eat in the cafe area.Do not miss this. The queue can get pretty long. We were there near the opening time but there were lots of people already there. However, we were in within 15 minutes. The Brits are masters at crowd management. (Something I can't say for Eiffel Tower)"

One word can use for this place is “Wow!” I spend the whole day in the museum, for me is not enough. If you guys like History this is the place you must go! I suggest to spend for two days in this museum, because the museum collected the historical items from worldwide. To complete the whole tour you have to spend more time over here. I love this place."
"Written February 17, 2019","Stunning atrium, stunning discoveries",You cannot leave The British Museum without having seen the atrium. I just love it whenever the design of the building which houses priceless objects is a work of art in and of itself. There are no words for the mummies and objects that have been curated here. I was amazed to see the state of human hair which must have been at least from 1300 BC! How can this be? 
"Written February 17, 2019",A museum you must visit,It’s one of places must see in London as there are really very interesting exhibits to see from all over the world. I must say that is a global Museum. Don’t forger to visit the Greek and Egypt departments.
"Written February 13, 2019",Yes!! but it feels ..old,"It is my second visit at the British Museum. The first time in 2012 I was so excited, mainly because of the exhibits. I am still excited about them BUT  i really felt that nothing has improved over the years. The exhibition rooms have a really old feeling and the way the exhibits are scattered in place is the one of the previous century... I hope that in near future this will change so that the greatness of the collection would emerge. A big plus if the free ticket.Honestly this comment is written with love."
"Written February 12, 2019",Worth to see,Worth to see however sometimes confusing. Not all the paths market clearly and can end up going in circles. I have most enjoyed greek and Egyptian displays.  
"Written February 10, 2019",Be careful not to get caught by the donation con,"I have been a regular visitor to the British Museum and most years have made donations to it during my visits. However, this at the start of this visit I found a new security procedure in place. As I finished having my bag checked I was directed by an official to go to desk number two. I presumed this was something to do with the security check. It was not. It was a 'voluntary donation' desk, where the voluntary nature of the donation was not at all clear. It was quite clear that some of the non-native visitors thought this was some form of entrance fee they had to pay. In the past, I have made donations to the British Museum and have also supported a number of organisations I am involved with in making donations. As from now I am stopping all my donations and will encourage the bodies I am connected with to do the same until the donation desks are removed from the security area."

The tombs were very defined with inscriptions of stories from hundreds of years. Totally priceless and amazing. You can take part in purchasing headphones and following through with prerecording or self guided tour. Take the family. Free admission, amazing information for the kids and accessible on the Underground station and tons of gift shops, in the area and across the street from the museum."
"Written September 22, 2018",Best of the best,"There's no way to do justice to this incredible museum.  It's vast and chock-full of exhibits and specimens.  Like similar great museums in the world from the Louvre to the Smithsonion to the Uffizi, it will help to go with some idea of what you want to see.  My only problem here is that the exhibits are ordered thematically rather than chronologically, so while I went wanting to see things from the Anglo Saxon period of English history, I found things related to this chronological period spread among several exhibits (pottery shrds, weapons, farming toolds, etc.  "
"Written September 21, 2018",British Museum ,"Nice way to spend a few hours on a rainy day, as we did. There you will see the Rosetta Stone. They have a large collection of Greek and Egyptian artifacts that are in pristine condition. Check schedule as some days are free. "

I trot up the circular staircase to the Egyptian Rooms to visit the mummies--love the cats. Then on to The Portland Vase, which had been shattered into 125 pieces by a patron, and painstakingly put together. Then there are the magnificent Elgin Marbles. Stop in the cafe on the top floor for lunch or on the ground floor for a quick lunch or snack."

"Written October 10, 2018",History galore,"The most impressive thing I find about London attractions, other than the unending layers of history to discover, is that the city gives us multiple sites to visit at no additional cost. I always make the ""voluntary"" contribution on exiting the venue, but those on a budget can still get tremendous value out of expensive city, without breaking the bank."

"Written October 9, 2018",Lots of mummies,"I’m a fan of ancient Egypt, so I had to come here when visiting London. I wasn’t disappointed. There is a huge gallery of stone statues and sarcophagi, as well as a heap of mummies. It’s hard to describe how impressive these are without seeing them.It’s free to visit - so why not!"
"Written October 7, 2018",Amazing museum - unpleasant pressure for donations,This is an unbelievably great museum and I have visited many times.It’s free which is fantastic as people who can’t afford it can still enjoy it.I always give a voluntary donation when I visit because I am fortunate enough to be able to but was horrified at my last visit when after going through security I was ordered to present to a numbered counter and essentially shaken down for money.Not only was this extremely unpleasant for me and made me not want to donate but it makes me worry that it will put off people who can’t afford it and will miss out on the history and education.
"Written September 20, 2018",Free dive into history,"It‘s fantastic to have free access to public museums all over London anyways. To be able to visit this one for free as well makes it even better. This way you can freely decide if you want to check out the entire building, which would probably easily take an entire day or if you just go for a few pearls. We went to the egyptian part including the Rosetta stone (helped translating the hieroglyphs) and several mummies. We then also got to enjoy a free tour with a really nice guide, telling us everything about the ancient empire and how mummifications came to be etc. After that we also enjoyed the Enlightenment sector, in which all types of research including biology, petrology, history etc. are presented. I recommend it to everybody as it is free and you don’t lose any money, even if you just check out the architecture of the building itself, which is impressive itself. "
"Written September 19, 2018",Obviously one of the greater museums in the world,"Even though you might want to ask yourself the question wheter certain collections should still be displayed here or should be given back to where they originally came from, the British museum displays a richt collection from Ancient Egypt such as mummies to Ancient Greek with its famous Parthenon Frieze and the Rosetta Stone just to mention a few. An extremely varied collection of all different kind of interesting objects from the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Americas are displayed in a splendid way and will make this visit last way longer than you could anticipate on. The architecture of the museum is worth a visit in itself. You can't really visit London without visiting the British Museum. Will definitely go back during my next trip, despite that fact that I have been there 6 times by now."

It has son many interesting objects in the museum you will be amazed and its free how many world class museums in the world are free I would so none. Example the Louvre of Paris is quite expensive. The Museum has history on Artefact , China, Greece Romans and Egyptians etc. The building has been modernised by one of Britain's for most Architects Lord Foster. There are many Cafes in the foyer to rest your feet and just to chill and to take in all the splendours of this great Museum and what it has to offer. The museum puts on special shows from other countries and example was the Terracotta Army of Sian of China excellent value and very interesting. This exhibition was about the first Emperor of China. The location of the British Museum is near to Holborn, but is a short walk from Covent Garden, which is a beautiful place in the heart of the city of London.You must visit the British Museum and just pay a small donation or not.

"Written October 2, 2018","Wonderful collection, nicely and clearly exhibited.",This wonderful building houses a huge collection of items collected by Britain from its colonies and explorers.  The Elgin from the Parthenon and The Rosetta Stone are not to be missed.  The Museum is free!  Great for families and scholars alike.

Depends on how much tkme you intend to spent in there, it was big.I highly recommend to rent a guided audio system @£7. You will be guided to the most popular items with clear stories with full explanation. There was coffee and snack area, restaurant when you need a break. Leisurely spent an afternoon surrounded by amazing world history. "
"Written October 2, 2018",Help with Summer homework ,An amazing location to visit and gain an understanding of many different things needed for school. Gets busy so go early and bring food with you. 
"Written October 1, 2018",Simply a must,"It keeps amazing me. Always something new to see. Now they are making it hard not to donate, which is fair. Something for something."
"Written October 1, 2018",Treasures of the British Empire,"The marble statues, the Rosetta stone, the great relics of the past and the fabulous art of ancient civilizations. You can really feel awed within these walls. It's free and it's another place that should be seen. On a rainy day, it can't be beat. "
"Written September 30, 2018",Well worth the visit ,"I saw so much and yet I didn't see enough. There was just not enough time on my schedule to take it all in and I am oh, ever so regretful. In hindsight I wish I had allocated more time. If you ever do go to London, make sure you plan to take more time than you expect. London is such a cultural hub that you owe it to yourself to do it right. Take your time. Don't rush. See it all. And definitely put the British Museum on your list. "
"Written September 30, 2018",Amazing museum!  So much to see!,"This huge museum has an amazing collection, including the Rosetta Stone. Entry is free, though some tours cost money.   It would take many hours or days to see and appreciate it all. Art and historical artifacts are well displayed, with helpful descriptions. We came on Sunday, and it was packed with people.  One way to be sure of not missing the highlights is to take the aptly named Highlights Tour, as we did, for a cost.  My partner loved it; I was less enthralled for two reasons: first, the guide walked very fast and made no attempt to be sure everyone on the tour was with him (a challenge since there were so many people and he did not have a flag or any other way to be seen over the many heads), and second, his commentary focused more on who donated the pieces and how they were found, as opposed to the historical context and what they meant (the latter was more my interest but others might prefer his focus).  If you're able to stay with the guide, though, it's a great way to be sure you can see the museum's most famous pieces in 90 minutes."
"Written September 28, 2018",Nice museum,"This museum is beautiful, and I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place. I think it is good for everyone"
"Written September 1, 2018",Great collections from all over the world,"This is the bigger museum in London. You can see Egyptian art with an actual reconstruction of the entrance of an ancient tomb and pieces from ancient Greece, Asia, China, India... Plan two days to manage to visit the entire exposition. Don't miss it!"
"Written August 28, 2018",British Museum,"The museum is amazing. I have spent time there twice, and would love to go again. The Egyptian rooms are fantastic. The only problem is the crowds. Both times I've been there have been numerous school groups, and I was lucky to get close to many of the displays. It is too bad there are not designated times for school kids, and times just for the general public. It is a wonderful museum though, and well worth spending several hours in if possible. "
"Written August 28, 2018",Must see,"A truly an awesome eperience , you got to see priceless treasures from every place in the world. A real must see "
"Written August 27, 2018",The British Museum's Special Program are Historic,"The British Museum has significant pieces of world history and is always a rewarding visit.  We have been many times and always enjoy renewing experiences we have enjoyed before - the Rosetta Stone, the Lewis Chess Pieces, the 7th Century B.C. Flood Tablet,  the Portland Vase, and thousands more.  You can always visit another room or presentation for the first time and find more to see in the Museum.  In addition, the Museum enhances the range of experiences with special programs.  Last month the Rodin special program was outstanding.  Several Rodin pieces were on loan from Paris.  They were arranged in a separate showing room with pieces from the British Museum's Elgin Marbles that inspired Rodin to create many of his magnificent sculptures.  The placement of Rodin pieces alongside the Elgin Marbles that inspired him was itself inspired.  Reading and listening to commentary before and after was instructive.  Even better, the Rodin special program empowered you to sculpt your own understanding of the relationship between Rodin's creations and the Elgin Marbles by seeing Rodin and Marbles side by side.   Well done."
"Written August 27, 2018",Valuable experience!,"The museum is far one of the best museums in London. The archive is great and well presented. My only advice would be to do in quiet days, weekend is a nightmare, too crowded!!!"
"Written August 27, 2018","Great Place to visit, Free exhibition!","Great place to visit and explore the Egypt exhibition, seen the Rosetta Stone and plenty of mummies including one of the cleopatra’s "
"Written August 27, 2018",MUST visit,"Breath in, breath out; be ready for CROWDS, at least right now in the summer season.  If you approach your visit calmly and with an understanding that you will be one among many, it is a wonderful place.  My family (12 year old included) spent HOURS here and merely scratched the surface of what it has to offer.  The Rosetta Stone is a highlight and there is something for everyone.  We ate in the Grand Court and the food was just fine; fulfilling sandwiches, yummy puddings.  I would plan (at least now in peak season) 4 hours for a visit."
"Written August 26, 2018",Great!,"What an experience! The Library holds one of 3 existing Magna Cartas, musical scores by Handel, Haydn and Beethoven, and much more. Very exciting place for those who love history."

"Written August 23, 2018","Amazing museum.. plan to do visit over two days, so much to see!","The Egyptian and Roman sections are amazing... especially the mummies and of course, Cleopatra... the summer can be tough because there is no air conditioning so go early in the day. "
"Written July 5, 2018",Brilliant museum,You know those pictures of statues and antiquities you see in history books? They're there - from the Assyrian winged bulls to egyptian mummies and the original Rosetta stone... you could spend days in there.

"Written July 3, 2018","Vast, make a plan!","A must do when in London!The museum is easily accessible, with two tube stations nearby and a bus stop right opposite. It is an impressive building, yet surprisingly well hidden in the surrounding area.Inside is quite arguably one of the best collections in the world, well arranged by time period and civilisation. It is advisable to get a map from the reception inside, which also means getting to explore the very impressive Great Court, which also contains the gift store and cafe.The museum opens at 10 and soons get busy, especially around the popular exhibits such as the Egyptian sculptures, Rosetta Stone etc. If possible aim for quieter periods if the day if you want to see these. There is also security and bag searches before you enter which needs to be considered although it did not take long to get in.There is so much to see it is impossible to see it all in one visit. My advice is to have an idea of what you really want to see and concentrate on those, otherwise you can end up wandering aimlessly and not really see much. Bear in mind the size of the place means there can be a lot of walking.I wanted to see the Egyptian sculptures, the eqyptian mummies, the Elgin marbles, the Roman collection and the clock collection. These are all in different areas so bear that in mind. The clock room when the hour strikes and all the clocks chime was quite special.The British Musuem is worth at least a visit once, and considering it is all for free, just a voluntary donation, there is no excuse not to visit!"
"Written July 2, 2018",Flying Visit,We literally had an hour to run around as we had a show to catch and timed our trip poorly. Such a beautiful building though. So impressive throughout. I'v always wanted to see real life mummies and the displays are amazing. With x-ray pictures of inside some of the mummies wrappings. The Rosetta stone was also top of the list for me and I'm delighted to have seen it. Will be revisiting London again and dedicating a whole day to the British museum.
"Written June 28, 2018",A must see for anyone interested in artifacts.,"The audio guide is very good and givers lots of options.  We set our two kids (teens) loose together to tour the museum--the chose the ""top ten"" audiotour and it really engaged them!   We could easily have spent several days here, so be sure to decide what you want to see and target your tour accordingly based on the time you have.  If you want to eat at the sit down restaurant, I suggest making a reservation when you ente the museum--we did so and were glad we did--there was along line when we sat down and were able to avoid that."
"Written June 26, 2018",Beware donation plea,"I am a Londoner and visit this wonderful treasure trove regularly.Today, after passing through bag search, I was asked to proceed to one of four counters, which reminded me of airport immigration counters. The gentleman there informed me that entrance was free (I told him I knew that) then proceeded to tell me that I could make a suggested £5 donation there and then. I was very disturbed by this new procedure at the Museum, spoke to one of the attendant staff and subsequently completed a feedback form. I am appalled that the Museum has resorted to these tactics in a bid to increase their revenue by targeting tourists and visitors. I have not seen this at other museums. There are many conspicuous donation boxes all over the BM and I often make a donation AFTER I have enjoyed a visit. I hope other visitors will beware this procedure and, like me, make their feelings known so that the BM can stop this disgusting practice. "
"Written June 20, 2018",Dazzling displays in a beautiful building ,"In London, this should be one of your first stops. Set aside an entire day, particularly if you enjoy Egyptian and other ancient artifacts.  This museum is HUGE!I recommend going early, as my visit during the middle of the day was over run with school children. Despite the crowds, it was easily one of the most amazing museums I have toured.The building is fairly accessible, though you need to look for elevators at times.  There is an info desk, just inside in the Great Hall, which may be able to help map out your visit.I downloaded, for free, the Rick Steves tour.  As usual, his guided tour was fascinating, full of stories and in depth explanations of what you are seeing. It helps to have an experienced person telling you the most important sights in a museum this size.There is a decent cafe on the ground floor near the gift shop. WC (bathrooms) are down a set of stairs on the right side of the gift shop.This is a must see for every London itinerary."
"Written June 19, 2018",Lots to see,I am sure most folks could stay in the museum for days. There is so much to see! The Rosetta Stone is one of the highlights. The mummies are sure to impress anyone!
"Written June 12, 2018",A modern museum with relics from all over the world,"This was my second visit to the museum.  My previous visit was in April 2016, there were no crowds.  This time there were lots of school groups and tour groups making it difficult to get around."
"Written June 9, 2018","A classic, traditional Museum with modern accents","Viewed the British Museum with friends while in London.   We mainly went there for the extensive selections of ancient artifacts as well as the historic Rosetta Stone.   Pleasantly surprised with some of the more modern additions.   Please note that there is security screening prior to entering the museum.   It took us approximately 10 minutes in line to get in.   Not bad, but we were late in the day.   Could be longer security lines upon opening."
"Written August 6, 2018","Very, very busy",Great museum but try and pick your time to go. Gets very crowded. Reading Room was also shut which was disappointing.
"Written August 6, 2018",Nice venue,Very nice variety of exhibitions.  Free unless you want to donate(I recommend).  Only reason we didn’t relate it higher is that they had no available audio headsets for the walking tours.
"Written August 2, 2018","Go to see the Elgin Marbles, and the Rosetta Stone.","Go to see the Elgin Marbles, and the Rosetta Stone. Check out the covered courtyard with the Reading Room. If it's open, go inside, to be in the same room where many great writers did their work."
"Written July 30, 2018",There’s a reason when you tell people you’re looking for “The Museum” they know this what you’re looking for ...,"One cannot walk through The British Museum without feeling somewhat underdressed for the occasion... that is unless youre sporting a brown leather jacket, matching felt fedora with a worn whip attached to hip. Set off by a rugged 4 day beard and sun-soaked tan, picked up after a week scouring the Middle East for treasures and fighting Nazis to save the world. That is, of course, because The British Museum makes all its visitors feel like Indian Jones. In his Prime I hasten to add (like all good ‘Indi’ fans we’ll ignore the Crystal-thingy-majig episode). With exceptional exhibitions showcased alongside the world envied permanent collection amassed from the spoils of gentleman explorers and rogue historians of a by-gone age. An age when being British meant having the curiosity to set one’s gaze up at the stars and across the seas to Europe and beyond - a long cry from the reckoning of the ignorant and insular on June 23 2016. What “je ne sais quoi” the Museum lacks when compared to its more en vogue and imperially impervious, if not a little pastiche, South Kensington rival (the V&A to the uninitiated) it makes up for in good old charm. And to that charm, the curators and the rest of the Museum’s staff I shall tip my brim."
"Written July 26, 2018",Worthy of many visits and revisits,"We have been to this museum on two separate occasions , approximately 3 years apart.. Each of our visits was at least 3-4 hours long and i feel that if I am fortunate to live long enough and get back to London several more times in my lifetime, I will always schedule another visit to the British Museum. One must always be selective in what you try to see as the museum can be overwhelming.Would always suggest you go to the information booth and find out when and where free tours are being given. The guides are very knowledgeable and quite conversant in the areas in which they lead tours. We try to take at least two per visit."
"Written July 20, 2018","Amazing treasures, fantastic architecture","Go into the British Museum just for the amazing interior architecture if nothing else. But the Greek, Assyrian, Egyptian artifacts are fantastic."
"Written July 19, 2018",Fantastic exhibits ,It is truly amazing to see in real lifevthebitemsvyou have only read about. Free access to museum is truly a great thing. We participated in a free your in ancient Egypt. Love the place and want to come back
"Written July 19, 2018",Such a treasure trove!,"While in principle I disagree with the looting of other nations by the British, whenever I visit this place I tend to have second thoughts. They have done such a wonderful job of preservation that in some cases the items in question are probably better preserved & displayed here. In recent decades, there is also acknowledgment of the way some items were acquired. All in all, this Museum alone needs at least 3 whole days if not more. "
"Written July 18, 2018",Toilet provision a disgrace,"I am ashamed as a man and a Londoner to see women queuing for ages to use a loo in our wonderful British Museum. In this day and age!! And, yes, I have written and complained to the organisation and never even received a reply. Perhaps this is elicit a response???"
"Written July 18, 2018",Not sure if summer is the best time to visit,"It is one of the best museums you can visit in your lifetime. However, there are some things that you should know before you go. First, not so long time ago, the security of the place was no so complicated. Now you have to pass a security scrutiny. 2. The place does not have a proper air-conditioning, thus summer at 30 degrees surrounded by hordes of tourist might be overwhelming. The place was so packed when I went that I barely could see anything in some of the rooms. If you moved upstairs, the museum is less packed but the heat is more intense. I will only recommend to visit the British Museum in summer if this is your first visit to London and you do not expect to go in the near future. Try to avoid the weekends and if the temperature outside is above the 30 degrees forget it; the heat will be so unbearable that you will be counting the seconds to get out.  Instead go to the Victoria & Albert or other museums less crowded."
"Written June 9, 2018",One of the top museums in the world,We arrived at 915 with the museum opening at 1000.  You can pass through security and grab a croissant/coffee while waiting for the exhibitions to open.  The Rosetta stone was amazing to see in person.  The Rodin exhibition was on during our trip and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The Elgin marbles are incredible.  This museum rates up there with the MET and Louvre.  
"Written June 9, 2018",A absolute MUST,Perfect for everyone.   There are not enough hours in the day to appreciate everything.   So much to learn and experience.   The cafe and resturant are very good and reasonably priced.   Lovely gift shops with worthwhile items.   Plan at least 4 hrs.   There are lifts if needed.
"Written June 2, 2018",History of everything - something for everyone,History of everything - there is something for everyone ...I am from New York and I would compare our Metropolitan Museum of Art to the British Museum because they both have so many artifacts and so much history.

"Written April 30, 2018",The World in a Single LARGE Beautiful Building,"A rainy Monday did not mean an empty museum. However, how can any living and engaged person not long to see the Rosetta Stone, the carvings “borrowed” from the Parthenon, unlimited mummies, and nearly every other historic object you’ve ever seen in your school texts? This is truly a DON’T miss destination! Lots of family friendly pubs and restaurants near the museum."
"Written April 27, 2018",Fun few hours ,We enjoyed the British Museum it was wonderful to see the amazing range of artifacts. They cater for families with some activities although it was school holidays. We arrived early and I think this is a good idea given how popular it is. We could have stayed much longer but we were trying to see as much of London as possible.Is a must do in London 
"Written March 11, 2018",So much to do,"Our 7 year old had just watched Night At The Museum 1,2&3 and was desperate to go to the British Museum. She also enjoys this sort of thing normally too so that was just an added bonus. Oh my goodness soooooo much to see and do. We queued at the cloakroom to check in our bag and jackets as we did not want to lug them around all day. We worked out this would have cost us £11 but as we got to the front the lady kindly informed us as we were a family we could use the family room downstairs for a £1 which is returned to to us  at the end! Bonus!! Took luggage there and you get a great big locker plus there are toilets - so no queuing upstairs! We went to the family desk to pick up a tour and a map and we were off, I’m pretty certain we dint see everything and will need to return in the future but what we did see was very well presented and laid out, daughter loved the Egyptian part, plus Easter Island with “DumDum”. Very interesting seeing all of the Roman finds as most seem to be from around Norfolk (home). There were lots of different areas that she had been learning about at school and got to see a lot of pieces and attic acts to support these so definitely great to see. We didn’t take lunch so bought some in the cafe in the main area - although it was quite pricey, it was very tasty, and different, not your big standard cheese or ham sandwich. Salads were tasty. Although next time I would take our own - lots of people did. We spent over 5 hours here and probably could have spent 5 more! Definitely worth a visit - and it’s free so why wouldn’t you! "
"Written March 11, 2018",Nice learning journey for the children,Visited during the last Dec 2017 school holidays. Huge collection especially the Egyptians sections. So awesome & nice to see the real mummy for the 1st time. 
"Written March 4, 2018","Weekends are a madhouse, but you have to go","So much stuff, so little time.  For the Elgin marbles from the Parthenon alone, this place is a must see.  There is also an amazing display of Egyptian art and artefacts, including so many mummies it will make your head spin.  The Babylonian area is without peer...truly extraordinary.  The covered courtyard itself is worth seeing...truly and architectural masterpiece.  That said, its crumbling and dirty in the corners, and the crowds are truly obnoxious on the weekends, especially if the weather is poor.  And, the ""Asian"" areas give such embarassing short shrift to countless cultures with a weird display of random artifacts in what looks like your grandmother's bookcases.  Strange.  Nevertheless, you must go."

Their collections are amazing and their presentation allows you to get very close to be able to see the amazing abilities of the ancients.  Of course the Rosetta Stone is there.  I am a Christian and I especially enjoy seeing the artifacts which demonstrate the unique accuracy of the Bible (e.g., Taylor Prism, Cyrus Cylinder, Lachish Ostrica and many other items).  They have great tour books for all interests and very interesting temporary exhibits.  It also has an adequate café to be able to refuel before taking on more of London.  It is just a short walk from the Tottenham Court Road tube stop."
"Written August 14, 2018",A Must if you're in London,"Although free of charge, this attraction alone is worth a trip to London. The museum is grand and there is so much to see.

Unfortunately the Japan exhibit was closed but there was so much else to see that it didn't I didn't feel I missed out. "

"Written August 11, 2018",Amazing museum!,This museum was on my bucket list for a long time!Home of the Rosetta Stone it was very much worth the trip. Do try to this this first as it does get crowed fast. Check their website for current exhibits.The entry is free but make sure you check the times and leave yourself enough time.The lines get long in the morning but moves. My hotel was almost across the street so I had the opportunity to go back a second time easily.Two hours prior to closing was perfect for us as the larger crowds weren't a provlem.There an area for eating and a wonderful gift shop in the once you enter the main area. This is a must see museum.

The bottom had ripped on my shopping bag a kind assistant in the gift shop gave me an extra bag as it was clear the contents were about to spill, she offered to help transfer the stuff but it was so busy I took it outside so as not to hold the queue up, my young son and I got out and I put my bags on a bench to start moving things when a woman security guard frostily shouted at us to “get out, move down” I was speechless at the way she spoke to us and she then turned to an elderly man and shouted at him “to hurry up” at this point I told her she was rude she continued to yell get out. as we were herded from the place by another woman this one with a whistle like we were sheep dogs. I take a lot of time telling my son about being polite and helpful, what an awful example their staff set! I will be writing directly to the museum. "

"Written August 7, 2018","Too hot, crowded and smelly","Heard a lot about this museum. I visited this museum on one of the hottest days of the year. Firstly, the queue was very long. Secondly, the map made no sense. Thirdly, it was extremely hot in the museum which had no AC! Fourthly, after getting over the heat the toilets were smelly, had long queues and hot water running in the taps which made things worse. Last but not least, there were a lot of tourists from China. It seemed as if they had booked the museum for themselves, which is fine but crowd control must be an issue if there was ever god forbid a serious incident in the building. I couldn't concentrate on the displays at all. Just had to leave immediately by following the exit signs. May return on a colder day and when there are fewer people around. Overall, the building itself is huge and beautiful inside. You need patience and a cold drink if you are visiting in the summer months!"

"Written July 15, 2018",Must do,"I don’t think I’ve been to London without including a visit to the British Museum. The exhibits don’t change much but there are just so many interesting artifacts to see to resist. The beauty of the museum is that with free admission, we feel we can drop in for an hour or two as our schedule allows. We don’t feel compelled to see all of it each time we visit. Our last hotel was in Leicester Square and we preferred to walk to the museum in the evening as opposed to taking a taxi or the tube. There is just so much to take-in along the way."

The museum is massive, and if you are like me and like to read the descriptions, you could not possibly cover the entire museum in one day.   The audio guides are flexible enough to accommodate different interests, with different suggested tours.  Alternatively, you could just wander, but I recommend following one of the audio 'tours'.  This is a great museum. Don't miss it. "
"Written July 12, 2018",Great Museum but crowded,This is a great museum but it’s almost always packed with visitors. It’s also not air conditioned and London was extremely hot during the time I was there which made the visit a bit unpleasant even though I would have to recommend the museum for its incredible collections especially Greek and Roman antiquities

This museum is well organized and has a good audio guide to help you through the galleries.  The stand out, is of course, the Rosetta Stone which I offer high praise that they place very close to the entrance to its gallery (vs. burying in the back like the milk in the grocery store) One word of note- the museum can be weirdly tricky to find right now.  I encountered other tourists like me, using mobile navigation and were getting weird walking directions.  Additionally, if you take the tube, Oxford Street is a complete construction zone right now. London is hard enough to navigate by map, but the scaffolding and construction makes things even more challenging.  Do your best to find 'Museum street' which makes it pretty simple."

You see fragments of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus , Pantheon, Egyptian  and Mesopotamian art. However, few people know that in one of the wings you can see a great collection of prints and drawings made by famous artists, from Michelangelo and Da Vinci to Picasso.  To have access to this absolute treasure you need to present your passport or ID which will be retained for the duration of your visit. In exchange, if you are an art lover, you can ask for any catalogue from their collection and along with it you receive a pair of gloves to go through the drawings without damaging them.  You get an unique experience.AND REMEMBER, TO VISIT BRITISH MUSEUM THERE IS NO ENTRANCE FEE "
"Written November 27, 2017",Devote half a day to this place!,We were pressed for time and sped through in two hours. What a regret! I could have spent a whole day here. The Rosetta Stone alone is worth gazing upon for hours. A staggering array of treasures here.

Also, the tour can be downloaded and listened to as you walk through the museum - excellent source of information and Rick makes history come alive.  We try to have a  flexible schedule in London.  You can never count on the weather, so when it’s raining we tour the museums, when it’s nice we take the walking tours.  Also, try to have a plan for meal time.  Look up restaurants in the area you will be in ahead of time, not when you’re starving.  Or if it’s nice, pick a park or a bench overlooking the Thames and have a picnic."
"Written November 16, 2017",A Must,"When going to London this museum is a must. The collections there were from all over the world. You can see a lot in just one place. The day we went, it was only a short queue to have our bags checked. After one of the staff pointed us to another counter, I had no idea what that was for. The guy at the counter asked me for a donation.  I know I have to give donation but not in this way, I felt like I was forced to donate. At the time I didn’t have anything smaller then £50, so I just emptied my change purse.  When I finished exploring the museum, at the exit I gave more donations (in Canadian currency) of my own free will. Be prepared to donate to this museum, it is worthy. Happy Travelling!"

We went on a Saturday, and some parts of the Egyptian rooms were shoulder to shoulder.  There were hordes of people by certain artifacts, such as the  Rosetta stone.  It's a good 4 hours adventure."
"Written January 7, 2018",A collection of everything the British stole and kept in good condition,"This is a one stop shop to see everything the British empire stole, collected and kept over the course of their illustrious history. Mummies, tombs, relics, jewels, statues, parthenon historical figurines from all over the world (Europe, Asia, Africa) are all on display. The building itself is impressive. If not for the British empire bringing these here, many of these relics would not have survived the weather, looting, vandalism in their native countries. So in a way it's a good thing they 'stole' these items and put them here. You will always learn something new each time you visit this remarkable museum."
"Written January 7, 2018",So many relics and so much artwork to see,"The Rosetta Stone, Granite Statue of Amenhotep. Lamassu. So much to see!  You can even have a lovely afternoon tea in the museum.   Fantastic, and educational, way to spend a day in London."

The Great Court is breathtaking and the history housed in this museum is a lesson not to be missed. There are guidebooks in many languages and places to make donations as well as gift shops and cafe's. The museum is filled with artifacts from all over the world. I also noticed FREE tours throughout the exhibits.So many pristine examples of history I had only seen in books, where at the British museum they are on display for all to see. More to see than possible in one day, but again, this museum is FREE, so there is no need to do it all in one day. A good place to be when it is cold outside and getting there early is key. Due to it being a free museum, there are lots of people visiting."

Unfortunately I was in a bit of a time crunch and only had two hours to look around, but you certainly can spend an entire day here and still not see it all. It contains a wealth of artifacts, history, and information, and for me it was a very humbling experience to see it all. "

"Written July 3, 2017",Pleasant surprise with teens,"Museum is a nasty word in our family except to me the Mom, but I require each kid choose a museum to visit , every major city we see when we travel so.... one of our kids chose The British Museum. I got the usual as we walked up ""How long so we have to stay? Do we have to do a tour?"" Etc etc. To my great surprise, they found this family interactive audio tour/ game and before I knew it, it was 2 hours later and the museum was closing and they wanted to stay longer! Shocked! We are going back. Very happy. The Greek exhibit is excellent-- especially since we have seen the other half at the Acropolis museum in Athens and they tell a different story about how all the remains ended up in London! Definitely worth a trip with teens, get the family game guide. I thought our 15 year old twins might be too old for it but were not. Since it's free, going twice is not a bad idea if you have the time OR visit for an hour or 2 in morning, go to lunch around the area, then wonder back. "
"Written June 29, 2017",Wow!,"Absolutely loved this museum! Could have spent multiple days here! We only spent about a half day at the museum as we had many other things on our list to see in London. The exhibits are very well done. We explored the Roman and Egyptian sections and were floored by the beauty of the exhibits. The Parthenon and mummies were my favorite. Can't get over the fact that this museum is free of charge! Just a slight wait to get through security and you are in a world of wonder. Easy to get to. Walking distance from the tube station. Highly recommended! Didn't really notice if there was air conditioning or not. It seemed warm inside and we visited on a cool day so dress accordingly, but an absolute must see!"

While entrance to the museum is free, there was a charge to enter the special Scythian Gold exhibit, but it was well worth it-- such amazing revelations about the lives of this Siberian nomadic people."
"Written November 7, 2017",My favourite museum ever,"This museum is legendary: it hosts incredible pieces from all around the world, such as from Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Aztec art, and countless more. There are always modern expositions as well and the souvenirs are wonderful too. I adore this place and hope you will too.Some of the perks are that there is no entry fee, although donations are appreciated (and deserved!), the area around it is nice, and the access to wordly treasures is incomparable in my opinion. The only downside I can think of is the tightened security these days because there is a queue--nor can you excitedly run up the stairs of this beautiful building. Some of the rooms get crowded in peek holiday season, but the queue to enter the museum moves fast.I (lived and) have family in the UK so I have been to London many times--and I visit this museum every during each visit (perhaps 20 times). I consider myself to be a bit of an art and history geek, so I even prefer to visit museums by myself, unless accompanied by somebody even more into it."
"Written November 3, 2017",An very imposing building,"This is one of many beautiful buildings in London. It is free but understandably visitors are asked for a voluntary contribution towards costs. There is the usual bag search before you get into the museum which is conducted efficiently and by friendly staff.  The museum contains many treasures and it is best to plan what you want to see and not ‘over do’ it.  Today, I went to the section on the Americas - incredible. The museum is clean and well staffed by very helpful people. There are the usual food outlets and gift shops. This museum is very worth a visit. "
"Written November 2, 2017",free but worthy,its one of the finest and most resourceful places i've visited. If i had one more day i would definitely visit twice. it has a great collection of art and history and it will take at least half of the day to go through it. great environment with super friendly staffs. Its very well maintained. nicely decorated. You must take your kids for learning. Its one of the top five things to do in london I would recommend.

The Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, mummies galore, phenomenal collections from Greek and Roman antiquity, on and on and on...the Museum offers excellent half-hour ""eye-opener"" tours of selected aspects of their vast collections - well worth tagging along. These are not tours led by bored, pimply-faced adolescents who got a summer job at the museum courtesy of mummy and daddy. the leaders are experts in their fields, and they provide a fantastic level of information. The museum itself is easy to navigate, and because it is free to go there, you don't have to feel like you must see it all in one day There is an excellent cafe in the new atrium, and a reasonably good (although not stellar) gift shop. There is really no point going on about this place - its reputation precedes it. But everything you have heard is true."

Only $12 per person and it was a manageable group size (maybe 10-15 people).  It was easy to keep up at ask questions.  We got to see all the ""must sees"" and some other interesting things as well.  The guide was very informative.  We definitely got more out of the museum than if we'd been on our own.  An excellent choice for people who don't have all day to spend at the museum!"
"Written July 26, 2017",For kids: Egypt and Middle East sections,"You would probably need several weeks to really see what the museum has to offer, but if you're traveling with kids (ours are 7 and 12), the Egypt and Middle East sections will keep their attention. We saw the two exhibits, along with the mummies upstairs, and a few other things in about an hour.

"Written September 18, 2017",The Colonial Museum,"I heard that the British museum was a great place to visit for all types of history. So why not visit if in the neighbourhood? It is free after all. Well I enjoy history and not just looking at a catalogue of historical artefacts. So what was the issue with the museum? 1. There's no narrative. Just random items plonked in rooms with no real story. Sarcophago dotted about then a room with Assyrian artefacts again just dotted randomly. No context. 2. The narrative that is supplied is one that I believe many people are no longer interested in. Items had under them a homage to the person who ""discovered"" the item and a blurb about them, then an smaller description of the item. I really could not give a monkeys about which colonialist stole this item for the state. It really isn't important unless the item itself isn't important but merely the acquisition of it. If that's the case, then as I say in the title, change the name of the museum! 3. Plenty of merchandising and sponsorships in your face. Yes the museum needs to fund itself but it's a bit OTT.4. Stuffy. Wanted to leave earlier than planned. I could rant about other things about the museum but I'm wasting my typing breath. "
"Written September 16, 2017",This place is awesome.!,"For a history buff there is not better place to visit.  If there was problem with the British Museum it is there is more things to see than you can look at in a day, and the crowds make this problematic.  Get there first thing in the morning."
"Written June 14, 2017",Amazing and FREE!,"This is probably the best museum in London, it's always busy. You will need at least 4 hours to walk through the main galleries. Totally worth the visit!"
"Written June 13, 2017",Loved! ,A must do when in London! Get there early as it gets super crowded. Give yourself a good 3hrs to see everything so you don't feel rushed.
"Written June 12, 2017",Always special,"Although there were lots of people, we are always amazed by what we see and learn here. Great way to spend an afternoon. "
"Written June 9, 2017",The best museum in the world,I spent an entire day in this museum and barely scratched the surface of what is here to see and learn. Practically every location in the world is represented and practically every time frame since the beginning of human settlement is represented. It's amazing and overwhelming. Definitely plan out in advance what you really want to see and plan on taking breaks to rest your feet and give your mind a break. I can't wait to return and see some more of the collections here. 
"Written June 6, 2017",Shocking discrimination,"Having a back injury and recognised as disabled I faced discrimination in the worst form as I wheeled round my bag carrying my iPad, diary and umbrella - although let in by the security manager at the main gate (there were signs that People were not allowed to take in wheeled luggage but I was). Then stopped by the security guard 256 who told me that I wasn't allowed to wheel my bag with me - he told me that I could carry it but I can't lift!He then told me that I was rude and condescending when I reminded him of the equality and diversity act.Rick (--) the British Museum Visitor representative came over and insisted that either I deposit it at cost in their cloakroom or my friend carried it.I noticed that there were people carrying knapsacks and bags, there were no mental detectors. As if I could possibly trip someone up with my small bag? There were baby strollers allowed, but no room for me!"

"Written June 3, 2017",Would love another full day here!,"I loved this museum.  There was so much to see, and with so much variety I can not imagine a single person not finding an area of personal interest.  They have a lot of free tours available - the most I have seen at any museum.  It was impressive.  It was packed today and would love to have had a little A/C in a few rooms, but it was easily manageable.  The directional signage and maps were really good.  The secruity lines entering the building were moving smoothly along and did not take an unreasonable amount of time.  Would love to spend at least another full day at the British Museum."
"Written June 3, 2017",Amazing museum,"The collections are so varied and vast, that it is best taken in smaller doses. We have visited London many times and on each trip we manage to go back to the British Museum and visit a gallery we hadn't yet seen or sometimes go back to a favorite gallery. The layout is easy to follow for such a large museum. Security screening takes some time on busy days so plan accordingly."
"Written September 14, 2017",A must,It always takes me 2 days to see the BMIt is so organized that one keeps going and loses track of time All of a sudden it is time to leave 
"Written September 14, 2017","Only had a couple of hours, but Egypt was GREAT!","We only had a couple of hours at this Museum, but knowing this, we picked our favorites and made sure to see the things we really wanted to see first. Then if we had time, we would see the other sights. The Egyptian area was fantastic. Lots of information and laid out quite nicely. Another thing we really wanted to see was the Rosetta Stone. That was very popular and had a huge crowd around it.The whole museum is clean and very modern. The fact that it was free is amazing!"
"Written September 12, 2017",The Museum of Mankind -ethnography and anthropology section of the BM.,"While living in London in 1987-89 my all time most favourite museum and frequently made visit was to this smaller , manageable super interesting museum's Living Arctic exhibition. Man! It really grabbed my imagination and interest. I've been looking MoM up as my brother's  family are in London currently and I thought they may enjoy it. Very sad to read its collections were moved back to the big, imposing BM building and most of its collection are now no longer displayed :-( . 6 Burlington Garden, the building MoM was house in near Burlington Arcade  (another place I enjoy just strolling through) is really beautiful. It is meant to be architectural redeveloped for the Royal Academy of Art and be reopening in 2018, it's 250th anniversary"
"Written September 10, 2017",Ancient cultures,How could you possibly describe British Museum. It is a must to have seen it once you are in London. Old ancient cultures displayed in a most excellent way helps you understand
"Written September 9, 2017",Great  museum of the cultures of all the World,"Great free museum with cultural gems from all over the world. We ran through it in two hours which is really straining it, but that was stretching my kids attention span.The kids especially liked seeing ""dum-dum"" the eastern islands statue, the Rosetta Stone and of course the mummies.I could easily spend a day here on my own and would definitely have taken the guided tours as they seem very knowledgeable and know the ins and outs of all the exhibits.

"Written September 1, 2017",Too much good stuff for one day!,"Excellent museum packed with stunning artifacts from around the world. They had wheelchairs right at the entry; my companion pushed me around the 3rd floor exhibits from ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt, Etrusca, Mycenae (?), prehistoric England, etc. Wow. And you can't beat the price...... Free"
"Written August 30, 2017",Museum,"This museum is global!  I would rate it as a very important museum worldwide. The Rosetta Stone is there along with many Egyptian and Greek treasures. I mean original treasures!  If these things were not scattered around the world, many would be destroyed by the likes of ISIS. "
"Written August 29, 2017",must see when visiting London,This museum has a lot of interesting artifacts from all around the worls - and you can have tea at the end of the at the rotunda.
"Written August 26, 2017",AMAZING!,"It's the British Museum! If you only have time for one museum in London, this should be it. Don't rush it. Schedule enough time so that you can appreciate all that this museum has to offer. It is crowded and that slows movement, so consider that when you are planning your time."
"Written June 2, 2017",Better than the Louvre!,"This museum has such amazing displays!  Not only do you see an item, but you learn about it's history.  For example, any mummy you may see will have any x-rays or ct scans with it, along with where it was found and what the test results were.  It's all laid out so beautifully, too. My favorite museum ever!"
"Written June 2, 2017",My favorite museum in London,"If you only have time to visit one museum in London, this one is the one I would recommend. My favorite parts were the Egyptian, Byzantine, Babylonian, Greek, and Roman sections. The Rosetta Stone is there!  It's amazing to be able to stand a few inches from the stone that unlocked the Egyptian hieroglyphs and opened up a world of information for archaeologists The Egyptian section includes statues of some of the most famous pharaohs as well as sarcophagi, mummies, pottery, and other artifacts. In the Byzantine, Mesopotamian, and Babylonian section, the winged lions with human heads that guarded the Byzantine gates and the cuneiform tablets from Babylonia were amazing. The collection of statues and artifacts from ancient Greek and Roman civilizations was immense. It just goes on and on. Also impressive were the Native American and Mexican sections.  Admission is free, so I would recommend two days at least for this wonderful museum. ."
"Written May 31, 2017",Free entry to a world of wonderful art and history,I spent a very relaxing day walking the exhibits. Be prepared to climb many steps to the various halls of history.
"Written May 31, 2017",Human Heritage,"If you have time only for one, go to British Museum. It has the most stunning collection of the journey of homo sapiens from stone age to date."
"Written May 30, 2017",A great day,"Had a great visit on bank holiday Monday.Arrived early before the crowds and went in without delay. When we left, the people were qued up in the street."
"Written May 28, 2017",Excellent museum and for free,"We went to British museum on a weekday morning so there wasn't a big rush so we got to explore for hours before it was starting to get crowded. Must warn, museum is huge. It's best to either select beforehand which portions you wish to see or reserve 2-3 days for it. If we ever visit London again, we will definitely go back to British museum, the collections are amazing and there's just so much to see. Museum does not charge any entrance fee but you can (should) make a donation of the amount you choose in the various collection boxes."
"Written May 23, 2017",No need to travel any further.,"So I first visited with my brother and sister-in-law, and they were happy with an hour and a half visit.  I returned the next day solo and my brother expressed surprise.  I explained that I had the most fabulous day- spending the morning in Ancient Greece in the Parthenon, late morning in Ancient Assyria, early afternoon in Anglo Saxon England (Sutton Hoe exhibit), late afternoon in the Enlightenment.  No need to travel to the Middle East or to time travel to old England - it is all there.  A world treasure. "
"Written May 21, 2017",Absolutely fantastic museum!,This museum has so much history in it that one could easily spend a full week and still not see everything of relevance therein.  Probably recommend having a guide and advise what is of interest.  Don't leave it as the last attraction to visit!
"Written May 18, 2017",Must see museum,This place is amazing; you really need a couple of days in this museum to see everything. Great place to take the family plus it is free. 
"Written May 17, 2017",Wonderful Gem of a Museum,"What a wonderful gem in London. Free to get in. Rick Steves does a wonderful audio tour as well as a tour in his London guidebook. You can download this for free through any podcast app on your phone. So much history in one place! Conveniently, there is also a Starbucks right across the road. "
"Written July 24, 2017",BUCKET LIST MUST!!!  See over & over & over!,Truly a Bucket List place!!!! Wonderful in every way. I could live here in the museum ....and probably would have to just to see everything in one lifetime!! Before you leave do some research and find out what you can't live without seeing. Then study a map of the museum to know just where to go so you don't waste your valuable time here. I promise you will want to come back over and over and over again!!!
"Written July 20, 2017",So much to see!,"You could really spend days at this museum and not see all the wonderful collections! It has a striking inner courtyard that in and of itself requires walking around to admire. Best of all it's free.We went between 11:30-noon and didn't find a long security line at all. There were sometimes several large tour groups that infiltrate the space you'd like to be in, such as around the popular Rosetta Stone (this exhibit is very cool btw!). You have to patiently wait a bit to see it up close.We spent €5 each to get an audio guide that you can punch in the exhibit number and get a brief explanation. And we used Rick Steve's Pocket London guidebook to point out the more interesting artwork in Egypt, Greece and Assyria. His ""tour"" took about 2.5-3 hours, which is about all my kids (ages 13 and 9) could bear in a big museum like this, so we'll have to go back someday!"
"Written July 18, 2017",ancient,"A very ancient and astonishing place we were really amazed by the beauty and magnificence. There are free guided tours of each section at specific times throughout the day, which are detailed in the map. Also  from the top down, and they had historical elements and artefacts of almost every country, from Japan at the top right down to Africa and Ancient Egypt at the bottom. Greek, British, Irish, Roman, American...basically ancient history and how people use to live all in one. I really liked the history of money and how it came about from trading blocks of gold to Apple pay and card these days, the pharmaceutical industry impact, and also the sections on time and clocks as well as writing styles from around the world, like hieroglyphics etc. The Egyptian section was amazing; huge sphinx, stone carvings of Pharaoh's, mummification and the Rosetta stone. There is so much in the museum that you could easily spend a couple of hours if not the whole day. "
"Written July 11, 2017",On of the best.,"Best museum in London and it is free.  Can be crowded at times but lots to see.  Rosetta stone, Elgin marbles etc."
"Written July 10, 2017",Tour London Walks,"Terrible tour guide for London Walks. Took much too long to get organized, collect funds and start the tour. Very eccentric guide that took 20 minutes to explain something that should have taken two. After 1 1/2 hours, we had only seen two things in the museum."
"Written July 10, 2017",Multiple visits; still much to see,"This was my third visit to the British Museum. On previous visits I had spent most of my time in ancient civilizations: Greece, Rome, and Egypt. Those collections are some of the best in the world and well worth the majority of my time spent on two previous visits. The Rosetta Stone is also worth a visit of its own. This visit, though, I managed to move on to other displays including Britain from 800 BC through Medieval Europe which occupied a good four hours reading display descriptions and viewing artifacts.A few pointers: Admission is free. If you are on a budget, you may want to print out a map ahead of time, although you can pick up a free map, with limited descriptions, inside the Great Court. Guide books and more detailed maps are for sale.The Great Court restaurants can get very busy. There is a pizzeria is the southwest corner (through room 12: Greece 1050-520 BC) that may be less hectic should you opt for dining within the museum."
"Written July 7, 2017",Excellent!,"This is a must see museum if you are visiting London, it has an amazing wealth of items that would interest even people who don't normally like museums. The place looks fabulous. The only downside is that there are a lot of people there, since the tour buses bring tourist there pretty much daily. So you really want to get there a few minutes before they open. I love that their brochure highlights all the must see items/exhibits and gives their exact location within the museum, so if you only have an hour or two to spend there you will see the most important things if you follow their suggestions. "
"Written July 7, 2017",Just thrilling,"This museum is such an amazing place,Its very big with great ventilation and this place have lots and lots of historic monuments and huge collection of old stuff,every corner of this museum has display showing directions for specific collectionmust visit place with family and friends because it also have a huge lawn where you can chill after long walk around the museum."
"Written July 6, 2017",Amazing Antiquities,"What an interesting experience the British Museum is! Full of ancient marvels from many civilizations. See mummies (even cat mummies), the rosetta stone, the Elgin marbles from the Parthenon, and much, much more! "
"Written July 5, 2017",Incredible Collection,"Headed here with wife and 9 year old daughter, quick to get into the Museum on a weekend and easy to navigate our way through various exhibits. Very traveller friendly. Fascinating facts about life in Ancient Egypt. So much more to explore so would love to go back. Had a tasty pizza there too."
"Written May 13, 2017",I could spend all day here,"Artifacts from neolithic Britain, Egyptian mummies, bog man, Assyrian artifacts, ancient greek and roman mosaics, coins, urns, helmets and swords,THE ROSETTA STONE, pieces of the Parthenon, and more. And, i didn't see everything....Will have to go back."
"Written May 13, 2017",World Recognized Egyptian Exhibit,"While here in London, I have visited the British Museum three times to gain the full appreciation of the exhibit. Artifacts dating back to 3000 years BC are truly a miracle to have survived and have a permanent home such as the museum. It is unfortunate that so many visitors don't take the time to read about each piece they are seeing. It appears that the majority rush thru, take a photo and rush on. Even for the Rosetta Stone, the cursory photo is taken with reflections in your photo from the glass enclosure and someone's head without even reading the basics. My suggestion is to pay attention to what you see and see it well. The museum is too large to see it all. Take one area and do it justice. Enjoy your visit."
"Written May 12, 2017",How did the Brits get so many epic pieces of world history?,We loved the British Museum - it was  a bit of a hike from our hotel in Southwark but just walking around London is a tourist experience on its own. We loved seeing so many epic pieces of ancient history in one destination. Seeing the Rosetta Stone was a highlight and the other items from the Middle East and Egypt were awesome. 
"Written May 10, 2017",I could stay here the whole day!,A free museum with an expansive and impressive collection of exhibits from all over the world. I went expecting to just spend an hour or two and spent 5 by accident. I particularly enjoyed the exhibits focused on Egyptian history. I learned so much.   
"Written May 6, 2017",Disappointing visit,"We had envisioned spending a whole day at this British Museum but barely stayed 2-hrs.  We didn't have to wait in long lines and later found out why -- there was barely anything worth seeing.  The Chinese section was closed for renovation, the Africa section consisted of baskets and spears, the Korean section had endless jars and plates, only the Egyptian section had interesting  artifacts worthy of a museum.  The museum was stuffy due to poor ventilation.  We left one exhibit to to get fresh air but no one wanted to go back in.  Good thing entrance was free."
"Written May 6, 2017",Amazing Ruins,"I'm not a history buff. I'm not an archeologist. Most museums with ruins tend to bore me because they have some weird Egyptian art. However, the British Museum has remarkable treasures from Egypt, Greece, and the rest of Europe. We didn't see the entire museum, which is another plus. It's layout is well suited for jumping in and taking off when ready. "
"Written April 28, 2017",A lot to see,Gorgeous space with loads of impressive artefacts. We mainly focused on Egypt  and Middle Eastern sculpture - lovely to be able to get so close to these wonderful artworks. Museum shop had lots of interesting things too.
"Written April 27, 2017",Takes time!!,"An amazing and huge collection of artifacts from around the globe. Someone else said it best when they commented that you could easily have a history of the world right here at one museum. It's so big though, plan lots of time to see it all."
"Written April 26, 2017",Family visit,"This is a must when in London, so many experiences to divulge in so many different cultures. You really need two visits to catch every experience, or a long day. You possibly could not take in so History in one day. We loved it."
"Written April 23, 2017",A must-see for everyone,"The British Museum was the highlight of my trip to London. If you have even the slightest interest in history, I urge you to come and visit.The building itself is both iconic and practical, with a beautiful exterior and large center room built to handle the large number of visitors.The artefacts are truly magnificent. Highlights include the Rosetta Stone, relics from The Parthenon and the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. All awe-inspiring.My only criticism is that the pieces are kept within reach - great for feeling engaged with the history, but sad as people constantly disregard the ""no touching"" signs! I'm no archaeologist, but I assume those signs are put up with good reason? A shame."
"Written April 23, 2017",Early visit,"Our visit began right after it was open. I felt like I saw more detail here, of the Egyptian pieces then I did when I was IN Egypt. Also being part Indigenous from Canada.  I saw the part with a lot of First Nations art &  traditional pieces. I'm glad they are showing the truth about what happened to indigenous people. Meaningful visit."
"Written April 22, 2017",Many cultures in one place,"This museum has no more than 5% of British pieces in their collection, but the rest is a very interesting exposition of egiptian, Greek and Romanese cultures. You can even see great pieces from Mexico's Aztec culture. The museum is spacious and well designed. Even though has many visitors, it does not feel like a crowded place. It's definitely worth the visit  and it's even free."
"Written April 20, 2017",British at its Best,"First a little hint, everyone uses the main entrance and there are large queues to get in.  In order to skip the queues, use a side entrance such as ontague place.  We walked straight in.Once inside take your time and enjoy the exhibits.  Get hold of a map and do two or three sections you really want to see before letting yourself get lost in the other rooms.  This is becuase you will need more than one visit to do everything. Compared to the Natural History Museum, this museum is laid out in a much better way and there are less people to have to try and navigate as a result. The Egypt section which contains the famous mummies and sarcophagus' will be busy no matter what time you go as that is a massive attraction to the museum."
"Written April 18, 2017",Almost Hard To Wrap Your Head Around,"We visited the British Museum for several hours on Easter Sunday afternoon, so of course it was incredibly crowded. I was grateful I had a Rick Steeves ""Pocket Guide to London"" with me to guide us through several of the exhibits. His writing is very conversational and funny, and provided even more context to what we were seeing than the written descriptions at the exhibits themselves -- starting with his introduction that in the 19th century, more than 1/4 of the world was controlled by Britain, and this museum's collection reflects that. Rick Steeves' guide let us to seek out 2-4 specific items in each room within just three exhibits in the Museum -- so we were able to spend some time really looking and learning, rather than wandering aimlessly about. I was of course mesmerized by the Rosetta Stone and the Parthenon exhibits, and our 11- and 13-year-old kids loved all of the ancient Egyptian artifacts. We ran out of steam after a couple of hours -- a combination of a busy day and huge crowds -- but I would absolutely love to return and spend more time. I am so glad we were there. Extraordinary."
"Written April 16, 2017",Really great place,"Really great place to visit, everything was there. No feeds to pay, no que at all. Amazing place, I was there with my wife, we walked about 2-3 hours and still we did saw just little but of The museum. Best museum In London and maybe In world. I would liked to come there later, maybe need to come London again 🤔🤔"

"Written September 14, 2016",Mesmerizing and Everything I thought it Would Be,"Having always been interested in Ancient Egyptian history, the British Museum was definitely a place I wanted to see. I easily spent hours here, wandering through the exhibits. Go early if you can to beat the large amounts of tourists, especially if you want to get up close to the Rosetta Stone. "
"Written September 13, 2016",Amazing ancient treasures in the middle of town,"This museum is worth making time for. It is one of the many treasures London has to offer and let's you travel to far away places while remaining in the center of this vibrant city. When we see what is happening to some of the historical treasures of Iraq and Syria, it makes us appreciate even more those forward thinkers who made a move to protect architectural treasures in times of destruction, and preserve them here, for us all to enjoy. I will never look at the trim on a building the same way again..."
"Written September 12, 2016",A must stop,"I go here everytime and I'm always amazed. Do yourself a favor and pick up the audio tour when you arrive. It makes a huge difference, but talk about a trip around the world in one building. "
"Written September 12, 2016",Traditional museum,"What can I say about an institution like the British Museum? The things exhibited are enormous, walking through history. We spent 2 hours visiting and barely scratch the surface (our feet gave up on us). If there's anything to improve, IMO, may consider adding some modern elements like interactive displays which we learned is going to be part of the 2nd level displays. "
"Written September 7, 2016",Excellent Hotel but Overwhelming,Kids might get bored with the way the hotel displays its priceless objects. Lots of stairs and so so much to see. 
"Written September 5, 2016",Colossal art collection,"If you looking for some free stuff in London then this is a must see attraction. The British Museum houses some of the most renowned works of art in Europe. The artworks are from all different time periods and are intriguing to look at. Before going, make sure you have plenty of time to spend at the museum, especially if you are interested in art. Admission to the museum is free, so you could spend split up the visit into separate days. If you short on time, then get hold of 1 hours and 3 hours must see guide available at the entrance."
"Written September 4, 2016",Excellent,"One of the best museums in the world with a huge collection of artifacts.  Great mix of exhibits from all cultures and periods.

"Written September 3, 2016",Nice place to visit,"It's worth to pop in here. The attraction is free so if you don't have much time you can at least check some most interesting rooms. I would recommend to stay there longer and see entire collection of very impressive artefacts I""s perfect for raining day. There is also a great restaurant on the upper floor."
"Written December 31, 2016",An absolute must see,"This is a fantastic museum that deserves at least a day's visit--even then, don't think you can see it all.  This a place you could go back to again and again and not see the same exhibit twice.  We went through the Egyptian, Assyrian, Roman-Greco and British Isle exhibits and were not disappointed.  The Assyrian exhibit was stunning--I almost cried when I went past the sphinxes--it was thrilling to see them.  Equally fascinating were the ""hoard"" exhibits in the British Isles exhibits--look them up, you will be astonished at the craftsmanship of these early peoples.  The exhibits are well laid out with good signage.  Our family did not include any young children, so we can't speak to how they might enjoy the museum but there were a lot of children there the day we went and they seemed to be enjoying the exhibits.  "
"Written December 31, 2016",Very good,"A wonder of the world. Must be seen. It is quite tirying if you want to visit it all, but it is a phantastic experience. "
"Written December 21, 2016",Easy to spend a whole day here,"I'm a huge museum fan and history buff, and I spent my whole day here from open to close. Admission is free, but I chose to rent an audioguide (they offer discounts for students) and I found that really enhanced my visit. The guide offers different tour options, so if you're looking to only spend an hour or two here before moving on, the guide will direct you to the museum's highlights (including the Rosetta Stone and statues from the Parthenon!)."
"Written December 15, 2016",Amazing resource,"Summary based on many visits:--amazing resource, extremely strong in some areas--free (donation requested)--some popular exhibits can be so crowded as to be unviewable--camera phones have transformed the experience to something like a rugby scrum--less visited areas are quite goodNow has a preliminary bag check in a sheltered tent, but no big deal. Lighting after sunset in the Great Court isn't very good.Selfie sticks and visitors without a clue are a threat."
"Written December 7, 2016",Nice,"Nice just expected it to be more interesting and the infrastructure was little bit difficult, so we had been going circles."
"Written December 4, 2016",Nice free museum. Great restaurant inside.,"We were here for about 4hrs before we headed to Oxford street. This museum is free but accept donation, very well maintained.

"Written November 28, 2016",Great Stop on Your Visit to London,"The British Museum is giant - you could easily spend an entire day there and still might not see everything.  If it's your first time and you don't want to spend the entire day at the museum, I highly recommend downloading Rick Steve's podcast that takes you through some of the major highlights of the museum. It allows you to feel like you've seen a lot, but gives you plenty of time to add more items to your itinerary for the day!"

And amazing enough, it is free of charge to visit the Museum as it is the case with a number of other outstanding Museums in London. The Asian collection is closed at this moment due to reforms gong on on that section of the museum. However the Middle East section which is a true highlight of the collection is open and spectacular as ever. Don´t try to see everything in one day. Their is free admission which means that you can come back another day to  visit other parts of the huge collection. The Audio Guide which you have to pay for was really good and worth using.So enjoy your walk through the history."
"Written November 22, 2016",Wow!,"This museum is amazing!  I have been to many museums in Europe and this one still surprised me!  So much valuable artifacts collected from all over the world.  We spent 5 hours in the museum and covered less than half of the exhibits (would love to stay longer, but seriously could not walk anymore).  We focused on the Egyptian and Chinese Jade/Ceramic exhibits.  They were truly amazing.   The museum is huge and it is impossible to see everything in a day.  It is best to focus on the few that are most interesting to you and then come back in another trip to see the other parts. "
"Written March 27, 2017",Huge and Awesome,"London's museums are free of charge to enter.  That by itself is just amazing.  The British Museum did not disappoint.  The Rosetta Stone is the piece everyone knows, but the museum is full of so many other artifacts, artwork, and historical elements.  The staff is not pretentious and are willing to explain or educate if you ask questions.  We did not feel rushed or crowded.  This is a world class museum you should not miss during your trip to wonderful London!"
"Written March 20, 2017",All the World in one museum,This is a must-see every time I'm in London. I think you could visit 100 times and not see it all. The original Rosetta stone is worth a look and the much-disputed Elgin (Acropolis) marbles have to be seen.
"Written March 18, 2017",Wow!,"There is so much to see at this Museum that it can be intimidating. But, get a map, have a tea or coffee break and plan your visit.  I was with a friend and we went our own directions. Concentrate on the areas you like..there is no way to see it all. Just savor what you love...for me it was the Elgin marbles and Egyptian rooms."
"Written March 17, 2017",Great fun!,We have gone several times and we can't get enough.  We visit London two times a year and every time visit this museum.  Always great exhibits and never enough time to see it all.  So we keep going back.
"Written March 13, 2017",Leading Global History Museum,"Aesthetically really interesting. Great long-term Egyptian exhibit with a lot of really nice travelling exhibits. Lots of great free exhibits from around the world - Iran, US, SE Asia, Ancient History, etc."
"Written March 9, 2017",It's the British Museum,"What else needs be said? But they are making me type more, so here it is: Britain conquered the world, and is now ashamed of it.  But you shouldn't be, because the museum is filled with all the riches and glory conquest brings with it. Enjoy. "
"Written March 6, 2017",Not bad,"The best part was Egyptian museum. Can see the mummified king, queen, cats, etc. in my opinion it is good to visit for Egyptian museum. "
"Written March 5, 2017",British Museum,"First and foremost arrive at opening time, no later than 10:30 to miss the queues/lines. That goes for all the museums. Secondly, entry is free. Thirdly, you need more than one day to do it justice! We spent almost a whole day in the Egyptian section. Do track down the Rosetta Stone. The detail of the carving is unbelievable and this item unlocked thousands of years of history as it deciphered hieroglyphics. And the kids will like the Mummies."
"Written March 5, 2017",Afternoon Tea,We visited the Museum which is fantastic and had afternoon tea in the main restaurant which was great. If you can do it - do it.
"Written March 3, 2017",Free nice 2 hour visit,"Been here with the family (2 kids, 11&13years) and my wife. Impressive collection of ancient egyptian, roman ... artwork. Especially the mummies could count on the children's attention. There are several quiet spots also if you want to have a pause. The hall is worthwile a visit, just for the cheer impressive size alone. The cafetaria is very busy, but there is ample space and the prices are fair. Easily reachable by bus."
"Written January 19, 2017","Ask your Mummy to see, remind her it's free","This place is amazing if you like history and are interested in seeing real authentic pieces of different civilizations that the Brits ""collected"" over their world domination days. Rosetta stone is a big draw and gets engulfed by people as soon as the doors open. The egypt exhibit was amazing with real mummies and preserved bodies. It was pretty incredible to see. After that there are a lot of jars, pots, jewelry, etc. from civilizations of the past. Definitely the best collection of real (not casts) items that I saw out of any museums I went to in London.Tip: Get there early on weekends, place fills up fast and gets very noisy and crowded."
"Written January 14, 2017",Wow but gets very busy,"We visited here over xmas which was no doubt a very busy time for the museum. It certainly has an exceptional collection of artifacts collected from the expeditions from many British explorers over the years (and don't ask, they are not giving any of it back!) I particularly enjoyed the Egyptology and Ancient Greek sections. The day we visited was so busy, all of their toilets could not take the strain and they closed half an hour early due to a plumbing issue! Recommend hiring the audio guide for a cost of 6 pounds. Again it was so busy they were all out when we got there (12 PM) and so we queued to get one at 2 PM. 2nd recommendation - get there early!! It still cant be beaten for a free activity to do in London. The glass ceiling over the entry courtyard is a piece of architectural beauty alone."
"Written January 13, 2017",Where is the British History,"Maybe I missed something, but I thought I was going to see loads and loads of UK, English, British, London, etc History.  There was some, but I think I learned more about Egypt, Italy and Greece...and now there is an American exhibit coming?!  I was excited to come, but about an hour or so in I got bored.  All the open exhibits started to run together and some looked like the bricker brack cabinets in my grandmother's dinning room.  I loved the architecture of the building and I bought a book about it along with some other reasonably priced museum books.  I would have eaten something, but I am not a fan of food that is left out with a cover...too many kids about to chance it.   I have been to museums around the world and this is by no means the worst, but I guess I was expecting something different."
"Written January 12, 2017","More interesting than you'd think, even for a couple of hours","Massive collection of artefacts, but its easy to find the headliners and we didn't feel overwhelmed by the size of it.You can spend a long time here but it also works for a couple of hours with kids - good option if you're in this corner of London and want an interesting diversion from shops...."
"Written January 11, 2017",Culture experience,First thing I did upon getting to London. Absolutely loved the range of work. My favourite was the Egyptian exhibit. Great way to spend the day and appreciate the histories of the world under one roof.

"Written January 8, 2017",Amazing place ,Could have spend a week here but unfortunately wasn't very interesting for my wife.  Make sure you go alone or with someone who appreciates history.Would I recommend....YES Would I return .... YES
"Written January 6, 2017",Prepare for the crowds,"How can you go to London without a stop at the British Museum? Especially  since many of the countries where it's treasures were ""discovered"" have asked for their return. Given our schedule, it was impossible to go anytime but the late afternoon, when it was the most crowded. But I was determined to see the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles, etc. I appreciated the fact that entry was free, and it has delightful gift shops, although it was lacking in sufficient bathrooms. Due to the crowds we only stayed for two hours, but it was exhilarating to see things you have read about."
"Written January 2, 2017",Worth visiting,"The museum is huge, there is so much to see - you will need at least half a day if you want to see a few of the exhibits.  The architecture of the museum is beautiful."
"Written January 1, 2017","One of the most important museums in the world, a must!",This museum has collections of every continent and is a must. Try to be early (10 am) and be ready to walk at least 4 hours. I recommend audio guide for knowing more about selected items.
"Written November 12, 2016","Amazing collection, even if half of it is stolen","This is one of the most impressive museums I have ever visited. I spent all day here and needed at least one more to see everything. Wide range of historical artifacts, with emphasis on Greek, Roman, Egyptian history. It is also free. I went off-season (but during school break) and it was crowded but not claustrophobic. I ate in the center food court which was reasonably priced with good food, but with limited seating. Definitely worth a visit. "

"Written November 1, 2016",Busy,Visited the special exhibition over the lost cities discovered in Egypt - fascinating. Exhibition finishes soon so would highly recommend to go now.
"Written October 31, 2016",One of the best!,You could easily spend the whole day at the British Museum! It's a huge gorgeous building and has something for everyone! My favorite exhibit is the Egyptian mummies! There are so many mummies both human and animal! They are displayed so all can see and the history of them is explained very clearly.  The Egyptian artifacts are something to see also.  The museum houses the Rosetta Stone and a statue from Easter Island plus numerous sculptures and relics from all thru history.  It is truly one of the great museums in the whole world!
"Written October 31, 2016","Amazing interior, wide range on display","Really enjoyed my short visit to this museum, even though I am generally not a fan of museums. When I first stepped into the museum, I felt a sense of grandeur. I was impressed with the design and columns. One of my favourite rooms (I didn't see that many) were the Egyptian rooms. The artifacts on display were simply breathtaking and I was in awe of the architecture of the olden days. Must see. "
"Written October 21, 2016",Stunning,If you love or dislike this place is magically. They are not only things to look at or read but to understand and be in awe of. Man kind can be cruel sometimes but we can do pretty great things and you see it at the british museum. stunning
"Written October 19, 2016",Very exiting and interesting!,Enjoyed very much the exhibitions and the item that saw there.Very recommended for people who like and interested in history and archaeology.  
"Written October 18, 2016",Must see,Over two million years of human history and culture under one roof! Absolutely one of the best and is FREE!
"Written October 16, 2016",Fascinating!,"One of the best museums I've ever been to! Their collection is beyond words and I was fascinated by everything I saw.The museum is huge, so make sure you get there as soon as it opens (10AM), and don't expect to get out before they close (5PM). The floor plan and the layout of the museum can be slightly disorientating.Would definitely visit again! And again, and again.... and again!"
"Written September 3, 2016",Go early and it's free,"You can easily spend a day in the museum, tonnes to see and learn. Slightly confusing display of sculptures and paintings, but since it's free, nothing to complain. Enjoy!"
"Written September 2, 2016",Impressive,What a massive building filled was really amazing stuff and the fact that it is free is also amazing. I loved that you can either go in quickly and see some great stuff or you could spend hours there and still not see everything.
"Written September 2, 2016",WOWZA!!!,"Wow!!  That's the word my husband and I kept saying throughout the FREE museum.  We only had 45 minutes but made the most of every minute.  The Rosetta Stone and the Egyptian areas you can't miss.  Great, great place to visit!"
"Written September 2, 2016",WOW!  Incredible!  The best!  ,"The British Museum is a mainstay of my visits to London.  Even after having lived there 9 years I still return to the British Museum whenever I can.  It is a treasure trove of history - not just of the U.K. but the human race.  History sits in the halls of this museum - the things you learned about in school - they come alive as you realize you are seeing them face to face.  The collection(s) are vast and well laid out.  The museum is very well kept and the atmosphere is a pleasure to visit.  I actually had a chance to sit out front at the mobile cafe(s) and really enjoyed soaking in the sun and just people watching as well.This is a must see on anyone's visit itinerary - plan to spend at least 4-6 hours or longer if you have the time.  It's great of kids, teens, and adults.  "
"Written September 2, 2016",An Amazing Museum,"You can spend days here and still not see anything.  The permanent collection is fantastic, especially the Egyptian and Greek materials.  The Persian collection is pretty incredible as well.  Plus, the special exhibits are phenomenal (my favorite is Egypt's Sunken Cities, which is there until November 2016).   And best of all, the regular collection is free!"
"Written September 2, 2016",Lives up to its reputation.,"Always wanted to see the Rosetta Stone.  So many great things to see.  Well done.  So many sources of info on this, it hardly needs anything added from me."
"Written September 2, 2016",Free! ,You'd be mad not to take advantage of this free national resource. So much to see. And see close up. You could spend hours in there or even days. 
"Written September 2, 2016",Rosetta Stone,"I went with 1 main purpose to see the Rosetta Stone it was awesome, had a look at the Ancient Egyptian rooms they were spectacular with mummies & cartouches & burial items. The antiques rooms were full of artifacts from around the world, there was an antechamber just for South American stuff. In all an exceptional place to visit"
"Written September 1, 2016",Fantastic collection,"British Museum, similar to other large museums, is not a landmark fully appreciated on a single visit.  If you come to terms with this reality, your visits to this museum will be better planned and more enjoyable.  I tend to use British Museum as a transitional destination on each trip to London.  I allot a part of a day and as such plan to see a smaller subset of this collection.  This way, I am driven mad by the volume of artifacts and the urge to try to see everything.  You will see people who think they can absorb thousands of years of human civilization at one visit.  They are rushed and tired and panicked.  Instead, take your time and stroll through one or two galleries.  Read the legends and try to understand the time frame and the geography.  That way you may actually take something away for life from your visit.  "
"Written August 27, 2016",Sunken Cities: Egypt's Lost Worlds,"The British Museum defies review...so this is merely the review of the temporary exhibition  ""Sunken Cities: Egypt's Lost Worlds"" which is on until the 27th of November 2016. The show is about two cities on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, east of Alexandria, which flourished in Ptolemaic times and gradually sank until they were submerged deeply and forgotten about for centuries. They were discovered in the middle of the last century, and systematically explored by underwater archeologists who contributed their chief findings to this superb exhibition. I was astonished at the scale of finds (monumental statuary)  as well the nature of finds. Since these are not ancient cities by Egyptian standards, and heavily influenced by the Greek culture of the Ptolemies, I was not expecting much in the way of new insights. I was totally mistaken. Many of the monumental works follow the traditions of Egyptian art closely, showing how thoroughly the Ptolemies ""went native"", pretending to be traditional pharaohs. On the other hand, many of the finds show the multi-culturality which was so striking about Alexandria. The artifacts not only show how Greek and Egyptian gods were revered side-by-side, but that new, syncretistic gods and cults emerged and became big, like Serapis, who was worshiped in major temples in these cities. The part of the exhibition about the ""Mysteries of Osiris"" ( as in the ""death and resurrection of"")  is particularly enlightening.I would recommend listening to the audio guide which is excellent in explaining all these aspects."
"Written February 28, 2017",New way to explore the museum ,"I recently listened to the phenomenally excellent podcast by the BBC and the British museum called ""A History of the World in 100 Objects."" It is still available as is an extremely good companion book that you can purchase in the British Museum's bookstore. Each episode of the podcast is about 12-14 minutes long. The narration makes even seemingly mundane objects in the museum completely come alive and some of the episodes are absolutely electrifying as well as enlightening. An example is a cabinet with some pottery jugs that do not look terribly interesting at first. When one listens to or reads the text of the podcast one finds that this is an example of a lost civilization called the Moche which once rivaled the Incas the Babylonians and the Egyptians. A thorough explanation of the history as well as the disappearance of the Moche people is given. This is the difference in just strolling through the museum and truly letting history illuminate one's imagination. Of course you must have time to do this but as I visit the museum two or three times a year I will henceforth try to search out some of these objects. "
"Written February 25, 2017",Great Britain ,I don't know why they call it British museum. You will see the influance of great Britain all over the world. Don't skip it
"Written February 21, 2017",So much to see... and it's free!! ,"It would take many, many visits to the British museum to do it justice, there really is just so much to see. Our first trip was a little frantic and rushed but we did the basics...the Rosetta Stone, Colossal granite head of Amenhotep III, Hoa Hakananai'a - The Easter Island Statue, and the The Elgin Marbles. You won't be disappointed! "
"Written February 14, 2017",All continents in one museum,"Incredible to think this museum is free! The collection is very impressive, you can easily spend 3-4 hours there. I did not have an audio guide and still stayed there for around 3 hours. I suppose that with an audio guide it takes even longer. It is easy to get lost so always look at the map which will show you which regions can be found in which floors. In the ground floor you can see a lot of Acient Egypt, including Rosetta Stone. But I think that in the upper floors, close to the part about Coptic Egypt and Ethiopia, you will find the famous mummies. This part is the fullest, many school groups, young children, teenagers, teachers... everyone wants to see the mummies. Honestly, you can't see much because they are mummies! :D So it is not like an horror movie. But still interesting to see how well preserved they remain. I also found the part about Japan and Korea very interesting, it even made me want to visit Japan. Not big cities like Tokyo but small, calmer ones to see the beauty of the art there. There are also some very small exhibitions about native people from the Arctic regions, Australia, Polinesia, South America... It was very interesting, I wish we could have more information about these cultures. So be prepared to walk a lot and you can see basically things from all over the world! All continents can be found there."
"Written February 2, 2017",Lots to see and some fantastic Artefacts,I went during the week with a friend of mine and we strolled around for a few hours. Unfortunately there were lots of school groups around so it was very crowded but Artefacts like the Rosetta Stone and well preserved mummies still made the visit worthwhile. 
"Written February 1, 2017",Best attraction in London,"This is undoubtedly one of the best attractions in London. It's free (except for certain exhibitions) and contains a history of the world in one place, from the Egyptian statues to the Greek marbles and so much more. It's wheel chair and pram accessible, has coffee shops and eating areas inside and out and is generally lovely day out. It is huge so might need more than one visit, but is very manageable if you only want to see certain exhibits."
"Written January 30, 2017",TERRIFIC!,"A long journey around the World through the History: great and marvellous statues of the hellenic period, huge babilonian carved horses, the Rosetta Stone, Maya and Atzec finds, etcetera. And you can see all of this for free... but a little donation is welcomed (and a must)! ;)"
"Written January 27, 2017",Wonders From around the world,"Spending.a day at the British Museum is like giving yourself a masterclass of world heritage. This monument to the British love of travel and acquisition (purchased and plundered) is awesome in its scale. It may leave you slightly uncomfortable though, wondering whether the artefacts should be there at all, which you will have to contend with to balance the immense sense of enrichment you would have acquired from the experience of the visit."
"Written January 26, 2017",A gem,"Yes, it can be crowded, & overwhelming. Do your homework before visit. It may take a few visits, to get a sense out of it. I went to BM every time I was in London, easily spent 3-4 hours each time. I enjoyed having a nice lunch there as well for a much needed break. There are many fantastic museums in the world, but this one is free, you can visit as many times as you like, and I never had to wait in a long line or any lines....so there are not anything one could complain. Maybe donate a few ponds to help with the institution.  Review the floor plan, pick a direction., or exhibits of interests to avoid overwhelming.  Last visit, I went in from other entrance instead of the main one, there was no line for the scrutiny.  "
"Written January 20, 2017",British Museum,"A five minute walk from Holborn station . Well signposted route. Admission is free, and open late on Fridays. Fantastic museum with artefacts from ancient Babylon , ancient Egypt, Greece , India and from around the world . The museum map lays out a 45 min walk of the key exhibits , or a 2 hr walk with more details and there are free guided tours at different times of the day. It's worth sitting down and planning which rooms to visit as it's a lot to take in. I would suggest starting in room 4 on the ground floor, just off the main entrance hall. It's the ancient Egypt hall . The sheer size , and age of the items will take your breath away. Enjoy. "
"Written October 15, 2016",Well worth the trip alone,My first trip to the British museum and it was more impressive than expected. The amount of culture and artifacts is overwhelming. Really a collection of our history as residents of same planet. I would make the 4000 mile flight again to visit. Make sure to spend an entire day
"Written October 11, 2016",Great Exhibits - Beware of the Crowds!,"Visited for a few hours in early October, 2016.  It was midday and the museum was so crowded it was hard to move through the exhibits.  The Egyptian artifacts were especially well-presented.  We tried to complete the free guided tour of the Egyptian exhibit at 2:30pm, but the guide was very soft-spoken and there was a group of about 30 people trying to pay attention to her, but hearing her over the other visitors was near impossible, so I broke away and viewed the exhibits on my own.The inside and exhibits in general are well-presented, but remember this is a FREE museum, and as a result, there can be large crowds.  If you visit, I would recommend going at the beginning or end of the day."
"Written October 7, 2016",A very good museum,A very large and interesting museum in an as interesting building.  Museums are one of those things you either love or hate.  This one has variety to keep your interest up.  We also paid to go though one of the special exhibitions which are on offer on occasions.  The theme or displays vary.  Overall worth a look if in London and interested in museums. You can either spend a hour for half the day in the building.  there is also a cafe with food and drink and seating.
"Written October 6, 2016",Lots to see here,This was our 2nd visit.  You cannot see it all at one go.  We had a great lunch in the restaurant on the top floor. They were able to recommend choices for me that were gluten and dairy free.
"Written October 4, 2016",So much to see no matter how much time!,"We've long thought of the British Museum as 'THE museum', with its collection of artifacts nearly too numerous to catalog. Just to see the Rosetta Stone, pre-historic man, ancient Egypt sarcophagi and relics, an Easter Island head, the wonders of Greece and Rome - we could go on and on - is astounding. We highly recommend a visit; stay for an hour, day, or month ... you won't regret it."
"Written October 4, 2016",Must See,"The British Museum was on the top of our must see list in London, and after visiting, can say it was wonderful. One could literally spend hours here, and still not see everything, so we decided to focus on what we really wanted to see to ensure our visit was a quality one. Definitely add this to the list of must see in London! "
"Written October 4, 2016",Simply Over-Crowded; Exhibits Poorly Set Up,"I have given up on the British Museum.  It's always jammed; the special exhibits aren't arranged to facilitate good flow of people, so it's impossible to see what's on display - it's like being on the Underground at rush hour.  Really - why bother?"
"Written October 3, 2016",Enjoying the British Museum,"Spent a wonderful day in the British Museum.  Amazing collection, especially in ancient artifacts, including the Rosetta Stone  Nice places to stop for a bite to eat, and accessible and well-stocked gift shops.  We got there right when it opened on a Sunday and it got very crowded very fast.  Check on the collection and go to the areas that interest you first."
"Written September 27, 2016",Great experience,"We walked from our hotel and timed our arrival to coincide with the museum opening to beat any crowds. As soon as I entered the building I new o was in for a treat. The ""Lobby"" for lack of a better word was already stunning. The scope of artifacts on display was astounding. Egyptian exhibits was jaw dropping. It's easy to navigate and best of all, it's free. A great way to spend a little or a lot of time depending on what you want to get out of your visit. Anyone with any interest in what the museum has to offer should definitely invest some time and have a look. "
"Written September 24, 2016",A day of history,We got there as the doors opened and spent most of the day wandering around this great museum. If you like to read all information supplied. Give yourself the whole day in enjoy. 
"Written July 26, 2016",A truly impressive museum!,"The British Museum is one of my favourite museums in London! From it's impressive exterior, to the stunning Great Hall, the architecture of this museum is a suitable backdrop for the beautiful artefacts that are held inside it! While it is free to enter the museum, it is worth while looking up what special exhibitions are currently being hosted at the museum, as they are generally worth paying to see! This is a must for anyone visiting London...as well as a lovely day out for any Londoners!"
"Written July 19, 2016",So Much to See,"This museum has it all. Some of the mummies, and pieces of the Parthenon will take your breath away. We spent most of a day and could have even stayed longer. There was something noteworthy at ever turn. The upstairs restaurant had very good food as well."
"Written July 15, 2016",A must see! ,"A beautiful museum was so much to see! The audio guide was fantastic, easy to use. Would recommend getting a map and navigating through the museum that way. Egyptian rooms are a must see! "
"Written July 14, 2016","Extremely interesting, but crowded","We toured the British Museum on a weekday morning with hundreds of school children apparently on school sponsored excursions. The displays were well organized and beautifully done, with excellent notes explaining the origin and context of the objects displayed. The displays of artifacts from ancient Greece and Rome were outstanding, but the artifacts from the pre-Greek middle east (Egypt and Mesopotamia) were unique and particularly interesting. It is impossible to do justice to this extraordinary museum in one day: plan at least 2 days, but separated by a day or two of rest, and try to time your visit for when the crowds of school children are smaller."
"Written July 10, 2016",Loved it,WowWhat can I say this place is AMAZING.I really loved the fantastic selection of artifacts and information about the Babelon empire and the Assyrian empire and Persian empire.The Mummy exibition was brilliant as well.
"Written July 5, 2016",A must museum for any visitor to London!,"Established in 1753 from a bequest from the naturalist Hans Sloane, the British Museum is one of the oldest and grandest museums in the world.  An obligatory visit for the tourist in London, I first visited over 30 years ago and have returned many times to explore the magnificent collection.  Admission is free, but stop by the main desk to purchase maps and tours.Do not miss the Egyptian Galleries west of the Great Court with the Rosetta Stone and the upper floor mummy galleries.  The Parthenon Sculptures and Greek and Roman collections as well as the Suton Hoo treasures are spectacular.  The Great Court designed by the  famous architect Norman Foster is visually stunning with the world famous reading room in the upper center floor and a huge gift shop below.  The Enlightenment Galleries to the right of the main entrance are worth a walk through.Open daily from 10:00-5:30, come early as the crowds swell when the tour groups start arriving and getting near the Rosetta Stone and other must see exhibits becomes difficult.  A full day is not enough for a visit, but plan ahead for which galleries are of most interest and visit those first.  Then plan to return if you are fortunate to travel to London once again."
"Written June 22, 2016",British Museum,"The best time to visit is when it first opens.  If you can do this, you will avoid the long line just to get in!  Once there, there are optional short tours that are very informative.  There is a ""secret"" restroom that is located behind and downstairs from the information center.  Believe me ladies, that piece of information is something to remember :)"
"Written June 21, 2016",Mankind reviewed,Seeing the displays of ancient civilisations was almost a spiritual experience.  I could see that the issues facing men & women have been the same since the beginning of humanity.
"Written June 20, 2016",Fantastic ,"Fantastic Awesome! Can't believe this was free! Was amazing, we were only able to see part of the ground floor and it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The Egypt exhibition was fantastic. "
"Written June 20, 2016",wonderful museum!,"Allow plenty of time - there is so much to see! It's free, easy to get around, plenty of helpful guides, too."
"Written August 25, 2016",A history lesson for free!,One of the most wonderful things about London is that almost all the museums are free to visit! The British Museum is my favourite one! The hall is a show of its own and my favourite room is the mummies where you can really feel the energy from all the history!
"Written August 24, 2016",Food for the brain,Don't forget to visit the British Museum if you have a few hours to spare....your brain will thank you for it!! I went and saw some sketches of Sicily on the top floor and then met some friends to visit the Mediterranean civilisation rooms. All in all an excellent and inspiring visit. 
"Written August 23, 2016",The World's Best Museum?,"Certainly one of the world's great museums, and free!The exhibits and exhibitions are brilliantly curated and the wealth and range of historical and pre-historical artefacts are phenomenal. "
"Written August 10, 2016",Wonderful place you could never get bored here,"What a wonderful place to walk around and look at everything that is on view. You could happily spend many hours walking aroung and I don't think you could ever get bored. So much to see, what an experience "
"Written August 9, 2016",One of the most comprehensive museums in the world.,"The British Museum has one of the best collections of any museums in the world.  It includes objects from nearly all major civilisations.  As a result there is a lot to see and not all can be seen in a single visit.Enter via Great Russell Street or from the back from Montague Place and head towards the Great Court in the centre of the building. From here you can access galleries on four sides or head upstairs to the galleries there.  One of the best known objects in the museum is the Rosetta Stone and can be found just off the West exit from the Great Court.  Further on from this is the Duveen gallery which displays the Parthenon Sculptures.  The frieze occupies most of the space and is the best preserved of the sculptures.  Large Egyptian sculptures occupy the gallery that you enter immediately off the west side of the Great Court.  The Egyptian collection continues on the first floor north wing with artefacts from the Pre-Dynastic period up to the Coptic period.  On the first floor collection are wonderful frescos from the Tomb of Nebamun.  It also has burials and Nubian objects.The Classical section not only includes the Parthenon sculptures but elements from two of the seven wonders of the Ancient World; the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and the Temple of Artemis.  Beginning with Cycladic art, it continues through Minoan, Classical up to Roman Britain on the first floor.  The objects from Roman Britain include early Christian mosaics.  It further includes Cypriot and Etruscan objects.A highlight of the collection is the Assyrian palace reliefs.  These are extensive and display a variety of scenes.  Long corridors and rooms are dedicated to the reliefs displaying hunting, war and blessings to give a better idea of an Assyrian palace.The museum holds a small but very good selection of Aztec artefacts.  One side gallery displays a large collection of Chinese jades.Their collection of 2 million prints and drawings are displayed on a rotational basis by artist or theme, e.g. witches or Spanish drawings.  A staircase from the print gallery brings you up to the Japanese gallery.  This gallery is wood lined and subtly lit and this presents the objects perfectly.There is a café in the Great Court but this can get busy.  Alternatively, you can go to the café in the South West of the building, which is usually quieter.It is opened daily with late openings on Fridays.  Entrance is free with special exhibitions having a charge."
"Written August 5, 2016",So much to see,One can easily spend a whole day exploring this beautiful museum. If time is limited you should download recommended plans from the museum website to help you see the highlights in a relatively limited time frame.
"Written August 1, 2016",Sunken City,"One of the biggest archaeological sensation of recent years was the excavation of two Greek trading posts off the Egyptian coast. History, excavation and artifacts are  beautifully presented and this special exhibition was well worth it's money I thought."
"Written July 29, 2016",Big museum,It's huge--lots to see. Pretty cool but rather overwhelming. If you pace yourself you might be able to get through the whole thing but I might suggest picking a couple of high interest areas and just hitting those. 
"Written July 29, 2016",Huge museum with huge soul,There is a LOT to see here - you need a couple of days to finish the lot. Lots of statues and art. Be sure to visit early or late to avoid the rush. I also recommend the giftshop with great and helpful staff.
"Written July 28, 2016",A fantastic place ,British Museum is a fantastic place to explore. You will need about 4-5 hours if you'd like to see everything. There are places to sit and rest. Best of all it is free of charge. 
"Written September 30, 2015",cool,i went to the British museum very fascinated in ancient history. I got there and as soon as i walked in i was swooned into believing that i was actually in that time period. It was truly truly amazing and i definitely consider going back sometime.
"Written September 29, 2015","Amazing museum, amazing collection, Amazing price (free)","When I had some time to kill in London I went to this museum. I had heard good stories about it and its collection, and wanted to see it for myself. It is the largest museum I have ever seen, collectionwise, almost without any paintings (these are located somewhere else, I was told). There was a lot to see inside the museum and they offered free 'eye-opener tours' in which a guide took you through an exhibition hall in about 30-45 minutes. All of this without charging anything for the admission!In short: amazing museum, amazing collection, amazing price!"
"Written September 27, 2015",Awesome British Museum,A must see museum. Just awesome with an extensive gift shop and a great place for coffee just outside back entrance of museum in Montague Place.
"Written September 26, 2015",A place for many visits when in London,"The British Museum has massive and encyclopedic collections from all over the world. One should choose an area of interest and focus on that, or you will experience sensory overload. My favorite is the Southeast Asia collection, which features items from the donations of Mr. PT Brook Sewell. The statues are well preserved and chosen, and demonstrate the extensive nature of the arts influenced by the Hindu religion. There is also a top quality restaurant as well as other cafes. The restaurant features menus from countries for which the museum has an exhibit at the time. It has a fine wine selection."
"Written September 25, 2015",A magnificent museum but be aware of crowds on weekends.,Have been here during a previous visit to London on a weekday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. This time we went on a weekend. Egyptian section was completely packed with visitors and the remainder of the museum was crowded. It is a must see attraction but try to avoid weekends.
"Written September 22, 2015",Rainy day in London ,Awesome vist. You can see the world in thos museum. Fantastic free and well organized. Must see in London
"Written September 21, 2015",Great Egyptian Relics,"Many of Ancient Egyptian relics to see.  Enjoyed the Greek works and Assyrian exhibits.  I only spent a few hours at the museum, but to fully enjoy it two days are necessary."
"Written September 9, 2015",Mind and Eye Stimulation,"There was so much to see and look.  I really enjoyed all the sections especially the Egyptian, Greek and Romans.  Time was short for me so I walk and only saw what I was interesting in.  If I were to go again, I will spend maybe 1 or 2 days in this beautiful place."
"Written September 1, 2015",Good place for history and geography buffs,"You must visit the museum if you are a geography and history buff - the museum boasts of exhibits from all parts of the world. If you really want to analyse and view all the exhibits, you need to earmark an entire day for this museum. An absolute must-see is the Egyptian mummies in this museum"
"Written August 31, 2015",One of a kind and an absolute must,"I absolutely love this museum and is a must do if you are in London. It is free but a donation is asked for when you enter. There is an extra fee for the headset commentary which is well worth it. As soon as you enter, you see a great auditorium from which you enter wings of the museum. The most crowded section is on the left where the Egyptian artifacts are. Absolutely amazing and with the turmoil in Egypt, probably the safest place to view such items. The Rosetta stone is the first object you see and is surounded by everyone. The part that I thoroughly enjoy is actually on the far right side as you enter. It is in a large libary full of smaller items from over the centuries. Literally you could spend hours just in this section. There are tons of books which I could only dream of reading such all the expeditions over the centuries. I would recommend avoiding the Russell Square tube station. It is incredibly deep and the waits for the elevators can be quite long. In the past we had a harder time finding the museum as well. There is a large and wonderrful gift shop in the central atrium. Another one as you enter on the right that has many jewelry options. You can easily spend a small forture there. There is no limitation of taking picture which was nice. No ideal about selfie sticks though. So many more places are banning them. Will continue to visit here everytime we go. Enjoy."
"Written May 18, 2016",Great place to spend some time,This is one of my favorite museums to visit in London. It is very large and there is so much to see. It does have free entry so don't feel like you need to see it all in one day. Frankly it can be a fun spot to go eat lunch and relax for a bit and take in some history and culture. I would recommend the audio tour guide if you enjoy history and learning. If your not a museum person it is still worth a visit. Try looking up some scavenger hunts to do in the museum or take silly pictures next to the statues to add some fun. 
"Written May 16, 2016",Love the museum!,"The staff very helpful, and exhibits a real learning experience. Re dining: sit-down service is pricey &slow"
"Written May 15, 2016",Took Rick Steves' Walking Tour,"We visited the British Museum to take Rick Steves' walking tour.  The tour only took us through the ancient Egypt, Assyrian, and Greek rooms/artifacts.  Still, it was a terrific experience.  As a history lover, I enjoyed all of what I did see, and even learned a little more than what I had come in with."
"Written May 15, 2016",Highlights tour,The tour could have been much better... but still assigning 5 stars as the museum itself is absolutely amazing.
"Written May 12, 2016",Great museum,"This is a wonderful museum! It just so happened to rain as we were arriving, so that was an added bonus. I Highly recommend the Rick Steve's free podcast for this museum. Very informative, and goes perfectly with one of my other favorite parts of the museum, FREE. :)"
"Written May 7, 2016",Best museum ever.,"Absolutely superb. This History teacher was very impressed. Can't say enough about this place. Suffice to say it should be on every visitor's list. I will keep coming back. The 'hands on' desks where you can handle some of the artefacts were thrilling. A big shout out to the staff of volunteers that tell the stories about the pieces, they were fabulous - especially the guy in the Enlightenment Gallery and the lady with the little Roman figurine (can't remember what it was called) she was hilarious and really informative. Great value - really enjoyed chatting about the pieces with her."
"Written May 4, 2016",Too old fashioned in execution and layout,"We took our 2 sons (ages 8 & 4) as our eldest has covered a number of subjects in history class which are showcased in the British museum. Unfortunately, everything is still as I remember the museum (in terms of execution) from my childhood visit over 30 years ago. Exhibits behind glass, tiny labels to read with huge amounts of detail and a general feeling of formality. Unlike a number of museums in London which inform through interactive exhibits and displays-this museum feels completely retrospective and makes exhibits which should capture the imagination and give an amazing glimpse into the past, feel terribly dull.The building itself is quite lovely. It's free to enter but after only an hour, the kids were bored and I had to admit, so was I and we decided to leave for lunch in a restaurant we had spotted on the way in! Thankfully this was a much happier experience.It's worth noting, the mummy's in the Egyptian section scared the life out of my 4 year old and in hindsight, we should have been more selective in what he was shown as not only did the museum bore us to tears, it also left us with nightmares!Won't be back in a hurry-Natural History museum is in a different league!"
"Written April 30, 2016",Interesting ,This museum is filled with interesting and unique artifacts from around the world. I felt like I had a world history refresher course! It wasn't too crowded -  there was plenty of space for the crazy photographing tourists and those who actually wanted to enjoy the museum. I really enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone and the Parthenon artifacts. Add this to the list!
"Written April 25, 2016",world class museum,So many things to look at! I wish I have more time to spend on this amazing museum. You can easily spend a day there. 
"Written April 24, 2016",Not to be missed,"You cannot visit London and not visit the museum that displays artifacts from all aspects of human history.  There is something for everyone, although the Rothschild's collection is amazing, and of course you cannot miss the mummies.  Leave plenty of time for this museum because there is so much to see."
"Written November 5, 2015",British Museum Never Fails to Impress,"We enjoyed our return visit to the British Museum. We especially enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone. The tea service isn't too bad, either! This is a must do activity while in London."
"Written October 30, 2015",Too many people,"I can remember being fascinated with the displays here and wishing that I had days to see everything when I visited the British Museum a few decades ago.  This time it was so crowded that it was both hard to see anything and hard to get from one place to another, that we left after 20 minutes.  If you come here, I would imagine that arriving when it opens is the time to come."
"Written October 14, 2015",Magnificent Museum ,This is the grandest museum I've ever visited. We spent an entire afternoon there and still felt we didn't have enough time to see everything.The most memorable items to view for us were the Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone which were on the bucket list.Anyone contemplating a visit should allocate several hours to enjoy and absorb everything on display.I'm returning to London in the near future and this is on my must visit again.
"Written October 13, 2015",An absolute must!,"Somehow I walk to the BM everytime I visit London. So many interesting collections and treasures. Extremely interesting, can be a bit tiring as there is a lot of walking around so wear comfy shoes!"
"Written October 12, 2015",So much to see and do!,What can you say - probably the greatest museum in the world. You can spend days and days there. Be sure to not follow the crowds. The Egyptian and certain areas of the Greek section are mobbed. Find the quiet sections and be amazed at all you can see and learn. 
"Written October 7, 2015",World History Tour,"From an outstanding collection of Greek and Egyption artifacts to the World famous Rossetta stone, this is one of the best museums in the World.mif you are in or near London you MUST make this a have to visit. It will take you at least 2 hrs just to,see the highlights, but it will be time well spent."
"Written October 6, 2015",A Must See In London!,"An amazing museum with historic pieces from all over the world. Wherever you're from there's bound to be a piece or collection representing the history of your country and culture. Although quite overwhelming once you enter, It's not too difficult to find your way around the museum, being divided up into regions with plenty of maps everywhere to see where you are and where you would like to go next. It's safe to say It's one of, if not the most important museum in the world! And It's FREE!"
"Written October 5, 2015",Worth trying the ‘highlight’ tour.,"This Mother-of-all museums routinely has some 80,000 objects on display - you can't 'do' this in a single visit. So consider an investment in a 90 to 120 minute highlight tour; a highly knowledgeable guide will instruct you in the museum's history, its ethos, and the significance of around 15 key exhibits. You can still amble around on your own, either afterwards, or on a return trip."
"Written October 2, 2015",Great Museum,Undoubtedly this is one of the big museums in the world. May be even the biggest.It is not possible to see this museum in full even if you spend a whole week! So please select the sections you would like to visit. We selected the Indian section and a part of the egyptian mummies. This museum has a great collection of ancient Indian artefacts. Also on display are the relics of British Raj in India. Tipu's Sword is one of that.
"Written October 1, 2015",So much to see!,I would recommend to take a guided tour or and audio-guide for your visit. There are so many things to see and the little information signs aren't providing enough. The architecture of the building itself is beautiful and worth a visit.
"Written June 20, 2016",Fantastic museum in the world!,"I had no idea that I would see things as old as 5500BC here. I even got to see the Rosetta Stone. There's so much here to view, so plan on a good portion of your day to tour this museum. It's so worth it."
"Written June 16, 2016",Fantastic,"I tend to nip in here, when I'm visiting London.  Frequent trips, so can easily do 1 wing or an hour, without getting bored.  "
"Written June 13, 2016",Two lost cities of Eqypt was amazing,"My wife and I were in London and although we have visited the British Museum several times, we were intrigued by an advertisement featuring the discovery of remains from 2 lost Egyptian cities flooded by the Nile. We were surprised that we hadn't heard about this prior to our visit, so we went online and purchased tickets. We went  to the museum and were rewarded with an excellent display and thoroughly enjoyed the exhibit. If your in London, don't miss the opportunity to see the remnants of these ancient cities and learn about their history."
"Written June 8, 2016",Sunken Cities,Took our breath away!  This was what we went for and this is what we focused on; we did visit other rooms.   Highly recommend the extra fare to see this amazing exhibit.  The Museum is well laid out to help those choose exhibits to their liking 
"Written June 3, 2016",The best museum I have been in,"This museum is massive and *gasp* free. The place have sections dedicated to each continent at least to some degree; Ancient Egypt, Middle East and Ancient Greece and Rome sections are its largest collections.There are descriptions for everything, with as much backstory as possible.If you are tired, you can try a bit posh restaurant in the centre where we enjoyed delicious ""Cream team"" which included typical English tea with two homemade scones. I recommend to visit the museum on Friday because it is open till 20:30 and gives you a chance to see the whole place at a moderate pace.Plus, standing at the silent main hall under the glass ceiling at night is magical :).It was a highlight of my trip to London."
"Written June 2, 2016",Not great or what I had expected,"Too big, too busy, a bit impersonal and not that informative or fun. The national museum of Scotland shows how you can have a fun and informative experience. The British museum does not."
"Written May 31, 2016",Superb,Grand entrance with lots of interesting things inside.  I went here after buying an umbrella from the venerable James Smith and Sons store just around the corner.
"Written May 31, 2016",Early bird catches the....,"Basically the Brits stole from the rest of the world and have nicely displayed their artifacts for our enjoyment. I would recommend going early and heading to the Rosetta Stone immediately. This is one of the main attractions, thus the masses congregate. I bought the map for £2 and that really expedited the tour. If you are on limited time or have all day the guide will get you to what interests you. Be sure to take awkward selfies with Greek statues. "
"Written May 25, 2016",The Sun Does Not Set On The British Museum,"The museum gives an in depth look at the breadth of British discovery and power. The exhibits were phenomenal. The number of artifacts most impressive. From mummies to Japanese samurai warrior armor, this place is amazing. Only wish we had more time to explore. "
"Written May 20, 2016",History of the world under one roof!,"The British Museum is a must visit on any tour of London. It is best visited without children and with no time constraints. It houses the most amazing collections of relics from the past. It's like walking through history. Depending on how much time one has, the visit should be planned and the attractions shortlisted. the museum website provides options for a one hour or three hour visit. The section with Egyptian mummies is simply spellbinding. They also have free tours at different times of the day, so history buffs should keep that in mind. To top it all, it's one of the rare attractions with free entry! An absolute not-to-miss attraction in London."
"Written April 19, 2016",Always nice to visit,"We just love this museum. There is so much to see. Especially for our 8 year old, she would be so disappointed if we wouldn't visit the British museum when we are in London. "
"Written April 10, 2016",Very Cool Place,Visiting from America.  One of the best museums we have ever visited.  Cheers to the Brits for presenting history so well. Should be an example to the rest of the world.
"Written April 3, 2016",The real challenge isnt to own artefact but to keep them safe.,"A huge amount of antiquities of quite all civilisations, its one of the best museum of the world,(but cairo have many more egyptian stuff).The history is hard for antiquities, quite all famous wonders or library have been burned or destroyed...and today its ironic to see that the first known Library (Ninive) is also the islamic state capital of obscurantism, and it is the large amount of pillaged and gathered object during the colonialism who save these treasures for us...So if the safiest way is to remain burried, the clever way could be to take more care of our heritage."
"Written March 30, 2016","Fantastic and educational, if you have the time.","This museum is so jampacked with incredible pieces of history, that you have to allot quite some time to appreciate it. Simply popping in to view the architecture is impressive! And you can also check out the Rosetta Stone and Elgin marbles during a quick visit. To indulge more, you really need a full day.I travel to London yearly, and pick just one thing (Ancient Greece, Victorian era, or jewelry for examples) that I would like to learn about each time. While in the area check out the Hunterian Museum for a little bit of creepy-cool. "
"Written March 30, 2016",Quiet space,"We arrived tired and hungry on Easter Sunday. The crowds were unbelievable, no room to sit down (and we needed it!). Then we saw signs to a conference room/classroom down the stairs. Go down there and there's a huge empty space with comfy seats. We sat and ate our sandwiches in peace before going round the museum. Plus there are toilets down there with no queues....nobody seems to bother going down the stairs."
"Written March 29, 2016",Go- it's a great museum and it's free,"It is free but suggested donation is £5- you could give whatever you wanted, or nothing at all if you are a Scrooge. It has some very nice exhibits including the Rosetta Stone on display.  We only spent 90 min there due to time constraints but still got a great experience.  Staff were friendly. "
"Written March 28, 2016",Too much stuff,"Don't get me wrong but I do like a GOOD museum! This one's meant to be like the king of all museums. Its the one that people big up and they're like oooooo got to go to that. However during my trip last April I had a horrific experience. Firstly, the toilet queues (i desperately needed a wee) was coming up the stairs. I waited fifteen minutes and was going to burst! In my opinion, I know it sounds daft but there's just too much stuff and yes the artefacts are incredible founded thousands of years ago but there's just too much of it and you just don't appreciate it.Call me an idiot for this next part but I foolishly thought the museum just had British stuff in it but it doesn't it has stuff from all the commonwealth countries and I was really confused throughout the entire museum.The only thing that was okay was the souvenir shop! Bought three rubber ducks."

Must see for all visiting couples, families and singles.The exhibits are out of this world and the building in itself is outstanding "
"Written March 9, 2016",Best and Most In-Depth Ancient History Museum I've Vistied,"First of all, it's impossible to see everything in this place- there's over 8 million artifacts! The museum is free, but you have to pay for a map to know where you're going. MY TIP: When you enter the museum there will be a board with the rooms and color coded areas indicated. Take a picture of this with your phone and reference it in case you get lost or want to find a way out ect. We went to ancient Egypt first just because it is the best collection outside of Egypt itself. I loved the mummy collections - they were much more rich than the ones on display in Boston. The wall depicting the Assyrian lion hunt was amazing as well as the Greek Nerid temple. I also loved King George III's donated library on the first floor Look at the map and pick and choose what interests you most. Its probably the best way for you to start executing your time there."
"Written March 8, 2016",Amazing architecture!,"I visited the British Museum with my 10 year old son and I have to say that both of us were so impressed with the museums architecture that we almost forgot to see the art!

"Written February 25, 2016",Amazing Museum!!!!,"We went to the British Museum on Tuesday February 9, 2016 and had a great day! What an impressive museum! They had the largest collection of Egyptian Artifacts I had ever seen and they had some of the largest pieces I have ever seen. Unbelievable!This is a big museum with 6 floors (or more?) I believe and we could have spent several days visiting the place. There is just a lot to see. We spent approximately 4 hours and wish we would have some more time. We saw the Egyptian exhibit, the Romans and Greeks, ancient Europe and saw the Rosetta Stone.  You definitely need to get oriented before going there as it is easy to feel overwhelmed. It is not easy to navigate this Museum.Be prepared for lots of people! This museum is free and during the week I suspect lots of school children go to the museum.  This is a great museum worth taking some time to see. We will try to return if we find ourselves in London again."
"Written February 15, 2016",Couldn't afford to miss in London,"Look, you'd wish you could have a whole day here, the moment you enter but, this is a luxury to most of the tourists.  What I do is, go to the website and download a 3-hour exhibits' guide and chase them one by one!  The official website wouldn't cheat and they are authoritative - all those 25 pcs should be the best of the best that you couldn't afford to miss in your whole life, especially when you don't know when you will be back next time.  Go treasure the treasures, of human beings and history.  You deserve them!"
"Written February 9, 2016",a place to spend some quality time!,I must to visit in London! lots to see and learn! If you have time I will recoment to visit every single room. I personally love the room with the old fashion clocks & waches
"Written February 5, 2016","too many to see, too little time","Our trip to London was prepared primarily by my daughters who unlike their parents are making their first trip there. They kindly included the British Museum as my reward for bringing them on this holiday, but of course reserved more days for their sightseeing and shopping. We alighted the double decker and the first thing to greet us was the museum guards garbed in Indian costume. We made our way inside, and beheld the grand edifice that's the British Museum. It houses many levels of artifacts and historical relics from different eras, and we decided to start at the very top level where ancient Egypt was displayed. And what a treat it turned out to be. Mummies and sacrificial objects kept entombed for centuries ensured the gallery kept its sombre ambience. We stared at mummies found killed, complete with the probable weapon they were dispatched with.Empy sockets stared dully out of skulls, sending faint-hearted visitors hastily to the other side where maps of early civilisations removed the chills. My family was intrigued by the stories on the plaques of how civilisations rose and fell due to climes and wars. The time spent on this level alone took up all of three hours, and when lunch beckoned, we only tucked in chocolate wafers and coffee at the mobile cafe outside while taking in the facade of the white stucco and collonades that made the British Museum one of the most visited in the world. Alas, time did not permit more gawking and we bade farewell with a promise to return and spend more time exploring history"
"Written December 11, 2015",Don't miss the Rosetta Stone and the Egyptian mummies,"The museum is a good stop when touring London.  My personal favorite was seeing many of the Greek items taken from the ruins in Greece, as well as Cleopatra's mummy."
"Written December 8, 2015",Make sure you plan your visit otherwise you'll get lost,"We went with friends and on entry we split up to explore the bits we wanted to see joining up later. There really is so much to see we spent a lot of ime with the Elgin Marbles and the Greece exibitions & dabbled in a few other areas ending up with a scone and coffee in the meeting area.Would recommend you go on line to plan what you want to see, we found the staff there very good and helpful, really enjoyed our visit."
"Written December 7, 2015",Cultural Tourism ,"The British Museum now has a collection of nearly 8 million pieces, which together tell the story of the cultural achievements of mankind since the beginning of history, there are more than 2 million years until the present day.Sala 40O jogo de xadrez mais famoso do mundo, símbolo importante da civilização europeia.The nearest tube Station is Holborn."
"Written November 30, 2015","You cannot miss this experience, and you will return","The British Museum helps you to understand the world, with exhibitions and a standing collection that rival anything in the world."
"Written November 23, 2015",Awesome for history nerds and laypeople alike,"If you're at all interested in ancient history, this is the place to experience it. I saw mummies, Greek hoplite helmets, Sumerian wall carvings, and a host of other amazing artifacts. Not to mention, of course, the Rosetta stone, one of the most important artifacts every recovered. Plus, it's free.Also, just wanted to say the food here (and at the Imperial War Museum) was AMAZING. I had an egg salad+sundried tomato sandwich, which was fantastic."
"Written November 22, 2015",Amazing place - be sure to take a free tour!,"I hadn't been to the British Museum in almost 40 years, but my return visit did not disappoint!  It is a wonderful way to while away several hours, with plenty of interesting things to entertain anyone and everyone in the family.  The explanations for each of the exhibits are well-written and informative, but the free guided tours on specific rooms/topics (I took the China one) are exceptional - make sure you take at least one! Regardless of what you think about the controversy over the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, they are very well laid out and fascinating to view and read about (they have a brochure addressing that subject as well).  Don't know how they manage to still make it free to visit, but it would be worth a visit no matter what they charged...."
"Written November 19, 2015",World class and very accessible,"This is a wonderful destination whether you are a culture/history nerd or not, there are so many different collections and exhibitions. I highly recommend the booklet with a variety of self-guided tours on various themes, there are also numerous guided tours (free) every day. I spent almost a whole day but still only scraped the surface. Shops and cafés were excellent as well. "
"Written November 16, 2015",One of the best,"There are no words adequate to describe the BM.  It deserves not just 1 visit but several if you have the time and if you are a Londoner, multiple visits year after year - and you'll still find something new to look at in every gallery , + the fantastic special exhibitions mounted several times a year. Try and see 2-3 rooms  with a particular theme or focus at one time or you'll overdose on too many  objects. The cafes and restaurant serve reasonable food and drink so there are places for you to sit and rest in between your visit. Also, the gift shops are great."
"Written November 15, 2015",Just round the corner,"I walked here from the hotel and spent the day with a friend.  There is enough to see for numerous visits and just not enough time in a day to see it all.  The Celtic Exhibition was outstanding, as well as a brief visit to the Parthenon sculptures to seem them again after several years."
"Written November 11, 2015",Favorite museum anywhere,"This is the one destination I make sure I go to no matter how many times I visit London. I never get tired of the most popular exchibits: Rosetta Stone, Egyptian mummies, Pantheon sculptures. But I also find something new every time I visit. The last time I ventured into the clock room right before noon, and was in the room when all the clocks struck noon. It was amazing - dozens of clocks from different eras ringing twelve times. It is a free museum, that asks for a donation when you visit."
"Written January 25, 2016","Excellent, first class museum.","This museum provides a climpse of civilization through the ages.  I was very impressed with the varied collection of Greek and Roman artifacts.  Depending on you interests you could spend days visiting.  I've been three times already and will be back for more the next time I visit London.  Plus, it's FREE!  This isn't a smelly old museum - it's lively and updated with modern museum with something for everyone."
"Written January 22, 2016",One of the World's Best,"Widely regarded as one of the world's best museums among the likes of the Louvre in Paris and Uffizi in Florence, the British Museum pays homage to the vast kingdom this country once held. Relics such as the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles (sculptures from the Parthenon) are housed here along with thousands of other artifacts acquired across the British Empire. Admission is free, like most museums in London. To get here, the nearest metro (tube) station is Tottenham Court Road on the black or red line. If you plan on using public transportation more than twice per day, buy an Oyster Card (not a Visitor Oyster Card) for Zones 1-2, which caps daily at 6.40 pounds for unlimited public transit use. The 5 pound deposit to buy the card is refundable if you go to a counter at any tube station before returning home (otherwise you'll have to request a refund by mail)"
"Written January 18, 2016",Such a treasure,"We only had a couple of hours to visit. I checked out the website before we went and it had suggestions on what to see if you were short on time. So, we went in with a plan and saw most of the recommendations. Admission was free, but all the guide books and pamphlets cost a few pounds. There were large maps posted throughout. This museum contains mainly artifacts; if you're looking for art, go to the national gallery. If I'm ever back in London, I will surely come back to explore further!"
"Written January 18, 2016",Museums are FREE!,We stayed in Russell square and the British museum is literally a 5 minute walk. The museum is quite large and they have a lot of nice exhibits. My favorite was the Japanese exhibit along with the Egyptian. I was able to take my time and walk through most exhibits within three hours. Plenty of restrooms and little cafes inside as well 
"Written January 2, 2016",Amazing,"The museum is large, has amazing things, it's family friendly and free! I was particularly impressed by the daughter of Cleopatra!"
"Written January 1, 2016",See awesome historical artifacts for just a donation,"This museum is massive, and can easily take up your whole day if you want to see everything slowly. I spent about 3 hours here to visit the highlights and really enjoyed seeing the Egyptian (mummies), Roman (roman empire), and the Japanese (samurai) exhibitions.It's hard to imagine having so much history in one single building. Although technically free, I would highly recommend donating money to help with the upkeep of the museum."
"Written December 28, 2015",Well rounded Museum.  Something for everyone,"There were lots of kids when we were there and they were all engaged.  The museum has something for everyone with good insights into Culture, art and industry."
"Written December 27, 2015",World Class Museum,"What a thrill, I've wanted to see it for years! Great exhibits! The only drawback was the crowds and boy were they rude! Mostly Asian..."
"Written December 27, 2015",absolutely brilliant!,"i spent many hours here spread out through my week in London and didn't even begin to see all the things i wanted to see, but i am happy about it because that means i get to return and continue my exploring. around every corner there is something amazing and astonishing. cannot say enough about how much fun i had here and i cannot wait to return. the Celts exhibit was a particular favorite, as was the Ancient Greek and Rome gallery. also the Clocks and Watches and Europe 1900 to the present. beautiful, intriguing, moving, thought-provoking. very nice gift shop, too."
"Written December 15, 2015",Beware the cloakrooms,"This was a terrific museum which merits several return visits.  It is free, apart from the special exhibitions and the audio guide.  But be aware - this museum charges 1.50 per item left in the cloakroom (bag and coat and umbrella for example classified as 3 items...) and they also have a weight limit on backpacks.  This was a strange one. Didn't find this anywhere else in London."
"Written August 31, 2015",THE museum to visit in London,"In a city full of great museums, which one to visit?  Definitely the British Museum.  Park your reservations about how the British acquired artifacts in the 18/19th century at the door and enjoy the exhibits.  The artifacts from the ancient empires are amazing, and there are free 30/45min guided tours in different sections of the museum throughout the day - just ask the info desk.  The Assyrian lions, the Egyptian reliefs, Greek marbles, Aztec jade masks, Rosetta stone, even an Ivory (Lewis) chess set ...just to name a few of amazing things to see.  You can spend a whole week in here!Like most London museums, it is Free entry.  It has 2 entrances - on Great Russell St and Montague Place.  A host of buses will drop you close to the Museum, or any of the tubes (Tottenham court rd, Holborn, Goodge St or Russell Square)Wear comfortable shoes as you are likely to be on your feet for alot longer than planned given all the amazing exhibits.  When you are tired and warn out - head to Russell square for some good cafes & food as it is expensive & average food in and around the museum."
"Written August 29, 2015",History buffs paradise,"All of the museums in London are spectacular. In fact, I would be very hard-pressed to pick a favorite one, but this might be it. The stone antiquities are stunning, but there is so much more to see here. Plan at least half a day, longer if you can. You will not be disappointed."
"Written August 28, 2015",Great Museum,The British really knew how to steal fabulous stuff from around the world and then preserve it in this museum.
"Written August 25, 2015",Beautiful but crowded,"The museum in itself is beautiful and very interesting. The problem we had with it was that it (of course) is so hugely popular and also there is no entrance fee (only a request for donations), that it is difficult to calmly enjoy it."
"Written August 25, 2015","I could spend all day in here, and still not see everything it has to offer","We utilized the Tube and the bus system from Greenwich to get to the British Museum.  We got turned around a bit on the streets, but eventually located the building.  As an American, we are used to having to pay for culture, so when I got to walk through those doors without having to stand in line to pay it was almost freeing but at the same time I thought I was going to be arrested for failure to pay.  I did download a guide from the Musuems website to assist if you only have 1 hour or 3 hours to spend in the Museum.  We spent our time locating the Egyptian exhibits, seeing the Rosetta Stone, the money exhibit, and the African exhibit.  We saw an Easter Island face - which was pretty cool."
"Written August 23, 2015",Can't top it,"One of the greatest museums in the world.  I went here twice on my recent visit. My only regret is how crowded it is, but of course others have discovered it as well.  The Egyptian collection and great statues of Ramesses II and Amenhotep III; the Parthenon sculptures; the Islamic rugs and objects; the finds from British B.C.; all this and more are wonderful.  Just can't recommend it more highly, except perhaps try to find a time when it's not as crowded!"
"Written August 19, 2015",Mesmerised by the collection,"To begin, I am not able to comprehend why this place is a 4.5 star and not 5 star. Its like history of the whole wide world placed together for your viewing all at once. This museum cannot be appreciated in 1 day, let alone 2-3 hours which your tour guide will give you. So avoid guided tours which will hustle you and make you run around.Its tiring so do wear comfortable sneakers. Must take is the audio guide."
"Written August 16, 2015",Endless galleries with intriguing artefacts,"This is a must-see in London. So many cool artefacts from all over the world, especially those that were stolen/forcibly taken from other countries during Britain's colonial regime. The museum restaurant was really nice as well, although very pricey."
"Written August 11, 2015",Expect to be there all day!,"This museum offers a broad collection of our history. You will see collections from all around the World. The architecture of the museum is to die for and the exhibits are well organized and clearly explained. If you're a lover of history I definitely recommend you leave a full day to visit the museum. Close by you will find restaurants, souvenir shops and many more stores for your convenience."
"Written August 9, 2015",Do your homework! ,"We had a wonderful day at the British Museum. We did our homework using the BM website and chose what we wanted to see in advance.  This worked so well because it's easy to be overwhelmed by the colossal amount to see and experience. The museum staff were very helpful with our teens. The Sutton Hoo, Rosetta Stone and the sheer beauty of the place was outstanding. The quality of the displays and lighting needs to be appreciated as you stroll about the enormous displays in this beautiful building. Wear comfortable shoes though.  The food is pretty good too!  "
"Written July 12, 2015",I lost track of time....Excellent day,Where to start. Something for everyone.This museum has SO much and covers every segment of history.  Free admission and open to the public this is an Awesome way to spend an afternoon or two.  Recommended for the whole family.  Kids will love it..and find it intresting as they explore this massive facility.
"Written July 10, 2015","First trip to London,  with children","Very, very interesting and it all was for free!Not a bad target, even with children, you easily have a great day here!"
"Written July 10, 2015",If You Want to Become Supersaturated in History  --This is the Place.,"Opened to the public in 1759 this building is dedicated to Human History, Art and Culture, and to prove it they have 8 million exhibits!The front of the building is lovely classical Greek and the interior is really beautiful, and of course the Great Hall is --- Great!For years I have believed that the Greek Elgin Marbles, the Egyptian Rosetta Stone and mummies should have been returned to whence they came, with a big thank you to England.  But once again now these 2 ancient countries are proving to the world that they are really not worthy of governing their own people well and to properly safe guard these treasures.The 2 exhibits that took my eye were the 1536 Hans Holbein the Younger's portrait of Anne Boleyn and  the 1900 -1600 BC bronze age Mould Gold Cape from North Wales.Brian, from Perth.

"Written July 9, 2015","BIG, but beautiful!","This is a beautiful museum that is well worth the visit! There's so much to see, you really need to schedule enough time to visit it! We were there for more than 2 hours and did not see everything! Also on Friday the museum is opened until 9pm, however some of the most interesting parts are closed at 5.30pm!"
"Written June 30, 2015",One of the Best Museums in the World,"I visited the British Museum on a recent trip to London.  The Museum is very large and it is not always easy to navigate, but the amount and importance of artifacts is extremely impressive.  The Museum is well-labeled and maps are easily accessible, but it is massive.  The Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone are some of the highlights, but there are so many important and interesting items this is a museum one should not miss.  Even for people who are not museum fans it is worth a visit, but I would not attempt to see the entire thing.  Another great feature is that the museum is free of charge.  I would recommend a visit to the British Museum."
"Written June 30, 2015",A must stop - don't miss the Rosetta Stone,"You will enjoy everything from Egyptian, Greek & Roman, South East Asian (Hindu) and other amazing artifacts. Of course, you must see the Rosetta Stone - however, be warned that it is so popular you will likely only have a few moments to snap a good picture - it's very crowded around this iconic piece! The Egyptian wing contains everything imaginable; coffins, mummies, hieroglyphics imbedded in stone and preserved papyrus. The South East Asian area contains beautifully preserved carvings of Hindu gods and goddesses dating back to (at min.) the 6th century. Just breathtaking! I must visit for anyone and certainly entertaining for children as well...and it's FREE!"
"Written June 27, 2015",Greek Marbles should not be here,"Great Museum, amazing artifacts from all over the world. I protest though about the Greek Marbles which were torn and stolen from their rightful place which is the Athens Akropolis. They should be returned to the Akropolis Museum in Athens. "
"Written June 27, 2015",Beautiful!,"I am not the museum type of girl, but the British Musuem was very impressive. I love the old Egyptian part with mummies and of course the Stone of Rosetta. I would definitly recommend to have lunch at the restaurant! Good food, a bit expensive but you are having lunch at the British Museum.. so it's worth it."
"Written June 26, 2015",Best Free Museum in London,"This was my third trip to the British Museum, but my husband's first.  I took him straight to the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon.  I also wanted him to see one of the original Caryatid statues from the Acropolis and the Rosetta Stone.  My husband's parents were Greek, and he really enjoyed seeing so much history during our short visit.  I was determined not to burn him out on museums on the first day of our trip.  We also took a quick stop to marvel at a statue from Easter Island and a short walk around the inside atrium.  The museum can be quite overwhelming, so this strategy worked well for us."
"Written June 26, 2015",So THATS where that is!!!,Many of the worlds treasures are here. You have to hand it to the British. If they wanted it they took it. I have been to Greece and southern Turkey and seen many a historic location that was without artifacts. That's why I go to the British museum - to put the rest of the picture together. A great place to wander and check out everyones schwack. Still Free on Sunday. The Rosetta stone exhibit is better than it was the first time I visited almost 20 years ago.
"Written August 6, 2015",Overwhelming!,This could well be the best museum in the world! it is huge! And popular. I suggest you go with plans to see something in particular or you may get burned out before you see what interests you. My son was eager to see this museum and he loved it. Open late on Fridays so you can tack this on in the evening if you can't get there before closing on other days.
"Written August 5, 2015",the museum to visit in London,"First, is free for all visitors :), you can see here a lots of things, from human history to art, culture, is also very big, so you will need several hours if want to see all.We went direct to see the famous Rosetta stone, and also we see a lots of Egyptian statues, and some beautifl sculptures and paints.Will visit again, for a longer time, if we travel to London."
"Written August 3, 2015",Everything I hoped it would be,"I am a huge fan of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City, so I had high hopes that this would be as awesome.  And it did not disappoint.  I probably could have spent hours here, but of course there were so many other things to see and do in London.  Even if you only have an hour or two, do yourself a favor and drop in to see some of the wonders housed in this amazing museum."
"Written July 28, 2015",Great place to visit but go early ,"Got there at 9:45am and queue was probably 500m long already. Took about 30min to get in, but once in it was tremendous. Suggest you got straight to Dinosaur exhibit as the queue for this get longer as day goes on. The volcano & earthquake section was worth it too. Ordinarily I would shy away from lunch at somewhere like this, expecting bad food but it was really good quality and reasonably priced too.  "
"Written July 28, 2015",Best museum ever,"This is the best museum I've ever seen, better than those in Paris and NYC. And for free !!! So you can get a glimpse every day all along your visit. The collections of ancient civilisations are just astonishing. And not only the Egyptian's mummys. Assyrians, old muslim art. Presentation is somptuous. A must go & see !!!!"
"Written July 20, 2015",Inarguably the best museum collection.,"One of the best museum collections globally. Has exhibitions to satisfy the taste of every visitor. Egyptian, Greek and Mid-East collections are the best. They regularly organise special exhibitions in collaboration with other leading museums, the ones I visited include Vikings, Colombian Gold and Mummies. The great court is huge and is an attraction in itself. Early morning and evenings are the best times to visit as tourist numbers are small.  Having visited this place over 30 times I would recommend an average trip duration of 2-3 hours. The collection is huge so don't wander about the place because you cannot finish the whole of it in one go, pick up a free map provided and aim to see the highlighted artifacts or a section that interests you."
"Written July 19, 2015",Loved it ,"We all loved it, kids enjoyed it, spent a couple of hours there... We loved the Ancient Egypt Section where they saw the mummies, it was crowded though, we didn't have time to look closely at everything. There is also a cafe inside, and a gift and souvenir shop, which was mostly lovely and good stuff except for some of the items that were cheaply made, especially the Indian bracelets and the Indian sparkly pens which our daughter chose, they broke the same day, we couldn't return them as we were traveling the next day. Outside the museum the kids enjoyed chasing pigeons. "
"Written July 14, 2015",Gives a good scope of the British Empire,Extensive collections of all kinds of things from all kinds of places.Makes you realize that England held sway over much of the globe.
"Written July 14, 2015",Best museum ever,It's free so perfect on a budgetEngland has ownd most of the world in her glory days so what is better den to show some of the world's history ;-) 
"Written July 14, 2015",Fun (and *mostly* FREE!) for the WHOLE Family,"This is one of the best museums in the entire world.  It's free.  It's manageable.  It has exhibits that will interest the whole family.  It's in a great area and is easily accessible by public transit.  It is also within walking distance of great restaurants.  There isn't much in the way of great food at this museum, but they do sell refreshments. Additionally, it's important to know that while the museum is free, not all of the exhibits are included.  The featured exhibit (found in the center of the rotunda at the main entrance of the museum does have a fee and requires a reservation.  Popular exhibits will sell out quickly, so either plan ahead, or talk to your hotel concierge (sometimes they purchase a block of tickets and sell them to hotel guests at a premium.... consider this option only if you are absolutely desperate to see the exhibit).  But it is by no means necessary to buy entry into the featured exhibit... there is plenty to see with out it.  None of the major artifacts require tickets (the Rosetta stone, the mummies, etc.), so don't feel bad if you can't or don't want to get tickets.  Plan to spend at least 2-3 hours in the museum in order to hit all the highlights, but you really could spend all day there."
"Written April 9, 2015",A great way to spend the afternoon,"About the content: The more you know about western or eastern civilizations, the more you will see how rare and valuable these historical artifacts are. Having a plan or knowing what you really want to see is impotent: I missed the room on the Parthenon and most of the Egyptians but I got to spend more time looking at art form and artistic skills that would be worth while to contemplate and appreciate. (Worth a visit: Chinese ceramics, chinese jades, Japanese art, Korean art and room on the history of money)After your visit, consider going across the street and visit their starbucks right opposite the museum. Somehow I don't see a lot of tourists there. Maybe they already are in the museum or gone into their coach buses. Great place to relax after."
"Written March 27, 2015",Pure Heaven,"There are not enough words to describe how much I enjoyed this museum. From the multiple giftshops to the Rosetta Stone all the way to the prosthetic toe of a mummy.Unfortunately we visiting during some kind of school holiday because there were hundreds of little children on a school trip and that made it hard to view some exhibits. Though that's no fault of the museums.My only suggestions are wear comfortable shoes, bring a snack (food is expensive there) and check out more than giftshop, they don't all carry the same things."
"Written March 22, 2015",WOW!!,"I had always heard that this was one of the best museums in the world and I was not disappointed. The Greek friezes were astounding and brought the Parthenon to life since I had visited Athens 5 years ago and their new museum was not open yet. I will not get into the debate over the Greek items, but it was impressive the care that was taken to showcase these works of art. I was also blown away with the Egyptian and Assyrian exhibits especially in the context of the time period involved. I warn you though that you need several days to see it all, it is vey hard to go through all the rooms at once. Too overwhelming."
"Written March 21, 2015",Great Buddhist section,"Architecturally it is wonderful, the way they have modernized it with the glass roof is really beautiful.  I would recommend the Buddhist section (if you are interested int uses things).  Beware that the Amaravati panels seem to be open from 10am to 11am and possibly also sometimes in the afternoon."
"Written March 20, 2015",wonderful,"Each time I go to London, I visit the British Museum. It's amazing. A single day is not enough.

"Written March 3, 2015",What a treat,"We had see the Rosetta stone!  We did not budget a lot of time for this museum, we had just come from Museum Island in Berlin and there is only so much one can retain in a single trip....so we made time to see a few key items and perhaps have a cup of coffee.  We stayed longer than we planned and wound-up having a hot sandwich whilst there.  We were very impressed with the lay-out of this museum and it seemed very easy to navigate from one room to the next.  It wasn't like many museums, where you are committed to a whole floor because you've started the ""loop""....each time we entered one room, we came back out into the vestibule...so it was just easy to go to the next exhibit or not to....whatever suits you.  We had a relaxing few hours whilst waiting for the rain to stop outside :-)....  Saw many treasures we hadn't planned on seeing...just because they were easy to get to....the chrystal skull...the easter island statue....and of course, the rosetta stone.    If you have only one hour, you won't be disappointed...if you spend all day, you'll know you still have lots to see...  prices were very reasonable for food and the selection was more than I expected for museum fare..."
"Written February 28, 2015",Simply amazing collections,"Wow - they have things you just wouldn't believe. The amount of Egyptian coffins and covers is unbelievable. The ancient glass is impressive. The clock exhibit was great and the money exhibit was really interesting. My friend and I only made it through the top floor and part of the first floor in an afternoon (all free, permanent exhibits). Look ahead to know what you want to see, because it's easy to get distracted in this place!"

"Written October 14, 2014","The space, the art, the ambience","It is all here, art from several ancient cultures -- Egyptian, Iranian, Roman, Etruscan, etc displayed beautifully with clearly written explanatory posters all over the place.  Of particular note was the full-room display on the history of money, and of course, the Rosetta Stone, stones from the Parthenon, and their other ""greatest hits.""  Exhibits are well labeled (though only in English), rooms are numbered clearly so that you can trace your route on the map through the huge space, guards and other staff are omnipresent and eager to answer questions.  We didn't try the restaurant but the cafe in the grand indoor courtyard was spacious and offered the usual lunch and snack options.  Free tours are scheduled regularly throughout the day.  We spend 4 hours there and felt that this was enough for one visit."
"Written September 25, 2014",The greatest museum in the world,"What a fantastic museum.  The displays are brilliant.  The Egyptian displays are the most popular - especially the mummies.  However, every single room is a wonder in itself.  The building is brilliant.  The staff are both helpful and knowledgeable.  Going back in November to see the ""Ming"" exhibition (have already bought my tickets to see it).  Far too much to see in one lifetime."
"Written August 28, 2014",World class museum - take it in chunks,"DON'T TRY TO DO THIS ALL AT ONCE - it can be so easy to try to 'do' a whole museum in a day, to see everything and not retain anything. But since the museum is free you can just bop in whenever you want for an hour or so and see what you're really interested in. Personally I like the Enlightenent room and the medieval rooms the best, so I spend most of my time there. But don't do what I used to do and see everything just to say you did - you won't enjoy yourself."
"Written August 19, 2014",Mummies,The British Museum:  You must check out the mummy exhibit from Egypt.  It is outstanding!  You've got to see the mummies.  Perfect rainy day activity.
"Written August 6, 2014","Crowded, warm, overwhelming number of items on display. Needs at least a day.","There were 3 floors in the British Museum, but the top floor with the displays from Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia appealed to me the most even though I had mainly come to see the Elgin marbles on the first floor. The Ancient Egypt galleries were quite confined with 2 main pathways to look at display cases along the walls and in the center of the room. I found this floor the most crowded and very warm, but also the most rewarding in terms of being fascinated with the displays of numerous mummies and coffins. The information about the Egyptians' belief in life after death was excellent. The Ancient Egypt display was continued on the first floor with columns and sculptures of pharaohs. The Assyrian/Mesopotamia Civilization display also took up my visiting time on the third floor with its variety of displays showing the location, warfare, and way of life. On the next floor down, I thought that the displays of early Britain were not as well done as those in the London Museum. Perhaps by this time I was sensory overloaded having looked at too may displays of jewelry and rusted spearheads. All of the items in the display cases were identified, and information about the time period appeared on the walls. It certainly was educational and, indeed, the school group of well-behaved young children I followed in one room (I was there in June) seemed to be enjoying their ""Treasure Hunt"" by filling out a worksheet after looking at objects in display cases. I saved some energy for looking at the Parthenon friezes on the first floor. They were not in perfect condition with heads broken off, missing arms and legs, or corners of blocks missing. Yet I still enjoyed the artistry. What I learned from the information boards surrounding the frieze was that this frieze tells a story of bringing an offering to the Temple, but the ceremony breaks out into a brawl when the soldiers instead try to abduct the Greek women in the crowd. Although the museum was busy, the crowds really didn't affect my ability to see the information in the display cases. We ate lunch on the main floor ""court yard"". We liked the cafeteria style service with a good selection of lunch foods as it was a very quick way to grab some food. A big bowl of soup and a thick chunk of bread was 5GBP and large scones studded with raisins were 2.50 GBP, but salads, hot dishes and desserts were also available. We printed out a map of the floor layouts to be familiar with what could be seen on each floor and used that to help us navigate the displays. I am glad we allowed ourselves all day for this visit as there was so much to see and take it. We came away quite exhausted and not really wanting to see another museum or gallery that day."
"Written August 5, 2014",An enlightened walk through history,"The entrance to the museum is remarkable. Vast is an understatement! We arrived on a Friday afternoon with a mission to see the exhibits from Athens, Greece, specifically the Elgin Marbles and the Parthenon Sculptures. We were not disappointed!  We also saw the Rosetta Stone which words can't describe, and just looking at it is downright mind boggling. Dedicate plenty of time and take it all in.  We only had a couple of days in London and would loved to have planned more time to explore everything this museum has to offer. Everything was highly informative and interesting. We also visited the gallery with clocks and watches and how they work. It was fascinating to see! Take advantage of the later closing time on Friday evenings. We visited the museum for a few hours on a Friday afternoon and then left to have an early dinner nearby to relax.  Then we returned and stayed until the museum closed at 8:30. Also, the crowds seemed to thin a bit later in the day. This museum has something for everyone, even if you don't consider yourself to be the museum type. Go and be amazed at what there is here to see."
"Written July 23, 2014",The reason to forgive the British looting of its former colonies,"I've always enjoyed my visits to the British Museum ever since my first-ever London visit of March 1996. And my latest visit, for June and July 2014, only strengthened my positive impressions! I have made four visits to the museum and I still am far from done.- Location -The British Museum is located on Great Russell Street, within easy walk of several Tube stations: Holborn, Russell Square, Goodge Street, and Tottenham Court Road.- Admissions -As is usual for most of the excellent national museums in London and the UK, it's free, though a £4 (or equivalent amounts in Euro, US dollars, or another currency) donation is suggested. Another £1 if I want a map of the museum.- Highlights -Many of the British Museum's exhibits are the result of British colonial occupation of the Near East and other parts of the world. In particular, the Egyptian and Assyrian collections are the most extensive in the world outside the countries of origin.The Egyptian collections consist of many old statues and fragments, spanning the many different dynasties and eras that made up 3,000 years of Ancient Egypt. Although the Rosetta Stone, which is written in hieroglyphics, a more modern Egyptian script, and Greek (and allowed the deciphering of hieroglyphics), is the most popular exhibit in the Egyptian section (and always mobbed by crowds), my favorite instead would have to be a bronze statue of a seated cat, portraying Goddess Bastet, not too far away from the Rosetta Stone. The upstairs exhibition halls have even more Egyptian artifacts, including many mummies of humans, cats, and other living things.The Assyrian collections are not as extensive as the Egyptian ones, but still awesome, with the iconic winged Pegasus-like guardians from city gates built into the modern museum structure.The Greek collection is also excellent. The highlights include the Nereid Monument, built in the 380s BC in today's southwestern Turkey, as well as the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon.Elsewhere in the museum, the Chinese and Southeast Asian artifacts are also very well covered, in a long exhibit hall toward the back (bordered by an awesome courtyard beyond it), with special emphasis on Buddhism, Hinduism, and other spiritualities of the regions involved; longtime British presence in India, parts of Southeast Asia, and Hong Kong, helped with the breadth and depth of the collections. Further upstairs, more Asian art awaits in the form of Japanese and Korean exhibits, sponsored by major corporations of the respective countries.Of course, there are artifacts covering the closer parts of the world, like Europe and the British Isles themselves. The standout of the British exhibits is the Lindow Man, who had lived around the time of Jesus, and who had been killed (possibly in a ritual) and thrown into a peat bog. He was discovered in 1984 and has been preserved ever since in his mummified state.Although there are some excellent exhibits dedicated to the Americas, Africa, and the Muslim world, I was not able to spend time with those exhibits this particular time around.- The Great Court -Perhaps the biggest change to the British Museum since my first 1996 visit would be the Great Court, formerly an open courtyard that was enclosed in 2000 under diffused glass ceiling. This area hosts some seating/relaxation areas, cafes, souvenir shops, and more.On a hot summer day, however, it more or less becomes a very muggy greenhouse.- Afterthoughts -Just hitting the ""star exhibits"" such as the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles can easily eat up a few hours at this excellent museum. And to appreciate the breadth and depth of the collection, by lingering in each cultural section long enough to understand the context of the exhibits and the history of the region concerned, can easily take multiple visits. Given the free admissions and easy accessibility, it is a good idea to visit the British Museum several times over multiple visits to London, if possible.Also I was less than thrilled with loud-mouthed Chinese tour groups (a fact of life at any major tourist destination in the world these days), in the Chinese (!) section. Honestly I don't get the point of spending a fortune to travel all the way from China to England, only to see more Chinese art, when there are better examples of Chinese art and culture back home, but that's me. Even without the tour groups (Chinese or otherwise), it does get crowded at all times of the day, so plan accordingly.In any case this museum is truly one of a kind, and a must-see on any London itinerary. I will surely be back again soon."
"Written July 12, 2014",Disgusting toilets,I'm usually one to not post negative unless really bad. This may sound petty but it ruined our visit. I have only seen and smelt worse on trains in India. There really is no excuse for poorly attended facilities in a first world country and a tourist destination such as London. 
"Written June 25, 2014","Ancient Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek and Italian galleries in 3 hours","We recently visited the British Museum, choosing to concentrate our efforts on the Ancient Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek and Italian galleries only.  By focusing on targeted areas within the museum we were able to enjoy a comprehensive visit, while conserving our energy by not moving around from one end of the museum to the other to see certain museum highlights. Starting with the Ancient Egyptians Gallery rooms as the museum opened at 10am, we were able to see the Rosetta Stone (196 BC), Colossal bust of Ramesses II (1250 BC) and other ancient Egyptian treasures before moving onward to the Assyrian rooms, highlighted by the incredibly detailed Lion Hunt Panels (645 – 635 BC). Onward into the Greek rooms, where you can see the the Parthenon and Elgin's Marbles (447–438 BC).  A nice collection of ancient Roman sculptures, potteries, wares and very nice mosaics (1450 BC – AD 500) were enjoyed along with a visit to the upstairs room 61-63 where you can see the Tomb-chapel of Nebamun (1400 – 1300 BC) and the collection of Egyptian mummies and sarcophagi (circa 2686 BC – AD 395) are found.  By this time, we had spent just over 3 hours in the museum and were ready to be on our way for lunch.  In the end, we found that concentrating our efforts on a smaller section of the museum had many advantages.  We were able to visit some of the very best of the British Museum and spend plenty of time, comprehensively looking over most of the collection in these galleries and rooms.   We also didn't feel as tired, not having to walk extensively around the museum in purpose of specific highlight scattered throughout. Regardless of how you decide to visit the museum, we highly recommend spending a bit of time getting to know about the museum prior to your visit.  This will greatly enhance your experience when you are there.  To help in this regard, you can have a look at our previous review which provides 'Tips on How to Visit' the British Museum."

"Written May 26, 2015",Essential to visit but some questions raised.,"I brought a tour group of US college students to visit the British Museum on a study abroad on the History of the African Diaspora. Of course, the museum provided an unprecedented opportunity to view artifacts from the Egyptian, Assyrian, Hellenic, African, and Asian worlds, including most notably the Benin Bronzes, the Parthenon frieze and sculptures, and the Rosetta Stone. However, my students raised questions fundamental to the museum in terms of the relationship of British colonialism to the collection as well as the continued rights of the museum to possess and display these artifacts. In turn, the students raised questions about the relationship between the Africa gallery to the other galleries. First, Egypt was disconnected from Africa implying that Egypt is not part if an ""African"" cultural and historical lineage. Africa was also consigned to a separate basement floor while Egypt was positioned in the center of the ground floor with a seemingly logical progression to the Assyrian and Hellenic galleries, suggesting an influence and interconnection in world historical development. In contrast, Africa was presented rather statically and ahistorically without close attention to regional and temporal transformations or global contributions."
"Written May 24, 2015",British museum sleepover ,"The British museum run sleepovers for their ""young friends"" members throughout the year. We have just arrived back from the ""indigenous Australia"" sleepover which is themed around the temp exhibition of the same name. Tbh I wasn't quick enough to jump on the tickets for the ""night at the museum"" themed sleepovers but I don't regret it at all. In fact it was a better option as we always head for the Egyptian galleries when we visit, whereas this time we took away and experience of something we weren't so familiar with. Have previously slept over at another well known museum in London and found that the British museum sleepover far exceeds the experience we had previously, mainly due to the organisation, which is seamless. You arrive for 6 and can walk straight in with your booking form- you then queue outside the Assyrian galleries which will be your sleeping area. At checkin you are assigned a colour group and shown to your groups designated area to set up. At 7 pm you head off for a talk and then into your first two activities. You leave your snack food in a bag labelled with your group name at the end of your beds and this is laid out in colour groups on the eating benches for snack time at 9pm where they give you coffee to keep us adults going before the final two activities. Ends at 23.30 and lights out at midnight. What I especially liked was the fact the activities are held in galleries we wouldn't normally go in- and you have a nice walk through others on your way to the activities. In the morning you get breakfast, to go round the exhibition and they open the shop at 8am to get any souvenirs. Can't praise the staff highly enough for their friendly approachable manner and always being available for questions. The exhibition really came to life for the children after the activities the night before.Highly recommend you do this- very special. "

"Written May 10, 2015",Spectacular,Unbelievable collection of artifacts from all over the world.  Lots of great history and exploration all under one roof.  Was there for only 3 hours and could have spent days in there as the collections are that extensive.  A must if you travel to London.  
"Written May 10, 2015",The perfect museum,"I love the British Museum. It has amazingly wonderful and diverse exhibits so you can see ancient Egyptian ruins the same day as Italian Renaissance Paintings. The museum is free which makes it possible to return multiple times which I personally think is the best way to the museum as it is so large. We visited for a few hours and then returned a couple days later to see most of the rest of the museum; had we done it all on one day we, well, we couldn't have seen nearly as much. Even after 6 or 7 hours we did not see even close to everything."
"Written May 6, 2015",Please STOP TOUCHING the art & artifacts!,This is a wonderful museum with a very interesting permanent collection (and temporary exhibitions as well). But there is one big problem with it - there are A LOT of people touching the ancient artifacts. I even saw a woman put her small child on top of a 3000 year old statue so that she could take a picture - THIS IS NOT DISNEYLAND! The British Museum should hire more staff to keep an eye on things.
"Written May 3, 2015",Step Through Time,"A trip to London is not complete unless we visit the British Museum!  We are especially drawn to the Rosetta Stone, the Elgin Marbles and the Egyptian artifacts. We make it a point to visit a new section of the museum every time we are there."

"Written April 22, 2015",Sensory overload,"SO. MUCH.There is just so much to see here. Before we went, people had told me that we'd need to spend at least a full day here. I'd also had people tell me that we'd need to spend *more* than a full day here. Having been, now, I can completely agree with both statements.The best advice I can give someone visiting the British Museum the first time is to plan ahead. There is no possible way you can give the displays your full attention in one day. It's impossible. There's too much to see, read and absorb, and eventually, your mind (and body) will just shut down.So, plan ahead. Check out the map of the museum, and see what exhibits are on when you'll be there. Choose one or two (or three, if you've got the time and the stamina) areas that you want to focus on, and stick with that. Otherwise, you'll end up like me.What happened to me, you might ask? Well, I became overwhelmed. I shut down completely - mind numb, body rebelling. It was just too much to process. It was only after my husband agreed to stick with the areas that he was most interested in that I felt some life come back to my limbs.Even following the ""Top 10 Things to See"" guide within their book (which you can buy at the front) can be overwhelming, because you'll see all the other displays that you're breezing by, trying to get to #4. It's immense. I mean - you've got main halls, side halls, smaller halls off the side halls, and each one of these has big displays down the middle, then smaller displays on the sides. And *every single display* has a card with really detailed information listed on it. Great for those who love history and want to learn, but still incredibly overpowering.If you plan ahead, though - and if you've got the time to break it up a bit - you should be fine. Just don't be like me, thinking you can blaze a trail through the museum in four hours or less. It will promptly and gleefully cut you down to size."
"Written April 17, 2015",Excellent!,So much to see here.  You need more than a day.  Excellent museum. All museums are free in London! They have free tours during the day that are very interesting and educational.
"Written April 12, 2015",Great museum shadowed by very rude staff,"As a Londoner and passionate about history, I often visit the British Museum. However, I feel in recent years that the staff is incredibly aggressive without reason and very rude, not to mention disorganised, to the point I'd thought I'd share a recent incident. I attended the free Bonaparte and the British exhibition last friday for their late opening event. Many people, including a kid that was running around taking snaps WITH FLASH of each sketch, item, were taking pictures or selfies. I was contemplating a drawing and thought, well ,why not take a snap on my phone without flash. The security lady yelled at me from the other side of the room, in a very aggressive manner, telling me off. Fair enough, it's her job, but I asked her why then picking on me and not on others when there are about a dozen people doing it in front of me, leaning on the glass panes with sticky fingers and so on ( may I mention that I am rather unconventional with black clothes, flashy hair colour and tattoos so you get the nice discrimination picture ). In the same very aggressive tone and litterally yelling, she said well we try to stop people, it's for copyright purposes. I had to tell her 'I understand' to make her stop her rant. It was completely uncalled for in a public museum and unappropriate. I left the exhibition straight away. Later, they had a free special event, a reading of medieval texts and poems, in the Sutton Hoo Gallery. I thought it would make it for a better evening. I was wrong. Same rude staff, trying to dictate people where to sit. After the first act of texts reading, they literally forced half of the audience to go for a wander in another gallery to listen to medieval music, while advised : 'come back later but keep to your seats'.There were no chairs in the gallery with medieval music, so the audience stood. I was finding it difficult to watch, standing in a corner, since many tourists/ japanese unaware of late events were pushing to make their way out. I got rudely pushed by one of them with their big backpacks (note :security doesnt seem to invite much of the cloackroom use for others comfort these days...). Suddently, one of the organisers or staff in charge of the event walked to me and asked me if I could move from where I stood ! As if I was unwelcome and not part of the audience. Once again, picking up on me, when he should have told the tourists not to push rudely people watching the event or rudely taking pictures with flash of the musicians as if they were in a zoo. I answered 'sure whatever, and left. When we went back to the other gallery for the promised swap in a completely disorganised chaos, our seats were taken. I left the museum, promising myself I will surely never go back to their so-called events. Go to Museum of London, at least they know what they're doing and treat people the way they should. What a disgrace."
"Written April 9, 2015",Some of the beset artifacts are in the British Museum,Took my 16 year old son there recently - I highly recommend signing up for the Around the world in 90 minutes tour.  This museum is so large it's really helpful to have a tour guide who takes you to and adds commentary about some of the major pieces the Museum houses.   Afterwards you can return to the areas that piqued your interest.  Tour is 12GBP and well worth it.
"Written April 5, 2014",Do NOT visit the Viking exhibition,"We had a 1.30 p.m. booking on April 4th. It was an unmitigated disaster. How the British Museum can possibly think that it is wise, or safe, or value to allow so many people into this exhibition at one time is beyond comprehension. If there was a panic or an emergency of some sort, the consequences could be dire. It was so crowded that you could not get anywhere near many of the exhibits and the poor visitors were obliged to shuffle slowly along like some sort of chain gang. The content of what is shown is good but for us the whole event was ruined by overcrowding.A much better idea would be to see the exhibition via a live transmission at a participating movie theatre.A disgraceful and shameful performance from the British Museum. Avoid it."
"Written April 1, 2014","I do love this place, but...","... It is almost always impossible to see the things you want to see.I have just spent a month in London, going to the museum several times a week. And while it is wonderful in almost every respect, it is also totally over-crowded and some of the galleries are only open a few hours a week - at very odd times, too.Despite being there for a month, I never got to see that one gallery I wanted to see - there was always some problem, but not a lot of information given by staff - and even the galleries that I could enter were often so shock-full of large groups of tourists and school children that it was impossible to see the objects. The noise was deafening, too. I had purchased tickets to the Viking exhibition and was thoroughly disappointed when I ended up queuing for more than an hour inside the actual exhibition. It was so over-stuffed with people that no one really got to see anything. It was extremely unpleasant to be in a confined space with so many people - and they even allowed people to bring buggies and push chairs in. There were piles of them, making it impossible to go anywhere. Couldn't even have stopped and turned around if I wanted to.Spent more than two hours in the Viking exhibition and saw almost nothing - couldn't give even a short resumé of what types of objects are on display. It just wasn't worth it."
"Written March 29, 2014",Viking exhibition,"Checking in at 12.38 for 12.40, I was told to wait as the 12.30 people were still going through. (Incidentally, surprised that check-in was done manually against printed lists rather than electronically). Once inside we immediately hit a log-jam of visitors all trying to read the very small exhibit notes as they shuffled through. No accompanying leaflet was provided to help with this. The exhibits I managed to see were stunning but the crowd was overwhelming and I gave up - which made the £16 ticket price expensive compared with, say, a Tate special exhibition.  A real shame."
"Written March 28, 2014",Vikings Exhibition,"Despite it being in a new and bigger exhibition space than the old reading room, this exhibition was very cramped a lot more than it used to be when it was in a smaller space.. It seemed like they tried to squeeze in too many people in at one time. The artifacts on display were amazing but with the volume of people in there you couldnt really have a lot of time to look at a lot of them. Once you got through the first section of the exhibition and into the bigger hall with the ship then it was fine as there were a lot more space. A lot of the problems were caused by having large parties of young children who were obviously on school trips in at the same time as the general public. Now I'm not against children going to museums but this exhibition was not really meant for young children and a lot of them were obviously bored and causing problems by running around and blocking the flow of people going around. Maybe they could organise special days for children to come when there could be a lot more hands on/interactive activities for them. There were sections where you could touch materials like amber, fox fur, sail cloth etc but only two of them I could see. Maybe you could also make the screens by the boat more interactive as the children who were there were very bored"
"Written March 24, 2014",Vikings Life & Legend = Visit experience DISAPPOINTING,"The items on display are amazing (this is the only good part of this review).  The over crowding would be a problem if you are claustrophobic. There is distinct lack of seating, just to sit and admire what you have seen or be able to wait for the crowd to disperse would have been useful. A minimum age limit should have been introduced, following a 3 year old round who had the attention span of a gnat was not fun. Why are the female facilities always recognisable by a queue.  Wake up BM, instead of another exhibition room, how about sponsorship of your facilities, you may find that visitors are more willing  to make a donation and visit other areas."
"Written March 24, 2014",The Viking Exhibition,"We were booked for 12:30 and entered to find the place jam-packed . People once in, could stay as long as they liked and they did, so some were standing 4 deep around the exhibition cases. I am just 5ft. therefore, not only did I have no chance of reading the descriptions, but also could not get near to view the artefacts. After 15 minutes we just gave up and left. Having travelled from Wales, especially to see this, we were extremely disappointed. I compare this with  the Tut' Exhibition which was really a wonderful experince-far bigger and FAR,FAR better organised"
"Written March 24, 2014",a bit of a let-down,"My wife and I visited the British Museum to see the Viking Exhibition which has been much hyped in the press. Admission, booked online, cost us £35.00 but it really wasn't worth it. Although we booked for a specific time, it seemed that everyone was being admitted and the exhibition area was grossly overcrowded. There wasn't really all that much to see, just a few artifacts and the remains of a viking ship (reconstucted in metal). The whole visit was very disappointing."
"Written March 23, 2014",Viking Exhibition - opportunity missed and too many visitors,As a fan and member of the BM I look forward to the exhibitions no matter the subject. In the case of the Viking Exhibition I felt let down as I did not come away with any lasting impression of the importance of the vikings. The start was far too overcrowded with long waits to see each case. The boat was very impressive even though so little of the wood remains but it could have been better. Just think of the impression if just a section had replicated the original with seating and sides to full height with shields displayed. Would a mast and sail been too much to ask in that large hall?  If I had paid £16.50 for a ticket and £4 for the essential audio guide I would feel robbed. I hurts to write these comments as the BM usually does an excellent job.
"Written March 22, 2014",Rugby Scrum,"I visited Friday 21/03/2014, Thank goodness I belong to the Art Fund as that at least lessened the disappointment by reducing the entry fee. There is no organisation the room supervisors just stood like manikins  or flow much means there are just bottle necks of people. Also kids will gain nothing and parents will have bored and very vocal little people. The objects themselves (that I was able to see) were interesting but without the audio guide (for which I paid a further £4) the information around the cases were uninspiring. If you wish to see these objects go to the cinema screenings, which I now plan to do."
"Written March 21, 2014",Great exhibition--bad experience viewing,"I agree completely with the other reviewers who panned tihs exhibition for being too crowded. After paying 16 GBP you expect to be able to see the exhibition in a relaxed and leisurely fashion. Forget it. The first part of the exhibition was so crowded despite timing entrance groups every half hour, that my wife and I couldn't get near several of the cases. The contents are really impressive but what good is an exhibit that you can't see or have to push your way to a case to see or jump out of the way every time a stroller (which should not be allowed) or wheelchair pushes toward the case? Once you get into the final large room with the impressive skeleton of a Viking ship, it's much better (although the hordes and packs of schoolchildren, more interested in talking to their friends and running through the hall than seeing the exhibition did not help. I know museums need to make money but packing in crowds like this to milk every last cent out of an exhibition is a very bad mistake and penny wise, pound foolish--I will hesitate to ever buy tickets to another exhibition here in the future. I'm sure others will do the same."
"Written February 22, 2015",Unexpectedly Awesome,"I went in a 10 am and figured I'd stay for 2-3 hours. I ended up staying the entire day because there was so much to explore. They display the history of civilizations in every corner of the world, and the more prominent ones such as Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome has 5+ rooms alone."
"Written February 9, 2015",Can't beat a free museum,"I went to the museum on Friday evening and spent a few hours wandering around. I was shocked that they don't mind you take pictures in the museum, I got to photograph a lot of my visit. I walked to the museum from my hotel so I could enjoy the sights on the way to the museum."
"Written February 9, 2015","I loved it, lots of interesting history.","I could spend all day wondering around looking at the ancient artifacts. The rosetta stone is one of the main attractions - to see in real life is amazing!! Not much British collection, but more British Empire collection ;)"
"Written February 4, 2015",Must visit in London.,"The British museum is without doubt the best museum I have ever visited. It is packed with interesting pices. The entrence is free so there is really no reason not to visit. I think you can easely spend a day or even more in the gigantic building if you want to see everything. I myself spent about 3 hours walking around and saw some amazing pices.My highest recomendations of must see pices inside is: the roseeta stone, remains of the mausuleum of Hallikarnasos, the whole egypt section with mummies and for a swede as myself I found the vikibg area very special. "
"Written January 28, 2015",Free of charge. Full of emotions.,"If you want to examine all exibitions, wou will need whole day. I had only 2-3 hours. By the way i'll come back again. All history through centuries is here. "
"Written January 27, 2015",One of My favourite museums in the world!,"I am a regular visit to this museum and have been coming here for at least three decades. There is such a variety of artifacts to see, including some of the most famous artifacts in the world. There is always something new to see. I find it good to focus on one area each time I visit. The Egyptian sections are incredible and my favourite. Of course, it is debatable how much should actually be there, rather than I the country it was found, but I'm not here to review that. A fantastic museum as it stands! "
"Written January 10, 2015",Stil cannot believe no entrance fees,"Having visited a couple of museums round the world, it is still unthinkable that this museum is free. One may conclude that it's because there's nothing to see but you will be surprised that the collection is awesome. One should not miss the Roman exhibits, especially The Parthenon ruins collection which apparently is just as spectacular as the exhibits back in Rome."
"Written January 2, 2015",Fantastic exhibit ruined by overcrowding and poor organization,"I have seen many Viking museums and exhibits and this was had the potential to be one of the best, except for the fact that I couldn't see any of it. Although this was timed admittance it was way over sold so the crowding was terrible. There were far too many people trying to read tiny writing located at the bottom of each case. This would have been so much better  if the print was larger and there had been some direction given to those who were tying to view the exhibit. Also too many backpacks taking up space. There was also one woman with a huge backpack leaning over the exhibits while chowing down on her smelly and messy sandwich !  Really !  Isn't that why they were checking my small purse ?save your money. Don't bother with this exhibit"
"Written June 12, 2014",Viking Exhibition,"Just to clarify. My comments are for the Viking exhibition only.  Please avoid, it's not worth the time, money and effort. Where do I start? First of all it's nearly impossible to get the overpriced ticket. The exhibition is not being held in the usual space in the central part of the building, so you have to go round the whole area through the crowds before you figure out where to go. Once you are in you see people's backs which is normal for a blockbuster exhibition.   However, the worst thing is the exhibition itself.  There is very little to see.  I was done in 30 minutes.  Do yourself a favour and book a holiday to Scandinavia for the real thing."
"Written May 27, 2014",Too crowded,"Visited the Viking exhibition today after booking a slot online several weeks ago and coming to London especially to see it.   We were very disappointed as there were so many people we could not see the displays very well.  When we entered the exhibition it was so crowded we were left confused as to where to start or where to go.  We felt oppressed by the greyness, the lack of direction and the number of people.   When a space in front of a display did become available we found others sometimes pushed in front of us.  We also felt the displays we did see were a little bland. Based on our experience and the cost (over £40.00 for three) I would definitely NOT recommend this as a day out."
"Written May 23, 2014",Viking Exhibition,"What a huge disappointment this exhibition was. So crowded, poorly labelled, lack of content. There was no flow, the cases were surrounded by people listening to their audio guides oblivious to everyone else. It was almost impossible to read the case labels. The artefacts were not individually labelled. The timed entry was meaningless. Do not waste your money. "
"Written May 15, 2014",Viking Exhibition,"If you are thinking of going do a little research first and it will be much more enlightening - see if you can find the Culture Show's documentary by Andrew Graham-Dixon, which is a fab programme on it's own!  The exhibition is in the new exhibition centre, more spacious than the old Reading Room but still, in my opinion, badly laid out.  Instead of flat on display cases they should try angled ones so more people can see the items.  Although it is a ticketed exhibition there were too many people and those listening to the audio guide were particularly annoying, standing in front of a display for up to 5 minutes...take a step back people and let others see!  Putting all this to one side, the exhibition itself is wonderful.  There are some amazing things to see and you learn so much about the people of the northern countries (it isn't really correct to call them all ""Vikings""!!)Go if you can and enjoy and learn - the British Museum at its best."
"Written April 22, 2014",Disappointing Viking exhibition,"As other reviewers have said,the Viking exhibition was extremely crowded and was basically one slow exhausting shuffle from start to finish. Information was difficult to read in a small font, exacerbated by the darkness. and people crowding close to the exhibits.The long ship was worth seeing, otherwise this wasn't a patch on Pompeii last year"
"Written April 15, 2014",Vikings brought to life - if you can see the artifacts!,"It is the reputation of the Museum that is attracting so many people to this special exhibition but the reputation is not justified in terms of the old fashioned presentation of the artifacts on show. Yes, there is high tech equipment available that provides information, at a cost unlike Stonehenge, and the viking boat in the last gallery is impressive, by size alone, but more could have been done to have more modern show cases.A lot of the artifacts are held in old fashioned, horizontal, show cases and not at eye or above eye level. This results in the inability to see the stuff unless you are up close, and when you do that no one behind can see. I must have read only a third of the information panels on show because of this poor presentation.There is much to learn about the vikings here but the crowds allowed in, despite the timed tickets, make it very difficult - especially for children.It was good, but not that good."
"Written April 8, 2014",The Vikings: Life and Legend,"We visited this new exhibition twice: one at our prebooked time of 6.40 on Fri evening and again on Sunday, using the re-entry ticket which we were given at the information desk when we complained after we were unceremoniously hustled out without warning at 8.30, our visit unfinished because of the appalling crush at the beginning. The lack of engagement of the staff made us suspect this was a fairly common occurrence, a tacit admission that the organisation and presentation of this exhibition is dire. We have attended several of the BM's large cultural exhibitions in recent years, often choosing the evenings to allow us to travel to London before an overnight or weekend stay, adding greatly to the cost of the tickets, but until now all have been worth it. The First Emperor exhibition was crowded even late at night but was a truly stunning and memorable experience, leading us to visit Xian a couple of years later to see the Terracotta Army in its original setting.By contrast, the Vikings exhibition, displaying artefacts found in our home area that we have never seen before eg the Vale of York horde, managed to obfuscate and cloud understanding at every turn of the unnecessarily cramped early displays. Any local history group knows explainer panels need to be at eye level in legible type, that artefacts need to be listed by name and a linking number or letter for ease of identification. Why was the Viking woman buried with a large bone sword as well as a plaque? The exhibition is silent. The hip-level small-type panels select one or two unnamed items to describe - but only give date, materials and home museum- making it almost impossible to understand what is being described and the context. We wondered whether the stress engendered by our first visit might have coloured our view of the whole. Our second visit was marginally less crowded, and we knew what we had  missed, but confirmed our view (also expressed by others throughout) that this exhibition is a huge missed opportunity. From the oversold 'timed' slots, the lack of an exhibition guide (a print out of the Viking timeline on the final wall would have been a start) and the rudeness of the staff who suddenly announced the exhibition was closed without warning ( the shop of course remained open!) this exhibition feels cynical and even perfunctory. The Vikings and Norsemen (difference never explained, Normans hardly mentioned) are part of my NE England heritage, place names and family names but this didn't illuminate them for me at all. The Jorvik Museum in York may be less cerebral but does a better job of showing what everyday Viking life was like, and is a lot cheaper!"
"Written April 7, 2014",Great but seriously oversold the Viking exhibition in more ways than one,"Clearly this is a world-class museum with great permanent exhibitions.  However, the previous comments about the Viking exhibtion are spot on.  Way too many tickets sold for too small a space (and at £15 a ticket it doesn't feel like they had to ram so many people in to make what is a relatively small exhibtion pay).  Then the items are crammed too close and the lighting on them is just awful; I suspect this is to make them less worthy of close attention and so relieve some of the terrible queueing.  You just become a moronic gawper shuffling past each exhibit without giving it any attention.  There is, no doubt, huge quality to the items presented but you might as well throw anything behind the glass when a group of coins can neither be seen nor looked at in any detail.  I could also quibble at the content - lots of artefacts but a strangely cold, bookish feel to the exhibition.  While they set out to debunk some myths, this entirely intellectual approach hardly seems a fitting way to get an insight into adventurous raiding and trading Northerners.The review score, perhaps a little unfairly, is for is specifically for the Viking Exhibition but having gone out of my way to attend - it would leave me less likely to attend a BM exhibiton of this type again."
"Written April 6, 2014",Badly curated Vikings,"Apart from the beautiful artefacts themselves (which alone raise this review to 2 stars from none) everything about the Viking exhibition was badly done. The timed tickets bought in advance were oversold for the space available. The artefacts were displayed too close together for the crowds to look at comfortably for long enough, as others compete for the same square centimetre of glass. The text cards are tiny & mounted below the artefacts so cannot be read in advance by those queuing at each case; mounting duplicates above the cases on a sight line visitors can see over the heads of those close to the case would solve this problem. High level duplicate cards above the cases, like surtitles at a theatre, would enable queuing visitors to read about artefacts before viewing them. This also reduces the blocking caused to those using audio guides who are kept waiting with nothing to see or hear.The lighting in the cases was poor, restricting the possibility of seeing the full glory of the textures of worked metal surfaces. Squatting low to catch the light would be unnecessary with better dynamic lighting. Quite a few visitors resorted to bending & squatting, which just adds to the crowding problems.Sadly TripAdvisor do not list exhibitions separately from their host institutions as the reviews of this show have been the most mixed and the British Museum usually do things competently. A big stainless-steel longship outline does not redeem The Vikings exhibition from being displayed like a minor specialist show at a modest provincial museum with a tiny budget. "
"Written April 6, 2014",Just Go - Tips For Your Visit,"Hard to add much of additional value that hasn't already been said in the reviews below.  So here are some very quick tips 'when you go' (not IF).- its free so go early, plan on being there at opening or as soon after as you can, avoid the afternoon if possible- research what you want to see and plan your visit accordingly- see the important things as early in your visit as practical- see the Rosetta Stone amongst the many other things, you'll regret it after if you don't- get a guide book, audio guide or real person guide to get the most out of your visit- kids love the mummies- plan to be there for 3-4 hours, take your time and learn something, don't just tick the box- and stay relaxed and enjoy the experience"
"Written December 16, 2014",Rosetta Stone,"My mission was to see the Rosetta Stone.  I took the time afterward to take a short tour of the museum's Greek and Assyrian areas (tight schedule).  My verdict....MAGNIFICENT !!.  The British Museum provides a most unique collection of cultural artifacts from around the world all in one place.  A must for the tourist, the historian, the researcher and the just plain citizen of the world.  AND IT'S MOSTLY FREE !!"
"Written November 26, 2014",Impressive!,"Astonishing collections from Ancient Egypt, many other exhibition halls. It is a trully tresure of the world's civilisation !"
"Written March 21, 2014",Viking Exhibition,"We visited the exhibition on Monday 17th March.at 2pm. I was so disappointed. I had looked forward to seeing all the treasures. As already described despite booking in advance you queued then were herded into the first room. It was so crowded we were told to miss the first room and come back later! thus missing presumably the introduction presentations.... The crowds lasted until the last room when it was possible to breath and take in the vast ship. I hope the exhibition can be improved for future visitorsThe next day we visited One million years of the Human Story at the Natural history museum,you came away feeling you had learnt a lot in a pleasant environment where modern display techniques had been used to near perfection."
"Written March 20, 2014",Too crowded by far.,The exhibition was interesting and the Viking ship was marvellous but the visit was spoilt by the crowds. It was difficult to get near the show cases and the signs were so low down that they were virtually impossible to read. Such a pity.
"Written March 19, 2014",Omnishambles,"It is too tiresome to detail the problems with this exhibition suffice to say it was frustrating, infuriating and disappointing. We visited on Saturday 17th March and I would echo what other reviewers who have given a ""terrible"" review have said. Our experience was made worse by the intransigence of customer service on the day who were unsymapthetic and didn't even offer a refund. After looking at Trip Advisor later I saw that many people did get a refund so I emailed the Museum later and have had a no-questions asked refund. Like many other people, we had also travelled a very long way and had stayed overnight in a hotel. The museum even has the cheek to charge you a booking fee to print off your own tickets using your own ink and paper ! We shall not be visiting a special  exhibition here again."
"Written March 18, 2014",A great exhibition marred by poor layout,"The British Museum is really skilled at creating well researched and curated exhibitions - however more thought on the layout, explanatory texts and planning on 'throughput' would have made the Vikings exhibition much more enjoyable and worth the rather high entrance fee to view - for example , at the start of the'tour' there was considerable 'bunching' of visitors as people attempted to read the poorly placed interpretative texts whilst blocking the view of the incredible items on display. Duplicate descriptions both above and below the exhibits would have helped considerably.Considering the scholarship and research that went into the curation of this really interesting exhibition it was let down by the presentation . British Museum,  please take note of the similar comments posted about this exhibition.... you only let yourselves down if you take no notice and repeat the experience in the future"
"Written March 18, 2014",Vikings,"This exhibition is a shambles. The Museum are overselling tickets so that it is impossible to see the exhibits other than to glance at them while being pushed and shoved by other people. The exhibits are labelled in such a way that it is impossible to read unless you are right up against them, some cases can be viewed from two sides but are only labelled on one. There is no queue management so only those with the sharpest elbows get to see all the exhibits.  The curator should be ashamed of this effort because I suspect the content is wonderful but it is such a mess that it was a dismal experience. Definitely not worth the £16,50 entrance fee."
"Written March 17, 2014",VIKING RAID,"There were some amazing objects to see at this exhibition if you had the perseverance to wait to get a space near the cabinets and spend most of your time invading other people's personal space or them invading yours.  Many of the objects were small coins etc. How could so many people enjoy them at once?MAIN PROBLEM:    Far too crowded....if you let too many in at once this is bound to happen.  The assistant at the door advised us to ""go past the first couple of rooms and then come back""....luckily we didn't do this as it would have been impossible to return to the first room against the flow of humanity pouring in.DISPLAY ISSUES:   Why were the information panels so low down on the cabinets forcing viewers to get up to close and blocking the view for those behind?    Did the designer of the exhibition expect small numbers ??  The info panels should have been higher or perhaps repeated on the side of the cabinets.  Many of the exhibits could have been more at eye level.Why so few photo panels extending the information available.Has the designer/curator tried to see the exhibition since he set it up....maybe he could learn a few things about displaying small objects and the relevant information.   For one thing why weren't the objects numbered so that the relevant pieces if information were easily found?SORRY BM. YOU HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS TO GET US TO COME BACK TO ANY OF YOUR EXHIBITIONS.....WHAT A SHAME .  A NATIONAL TREASURE RUINED BY BAD DESIGN"
"Written March 17, 2014",VIKINGS SO DISAPPOINTING,"This exhibition could have been made for me and my daughter. This was a birthday surprise for her and much anticipated. I had booked my time slot and received an email to remind me not to miss it etc. This made me think that visitors would be staggered - if they were it made no difference. Over-crowded - constant bottle necks of people listening to headphones. Bare minimum info on the exhibits - a heap of cash in a cabinet could have been worth tuppence halfpenny for all I know. Staff bossy and not user friendly. Presentation seemed dated in style. Cannot tell you how disappointing this was, and I really like the British Museum. Definitely did not live up to all the hype. Go by all means but keep your expectations low."
"Written March 16, 2014",Viking exhibition scrum,"This is the third recent exhibition we have been to at the British Museum but it could be the last. The first problem was the shear number of people being admitted at one time. This was compounded by the people standing in front of the exhibits listening to the audio guides. This continued for the first half of the visit, the crowds thinned out towards the end. By that time my wife had given up and had gone to find a seat. The exhibits themselves did not compare with the terracotta warriors or Pompeii.  It seemed that the museums greed in maximising visitor numbers spoilt what should have been an interesting visit and turned it into a scrum."
"Written March 16, 2014",Vikings,Deep down this exhibition was shallow. BM visitors can handle more information than was provided. The most challenging aspect was coping with the large number of visitors the museum tried to squeeze through the doors. I expected better.
"Written March 15, 2014",Vikings at the BM,"The British Museum is a wonderful treasure and exhibitions from Tutankhamun to Pompeii stay positively in my mind. But the Vikings, which promised so much was spoiled, as all previous reviewers here have said, by overcrowding. Where small and intricately beautiful pieces of jewellery deserve close examination it was either practically impossible to see or one was jammed by the slowly shuffling crowd in the gap between exhibits. The entrance was planned so badly that there seemed to be two diverging routes but no way to view the alternative path. The remains of the boat are also disappointing, with far more new metal skeleton than genuine timber.I agree with previous reviewers that the BM has tried to maximise its income by allowing too many people in to the timed session and in so doing has spoiled the experience for us all. A great shame, so I shall be watching the television programme about the show tonight with interest to see what I have surely missed.I think I will then start planning a return trip to The Viking Ship Museum at Bygdøy, Oslo (entrance fee £3 !)"

"Written March 6, 2023",Fantastic antiquities sections and great shopping as well.,"There are so many wonderful pieces of art and artefacts, especially if you are a fan of earlier cultures. The Egyptian section by itself makes the museum worth visiting."
"Written February 2, 2023",Turning back the hands of time ... 2 million years back,"There are 8 million works in the Museum systems collection; it represents the history of human culture, or at least its objects and antiquities.  The exterior is beautiful Greek Revival architecture and the interior Reading Room is a huge food court with a rotunda of glass in the ceiling.  The museum occupies 990,000 square feet.  There are 7 levels to the museum.Seven categories of geographical locations divide the areas of exhibits: Africa, Americas, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and Rome, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.  Additionally, there is a category called ""Themes"" which is further divided into 7 topics.  The Museum is open at 10 a.m. and stays open until 5 p.m. (later on Fridays).  It is free, get there plenty early as it really gets crowded quickly.Less than 1% of its artifacts are on display (about 50,000 items).It was said that the British Empire was so vast that the sun never set on it, as the sun would always be shining somewhere in it.  One can imagine that the British were everywhere and in no small part were involved in the aspect of collecting.Some personal favorites were the depiction of the double-headed eagle which represented the Holy Roman Empire (not from the Russian Romanoff's as I would have imagined), a soldier pulling the wing off Cupid (it is a political anti-Medici statement), the dying Lioness (so painful to see her riddled with arrows while she drags her body), the face of the fisherman (how much uglier could he possibly get?), the Battle of Adua (Ethiopian queen is holding a huge revolver!) and the beauty of Ganymede (object of Zeus' affections).But there was so much more.  Can't wait to get the chance to come back.  Could spend a week here!  It was so helpful to have little write-ups next to the displays so we could appreciate the item in context."

"Written March 15, 2014",Vikings Awful,"The worst of a series of increasingly expensive  (£17.50), crowded and sparse exhibitions.  The Vikings has been hyped beyond it's value.   Every 10 minutes another 25 people were admitted to the gallery,  where we stood for another 20 minutes before trying to see a 2inch brooch, along with another dozen people.  Most of the exhibits were coins.  Just try to examine 20  10P coins with elbows gouging into your ribs, school parties scrabbling around with their note sheets. and the temperature/humidity reaching tropical levels.    We will not be attending any more BM exhibitions until these problems have been solved."
"Written March 15, 2014",Allow at least 2 hours for the Vikings,"Our tickets were for the last slot on 14 March (7pm) and the entrance area to the exhibition was extremely crowded at that time.  We chose to be patient and let the crowd clear and then worked our way around the exhibition which was very good.  Unfortunately, this tactic meant that we were unable to finish the exhibition before we were uncermoniously thrown out at 8:30.  I think that the BM should allow 2 hours from last entry, especially given the overcrowding issues which make progress slow.  The person who took responsibility for removing the last reluctant visitors from the exhibition was unnecessarily rude which reflects badly on the BM."
"Written March 14, 2014",Viking Exhibition - Great if you're not in a hurry.,"Brilliant exhibition, but overcrowded. 20 minute slots would have made it better. No it's not a cheap exhibition, but the exhibits are priceless, and the quality of the displays and security would not come cheap. The descriptions against each exhibit were small and some were difficult to read (especially if you had several people between you and the exhibit). They could have been bigger and higher. One reviewer was disappointed that the ship was just a few planks of wood : to please 'non-archaeologically-minded people it would have been good to have a scale model (maybe a fifth or sixth of real size). Despite the crowds, I was in no hurry, waited for the people to move on, and took around 3 hours to see everything. The price for 3 hours entertainment is not so expensive."
"Written March 14, 2014",Viking Exhibition a Frustrating Experience,"To walk into an exhibition - to which you've travelled a long way (in our case from Dorset), and paid to see, and looked forward to seeing - and find that you can hardly get in the room for the crowds, is extremely disappointing and anger-inducing.  It seemed that the British Museum were being far too greedy.  To then find that you can hardly see the exhibits because you are craning your neck or simply completely blocked from viewing them, and that you cannot read the information about them because someone is leaning over to shadow them or simply blocking them completely, is even more frustrating.  Even when we did get to read the info, the descriptions of what was on show were very basic and simplified, so one didn't find out much about them anyway.  It was like the BBC dumbing it down.  And as for the writings on the walls - some of these were barely legible in the shadows because they were in dark script, and when they were readable their sources weren't listed.  One verse looked to be genuine poetry but one couldn't be sure.  There was no mention of the literature surrounding the Viking era; and as an example, even when the Battle of Maldon was mentioned, there was no reference to the Old English poem from which we glean our knowledge.  The curator should be sacked and so should the interior designer.  In all, this exhibition doesn't deserve even a glance."
"Written March 14, 2014",Viking Crush,"What is the point of selling advanced fixed time entry slots to so many people at once? Groups of people were just milling about in the entrance, so sharp elbows were needed just to get in. Everyone using one of the electronic guides (which the Museum charges extra for) stands blocking each exhibit while they listen, groups just stand around chatting and pushchairs - why are they allowed? In fact, the show was so crowded when I went yesterday (Thursday) at 1pm I got out as fast as I could. I hate being so hemmed in and couldn't see a thing anyhow, so gave up. I am only glad I have an Art Pass and didn't have to pay the full price. I love the British Museum and I go several times a year, but it is now so busy now the whole visit is too much of an effort I am not sure I will go again for a while."
"Written March 13, 2014",Vikings know how to make money,"Visited the new Viking Exhibition at the British Museum with a visually impaired friend.It was far too busy. The numbers were limited but not enough. Too many folk were trying to seeinside display cases with small items in. Of course when you pay to see things that are unique and small like coins & jewellery you want to be next to the glass case not have loads of people in front. Other visitors were very sympathetic to my friends needs however.Some form of dressed up actor would have improved the event, especially for the school kids.The actual main attraction - a life size replica of the skeleton of a ship was a let down for us. It was metal, not wood as we'd imagined.Please could the Museum put white lines on the edge of the entrance steps ?My friend has tunnel vision so the disabled entrance would be no use for him to see if he wasattempting entrance alone. It's not well sign posted."
"Written March 13, 2014",Vikings,What a poorly organised exhibition! Despite a specific booking time(10.50) we walked into the displays rooms to join the end of an almost static crowd. The display cases contained amazing items but you could not get near them or actually read the information which was at thigh height.After 30 minutes of herding we managed to shuffle past only half a dozen display cases therefore decided to give up and quickly walked through to the longship. This room at least was large and the crowds had more space to move around. Overall this was a real disappointment.  We paid for the tickets and the audio  guide but actually missed seeing the majority of the exhibits in the display cabinets which made for an expensive and deeply frustrating visit. The numerous comments around the frustrations for those attending this exhibition should make very sobering and thoughtful reading for the organisers. Please pay attention!Fabulous artifacts - greedy museum- dreadful experience- don't bother going!
"Written March 12, 2014",Vikings,Was really looking forward to this...but despite timed entry the exhibition was horrifically crowded and not well displayed. Unlike the ice age exhibition which I loved there was nothing which touched you with a sense of a human story...I don't think I will go to a blockbuster type show again...I would have had a far better experience wandering round the open galleries.
"Written March 12, 2014",Viking Exhibition,The exhibition was overcrowded and poorly crowd managed.  The entrance was blocked by people shuffling along.  I left feeling agitated and ripped off for £16.  The boat is just a few planks.  I would have rather have seen a smaller yet more complete boat.  Some amazing items on display but very little information about them.  I did not pay for the audio guide because I had already paid a lot for the exhibition.   This should be included in the initial ticket cost and not an added cost to the visit.I will not be visiting another special exhibition at the British Museum.  If you are interested in Vikings go to the Jorvik Museum in York.

Even with tickets booked for a pre set time (10.40am), the queue / line was very long and took forever to pass around. There was little proper organisation as there were exhibit cases on the left as you proceeded, then at various points cases on the right some feet away. If you went to the right hand cases you lost your place on the left. There were some heated exchanges taking place regarding queue jumping.When we eventally recahed the star attraction - the longboat - I would say 95% of it was just a metal frame (skeleton) with a few boards and wooden struts. The reconstruction was all metal. Don't go to this exhibition and expect to see anything vaguely resmbling the Mary Rose.It appeared the exhibition had been put together in support of the ""star attraction"" and it did not work."
"Written March 11, 2014",VIKING EXHIBITION - A MISSED OPPORTUNITY,"We had timed tickets for the first day of this much vaunted exhibition but a fire alarm rang just as we were picking up our audio guides (£4.50 extra). Twenty minutes later the doors reopened and all of the three timed groups were let in at once, resulting in a jam packed shuffle from glass case to glass case. Very disappointing.Even without the crush, we would have been disappointed at the layout of the exhibition which displayed exhibits in glass cases, most of which were up against a wall and so had only one line of vision. The information cards were placed at groin height and so were completely covered by whoever was fortunate enough to be in the front line. At one point the pathway takes visitors along a fairly long corridor with a completely blank wall, yet further into the exhibition a time line is squeezed behind a couple of glass cases practically impossible to read as the print is so small. A wasted opportunity.Despite some stunning pieces there was simply no sense of excitement, no background clashing of swords or sounds of the sea to add atmosphere, no audio visual displays to entertain or inform younger visitors, just glass cases and unreadable cards covered by visitors' middles! It was also extremely warm inside due to the crowds.We left feeling that we had seen some marvellous artefacts but that the museum had missed a once in a life time opportunity. Make up your own minds!"
"Written March 11, 2014",Disappointed with the Vikings exhibition,"We were extremely disappointed with the Vikings exhibition. Whilst the contents are very good, the exhibition design is simply “not fit for purpose.”The main problem is that the size, contrast and placement of the explanatory texts dictate that each can only be read by one person at a time. That person prevents anyone else seeing the object whist they are reading or anyone else reading the text whilst they subsequently inspect the object itself. The result is massive “overcrowding” and an abysmal visitor experience.  The visit starts where this problem is most acute and causes instant frustration and disenchantment.The exhibition is set for a long run and this unacceptable design could be corrected quickly and cheaply by any competent graphic designer. The British Museum should take immediate action to rectify the situation for the benefit of future visitors. It should also question the professional judgement of the person responsible for appointing the designer and approving their work. Large areas of wall are used for “mood” images and quotations; telling one nothing. The entire end wall of the “ship room” is devoted to a picture of the sea. Most of us know what the sea looks like and have guessed that it is what the ship sailed on. What little background information that has been provided is on very small screens and is, at best, highly simplistic.We were excited and happy to pay £35 to see a major exhibition of a subject we are interested in but left feeling disappointed and cheated."
"Written March 11, 2014","Viking exhibition. Beautiful exhibits, poorly presented","Travelled down from Yorkshire to see this and was very disappointed.The displays were very old fashioned: all the armour, pins, jewellery, helmets  etc just in display cabinets, no displays of them 'in situ' on life size models to show how they were used. The helmet and jaw display was actually a reconstruction, but only accessible from the front, unlike on the TV coverage.The descriptions were mounted low down so could not be viewed while other visitors spent ages in front listening to their audio guides.The lauded ship was 95% a steel frame with no scale mockup of what a complete ship would have looked like.I found that she Saga extracts on the walls were very pertinent.I suggest better flow control (especially in the first room), high level descriptions, and some reconstructions be added.I am afraid I cannot recommend this exhibition in its present form. An opportunity wasted."
"Written March 11, 2014",Oh dear!,"Had timed slot, but FAR too many people booked in. All very uncomfortable.Impossible to read or even see most of the information panels which were poorly placed, far too small and generally dimly lit.Very disappointed."
"Written March 11, 2014",Viking Exhibition Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of the British Museum generally but have to agree with many of the other reviewers regarding this exhibition. Far too crowded, poor layout of the exhibits, much of the narrative impossible to read as it's all at the bottom and constantly blocked by people. Descriptions of exhibits not always clear so hard to fathom which items they tie up with. I think it's a real shame that a museum of this calibre has pulled together such a great selection of exhibits and then designed this exhibition so poorly. It feels like someone with no previous experience has designed the layout. Come on BM, make some changes now so that future visitors paying £16.50 each get a better experience."
"Written March 10, 2014",Vikings Exhibition,"We expected queues on the first weekend, but not the volume of people in the exhibition.  I was expecting fewer people having booked timed tickets than the huge crowds we had to deal with.  We found it impossible to read the descriptions due to people standing in front of the cabinets listening to audio guides - why not provide 'break-out' areas for people to stand/sit and do this away from the exhibits (which are all shown as pictures on the guides anyway), to let those without these guides read the descriptions.  I am not a fan of audio guides, so never use them and would not have paid the extra charge anyway on top of the ticket price.  I can understand the Museum needs to recoup money to cover the free access to the rest of the collections, but I think that cramming people in led to a poor visitor experience on this occasion - very different from when I have visited their other special exhibitions on the past.  However the exhibits were stunning, especially the boat."
"Written March 10, 2014",Vikings!,"How excited was I to get tickets for the fabulous Vikings exhibition. The exhibition itself is fantastic with some amazing things on display. The background of voices in the ancient tongue lend to the atmosphere BUT there are some major disappointments. The exhibition to me seemd to run backwards. The queues were horrendous - a case of shuffle shuffle all the way round. They were letting people in 10 minutes blocks and the previous block hadn't even started their way round when we were let in. The first cases are very squeezed together whereas when you reach the far end the hall is huge, would have made more sense to let people in this end to them filter through the smaller areas much quicker.  The attendants seemed disinterested and totally oblivious to the fact there were a number of people taking photographs when it clearly states not to. One attendant was even on Facebook while I was going through - not what I would expect.Don't get me wrong, I would still have gone to see the exhibition. The chance to see artefacts like this doesn't come along very often and some of the items are just gobsmacking in their beauty and wonder. I hope that as the exhibition goes on, then there won't be such a squash to go round."
"Written March 10, 2014",Viking exhibit too crowded to enjoy,"I was really looking forward to the Viking exhibit, but it was a disappointment. Despite the timed entrance, it was so crowded one could barely walk, and the artefacts were very difficult to enjoy behind a wall of people. The British Museum should rethink the maximum number of visitors allowed in the exhibit at any point in time."
"Written March 9, 2014","Museum wonderful, Vikings Exhibition Not So","The British Museum is one of my favourite places to visit and I have been a frequent visitor to both the standing collections and exhibitions for over 40 years.  So, to be clear, the low rating I've given is for the exhibition and not the Museum. Unfortunately, I must agree with a previous post which suggests avoiding the Vikings Exhibition (unless of course you enjoy crowds & unacceptably long waits). I, too, had a timed ticket entry but it still took 30 mins to queue and enter the 1st introductory room. But, even once in, I was disappointed by the artefact descriptions which aren't clearly labelled so matching them up took a bit of educated guesswork ; be aware an audio guide is essential which can be prohibitively costly if you are a family/group. On a final warning note, if you have mobility problems I would advise thinking seriously about attending. I do have mobility issues; although I was offered a folding chair by a kind attendant that was no compensation for being frequently jostled by the crowds of people. I wish I'd thought of asking to get my money back but, after coming down to London specifically to see the Vikings, that just didn't occur to me."
"Written March 9, 2014",Average Vikings!,"Very disappointed!!!!... far to many people allowed in at the same time. Children unable to view the items easily,so quickly got bored. As I have been to many Danish areas that were involved In this exhibition,i was expecting so much more!!. The Viking exhibition is Roskilde is wonderful!!!. To spend over £30 pounds on a tickets and booking fee ( even for children that are FREE) is a bit steep!The items on display were very much the same. You never got a true feel of what the Vikings were truly about.  Also the staff looked so depressed!!!! no one smiled everyone looked stressed!!!.. I think they could have all done with a Schnapps!!!!!!!."
"Written April 2, 2013",Great Museum & fantastic Pompeii exhibition,"I love the British Museum and have been here countless times.  We went to the Pompeii exhibition on Good Friday and it is superb.  Very informative and well laid out.  Would recommend to everyone.The museum is free to get in, although a donation is welcomed.  The exhibition isn't free and you need to book ahead as it is so popular."
"Written March 18, 2013",Great building,Great building filled with treasures. Toilets disgusting. Staff attitudes need extra customer service training.
"Written March 11, 2013",Not very british,Wanted to ask if there was more British artefacts in the Greek or Egyptian museums as I went to the British museum and couldn't find much british to look at. The Elgin Marbles was the highlight for me but unless I got it wrong wont be going again.
"Written February 23, 2013",British museum...without any british exhibits !!!,"Everytime I travel to London, I visit the British museum. For us greek people it's always painful! A big piece of our history and culture is in there. I hope the next time I visit it the greek marbles will not be there but where they belong:The modern Acropolis Museum in Athens which was voted as the best museum of the world last year!I asked the guard if I can take a picture with flash (I was sure to hear NO) but he said:Yes, it's OK, they are just marbles!!!! This is how some people see the masterpieces of a culture made 2.500 years ago!!!The greek marbles(not Elgin's marbles: why should they take the name of the thief?) as long as they are there they will be shouting for freedom with the other ones from Italy, Egypt etc...etc...etc...Civilised people can hear them!!!"
"Written September 27, 2012",Get The Most From The Best Museum in the World,"Don't be fooled by the name.  It is not so much a ""British"" musum as a ""World"" museum that celebrates the whole of man-kind's history and achievements.The collection is vast so here are three practical tips as to how to get the most out of your visit.(1): Make a plan:  Decide what you want to see and head for it rather than wandering from gallery to gallery.  The museum information staff will offer help and there are guides you can buy or hire (audio) for a small fee.(2):  Take a free ""eye-opener tour"":  The museum offers free tours throughout the day.  The tours last 30 to 40 minutes and are led by knowledgeable volunteers who bring the objects to life by putting them in the right historical and cultural context.  Other volunteers run ""hands on desks"" where you can touch real objects from the collection;  these desks are manned from time to time but if you see one open please stop and try.(3): Avoid the obvious:  Two galleries are always crowded - the area around the Rosetta Stone and the Egyptian mummies so aim to spend more time elsewhere.  (And you can see a lifesize replica of the Rosetta Stone with a copy of the letter announcing its decipherment in Room 1 and as a substitute for the mummies, Room 61 is rarely crowded and has fabulous decorations from the Tomb Chapel of Nebarum).I live in London and am a frequent visitor.  Enjoy the museum."
"Written June 21, 2012",Touble Security,"Nice place with a lot of wonderful things to see. However,  security is a joke. No one to check anything coming in or going out.  My wife and I were having lunch, purse by her feet and it was taken.  Passports, credit cards, money, rail passes driver's licenses, all gone.  There was CCTV which the police reviewed but of the poor quality the police could not ID the ones who took her purse and we were told the CCTV could not be used in their courts. We saw other sites and museums that had much better security and warning signs posted.  They were no warning signs at the British Museum. This type of thing is happening all over London the police told us and they expect it to increase do to the OlympicsMy advice is to only carry what little you need.  Be aware there are scams, be aware of your surrounding at all times while in London, especially in crowded places, such as the British Museum"
"Written January 3, 2009",Babylon Exhibit,"We really enjoyed this museum. Recommend to every London visitor that has at least half a day to spare. We saw the current exhibit for Babylon. We did not like the way it deplicted the American Military at the end of the exhibit, very bias. You will see mummies from 3400 BC and the Rosetta Stone."
"Written May 26, 2007",A testament of the human  greatness,"It is hard to believe the British Museum opened to the public in 1759 and has remained open ever since despite all the European wars.  The museum is a testament of the British world dominance with a breath taking collection of human cultures, the biggest artifact collection across the world. Its pieces represent the people and places of the past two million years. If archeology is your thing, this is the museum for you.  From the vikings to the Aztecs, from ancient Rome , Egypt and Greece to Imperial China.   Here you will find it all.  From pieces of the Parthenon's pediment (a sore topic for the Greeks) to the spectacular winged human-headed lions from ancient Assyrian temples.  Admission is free (hard to believe) so please splurge and get the audio guide.  It will be your best investment on this visit. Do not miss to peak inside the museum library it is amazing."
"Written September 2, 2023",You can't go to London and NOT go to the British Museum,"In case you don't know, you don't go to the British Museum to learn about British history, you go there to learn about world history. So much to see and to learn about, you could spend a whole day there and still not see it all."
"Written July 27, 2023",Great museum but too busy,"Great museum, but it was way too busy to be enjoyable. I wish they would restrict the number of people they let in. At times it felt that I wasn‘t moving on my own, but was pushed along by the steady stream of people . "
"Written July 24, 2023",Fun day out for everyone ,The museum was so good so much fun to see the only problem was its so big and its get very hard to see every thing in the time you have.

"Written July 20, 2023",Great Musuem,Very interesting museum especially with Egyptian artifacts.  Very crowned in July but still worth going.
"Written July 18, 2023",Disappointing,"It is what you have heard- what the Brits stole from the world. But as a consequence it seems like a random collection of material, where in-depth learning is not possible. In the world, there are better museums.- But it is free- and interesting.   "
"Written July 11, 2023",A Must Stop in London!,"The British Museum is a must stop on your list. Wonderful exhibits, big and airy.  Can stay as long as you want. It can get a bit crowded so be prepared."
"Written July 10, 2023",An amazing free place to visit. A must.,An amazing museum with so much to see. The Egyptian rooms are especially interesting for children. The only negative point was that there were just too many people in some rooms- maybe this needs to be regulated somehow.
"Written June 15, 2012",Overwhelming!,Have a plan when you visit this museum.  There is so much to see!
"Written June 13, 2012",Plan on spending three very worthwhile hours,"One of the better museums across Europe, the British Museum focuses mostly on Egyptian, Greek, and Roman archaeological artifacts from around 500 BC to 1000 AC. While it is not the same in content or architectural design as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Louvre in Paris, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, or the Museo del Prado in Madrid, it is comparable in the quality and content of its exhibits so as to be considered world-class. It also is free to visit, and contrary to some other ""free"" museums in London, such as the various Tate Galleries, this one truly offers mostly all of its exhibits for free. The hours are somewhat limiting, as is the case for most attractions in London. When visiting in June of 2012, the museum was only open until 17:30, except Fridays when it closed at 20:30. Some notes:- Do visit the upper levels toward the rear of the building. They are listed as levels 1 and 2 but they feel more like levels 3 and 4 if you are using the stairs. There are elevators but they are slow and small. These upper levels contain some wonderful Asian collections, mostly from Japan and China.- Do not eat here. There is one cafe somewhat separated from the hustle and bustle of the museum at the end of one of the wings. There is another in the main rotunda. Both serve what could only be considered food by those who are truly starving. There is also a restaurant on the upper level (go up the stairs in the main rotunda). We did not try it, but the menu was quite limited.- There seems to be enough space to walk around and not feel congested. Even though the museum is free, there are no hoards of people as one might expect at all times. Photography and videography (amateur) are allowed. There is no bag inspection (security may not be as needed or perhaps they only stop people with certain size bags). - Do not miss the Rosetta Stone, the Statue of Ramesses, the Minoan Bull Leaper, and the Parthenon sculptures (which likely the Greek government would like to have returned).Do allow time to see the museum with care. It took us about three hours just to walk through all the exhibits without dedicating too much time to each, which included about 20 minutes in one of the aforementioned and forgettable cafes."
"Written May 28, 2012",Museum for kids,"If you are travelling with your kids, ask for the kids packages. They are great, they need to look for clues depending on the section of the museum you choose. "
"Written February 21, 2012",Toilets a disgrace,"The museum was brilliant and the sandwiches in the Court Cafe were amongst the best pre-packed sandwiches I have ever had. But, oh ! the toilets were a disgrace. Most of them were blocked and clearly had not been cleaned for a considerable time. The museum is a magnet for overseas visitors, I dread to think what sort of impression it leaves with them to take home."
"Written January 9, 2012",Best in the World,"Because of the rampant colonialism experienced by Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries, they were able to amass the most impressive collection of Eygyptian artifacts in the world. Now that the reading room is completed, it is an un-forgettable expereince to wander through a space used by Twain, Emerson and others. What makes it the best? Its free!"
"Written December 19, 2011",Booty,"The reason I give this museum two star is not because the museum is bad, it is because most of the stuff in this museum are not belong to Britain.

We especially liked the Rosetta stone, the Parthenon marbles (which we had been looking forward to it since our earlier visit to Athens), the statues of Egyptian pharaohs, the Lewis chessmen, the pre-historic reindeer sculpture, the Amaravati limestone reliefs, etc. Be sure to donate a small amount and get yourself an audio-guide and map at the entrance."
"Written October 4, 2011",Incredible Museum with so much to see!,"We spent a complete day at the British Museum and it was not enough to be able to see everything!  It was wonderful though. There is so much to see from so many different eras of time and countries that even one who is not a 'museum type' would find it extremely interesting and enlightening.  The Egyptian rooms with the mummies and artifacts are fantastic as well as the Greek, Assyrian friezes, the Rosetta Stone, the Obelisks (monument pillars) telling the defeats and history of the people.  Also, the guides showed how many things corresponded to facts in the Bible. Until the last century, it was not believed that many of these persons or places existed but artifacts found in the last century which are displayed at the British Museum have changed their view of the Bible as being very factual.  There's also several places to eat lunch or have tea and the food is delicious!  Overall, it was great!"
"Written August 9, 2011",The most interesting museum I´ve ever seen for free,"It´s the most well´known Museum in London and now I understand why.It´s fantastic, you can find a wide variety of items, The most exciting parts for mr were ""The Parthenon"", ""The Rossetta Stone"" and the mummies of course."
"Written May 28, 2011",A visit to London is INCOMPLETE without this stop,"Forget the wax museums and tourist holes. Don't be one of those tourists who needs to see everything and has that camera attached to your chest ready to take pictures of things you won't be able to identify later. Look for quality and integrity in your travels, and I doubt you could find better than this museum. Its a stronghold of artifacts that have been brought (stolen? =) ) from all quarters of the world. For history buffs like myself you will be in heaven. Name a culture, name a civilization and you will be impressed with what they have. Even if you are not that much into history, there will be something for you. My personal advice is to pack a lunch - including some good wine and feast in the front porch area on the steps. Also bring your iPod and load up some incredible music - nothing like looking at the Rosetta stone while you listen to Vivaldi. http://silandco.blogspot.com/"
"Written April 16, 2011",Too bad giving 6 stars isn't an option,"This place is simply amazing. It truly is the best collection of world history anywhere. The highlight for us was the Rosetta Stone, but there is so much more than that. Separate rooms from everything to Egypt, to Korea, to the Incas make for a full day. Actually we spent half the day here and didn't come close to seeing everything. Taking a tour of a specific room that you have the most interest in is a good idea. But the audio guide also gives a big assist by allowing you to choose specific artifacts you might want to check out. Love this place and it is FREE!"
"Written March 26, 2010",Doesnt do what it says on the tin!,"Those of you who visit London museums know that the clue is usually in the title - The Imperial War Museum is based around war, the Victoria & Albert Museum is based around Victoria & Albert and, surprise surprise, the Science Museum is based around science! You may, therefore, assume that the British Museum is about all things British; unfortunately its not! There is very, very little British about it - instead it is filled with artefacts from all around the world. From mummies to Easter Island statues to 16th century Chinese artefacts, there is certainly a lot to see within the museum. If you are one for culture then it would definitely be the museum for you. I do feel it would help people to do a tiny bit of research before they went - the Rosetta Stone is a lot more impressive if you know why its important! The audio tour is informative and directs you around the museum well and this helps as it stops you by getting overwhelmed by the plethora of items in the museum. It is an interesting if slightly unspectacular museum in that it really only suits a certain type of person - one who has an interest in global history, ancient civilisations and the evolution of man's labours through the ages. Those of you with kids, or those of you who are looking for a 'something for everyone' type of museum (similar to the World Museum in Liverpool), this might not be the most enthralling place you ever visit. Worth a visit, but understand the kind of place it is and the kind of artefacts on show."

"Written July 11, 2022",Massive and Massively Amazing,"I wish I could’ve returned back to the British Museum after my first visit on my second day touring London. This is an outstanding facility befitting one of the classiest, most beloved cities on the globe. The grand atrium, with its stunning glass-paned ceiling, is bright and welcoming, despite the throngs of fellow tourists during the unprecedentedly-busy summer season. From this atrium, one can access every other part of the museum, making navigation relatively confusion-free. I encourage everyone to take their time at each exhibit, reading the plaques and learning from this incredible collection of art and history.Contrasted with the National Gallery, which I kind of consider the “sister” to the British Museum in a way, this museum offers ample dining/snack options at affordable prices, as well as with ample seating areas. Moreover, the restrooms and other public facilities are very clean. And did I mention that it’s free here too?!There’s not enough time to list all the wonderful attributes of this top-notch London icon. I recommend a visit ASAP!"

"Written February 28, 2022",Stonehenge Exhibition spoilt by lack of information when booking online.,"We booked tickets to the Stonehenge exhibition online in good faith.  On arrival, we were informed by a surly security guard (rear entrance) that wheeled luggage was *not allowed.  (We had one 10kg suitcase between us.)   Nowhere during the booking process did it tell us this.  In fact, it was only through searching afterwards that we found the rule - on a downloadable word document.  We had to click three times on small print to find it.  Having travelled across London especially early for this exhibition, four hours before our train home, this was disappointing.  No sympathy from security guard - only a sarcastic 'read the small print.'  No apology from staff when we asked for our tickets to be refunded.  Why is there not a pop-up alert on the booking page?We ended up at the rather wonderful Charles Dickens museum on nearby Doughty Street,  where we were able to store our small suitcase f.o.c. If we'd travelled especially to London to see the Stonehenge exhibition, I would have been livid.British Museum  -  please make it abundantly clear on your website and booking forms that wheeled luggage of any description cannot be brought onto your premises.We would have left our suitcase at our hotel."

"Written February 10, 2014",Disabled Visitor made very welcome by staff,"We visited recently on  a sunday after a weekend in London.  We had already rung ahead as the Nuseum offers parking to disabled visitors with a blue badge if you ring ahead.  This parking is free and on site.  When we arrived they were expecting us, took us into the courtyard and we parked,  What could be easier if you are disabled.  My husband used a scooter and this we used around the museum on a busy and crowded day.  There is a little lift to give access to the front and then once inside there are plenty of lifts to get around.  There is virtually knowhere that is inaccessible.  toilet facilities are plentiful.  We used the little cafe just to the left of the entrance rather than the busier central eating area.  A member of staff, again very helpful, showed us up the the upper floor.  the reteraunt was quiet and the food was excellent, tasty, fresh and good value.  the museum itself is expansive ( we have been a few times) and it can be easy to get lost and miss bits so its worth taking a while to get familiar with how to get around.  I don't suggest its a museum for young children, there isn't much hands on.  If you are interested in artefacts and anything ancient then this is the museum for you.  Free entry for all, donations asked for.  There is a cloarkroom with attendant for use of bags and cases."

Beautiful, amazing items from normal household goods and food to lush wall sections depicting life of the time. Having visited both Italian locations in all there splendor this certainly enhanced that trip and is truly excellent. For a Monday it was quite busy but when you see what is there you can understand why. Whilst there I also visited an exhibition on Ice Age art.  Worthy of a mention also is the restaurant with a wide selection of food and drink and not at extortionate prices. Try the carrot cake and a camomile tea."
"Written April 8, 2013",pompeii and herculanium exhibition,"We are both in our seventies and relatively small people.We went to the exhibition last Saturday 6th April at 3.40 pm.We assumed that with timed entry that it would not be heaving with people inside--how wrong we were !!. It was impossible to move around and seeing exhibits was virtually impossible.People with the audio equipment were hogging all the exhibits and we could not get near. I fail to see the point of the audio equipment when it appeared that all the exhibits were individually described.Our disappointment wes immense as we had been looking forward to this exhibition for a long time [and spent a great deal of money reaching the British Museum and paying the entrance fee]If you have a timed entry,why can't there be a timed exit so that people do not stay there all day"
"Written April 6, 2013",The Pompeii Exhibition,"I wanted to write a review of this exhibition but having arrived in time for our 4.00 pm slot, my wife and I managed about 10 minutes at best in the exhibition. It was far far too crowded. Too much pushing and shoving just to move along the corridors, let alone view the exhibits. We gave up and left by the entrance. We did complain about the obvious overcrowding but the staff were unhelpful.I have enjoyed many exhibitions at the British Museum but this was just dreadful!ConorM"
"Written April 6, 2013",Pompeii - Too Crowded,The Pompeii exhibition was totally sold out on the day of our visit and as a result it was difficult to see the exhibits properly.  In some areas the lighting on the texts relating to the exhibits was in shadow (probably owing to the number of visitors pouring over the cases)The selction of post cards relating to the exhibition was very limited which was disappointing.
"Written April 5, 2013",Mobbed,"Too packed, despite advance booking to Pompeii and Ice Age shows. (which were, btw, totally booked out on the day) The number of people permitted into each of these small enough exhibitions was far too great. People were pushing and shoving each other to get to see the exhibits. The audio guides, which you also pay for at £4 for each show per person, were too slow to keep up with the push of the crowd. Beautiful building. Well maintained but visitor numbers too large so not an enjoyable experience at all. The success of the blockbuster, revenue raising, exhibition is a double edged sword. The visitor experience to the British Museum needs to be improved, how to allocate/limit visitor numbers needs to be continually assessed."
"Written October 11, 2020",Always worth a visit,"We visited under covid conditions so only the ground floor was open to the public. We were disppointed at not seeing the mummies, only the egyptian sculptures, but enjoyed seeing the greek vases without treading on peoples toes and so being able to read the notes. "

Like, did you know that the Inuits made these FABULOUS ivory sculptures. This is a must see. Then, I saw the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin marbles and they were a wonderful sight to behold.

"Written October 6, 2021",Explore Egypt,"We went to specifically visit the Egyptian exhibits as part of uni study research, unfortunately for us the period of our study isn't greatly exhibited in the current displays, but what was and the other exhibited items were extremely interesting, and very well preserved."
"Written October 4, 2021",Really disappointing,"I'm sorry to say I was really disappointed by my experience here. On arrival, we passed through the bag check area quickly, then expected to have our pre-booked tickets checked at the door. Nope. There wasn't a member of staff to be seen, therefore pre-booking our tickets (which we were more than happy to do, since we believed this would limit numbers and increase Covid safety) was completely pointless. We wandered straight in to the building without so much as a greeting. No maps or literature to be had, so we didn't know where to start in such a huge place. We headed off and just hoped we wouldn't miss anything. It quickly became apparent the place was busy - too busy - and since many people weren't wearing masks, or were wearing them incorrectly, we quickly felt uncomfortable as it wasn't always easy to distance. Because of feeling uncomfortable, it was difficult to relax and enjoy the exhibits.I was also disappointed with the staff. Most of the ones we saw acted like they didn't particularly want to be there. They didn't seem to engage with visitors, not even a smile or a nod. In fact, one was so intent on playing with her phone that she almost walked right into me, and another was sitting down doing a Sudoku.The one good point was there was plenty of hand sanitiser dotted around - but that's not going to help very much if there are too many people around.In the end, we were so disappointed and uncomfortable that we only did half the museum, then left. There is so much to do in London, and we chose this place thinking it would be great, and that care was being taken re: Covid, only to find that isn't the case."

"Written August 25, 2021",Nero at the British Museum - a real insight,"The British Museum is vast so you need to plan if there are specific areas you wish to visit. I thoroughly recommend the exhibitions. There is a charge for them but they are exceptionally well curated. Most recently I visited the Nero exhibition which set out his biography, his place in the dynasty of emperors that started with Augustus. Its main focus was to engage you with Nero's reputation. Was it deserved or was it an historical character assassination after his downfall.  Artefacts that illustrate his military campaigns, his building and public works and his turbulent political and married life were clearly displayed and signed in an order that made it relatively easy for the novice to begin to understand the period and the issues that were relevant to the understanding of Nero's reputation.  The Museum is just a wonderful place and the exhibitions are always worth the payment."
"Written August 3, 2021","""Where we keep all the stuff we stole Museum""","Great place but should be called ""Where we keep all the stuff we stole Museum""When we visted Egypt the answer to many questions was no you will find that in the British Museum and how right our guide in Egypt was,this place is full of plundered stuff from other countries,I am not saying give it back becuase it was great to visit when these places are considered to be no go areas until the pandemic ends.A well laid out museum,not confined or  claustrophobic like the National History museum and well signed."

"Written March 11, 2021",The British Museum...,"Like New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Paris' Louvre, the scale of the British Museum can only be appreciated in person as pictures don't capture the building's sheer size and scope.  The famed cultural institution is so large, it's best to plan on visiting it over a few days.The famed institution's collection easily exceeds 8 million objects and pieces of art. Some of those are controversial as they were obtained during the height of the British Empire and their ownership is contested by other countries.It's almost difficult to comprehend this glorious institution originated from a collection of art objects and books bequeathed from a single individual, that of Irish doctor, Hans Sloane.  Over 2 centuries later, the building, which still exists on its original site, has grown and is now home to more than 8 million pieces of art."

And then the magic begins as he leads you through the sprawling rooms of the greatest museum in the world, unlocking its secrets along the way. He plots out humanity's journey from the Stone Age to the modern age, visiting all of our greatest civilisations including Mesopotamian cities and the great empires of Egypt, Assyria, Greece and Rome, and the Vikings and the Aztecs to boot! His style is accessible and easy to follow, but incredibly informed and one that obviously draws on a wealth of experience. He provides a very effective summary of classic archaeological theories, but also challenges established beliefs where he sees fit. It's an interactive experience with Rossa welcoming questions and thoughts; he even gives you the opportunity to play a round of the Royal Game of Ur, the oldest board game! Careful, he's a hustler!Of particular interest is a history of how Egyptian hieroglyphs and Sumerian cuneiform, the world's earliest written language were deciphered and the incredible personalities involved. Rossa finishes the session by proudly talking through some of the science behind archaeology, addressing obvious, but curious questions like ""how is it that ancient sites get buried?""This is a truly fantastic whistle-stop tour of some of the British Museum's star highlights and you are expertly led through the entire experience by a guide who is knowledgeable, articulate and experienced, but ready to challenge and question with a keen sense of humour. If you're looking for an introduction to the world's greatest museum, look no futher than Rossa Minogue."

"Written February 19, 2020","Troy exhibition, British Museum","Visited the Troy exhibition at The British Museum this week. Overall good but let down by lack of more thought in presentation.First the good-Great selection of items brought together from all over the World.Good sequence of groups exploring fact, fiction and art.But the bad-Captions to exhibits poor. - small print (one at least in gold letters on white)Captions set down at knee level make problem worse - visitors having to step back and stoop to read; text explaining source in even smaller text - with either no lighting or in shadow created by visitors standing in front.Grouping of objects- some exhibits set close together creating queues of people whilst parts of area empty and dark.Exhibits at knee level - why so low down? Large empty space in cabinet above. Taller persons behind cannot see exhibits thus causing more bottlenecks.Exhibits not in any real order - no chronological order to items from different periods of. Excavated Troy.Bit of advice - ask for a large print copy of exhibit text on entering. There are some available but not very obvious.All these problems add up to creating unnecessary bottlenecks / queues of visitors which spoil the experience.We love the British Museum but come on team - put more thought into visitor usability and less into trendy graphics!"

"Written May 2, 2020",Free access to unparalleled collection,"This museum is described as the oldest museum in the world, with an “unrivalled collection of antiquities”. Hard to argue with that! It is indeed a massive museum, with dozens of galleries dedicated to various countries, regions, and eras. Too much to take in during one visit, not just for the time it would take, but for how overloaded your brain would become. We reviewed the floor plan and list of galleries, and selected three sets of galleries, along with “Enlightenment”. We had two hours, but didn’t keep to just the three selected galleries - there was always something in the next room that drew our eye. We didn’t read as many labels and descriptions as we perhaps should have, but we still learned a lot. An unexpected treat was the Enlightenment room, built as a library for King George III, it now presents a contemplation on the emergence of scientific research and discovery, and the establishment of institutions such as the British Museum. I didn’t come across anything that acknowledges that some of the research and collection of artifacts was conducted under circumstances involving racism, exploitation, occupation, and oppression, all of which co-existed with the ideas and ideals of the Enlightenment. Amazing that admission is free to the permanent collection. So many attractions in London charge absurd entry fees."

"Written April 12, 2020",Best museum ever,One of the best museums that i’ve been to and everything was real and nothing fake but on the minus side: some exhibitions cost money to enter but overall it was excellent

"Written February 25, 2020","Always an incredible, fascinating and educational experience",Brilliantly laid out and with so many different objects and rooms that it almost makes your head spin with knowledge after a few hours. Worth visiting just for the central area alone. And free. 
"Written February 25, 2020",British museum,"The museum was huge, and there were many rooms available for a visit. Highly recommend it. It is a great opportunity, and is also free!"
"Written February 24, 2020",Great exhibitions but finding a toilet for disabled people is a nightmare,There is so much too see in here but the infrastructure is quite poor. The toilets are smelly after 11.00 a.m. and for disabled people there is a very limited availability. The museum is in need of an upgrade. 
"Written February 18, 2020",Vacations,Is very large museum with so many exhibitions to see in the center of London. We had a great time. It also has a free entrance which is very important I hope keep that way
"Written February 18, 2020",Troy Exhibition - very crowded but BRILLIANT,As it's so crowded best to buy the catalogue first and study it before visiting to get the most from the experience. Great to see so many parents telling the ancient Greek stories to their kids! A must see.
"Written February 17, 2020",A walk back into history,"The Egyptian and Assyrian exhibits are an amazing insight into those nations life and history.   We thoroughly enjoyed walking amongst statues, wall reliefs and sarcophagus which are thousands of years old."

"Written February 12, 2020",A Top Museum in London,"I love the British Museum. It has everything a history buff like me could hope for. It is clean, well-organised and has helpful, well-trained staff. I especially love the egyptological exhibitions. I do realise that many of the artefacts have been stolen from other countries (Greece and the lost marbles, anyone?) and I don't think it's right, but the museum itself still is well worth a visit. I have visited this place many times throughout my life and it never ceases to take my breath away!"
"Written February 23, 2020",An amazing collection for free!,Get there early at the weekend because it gets busy fast. It is well laid out and plenty of amazing artefacts in addition to the famous Egyptian ones.

"Written February 23, 2020",It was a great museum ,"I visited firs time . A lot of art there. So huge . Entrance is free . Clean , tidy . There were beautiful historical items there. I think it is a biggest and rich museum in the word."

"Written January 26, 2020",Museum of Museums,You simply have not visited London if you have not visited this place. Allow plenty of time to discover and take a rest to enjoy the well selected range of beverages n snacks
"Written January 26, 2020",60th Birthday Trip,"Cannot believe that this museum is free, we only had time to do the Greek and Egyptian section as I think you would need a few days to do justice to everything here, the Elgin marbles fab and the rosetta stone not to be missed.Just choose wisely before heading off into the museum to make the best use of your time."
"Written January 26, 2020",Awesome sight,"Why not visit if u are in London and in the area, a beauty not to be wasted, must come to snap photos!!!"
"Written January 25, 2020",True history....,Had a quick look around but you probably need a week to do it properly. The museum is laden with artefacts from all over the world. It felt a bit too much to comprehend but obviously a must do when in town. Enjoy......

"Written January 21, 2020",Probably the Greatest Museum (on ancient stuff) in the World!,I’ve been here twice now. Once a general visit and most recently for the Troy exhibition. It’s excellent. Quite possibly the best Museum about ancient civilisation in the world.
"Written January 20, 2020",Ancient history,"Part is closed so check in advance.  There are very interesting things here like a part of the parthenon.  Lots of ancient egypt, rome and greece artifacts.."
"Written December 24, 2019","Too much to see, so little time.",Great to visit without crowds! I appreciated the pictures and stories for the ancient finds. Several food options. Exhibits good for any age over 5. They have family events. Good directions in the museum but I would recommend the headphone tour.
"Written December 24, 2019",Tour with Valuable Rick Steves Free Audio Download!,"I highly recommend downloading Rick Steves free audio tour of the British Museum, do an online search. He walks us through the highlights and gives  many interesting details which makes it all the more meaningful. I totally enjoyed my 90-minute visit!"
"Written December 24, 2019",very impressive,Huge museum . You can get lost and spend hours in it. I recommend to take the audio guide and follow the top 10 items tour. It takes you to 10 pieces from different eras in different rooms of the museum. In between it takes you through most of the galleries. Loved it. 
"Written December 22, 2019",A Walk through ancient history,"I was surprised by how large this museum was. It was a walk through the history of our world. With authentic pieces of art and artifacts from the Greek, Romans, Egyptians, tge America’s and more. I enjoyed learning about their cultures and customs and the displays were exquisite. Excited to visit again."
"Written December 22, 2019",Good Exhibitions  ,"Free Entry — but please leave a Donation as this helps to keep some great exhibits here. There are some great exhibitions and really enjoyed the Ancient Greeks, Egyptian and Roman UK and learning the history from the information next to the exhibit. Fantastic architectural dome and glass ceiling in the middle of the building Well worth a visit which could be for a couple of hours or longer if you take in all the exhibitions "
"Written December 21, 2019",Great museum but way too many people!,"We went to visit the Egyptian room so that the children could see the Mummies which they were studying at school...it was raining & the museum was packed, way too many people and the kids were constantly jostled & pushed to the point where they really could not see what we had come to look at. Alexa is slightly claustrophobic so we left fairly quickly. A. Real pity ....."
"Written December 19, 2019",Lot's of Great Exhibits,"I've been in The British Museum several times and always enjoy it.  It is very large with much to interest about anyone.  But, like lots of museums it is always very crowded, so take your patience.  "
"Written December 18, 2019",Too big for just one day,"We were only able to scratch the surface of the marvelous collection. Your choice is scan quickly and try to see about 50 percent or come back two ior three times and savor the quality of the treasures inside. There were a great number of people trying to do the former and could get in the way of your enjoyment, but let them hurry by and take in the cultural history this museum affords."
"Written December 18, 2019",A realy great museum! ,"The exhibits are amazing, they are extremely well preserved and  displayed! It is 100% worth visiting if you are in London! One of the greatest museums i have ever been to. "
"Written December 18, 2019",Inspired by the east,"The museum has introduced an extra security level and queuing system to enter. Security guards are checking bags and then a line of youthful employees encouraging you to give £3.00 to enter and support the upkeep of the museum. I had pre-booked tickets to see the exhibition ‘Inspired by the east’ and found myself in the fast track queue without the request for money. I thought the exhibition was an interesting insight into how the Ottoman Empire was reflected into the West when Europeans began travelling. Some of the art was beautiful. It was worth going. I love this museum it’s wide, open and light central court with all the exhibits radiating off at the different levels. At busy times there are not enough seats, so grab one of the portable ones from beside the information desks.There is a useful cloakroom, £2.00 for each coat. Bags are £2.50 on wet cold days it’s good to be able to wander around in the warmth without heavy coats.I’ve already got my ticket to visit the Troy exhibition next."
"Written January 19, 2020",Must visit museum amongst the many,Out of the museums you have to discover in London this has the best History. Do not miss out on the Egyptian room 😍👌🔥

"Written January 14, 2020","Wow, so many things to see",It's huge and very interesting.  Especially the Egyptian rooms. The mummies were fascinating. There's so much to see and read and learn. Pick up a guide though otherwise you'll be going round in circles

"Written February 2, 2020",Lecture,"The British Museum is world renown. Whatever exhibitions , lectures, events there are on at this national treasure they are all likely to be excellent and will positively increase the knowledge of the visitor."
"Written February 2, 2020",World class museum - small bites taken,I explored the Tudor rooms and Sutton Hoo discovery of Anglo-Saxon artifacts.  Both very informative.  Also had lunch at the cafe - delicious!
"Written February 1, 2020",Free for most of it,This is a mostly free museum.  Some special exhibitions cost money but it is mostly free.  The free part takes at least 3-4 hours to see it completely.
"Written January 31, 2020",Wonderful architecture,It was fascinating to see the beautiful architecture of this place. Great entrance space and stunning exhibitions! Must do for art lovers. 
"Written January 28, 2020",Nice visit,"We spent a few hours here last Saturday. Very busy, but weekends so to be expected. We hadn't been for a few years. We both enjoyed out time here. "
"Written January 28, 2020",Family vacation ,"A very well coverage of the world’s biggest ancient civilizations and some modern exchibits,too....But as a Greek ,I was mad at the sight of our Parthenon marbles ,that are the main demonstration of the museum,without our consent.....😢😡"
"Written January 27, 2020",A must visit London institution.,Visited today to see the special Troy exhibit.  History and mythology vividly brought to life.  Well worth the visit.
"Written January 26, 2020",What a Collection,"Collection of antiquities is absolutely stunning!  Rosetta stone, Walls from ancient Nineveh, walls from Nebuchadnezzer's castle, etc.  Great way to spend a day in London."
"Written January 26, 2020",Interesting artefacts from around the world,Wonderful building.Interesting artefacts from around the world; including the Elgin marbles which may look better in the Parthenon.
"Written December 17, 2019",A Must See,"It’s a beautiful place even without going to see an exhibition! (Though the exhibits are amazing and well worth seeing). It’s that beautiful roof they have - it uplifts they spirit and illuminates the heart. If you have time maybe research a particular era you want to see  because it’s huge, but no matter what  go,go, go!"
"Written December 17, 2019",Troy Exhibition,A fantastic collection of artwork and archeological finds. Slightly surprised that the normal excellent layout of BM special exhibitions was not up to its usual high standards. Exhibition overcrowded in places making it hard to enjoy as I would have like to
"Written December 17, 2019",The centre of Culture,"Amazing building. We spent around 3-4 hours to see all the attractions. Its a museum where you have in one place all the history and culture of the world around.You can see Greek,Indian,Roman,Egyptian,African,Chinese,Moggolian historical collections, each of them in different room. If you ever get there, asure you have a lots of free time."
"Written December 16, 2019",Amazing place,I went on two different days & used the audio you & did the docent lead tours as well. Learned so much.
"Written December 16, 2019",human history an culture,I never miss a chance to visit whenever I am in London.I am an Architect and I travel a lot enjoying Museums.The British Museum is bye far my favorite. Entrance for free but would be nice of you if you give a little donation to continue supporting this great institution.
"Written December 15, 2019",Amazingly educational museum.,"Mummies. Rosetta stone. Samurai exhibition. Enough said. Seriously one of the most amazing museums in London but if you want to get a good shot of the Rosetta stone, show up early or be very patient."
"Written December 15, 2019",Stone Ancient Statues at BM,I went to see the exhibition of Ancient Roman and Assyrian stone statues. I had seen the Assyrian Winged gate guardians in Berlin and came to see the originals in London. The exhibition was so good. So many top quality examples of ancient cultures. The original Assyrian statues are so impressive and there are several sets on display with different features. Lots of space around them so you can experience their powerful presence.  Also saw the Elgin Marbles. Well worth a visit and free!
"Written December 14, 2019",Join the British Museum & Get Unlimited Access to Troy,"Yes, entrance to the British Museum is free but the Museum does charge a handsome fee for its special exhibits. I wanted to see ""Troy: Myth and Reality"" more than once (plus relax in the serene Members Room) so I joined for $78 (a few dollars more than the pre-Boris pound would have yielded). Also, the 20% discount on the excellent and extensive offerings in the shop comes in handy before Christmas."
"Written December 13, 2019",The building alone makes it worth a visit!,"The British Museum really is a must see in London. I've been there several times and it still impresses me!It contains countless treasures from around the world, and yes it looks fairly normal from the outside, but the glass covered central court is just stunning. It's the best example of new complimenting old that I've ever seen. Don't miss it."
"Written December 13, 2019",Excellent Tour and history.,"There are some rooms that you need to pay but we went to a free one like Egypt.It was fascinating to see tombs, egyptian relic, curved stones, hieroglyphs and so on.I felt that i went back time to Pharaoh's time.I definitely recommend it who goes to the museum itself,"
"Written December 5, 2019",Wow!!!,"The artifacts, displays from around the world and ages is outstanding!!!I didn’t know I would ever see Cleopatra in my lifetime and there she was mummified!Such a treasure and something for everyone. Lots of school children can be there- so if you have a headache or are overstimulated be sure to bring ear plugsI do suggest planning ahead if you need to use the toilet... lineups can be astronomical!"
"Written December 4, 2019",Don't go tired...like me,"Since it's free admission (donation suggested), you should at least splurge on an audio guide if you're not part of a guided group tour.  Then just wander.  My biggest mistake was leaving this spectacular institution for near the end of a long day. So after the Egyptian, Assyrian, etc galleries near the entrance, I was already exhausted and intimidated by what lay ahead.  After about 2 hours I barely got through 20% of what was worth seeing.  You can easily spend a whole day here."
"Written December 4, 2019",Troy exhibition another big success,"We are members and visit all the major exhibitions.  Troy was amongst the very best.  It included the story of the myth, finds from archaeology and artworks.   Explanations we accessible.  Allow two hours"
"Written December 4, 2019",Wonderful,Visited many times now and never tire of it. Best visited for 2 hour visit in early morning leaving the rest of the day to avoid crowds and do something else.
"Written December 4, 2019",Must visit,"Finally got to visit the British Museum. Excellent exhibitions,displays n collections. My teenage son n I especially enjoyed Kathe Kollwitz's prints exhibtion and the Egyptian collection. Visit the Great Court Restaurant on the upper floor. Excellent food. A good place to take a break! "
"Written December 3, 2019","A must, the museum of looting","A poignant experience always, the British made swum has emblematic pieces, torn from various corners of the world. Literally grabbed, cut out, hacked out. Some of these treasures are almost painful to look at, such as the Elgin marbles, last room on the left at ground level. They were robbed from the Parthenon by lord Elgin’s men, cut and carted out. In spite of the horrid damage caused by their hacking and cutting the marble out, the friezes of the horses, and other pieces are breathtaking. I still think they ought to be where they belong, as half of the pieces, or at least pay for them. My teen endured it well."
"Written December 3, 2019",Amazing artefacts but a nightmare to get around,"If you want a one stop location to learn about the history of the world then this is the right place. However, even with a map, it was difficult to navigate through all the different floors and hallways. You also need a lot of time to get through each section so if on a short holiday, perhaps either limit the things you'd like to see, or skip this altogether for a time you're on a longer stay."
"Written December 2, 2019",My kids really enjoyed it.,"One of the best museums we've been to as a family. Extensive collection, some of the highlights include the Ancient Egypt mummies and the King's Library. Has good amenities and souvenir shop. Will go again"
"Written December 1, 2019",Nice Place,"I visited with my father, whom uses a walking stick was allowed to avoid the queues to enter the museum by a security guard. I enjoyed seeing the Egyptian and Ancient Greek and Roman but I didn’t stay long I will have to spend more time in the museum next time I visit."
"Written December 1, 2019","Excellent, although crowded","SUmmer in London with the family, and the BM is definitly a ""go to""Go Early, though, as it can be mobbed!"
"Written January 1, 2020",Beautiful Museum but badly preserved exhibits! ,"Despite the truly beautiful experience this place actually provides to every visitor, the badly preserved and poorly treated exhibits have actually '' suffered'' a lot. Especially saddened to see significant exhibits from my own country in a truly poor condition... "
"Written January 1, 2020",Always a great visit,We are members of the British Museum and love visiting there and really enjoyed the Troy exhibition. 
"Written December 31, 2019",Many Amazing Historical Items,Today we went to the British Museum and it was amazing. They had many artifacts from different time periods all over the world. Their main object is the original Rosetta Stone. This has been one of my favorite places I have been in London. 
"Written December 30, 2019",Extraordinary,"Fantastic jumbo museum, need to spend there a whole day to see something. And must get a guided tour so that you understand what you are seeing. "
"Written December 30, 2019",Rosetta Red Carpet,"Great museum, phenomenal exhibits but some of them get more crowds than others. Particularly the Rosetta Stone... best for people who are tall or have pointy elbows as this one was crazy busy. Lunch here is a problem though if you don't want to use the restaurant as there was nowhere really to have a picnic and of course the prices for food were ridiculous. Once you arrive here though and have a plan of what you want to see most you can happily spend a full day here and still not see it all."
"Written December 29, 2019",How could one not like this place?,"This museum is absolutely stunning.  I only had a few hours to spend in a place that could easily occupy a curious mind for a month.  If given the opportunity I‘d spend entire weekends gazing in awe at all the collections.  The fact that there is no entry fee, only a request for donations (please donate it’s well worth it) makes it even more incredible."
"Written December 29, 2019","So Much World History, and Free!","You could spend a month here, or 2.5 hrs like we did which seemed to take us through the world on a time machine. See the Rosetta stone, Egyptian artifacts & mummies, the Portland Vase, and so much more. And unlike most attractions in Europe, it is completely Free! But, does close at 5pm, check the website before you go."
"Written December 27, 2019",Free enter and make a donation,You can see the mumies here and lots of interesting things from all over the world. You can enter for free or make a donation to the museum.
"Written December 26, 2019",One of the most important collection of artifacts,This museum houses one of the most important and priceless collection of artifacts in the world. It is a must-see if you are in London. Entrance is free.
"Written December 25, 2019",One of our best days in London,"Actually the British Museum was not a ‘must-do’ on our list. We were on our way to the Tower of London when it started to rain - so we made the detour to the British Museum. Kid was at first restless too - but we quickly managed to solve that issue with the audio! And honestly the audio is critically if you only have a day at the British Museum since it is massive! Gift shop has a great selection. Great Court restaurant was absolutely my favourite in the entire trip! Food, drinks and service were good. Cloak room took very long though vs other museums / attractions - wasted too much time there."
"Written December 1, 2019",Could spend all day,"As the title suggests, I should have spent a whole day in this place but time always runs out! I had a spare hour in the day to walk around the area so decided to pop in for a quick view. I missed my scheduled meet and spent all the time I had. For a historian like myself this was perfect. Open, large, bright place full of relics in every corner. Would honestly recommend going, I will be the next time I am in London. Great place to visit for both young and old."
"Written November 30, 2019",Glad we visited.,We booked a private tour of specific features of the British Museum and it did not disappoint. Saw and learned about some intriguing artifacts including the Rosetta Stone. The building itself is lovely and was easy to get to via bus and close to eateries and convenient to exploring Central London.
"Written November 30, 2019",Could live here!,"Super great museum. It never got boring, it never felt heavy or too much. Loved the possibility to sit and have a coffee or a bite in between your tour. Really nice!"

"Written November 30, 2019",Go at the beginning of the day!,"Went with family friends, mostly because I wanted to see the Rosetta Stone. It was free, but after a long walk we were already quite tired. some incredible artefacts but we had just been to Rome, so they often paled in comparison."
"Written November 29, 2019","Very vast, lost of things to see.","The museum is very big, and there is lots of interesting things to see inside, in various different topics. All the information is laid out very nicely! Leave a bit of time to go thorugh all interesting areas."
"Written November 29, 2019",I believe this is a one-time failure ,"The experience I had at the British Museum  was not as I had expected.I came on a Sunday, probably the most packed day, but also the most legitimate day to visit.I was trying to get some guidance or help at the reception, but mostly got a “DIY answers”.The general daily tour ran out of places (you cannot pre-reserve) and no one was trying to help with an alternative. I left after an hour.I assume if they would take some charge from everyone and gave minimal service, my experience would have been better."
"Written November 29, 2019",DISAPOINTING,I love the British Museum so decided to visit their restaurant. A great disapointment. It was very expensive and the portions were very small. With all the compettion locally I thought it would give better value.
"Written January 10, 2020",Excellent ,Free entry. A key attraction and need at least a half day to visit. I would say a must visit museum. 
"Written January 8, 2020",Amazing place to visit,I really enjoyed visiting the British Museum. Plenty to see and a lot of knowledge to be gained. They have a rich number of artefacts and a wide range of history. Great staff too. 
"Written January 8, 2020",The best museum,"Probably The best museum I've ever seen. Spent 5h here and join a tour about Egypt. I suppose you do not need to travel anywhere else, because all artifacts are gathered here."
"Written January 6, 2020",Lot of History - definitely worth visiting,Plan for at least 4 hours if not more if you are interested in visiting the important artefacts / sculptures.
"Written January 3, 2020","this was a museum visit from hell,","the very long lines for security plus long lines to leave the museum. trying to get near the Rosetta stone was impossible. Why would any parent in their right mind take a child to a museum like this, we witnessed a child frantically looking for his parent, he did not speak English, I tried to get him to stay where he was out side the Rosetta stone exit where we had seen him frantically pushing through the crowds, but of no avail, not a  museum members in sight. However, once we managed to squeeze past the blockage in front of the Rosetta stone we enjoyed a quite nice visit to see the Elgin Marbles, I had a thought that maybe the some of bodies could be reunited with the heads in Athens, seems a pity that at least they could at least be reunited! We also visited the Persian exhibit, a very nice young guide took us to the area as it seemed to be in an obscure area.  Lunch was good, we were lucky to get a the last reservation at 12:30, after that time no reservations, a long lines.  However, many small eateries around the museum, you will not starve. Once again I notice wait staff and guides all foreign, all very pleasant, and with good command of the language, where are all the UK workers!"

"Written January 2, 2020",Great exoerience,Definitely a great museum. I particularly enjoyed the Greek antiquities ( I am Greek myself ) and the Babylonian sculptures. A bit crowded during the Christmas holidays had to wait in queue about 49 minutes. Recommended 
"Written December 12, 2019",Crammed with everything,"This was our Sunday walk when it was raining as we lived 10 minutes away.   How lucky was that? It's been renovated since I left England and it's on the visiting list every time I come over. Whatever your taste,  you'll find it very interesting. "

"Written December 11, 2019",Super,"Visited the museum in the past week with friends from out of town - they requested to see Egyptian Artefacts (including Mummies) and the BM was the first place I thought of. Still free (although requested donations of £10) the BM is a national treasure. Not only could we see Mummies as requested, but we also managed to see numerous other exhibitions. We all very much enjoyed the visit. "

"Written December 10, 2019",2018 Oct,Lots of stuff. Cozy and free. I enjoyed my time there when it was raining and cold outside. I thought rosetta stone was much bigger but you have to see it. It makes you wonder the reason the museum is free that they may feel guilty about taking some items and refuse to return them to the original country. 
"Written December 10, 2019",Definitely worth a visit while in London,"Very diverse collection and interesting temporary exhibitions. The entrance is for free, so this is also a great museum to visit with someone who might not have so much museum experience, to figure out if they like it. There is also a huge gift shop where you can buy nice gifts and books. "

We did and we truly loved it, we have explored many knowledge and history of Britain. And the area surroundings has a lot to offer: shops, restaurant, money exchange and etc. It is very closed to Tube Stations too. "
"Written December 7, 2019",Don't go on school trip day,"Loved the museum! But we came on school trip day and there was children everywhere. Running and racing and yelling... I like kids as much as anyone else but they made it very difficult to relax or view anything in piece. Plan accordingly. The British museum was a bucket list item for me, i really like ancient Egypt and also learning about the great explorer Belzoni. I was actually a little disappointed that i didn't see any mention of the great Belzoni anywhere. "
"Written December 6, 2019",total treasure trove,Almost too much and quite crowded at times but as a historical experience hard to match anywhere - worth planning the trip to avoid cultural indigestion and often good exhibitions (not free) current one on Troy well worth a visit - also shop has a great choice of books etc for all ages

"Written December 10, 2019",The Troy Experience,"At last this exhibition with artifacts on loan from other sources plunges you into the world of the lost city of Troy, its myths, legends, and realities. Walk among the gods and goddesses, in a dramatic atmosphere of statues, paintings and quotations. I was surprised by how relevant many of the quotations are for us today, especially those commenting of war and peace. The earlier you can visit the exhibition the better as it is extremely popular."
"Written December 6, 2019",An excellent museum,An excellent museum with an overview of British history and contemporary life. Good display and great museum building. I would definitely recommend a visit.
"Written December 5, 2019",Awesome,"Every time I come, one place I don’t forget BM.Something new each visit, so I have visit section wise to give more time to it.This time I saw the ancient Egypt and it was amazing, fascinating and I was spellbound."
"Written November 24, 2019",Outstanding and diverse collection,I’ve visited this museum many times over many years. Every visit has yielded new and interesting exhibits - and I have particularly enjoyed bringing my daughter with me on the most recent visits. We have spent 2 or 3 hours in the general exhibits using the excellent top 10 guide and just worked our way around the museum to find the highlights. We have also spoken to museum staff sitting at a desk and explain what some small items were used for in the ancient world.
"Written November 23, 2019",Troy: worth a miss,"We went to the ticketed Troy exhibition. It was dark, cramped and teeming with people. Most of the curation is out dated, waist height glass cases with annotation below. I spent the majority of my time unable to see any artefacts, trying not to bump into people. Expect very little truth as the section on archeological finds from the “real” troy is rather diminutive. Honestly, would have gained more knowledge, and had a more enjoyable afternoon at home with a book. Sad to say about a museum with so many exceptional items to offer."
"Written November 22, 2019",Fantastic Museum / Artifscts from all over the world ,"Before you decide to visit to museum, you need to accept the fact that you will visit it to admire all those galleries from all over the world, and not to determine whether the artifacts should be there or back to their home countries, nor to determine whether they were stolen etc.Having said that, the two must see sections are the Parthenon marbles and the Ancient Egypt sector with mummies. Really impressive sections. However, you may also admire artifacts from China, Japan, India, Mexico and other countries and all of the above with a free entrance.On the cons, I would really love a directed route because you enter the museum and you do not know where to start or in what way to start viewing the galleries. "
"Written November 21, 2019",Great afternoon out,Fab afternoon out at the British Museum. Was so much to do that we will need to go back again to do the 2nd floor! Recommend the Ancient Egypt section in particular
"Written November 20, 2019",World Class,"One of the best in the world. So many critically important artifacts, although questionable if they should truly be in British procession. Just ask any Greek if they believe the Marbles should be returned to Greece. That said, it's a must visit, the range of works is incredible."

"Written November 18, 2019",Fantastic museam,We visited to see the Egyptian mummies and artifacts. We also visited as much as we could walk around until our legs felt tired.We have made visits many times before and every time there is something new to see. Great for every age.
"Written November 18, 2019",Africa Room 25,While visiting London I set my sights on going to the British museum to see and show my companion the copper heads of the Yoruba tribe from Nigeria.  It was a must do and also a better understanding of the culture. We did not have to read much on what the sculptures of art were telling others. We were able to read through the messages of the different tribal work.  It was at times overwhelming and by the time we were done we we really did not want to see any other part of the museum. While the history was enlightening for us it really was a sad to see the messages told to us through this art work. The main message I received in most of them were that our African people had no idea what they had agreed upon once the trade of of a nation started happening. You could clearly see the aftermath of the message through their artwork.  God Bless the motherland.
"Written November 17, 2019","Visit, take your time and enjoy...it is worth it!!!","It has something for every member of the family and could be a great place for kids to learn!  This is a place to visit with time, if you are like us and want to be able to read everything and grasp it, my advise will be come early and try to set a plan prior to your visit.  There is no possibility to look at everything in detail in just one visit.  Make peace with that reality!!  This place needs a week to itself to walk and see everything.  The building itself is a beauty and the are  where it is located is booming with cafes and souvenirs shops.  Accessible via bus and tub, it is free, and you can decide if you book a tour (paying) or not.  There are two cafes and one restaurant, that we saw in inside the building."
"Written November 17, 2019",So many excellent exhibitions worth seeing!,"The British Museum has free entry and multiple floors of exhibitions. There is something for everyone. I really enjoyed the indigenous cultures exhibition, I learned something about the wonderful indigenous cultures through the world. The Captain Cook exhibition was also very informative. The gift shop had a great selection of books and gifts, if only my checked baggage limit could be increased."
"Written November 16, 2019",One of the WOnders of the Woerld,"This Musuem is one of the great museums of the world.  It is tough to explain it but in addition to the great Egypt collection, it also has Assyrian collections and other great world treasures"
"Written November 15, 2019",Sculptures and Artifacts from Yore,"The museum is huge and full of amazing art and artifacts from across the world. However, I did not get a whole lot out of it by reading the little write-ups. I would recommend going on a tour with a guide to truly appreciate the beauty and the offerings of the place. "
"Written November 28, 2019",holymoly much to see.,suggest following the recommended sites in the map first. then backtrack to other items.  the rosetta stone a big hit of course 
"Written November 28, 2019",Worth a visit,"This was the third time I came to London and finally I got the chance to see this Museum. It’s a big place so you have to spent more than half a day there if you want to see everything. We like the Egyptians mummies and the Chinese exhibits. Even if there are a lot of visitors, you won’t feel crowded. Definitely worth a visit and remember, it’s free. You pay only if you want to make a donation to the museum. "
"Written November 28, 2019",Must see but way too crowded during weekends,Just like Louvre this is a must-see but can't be done in one visit. The most important part is to not go there during weekends. And do prepare before going so you know what you want to see and where it is located.
"Written November 27, 2019",Overwhelming!,"This museum is huge! But they offer many tours, some free; the Highlights tour is great - our  guide was knowledgeable and interesting."

"Written November 25, 2019",Amazing,"Quite simply, my favourite place in all of London. In my early 20's I used to live nearby and felt so lucky to have something so remarkable closeby. Now, I live on the other site of the world, but whenever I am in London, this is always on the itinerary. There is just SO MUCH to see that there is truly something for everyone. One visit is not enough, nor is 2 or 3. 10 or 11 is more like it! My favourite area, Ancient Egypt. But the fun of the British Museum is wandering and exploring and taking it all in, room by room. Tip - go early to avoid the crowds, utilize the floor map and explore, explore, explore."
"Written November 25, 2019",Wonderful Cultural Experience for All Bes,"With it’s covered courtyard, multiple cafes, free admission and fine collections, the British Museum is a grand place to spend the day. We spent the majority of our time in the Clock and Timepiece rooms, as well as the exhibits that covered British history in the pre Roman, Roman and Viking eras. We learned so much, saw some amazing Viking treasures and really came away dazzled. One note, handicapped toilets are an issue - with loos that don’t require stairs being either very far off the main galleries or out of order. "
"Written November 24, 2019",Troy Exhibition - poorly presented,"I love the British Museum. The presentation of exhibits is second to none. It's the best museum in the world.  But the Troy Exhibition is so poorly presented, I'm really surprised.Too many exhibition cases are lined against walls so limits how many folk can view at a time. And it is busy. The initial linear placement of cases causes a blockage immediately once inside the exhibition room. The accompanying information plaques are uselessly displayed! A real amateur blunder in the curatoring. The information plaques are located at the bottom of exhibits. In small type... So unless you are standing right in front, you can't read them. Even when you manage to get to the front, your own shadow blocks them. The pots displayed in one of the end rooms, are against a black background. The lighting is such you cannot actually see inside the pots, unlike the lighting in the normal Greek galleries. Underwhelmed to say the least. Not recommended. Go and see the BM's normal Greek galleries, much better curated."
"Written November 24, 2019",A must to visit!,We had a little over an hour to fill in before another engagement and so visited the museum.  Wow!  Wish we had longer!  We did the recommended one hour trail self guided exhibition  which you can view on their website.  Simply amazing .  I need to go back!
"Written November 15, 2019",Beautiful museum with great art and culture,"Very recommended for a half day of history, art, culture and just a lot of fun.It has 5 floors of things to see.Not all floors where open when we were there, but there was still tons of things to see! "
"Written November 15, 2019",One of the best,"I host foreign students who come to London to improve their English and enjoy our culture. The British museum, along with Tower Bridge   is the number one attraction they all want to visit. Most find the fact that such a amazing museum is free unbelievable. Highlights.. The Egyptian statues, Elgin marbles, rosetta stone, Egyptian mummies.. All just fantastic. Usually there are hundreds of school kids on school trips here but usually they are well behaved although you do get the odd rowdy lot. Tip... Don't visit the tourist shops opposite the museum they are the most expensive in London. Much cheaper are ones near trafalgar Square or in Oxford Street. "
"Written November 14, 2019",Really interesting ,Great experience especially on a cold or rainy day. Some really interesting  displays including mummies from ancient Egypt and items from Ancient Greece.Admission is free (donations ) and all staff we encountered were really friendly.Easy to find your way around.

"Written November 13, 2019",Lovely museum,Definitely worth an afternoon to explore. One of those museums that can be a little bit hard to navigate but one of those ones which is fun to get lost in. Well detailed and very informative
"Written November 12, 2019","Thin, expensive and limited Islamic exhibition","To charge £14 for a poor exhibition smacks of poor marketing judgement. The current Islamic exhibition is small, rather cramped, and short of top quality artefacts. The Museum's own Islamic collection is better, more diverse and free!The BM teamed up with Malaysia's Islamic museum, but the theme was Islamic art and influence of the Ottoman empire and the ""midd;e East"" and also some passing reference to Orientalism. So where were the great French paintings of the most renowned ""Orientalists"". Not here,for sure. The great Italian paintings of the Ottomans? One! Silk? A few handbags.Seemingly nothing from Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Cairo or the Gulf states collections. Not worth the money, and poorly attended."
"Written October 27, 2019",Nice museum,"A lot to do in this museum, it’s really big! Spent about 1 hr, but really you need more time if you want to completely see everything. Free entrance. Museum staff was friendly and helpful."
"Written October 26, 2019",So many fantastic sights to see and so little time to see it all.,"If you think you can see this entire collection in one day, you do it a grave injustice and your feet a hard day.   Take some time to plan your visit before embarking upon it, if you want to see the Elgin Marbles make that your first stop, then pick the other sites that you really want to see.   If you have additional days to spare, then go back and see the collections that you might otherwise have over looked.   The Greek and Roman sections are fantastic and will keep your attention with the variety of relics and the informative placards will enlighten you.   The Egyptian collection is a special place and is majestic in the size and elegance of the statues and everyday things that have a beauty beyond description.   Take your time, this place is crowded, but it is one of the places you must take the time to see when you are in London."
"Written October 26, 2019",A must do in London,there is so much to see in the BM - one morning or afternoon is just not enough! Next time we will try to combine with lunch or afternoon tea! We will be back !

"Written October 25, 2019","ANOTHER Unpleasant, Unexpected Experience - Beware!","The matter described here duplicates the events I described in a review of October 2018. Part one of our annual visit to London for a birthday celebration involves an afternoon at the British Museum. Last year I described how visitors are being pressured into giving a donation and the upset it caused. Well, as it was the same this year, I must assume the abuse is systematic and institutional. On both occasions, after passing through the security search, my wife was DIRECTED to go to one of the desks and make a donation. Let me repeat what I said in October 2018: entry to the museum is free and such pressure should not be being applied, especially by the sour faced girl who glared at me after I came to my wife’s assistance. This year I went to the Information desk and asked to see a customer service manager. An extremely professional discussion followed where it was agreed that the events as described should not have taken place. Crucially for this post, I was encouraged to make a complaint in writing to such a forum as this because senior management would otherwise take no notice. I have (generously) given money to the museum over many decades but pressure applied to so many people unfamiliar with this magnificent place must surely do it nothing but harm."
"Written October 24, 2019",Lots to see in a quick visit.,"Having only about an hour and a half at the museum, we first went to the major highlights (Rosetta Stone, Easter Island Statue, The Pantheon Sculptures), then wandered to see the other exhibits.The museum is very well laid out, so it's easy to get from one exhibit to another without having to backtrack."
"Written October 23, 2019",Rosetta Stone,"Wow, seeing the Rosetta Stone as you walk in is truly amazing.It is hard to believe how important it was in deciphering Egyptian writingsTo us the next impressive exhibits were the Elgin marbles that were removed from Athens.There must be some controversy with the Greeks since it was the Turks that gave permission to remove them.You can spend countless hours walking the halls and it will help if you explore the website and try to narrow down the exhibits you have a particular interest in seeing"
"Written October 23, 2019",British Museum,"My daughter and I enjoyed the beautiful British Museum with its expansive ceiling and design. It houses many artifacts of interest and I suppose it is good they are in one place. However, I side on the part of the countries, specifically Greece, who have requested the stripped artifacts from the Parthenon and other buildings at the Acropolis be returned to Greece. With that mindset, it was difficult for me to admire Elgin's Marbles and other items of great Greek importance. However, the overall experience of the Museum and what it offers viewers is a good one. We finished off our visit with an afternoon tea in the museum restaurant up at the top near the expansive ceiling - that was a nice experience!"
"Written October 23, 2019",Plan ahead for best results,"This mighty, huge Museum contains so much that if you just go in without at least a rudimentary idea of what you would like to see, you will get 'gallery fatigue'.  Do a bit of research online and pick things that are of special interest to you.  A great place to visit if the weather isn't good for outdoor exploring.  The gift shops have a great deal of diverse and quality items."

"Written November 1, 2019",Not all exhibits are sensitive to other cultures and their needs,"As an Indian, when I last visited, I was appalled by the way that several ways in which statues of importance to my culture, such as the statue of Hindu gods, were displayed in a way that does not honour how we see them or respect that a religion is not an exhibit, It means something to those who practise it and this blatant placing of such holy statues in a museum was not respectful of my views. We see statues of god as being as holy as our gods in their physical incarnations. I am sure that others may have felt the same way as my family members agreed. I think some of the things there should be revised and returned to the countries they came from to be honoured and respected dutifully."

Last week I went to the special ticketed exhibition on how Islam affected Western Art, which was an interesting expose of often fanciful and imaginative responses by western European artists to Islamic art, architecture and domesticity. A very early Dutch map was a highlight!Another day last week I focused by going to the (free) exhibition upstairs of wonderful cultural art associated with Horiji Temple in Nara, Japan. This was particularly interesting, and had magnificent historical pieces of Buddhist art.  It was accompanied with excellent wall label descriptions and explanations of some depth to help appreciation.The museum was very crowded on the lower levels on that wet Saturday, and was also mid term break, but by going to an upper floor display, I was able to escape the crowds below, and focus on a particularly excellent presentation.There were also a lot of families with children, which was lovely to see how the children were absorbed by what they saw.The bookshop has a great selection of reading- of varying depths- so it's a great place to pick up interesting publications for all ages and enquiring minds."

There’s so much here to see from all over the world, the highlights being the Rosetta Stone (which had a huge crowd around it as soon as the museum opened so go early!), the Easter Island Statue, the Egyptian mummies and the Parthenon Sculptures/Elgin Marbles. There was a pamphlet discussing the debate on whether these artefacts should stay in the museum or be returned to where they were from, which was interesting.It does get very busy as you’d expect so go as soon as it opens."
"Written November 7, 2019",One of my favorite places!,"This is truly one of my favorite places on the planet.  Most of the museum is FREE, though they do have donation boxes around (which you should do anyway).  The special exhibits have a ticket charge, but they are well worth it.

Free entry which is awesome but the security line is SO long at peak times. Architecture of the building is amazing. Well set out museum and the Egyptian section is incredible. The Rosetta Stone is a highlight too."
"Written November 4, 2019",History,"I absolutely love the place massive building feels like never ending ,,,,,,,collective items from all over the world"
"Written November 4, 2019",Fantastic,"Really good museum, so much to see you could spend days there. Lots of amazing big rooms with high ceilings, very grand. You can see why it's one if the most visited places in London. Definitely a must-do!"
"Written November 3, 2019",A wonderful place,If you come in London you have to visit it. You can find most important artworks. It's amazing to see Stele di Rosetta or real Rapa Nui. You can walk in the history from ancient age to modern time. We took audio guide for exploring better all artworks that are there. A fantastic experience. 
"Written November 3, 2019",Fantastic visit with 11 year old son.,"We had a fabulous day exploring this wonderful museum. Before visiting I had done a bit of online research of artefacts we would like to see, which I recommend you do before visitng.   I also discovered that you can hire an interactive family guide for £6.   On arrival we queued up and hired the family guide and bought a map. The family guide was brilliant, we were able to get round most rooms and focus on a few key pieces rather than wandering around aimlessly and becoming overwhelmed. My son really enjoyed the game aspect of the family guide, as it allows you to compete with other family members and score points. I highly recommend hiring a family guide if visiting with children over 7yrs.We spent almost 3hrs here and my son came away with a new appreciation for history and had a wonderful time."
"Written November 2, 2019",A must see when in London,"We love the British museum for its display of artifacts from all over the world. Although we struggle with the reality that the British took these relics from their ""colonies"" we do enjoy visiting all the mummies in particular. They are fascinating, especially if you have not been to Egypt. All their exhibits are well done, well displayed in an inviting, vast and beautiful building that was recently remodeled to include an interior cafe, bookstore with a glass cover over the courtyard inside. Sadly we are so old we were here before that courtyard was covered but the building remains iconic and beautiful!  Their bookstore is always worth a visit too!"
"Written November 2, 2019",Mummies and the Rosetta Stone!,Heavy on the Greek and Egyptian theme displays but well worth a visit.  Don’t bring a bag and your quene will be much shorter.
"Written October 23, 2019",One of the best museums in London,"Definitely my favourite when it comes to London museums. Great space, breathtaking exhibitions. Definitely worth 2-3 hours of your time."
"Written October 22, 2019",Beautiful building and exhibits Service lacking / signage poor,"If you’ve read my other reviews of multiple restaurants / venues you’ll see I’m resoundingly positive . Though the museum is stunning as a building and as a place of awe and education today the service and signage was lacking . I came with a colleague after work about 415pm having had an act of Parliament passed for our shifts to coincide and for her child care arrangements . We walked up the security check in and the mans desk and aisle  on the other side of the railing was clear so I went to himAs my side was occupied. He sent me backAnd then invited someone else from further back in my queue . Having worked with the public for 38 years I didn’t find this big funny or clever and briefly politely told him so . We entered the building to see the Islamic art exhibition , saw the poster for it and walked up a big staircase to be told we couldn’t buy tickets there , went down to an information desk and got a smarty pants reply when we asked for tickets and were then directed to a ticket office tucked away . We were then told that it was£14 each and it was closing in an hour so we declined as we needed more than an hour . Very poor signage .we came in through the main entrance and to a blank wall facing  us. At this point we then wandered around the regular exhibits . English is my first language , I pity people for whom it is not"
"Written October 22, 2019",Too crowded to enjoy,"We looked forward to this so much and expected it to be one of the highlights of our visit. We even stayed nearby because we planned to spend a lot of time there. We were only able to spend two half days there though because of the crowds. The second day we left by early afternoon because it was so hot with so many people that I felt lightheaded. Mind you, I live in Texas, and I'm used to high temps! Overall, it was pretty disappointing. "
"Written October 21, 2019",Free!,"Deserves a repeat visit. History buffs heaven. We only visited a few exhibits (Egyptian, Japan, Americas) and would like to come back for more."
"Written October 21, 2019",Wow,I was put off by the queue out onto the street when we first arrived but thankfully it moved very quickly. The building itself is beautiful and there were so many amazing exhibits. Our favourite was the Egyptian section. The mummies were fantastic! There's so much to see you could spend all day here. 
"Written October 20, 2019",In awe,"Wow! I was in awe wandering through the British Museum. I would definitely recommend the audio tours, they guide you around on different exhibit tours, multiple are doable in a day. Lunch was a bit expensive there but considering entrance is free you are definitely winning!"
"Written October 20, 2019",Needed more time,Visited this place with my best buddy. Entrance was free of charge and everything was great. I guess that we needed to plan more time for this museum because we just ran into it for one and a half hours. 
"Written October 19, 2019",A whole lot of museum,"If world history is your thing then this is the place for you. Very much geared up for the adult as a pose to the family this museum has historical pieces from China, Egypt through to the Roman Empire. The mummies in the Egyptian section were particularly fascinating. The place is massive and if you enjoy reading all the info you are going to need a few hours. If you have a family and young kids this isn’t the place for you. "
"Written October 19, 2019",Bucket List!,"The British Museum's collections offer something for everyone. Top exhibits for me included the the Rosetta Stone, Phoenician and Egyptian collections and the Lewis Chessmen. Allow for a few hours to a full day to see all the wonders that this cultural gem has to offer."
"Written October 18, 2019",Plan ahead...there's too much!,"It's free, but leave a donation.Grab a color map or guide for a few pounds, or inside they have black and white copies for free.Most people go immediately left to see the Rosetta Stone and big Egyption and Syrian staues.I like to head to the old british and european exhibits.Look for hands on spots where you can hold thousands of year old hand axes and such."
"Written October 29, 2019","So many, many things to see (and then they hustle for donations)","Wonderful museum stuffed to the brim with interesting things to see, that you cannot possibly finish even within a day. When we visited on a weekday, the Egyptian exhibition rooms with the mummies were chock full of people, leaving the other areas much more empty and enjoyable to explore, like the fascinating Roman section. One caveat - there was a row of young museum staff literally hustling for donations when you first enter the museum, which was fascinatingly tacky for such an institution. I mean, these enthusiastic folks were literally shouting at people to donate, and saying passive aggressive things like, ""That should be the way!"" when someone came forward. I didn't see this in any other museum we visited during our UK trip. At any rate, donation boxes were everywhere within the British Museum, and we were more than happy to drop in the suggested 5 pounds each before we left (without being coerced). If the British Museum decided to charge that amount, I'm sure people would willingly pay to see such world-class exhibits."
"Written October 29, 2019",Absolutely amazing ,"Unbelievable beautiful. The history, the artifacts, the building itself. If you go to London this is a MUST SEE. "
"Written October 29, 2019",Lots to see and take in,"I have been several times to this museum and always forget how much is inside, the outside is wonderful with the pillared entrance and then you come across the Rosetta Stone. Each gallery has amazing artifacts, and you spend far longer looking than you'd think, personally it needs more than one visit to do it justice. If you don't have a lot of time, then you must visit the Egyptian rooms and the Elgin Marbles are must sees. There are places to eat and several gift outlets.There is always a special exhibition on so check the website. Not too much in ""the hands on"" mode for children, but interesting all the same. The queue to get in is usually long from the word go, so be prepared."
"Written October 29, 2019",Don’t miss this one,"Great day at the British Museum! Antiquities from all over the world. If you’re in London, don’t miss this gem."
"Written October 29, 2019",So beautiful.. But ,So many things to see in the museum but so many people in the mummy's part. The others parts are Interesting too but with less people so you  have time to enjoy your visit
"Written October 28, 2019",Brit,Really a lot of things to see and a lot of walking. Excellent! This Museum has a lot to offer. You need a lot of time to explore everything and you won't be sorry
"Written October 28, 2019",Finest Archaeological and History Museum in the World,"The British Museum is probably the finest, most comprehensive and extensive museum of the history of not just Britain but humanity located anywhere in the world. The collections are immense and enable the visitor to gain a really perspective into the evolution of both society and civilisation from the earliest man right up to the end of the classical period from all continents of the world. My 13 year old, who wants to be an archaeologist when he grows up, was absolutely in raptures and could have spent a few days taking everything in. My younger 2 children, however, were somewhat overwhelmed by both the crowds and the sheer volume of exhibits so my advice to anyone who has younger children that are likely to tire after a couple of hours, have a plan around the key artefacts and exhibits that they will be interested in such as the Egyptian Mummies or the Acropolis Freeze/Elgin marbles and focus on these!"
"Written October 27, 2019",World class,So much to see.  I took self audio tour and did top 10 must see.  That was 2 hours and didn't even see a quarter of exhibits.  
"Written October 27, 2019",Great museum,Top notch museum. I wanted to see the Cyrus cylinder as it is housed here. Lots of things for young and old.
"Written October 27, 2019",Perfect,British Museum is whitout any doubt a must in London. I love the African part (apart from the Roman and the greek one).
"Written October 17, 2019","Amazing, but way too big","The museum is free, very interesting, but waaay too big for one day. I recon you should go here every day for a week to see all of the interesting things and not just run around quickly. :) "
"Written October 16, 2019",Amazing and free,Very impressive ancient Roman and Greek artifacts.  You don't have to be a museum buff to like it here.  The building itself is magnificent. It is also free.
"Written October 16, 2019",We had a great highlight tour. Highly recommend it,My husband and I chanced upon the British Museum. We reserved the highlight tour and were very pleased. The British Museum is fantastic and can be overwhelming without a guide. We signed up for the tour on their website. Our guide was knowledgeable and a great storyteller. So glad we visited and will go back.
"Written October 16, 2019",A must see in london!,"It s so huge that you may need more than one day to see it all, but it s beautiful. It s been my second time here and i ve not been disappointed.A must see in london!"
"Written October 16, 2019",This place has EVERYTHING,"I mean, really, everything.  The Rosetta Stone. Allow a full day to visit this museum.  They have items that arguably should be returned to the country of origin but they argue that they are caretakers for the artifacts and they use state of the art science to preserve and display the items from around the world.  Whatever your area of interest, you will find the best of the best here.  Do a bit of research before you go so that you don’t miss what you really want to see.  Hint, back door has shorter lines for entrance but it’s long walk.  "
"Written October 15, 2019",Too much to see,Too much to see. Too much people in bad weather. I felt like staff doesnot care too much. Be prepared for queue at entrance and security check of bags.
"Written October 15, 2019",So much to see!,"There is just so much to see at the British Museum that one day would not be enough so pick a few special themes you want to see and make that your main focus. I chose the Egyptian rooms. It was fascinating and a bit creepy looking at the mummies.Went on an October weekday and it was crowded with tourists and school children, but don't let that deter you."
"Written October 15, 2019",Simply astounding!!,"Having visited this absolutely incredible ""Museum of, and, for the World"" semi-regularly since 1971, I am still ""gobsmacked"" by its collection of 8+ million objects, covering about 2 million years.  One might think that many visits allow one to cover the 907,000 ft 2 (or, about 19 acres)- containing the many exhibits.  What is also amazing is that the ""price of admission"" has not risen over this period... and, is still FREE!  There is nothing like it anywhere... and, in order to appreciate it, I suggest focusing on a subject that is of greatest interest... and then asking the information folks where this could be found!  If one chooses not to pay it a visit... the visit to London will be ""shortchanges""!  It has also received TripAdvisor's most coveted ""Traveller's Choice"" designation (based on the reviews and ""feedback"" from travelers like you and I). I hope that this Review has been helpful."
"Written October 14, 2019",A treasure trove,"Feeling a little daunted by the overwhelming collection/exhibits, we opted to book a highlights tour of the museum. Highly recommended as we saw some key pieces (including the Rosetta stone and the Elgin Marbles), learned a lot and felt uplifted rather than exhausted at the end. The guide was informative and paced the tour well, catering for the different needs of the group."
"Written October 14, 2019",a culural and historical gem,"being very interested in egyptology, for me the british museum is a must and i go there whenever i have a chance. there are not many places in the world with such a high level seletion of impotant artifacts"
"Written November 12, 2019",Interesting but ...,"Went to the museum yesterday.We came  in at the side entrance,unfortunately we could not hang our large coats up as there was a cloak area for members only.Excellent aboriginal display,lots of wonderful art explored through the exhibition .We also went to see the Islamic exhibition,a bit cramped and the glare from the lighting made it difficult to see some of the pictures on display.An interesting exhibition nonetheless."
"Written November 11, 2019",How do you review the British Museum?,"The collection is first-rate: as noted in many reviews, the Egyptian artifacts are especially impressive. I always find the African collection, though small, to be the most interesting part of the museum. We recently saw the Islamic Art Influencing the West Exhibit. The catalog for the exhibit is a bit thin and superficial,  but the exhibit itself is well laid out. If you bother to read the captions, then you'll get the historical context necessary to understand the exhibit. The British Museum overall, however, needs to work on exhibiting its collection in a less ramshackle way. Its presentation is antiquated. The museum if free - except for special exhibits - and famous, hence the crowds. But for discerning travelers, the museum is a bit tedious"
"Written November 11, 2019",Trip,Mostly good and enjoyed the exhibits we was unable to explore upstairs as some of the lifts where out of order needs more lifts and more areas for children to explore maybe interactive loved the ceiling and visited the day after Halloween so loved the ceiling decorations 
"Written November 11, 2019",Great experience!,The museum is free and you can enjoy lots of free tours! You can learn a lot about the history of the world!
"Written November 11, 2019",Great Museum,"I have been to the British Museum countless times. It never gets old and there are amazing exhibitions all tear round. Every time friends from abroad visit me in London, I always suggest they spend some time among the Egyptian Mummies or the Roman ruins, at this spectacular establishment.One aspect I would change though, is crowd management. I would allocate slots through the day, in order to limit the number of visitors at any one time. Some people are rude and inconsiderate and would physically push you out of the way, in order to get the perfect selfie near the Cleopatra Sarcophagus or the Rapa Nui Moai.Please visit but maybe try to go during the week, definitely not on a weekend!"
"Written November 9, 2019",Hours of fascinating exhibits and history,"This is must-see. We recommend the audio guide even if English is your first language. It's helpful when you approach exhibits to hear and learn a bit more than what is available to read. Take your time, wear comfortable shoes, and learn as much as you can. We especially enjoyed the ancient near east exhibits."
"Written November 9, 2019",Visit,"Was not happy having to be put in a queue then made to feel crap been asked to make a contribution, I am a British  tax payer who no doubt  have paid  a hell of a lot into the system.  The tourists  should pay  like I have to in other countries."
"Written November 9, 2019",Must Visit,"This is a ""must visit"" in London.  Incredible location and you can't see it all unless you stay for the day.  Be ready to fight the annoying, picture-taking crowds around the popular displays. But it's worth it!"
"Written November 8, 2019",Enthralling visit,Private tour of the Chinese section of the British MuseumIt was fun getting into the museum an hour before the weekend hordes arrive. We were treated to a tour of the highlights of the Chinese section of the museum. I had been to this gallery before bu the guide we had made it much more interesting and informative. There some real treasures there but the best is the 3D type video of a Chinese scroll painting - enthralling.
"Written November 7, 2019",One of the world's very best museums,"Accumulating centuries of conquests and donations of private collections, the British museum is an astounding repository of human artifacts. Far too extensive to complete in one day, you need multiple visits to start to embrace the enormity of its collection. At any one time, only a small fraction of its total collection is on exhibit, so you need to visit on multiple occasions and return frequently to take in all the magnificent items on exhibit. It has multiple cafes, restaurants and resting places, as well as great gift shops for the wearly."
"Written October 14, 2019",Rewarding Visit,"Huge building that store many exhibits.  Need more than a day to view more! Was there to attend the special exhibit on ""how the Muslim word influenced western arts"""
"Written October 14, 2019",A must-see,"You just can't miss this.  There's some area that will appeal to you, no matter what your interests, and the treasures stored here -- away from the turmoil of the world - are mind-blowing.  The collections of remote antiquity can only be compared to those at the Louvre."
"Written October 14, 2019",Brilliant exhibition- very poor organisation -especially with reduced access,"Travelled from Yorkshire to London to see the Kathe Kolwicz exhibition - which was great.  We knew not to bring bags to the BM but were directed into the long queue for security. When we got to the end of the queue, 20 minutes later, we were just waved through. The exhibition is on the fourth floor- but no lifts were working. The only toilets were in the basement. Very poor that the most well resourced museum in the uk couldn’t get the basics right on the day we visited."
"Written October 13, 2019",What a great museum,"It is not too big, but is packed of ancient history. We were really impressed with the content of the museum. A lot of pieces from Greece, Rome, Babylon, among other areas conserved almost perfectly."
"Written October 13, 2019",The place to go for a day of learning,We landed in London early and because we were unable to check into our hotel we decided to spend the day at the museum.  It was a great choice.  An amazing collection and something for everyone.  The only thing I would say is do not go on a weekend.  We went on'a Sunday and it was a mob scene.  I could not get over how many people were touching the objects - that was not pleasant to see.  Staff tried to keep them off but the lack of awareness of the value and fragility of the objects was disappointing.
"Written October 13, 2019",Lots of artifacts taken during British expeditions,"The museums collection is impressive.  Many ancient world treasures in 1 location, most acquired over the course of England's imperial history.  They now have signs saying it is better for the artifacts to remain in England and could never be safely returned.  Would the other countries agree?"
"Written October 13, 2019",Great museum,"We visited on a rainy day, worth noting - the queue is long and your exposed to the elements. Families with children can go ahead in a separate shorter queue.We decided to go around the museum in a clockwise direction. This starts you off with the architectural based sections such as ancient Egypt. There is an awful lot of sculptures and architectural elements, bare with it, there's plenty more to the museum.The museum has numerous restaurants and cafes. The pizzeria is small, so don't count on being able to eat there.We had a great time and got tired before we completed the museum, so we rusheda bit. We'll definitely be back to take everything in."
"Written October 12, 2019",Great range of artefacts from europe and beyond,The British museum has an incredible range of artifacts and objects from all over the world arranged according to the period they originated from and the country or region. It is a fabulous way to get an idea of how civilisation progressed through history. It would take several days to see everything they have here so perhaps read up on what interests you and plan your visit accordingly.
"Written October 12, 2019",One of the very best,"I love Egyptian history, the British museum didn’t disappoint. It was truly larger than expected and I could have done two days there...  I did it the day before the V&A, it was slightly better while both are greats.  Also... free is a bonus!"
"Written October 12, 2019",A great day out,"The British Museum was fantastic.  There is so so much to see there that we couldn't take it all in.   Loved the Egyptian room, The North Americas, the various private collections"
"Written October 12, 2019",...AND IT’S FREE!,"This amazing place is the jewel in the crown of London museums, possibly the best museum in all the world!  If you only have one day to visit (this London visit for us) then you have to be strategic in planning your time there.  You can spend days here and not see it all.   We focused on 2 areas we had not seen for many years: the original rooms - the oldest collections- and the Sutton Ho exhibit.  We also took in the African collection which is stunning.  And did I mention that, like many London museums, the entry fee to The British Museum is FREE! "
"Written October 12, 2019",Too crowded,"A lot to see, but the lower level was crammed full of so many people we had problems moving.  I see timed tickets in the future."
"Written October 11, 2019",Great place,Love this place. Wish i have more to time to explore. Artifacts were so nice. The only museum that I’ve enjoyed so far (haven’t been to a lot though 😂)

"Written October 10, 2019",BRITISH MUSEUM IN THE GUTTER,"It’s been atleast 10 years since I have been to the BM and I thought it would be a lovely idea to visit and look at England’s / Britain’s history from Mediaeval to the Stone Age.   There’s a lot here that’s wonderful but I have had such an appalling experience I thought I should warn others who may come here.By the way it’s definitely worth a visit infact more than one as you won’t do it in one hit. Despite a beautifully designed modern structure inside the Georgian neoclassical building, the Museum collection on display is really still a hang over from the days of Empire and full of things rich aristocrats plundered from other countries .....some of course like the Egyptian Collection is rivalled only by Cairo Museum and the Louvre but frankly you would think the British Museum would be primarily celebrating well Britain and us The British.  If you want this you have to go to level 3.  It’s not signposted.  Nor is it signposted from the nearest Tube Tottenham Court Road.  On arrival you are forced to go through a ridiculous zig zag chicane like at an airport only much worse as there about 40 Barriers.  Then you are bagged checked and have to go through a ticket office style arrangement despite the fact the Museum and our heritage is supposed to be free.  I feel strongly about this as an historian and yes I know there are Govt underfunding but I don’t then expect a mouthful of abuse from a young female guard for not paying. I then had to empty out all my luggage and put in two separate containers as they said my bag was too big ...Really why it was an overnight bag surely they can cope with these they charge enough to mind them for an hour.  The East European woman in the bookshop snatched my money. Many new toilets were out of order but the worst thing of all is when I actually got to L3 to see English history ad archaeology there was nothing beyond 80 bc. It literally stops at the Bronze Age with a few Neolithic hand axes on display.  What about our amazing Mesolithic finds and even Palaeolithic instead you get another exhibition about some poor country we have plundered which is totally incongruous.  Also there is Sutton Hoo, the Milden Hoard, why can’t they build a replica of a Iron Age roundhouse or a Viking Longhouse  for people to go into.  Often when you to a Museum like Lewis there is a sign saying the BM have taken most of the best exhibits and left reproductions well why are they not on display.  Too many signs saying removed for study.  Well replace them then with something else.  The lighting is also poor. Coupled with noisy disinterested guards and boisterous and giggling school children who were not being kept in check by teacher and extirpate cafe prices otherwise excellent.   Cmon we can do better inBritain than this."
"Written October 10, 2019",A fabulous place,Each time I visit the Museum it has new experiences to offer in every department. I am always blown away by the range and quality of permanent exhibits and the wonder of the special exhibitions. It never ceases to amaze me at the level of craftsmanship of all Mankind dating back thousands of years and fills me with hope that the ingenuity of our species will prevail for solutions to present and future problems.

"Written October 7, 2019",Unbelievable Treasure Trove,My husband and I visited the museum in early September.  It's hard to believe that this is free considering the quantity and quality of treasures it holds!  Plan to spend at least a couple days here...and still you won't see everything!  Not to be missed while in London!
"Written October 7, 2019",3 day vacation in London ,This is a must visit when in London. Pick a rainy day and stay for a long time. The entrance is free. Audio device is 5£. We did not get any since they ran out of devices. The Egyptian and Persian section was fascinating. Particularly the Cyrus cylinder the king of Persian empire the first human rights declaration and replicas of Persepolis walls. If you are a museum buff half a day is the minimum time. 
"Written October 7, 2019",Fantastic!  Wish we'd had more time!,"We were here for 4 hours and it was not nearly enough.  Would loved to have had the time to come back another day, didn't even make it to a quarter of the museum.  The exhibits were fascinating.   I'm sure you could do it faster, but, if you like going at your own pace and reading and wandering about, set aside a good chunk of time.  Great stuff. "
"Written October 7, 2019",Treasure haul of empire,If you can get past the obvious issues with items of great cultural import having been taken from across the globe .. Could easily spend a day here and be left feeling you had just scratched the surface. Planning your trip ahead of time to make best use of your time is recommended.
"Written October 6, 2019",Fascinating,"It’s obviously the British Museum. What a wonderful opportunity to see such sights from antiquity. So many things to see. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit and spent most of our time looking at pieces from Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia and Egypt. "
"Written October 6, 2019",Wow!,"An amazing museum with tons of stuff to see.We used a guide which was a two-hour tour and hit some of the high points.

"Written October 5, 2019",Outstanding,"The British Museum lived up to its stellar reputation.   Simply an unbelievable collection in an outstanding facility.   We went on the early morning tour, which really helped in getting set up for our visit.    A must see in London."
"Written October 3, 2019",London's Treasure,"There are so many treasures to appreciate at the British Museum! The exhibits were well displayed and the narratives informative. We enjoyed our exploration of the museum and would recommend it to other visitors. Don't let the surly attitude of the cashiers at the gift shop and food services put you off. You're here for the exhibits, not the service providers."
"Written October 3, 2019",So much to see!,We spent 3 hours here before becoming ‘museum blind’. Free to enter so you could return several times if you lived near enough. Beautifully presented artefacts. The mummies were exceptional.

"Written September 27, 2019","So much to see, too many people","This is my third visit here and I really enjoyed catching up with some of the exhibits I hadn’t had time to discover on earlier visits. Great presentation but slightly spoiled by large, noisy school groups but good to see young ones appreciating history. Still a must go to place when in London."
"Written September 27, 2019","Brilliant, Myriad & Infinite collection","So how does one review a museum -	That goes on and on and on with myriad and infinite collection-	That has collection of things that are thousands and thousands of years old – from mummies to bath tubs-	That has brilliant display techniques in terms of placement, lighting, anecdotes, et al-	That is brilliantly organized among plethora of sections across different floors-	That has huge central area with natural light, book stores and café and what not-	That is totally free, 7 days a week (from 10am to 5.30pm including Sundays)- especially when most attractions in UK cost a fortune. -	That can take up to a day or more to see everything that is on offer -	That is brilliant place to teach your kids a thing or two.Must visit place in London – especially with kids. Take some time to go there – may be 3-4 hours."
"Written September 26, 2019",Awesome!,"Wonderful museum! I think this is my third favorite museum, after Louvre and New York Met. If you really enjoy a place like this then better be ready to spend some hours here, there is so much to see! Lots of details, information, and why not? Adventure and a feeling of nostalgia and wonder just by seeing how great this world and its people are! So much worth the visit! Enjoy!"
"Written September 26, 2019",Always a crowd pleaser,"It's a great place. Certainly draws the crowds, well it is the British Museum! Stunning exhibitions.But, there are London museums that provide better signage. "
"Written September 26, 2019",Incredible History!,"I did not really know what this tour was about, but it was on the London Pass so we went.  Wow, how cool was this place!  We were able to see the Royal Jewels and to hear an amazing tour by one of the Beef Eaters.  This is an important piece of British History and is a beautiful place as well.  Make sure to walk along the Thames River and get some shots of the Tower Bridge!"
"Written September 26, 2019",So much to see!,"The British Museum is an extensive collection. There is so much to see, we could have spent all day here from open to close in order to see it all, but we had to keep it shorter than that due to our other plans. It is laid out well, with lots of room to maneuver through the exhibits. That was good, because it was very busy. I enjoyed this museum a lot and would definitely return to explore it further when I have another chance."
"Written September 30, 2019",Great museum staff very helpful ,Even though there were huge crowds today the museum really caters for them. Plenty of things to see. We just didn’t have long enough so only saw the clocks special themed rooms and the mummies. I felt sick and Sunday (name) a security guard was very helpful. 
"Written September 30, 2019",Private tour recommended,"We took a private 2 1/2 hour tour because the museum is huge with thousands of artifacts.  The guide was extremely knowledeable, friendly and took us directly to the exhibits we wanted to see the most and then some that were very interesting as well."
"Written September 30, 2019",Full day trip,"We went there for couple of hours as we were using London Hip Hop bus tour so we had to cover other attractions hence could not visit the entire museum. I must say this is a full day trip, lot to see and lot of information to go through.Do not use Hip Hop bus tours to come here, you will not have enough time to visit other attractions."
"Written September 30, 2019",intersting Museum,The british museum is one of the biggest museum in term of the collaection that represents different history and cultures all over the world. the ancient egypt section is really interested with mummies. the section of watches and how it was developed in early ages also worth the visit.
"Written September 29, 2019",Outstanding ,"Huge variety of treasures from all over the world! Great for all, including kids!Especially liked the Greek and Egyptian areas."
"Written September 29, 2019",Great museum limit your visit,Went 1&1/2 hours before closing and limited ourselves to Greek exhibits. There was plenty to view including a massive room of stuff from the Parthenon. If you try to do it all in one visit it would be too much. Oh yes also saw the Rosetta Stone 
"Written September 29, 2019",Museum and architecture,Booth the building and the exibitions are worth a visit. Interesting and impressive. Take a photo og the beautiful ceiling. 
"Written September 29, 2019",Great,"There always seemed to be a small crowd around the Rosetta Stone, but someone with patience can eventually get right in front of it."
"Written September 29, 2019",Aweome,I thought this was going to be boring and not interesting but it was anything but.  It was super interesting and very informative.  I recommend doing one of the public tours they offer.  This is a must do while you are in London.
"Written September 29, 2019",Massive museum,"Incredibly large museum with extensive selection of exhibits - the Egyptian being the most popular / impressive in my opinion. Because of the crowds it's a little less enjoyable than other museums (running kids, jammed hallways) - but I suppose this is testament to it's success. The museum shop had a remarkably thoughtful collection of books as well."
"Written October 9, 2019",Excellent museum,"Went to this museum because my son wanted to see the mummies...he had been reading about them...We wandered for a while through the museum after not waiting very long in line, and were mesmerized by all artifacts we saw.My son also loved it, especially the mummies and the big Egyptian statues. We as adults loved it as well, moreover since muses are free from admission in the UK which is great in itself!"
"Written October 9, 2019",MESMERIZING ANYWHERE YOU GO,"We were blown away by the experience of wandering these amazing galleries. We split up so we could absorb exhibits without distraction, then met for lunch and revisited our favorites. Five transformative hours; could have spent at least another day there. Great people watching as well. "
"Written October 9, 2019",British museum,"For me was OK,  not to my taste, but if you like bits of history , Egyptian artifacts and the like, you’ll enjoy it."
"Written October 9, 2019",IF YOU ONLY HAVE TIME FOR ONE SIGHT,"This museum is well worth the day we spent there, and we could have stayed another day or two to see it all.  Had a private guide whe made the place come alive!  "
"Written October 9, 2019",One of the world's greatest museums.,Not to be missed.  The only drawback is that it could take you years to really explore all the wonderful collections.  I have visited many times over the years and still haven't seen it all.
"Written October 9, 2019",AMAZING,I was impressed with the museum. Worth to visit well organised and very informative. A perfect place to spend a few hours.
"Written October 8, 2019",Outstanding museum,Suggest getting there at the opening as the crowds later in the day are overwhelming.  So many artifacts to see.  Suggest purchasing the audio guide and review the floor plan for the location of certain exhibits prior to visiting so that you can design a plan to see those that are most interesting. 
"Written October 8, 2019",WOW,"I have visited London many times, and have been to several museums, but never to the British Museum until my last trip here. All I can say is WOW and AMAZING! London has some incredible museums and art galleries, but as of now, I think this may be my favorite. I was further being stupid in not spending enough time here, but that is a mistake for which I will not make again on my next visit. This is an absolutely incredible museum. "
"Written October 8, 2019",去不了埃及來這也行,如果你喜歡古文明，探索那些古物。這裡絕對是你會喜歡的地方當你靠近一點，感受他們歷史的痕跡時候。會有感動的想落淚的情緒Welcome to explore at here. Inspire ur emotion 
"Written October 7, 2019",Great museum,"The second obligated aim of our London tour was visiting of The British museum. We were most interested in seeing of Greek and Roman collection of  art work and main thing to see Egyptian collection. Earlier we saw Egyptian collections in Metropolitan (New York), Louvre (Paris), National Gallery (Сairo).  Each of them was amazing and splendid but we expected that London collection will be the best.   Unfortunately we can not say it now. Yes, the London collection of Egyptian artefacts is   great but other Egyptian collections are no worse, and in some ways even superior to it.Collection of Greek reliefs, sculptures and vasas is super."
"Written October 3, 2019",Amazing but allow a lot of time or make several visits.,This place is so large and has so much that we know we will need to go back next time we visit London because we barely scratched the surface.
"Written October 3, 2019",One day here is not enough!,Here are so many items and artefacts to see that a one day visit is not enough to explore them all. It's a wonderful place to go to admire 6.000 years of human history (both good and bad things!) Note that the queue to get inside can be a very long wait... We had Afternoon Tea after our tour: A very pleasant experience (we had ordered beforehand).
"Written October 2, 2019","I have mixed feelings about all of the antiquities that England ""saved"" from ancient cultures  ....","We tried to go to the museum at 10am on Saturday and the lines of people at the front and rear entrances would have literally been a 3+ hour wait. We gave up. But we returned to the museum on Tuesday, which was our last full day in the city. At 5pm we waited in line a few minutes, rather than several hours.It is impossible to see everything in this vast museum in a single visit. The 70 galleries are organized by geography, history, and theme. The amount of ancient artifacts they have from Egypt, Syria, Greece, and Asia is mind boggling."
"Written October 2, 2019","Good museum, not the best",British Museum is a huge facility with several exhibitions but some rooms are hard to get in or to stay when crowded. So we choose to visit those ones with a high ceiling or with fewer people. But it's worth to be visited if you already were in the other main museums in London.
"Written October 2, 2019",Must!,"Beautiful museum! The museum contains some of the coolest collections such as pieces of the Parthenon. Also, the best thing for you to do is either spend the whole day here with snacks or research what you want to see. The Egyptian section of the museum is world renown and it contains ancient artifacts that you would not normally see, ever!"
"Written October 1, 2019",Spectacular Museum,"Beautiful museum with fantastic artifacts (yes, most were stolen LOL).  Need one full day or a couple of days to fully explore.  Must sees:  Rosetta Stone, Easter Island Statue, Parthenon Reliefs among many others."
"Written October 1, 2019",What a cool visit,Visited with grown son who is a history buff.   Enjoyed the displays.  Saw things we didn’t know existed and things we had only seen in books.   Cafe wonderful.  The only complaint we had is that we didn’t to have enough time to see everything.  This will be on our must see for the next trip.  
"Written October 1, 2019",So much to see!!!,This museum is great for history geeks like myself. Free entrance but there is a line to check bags. The map has a section for “20 must see items” if you have less than 2hrs to visit. Give yourself a good 3.00 hrs (and a break) as there is plenty to see. There are free guided tours every hour (check for language and area/rooms)
"Written October 1, 2019",Cant Go Wrong,Everything for everybody. African display was new from last time we visited and was worth the visit.
"Written September 30, 2019",Tour de Force World History,"Walking through the British Museum is akin to taking a well-choreographed trip through history.  The Brits certainly pillaged and plundered during their Pax Britannica and you’ll find it all right here.  In retrospect, one can hotly debate the ethical considerations of all that transpired during that time period, but many of these items potentially could have been destroyed or pillaged by others and the world public would never even have had the opportunity to glimpse these treasures of human creation.  The British Museum is a must-visit for anyone passing through London as the quality and vastness of the items on display offer a rare and comprehensive summation of human, architectural, and cultural activity from antiquity to the near past.  There are so many amazing artifacts from every part of the world to marvel at, it really brings our past into beautiful perspective.  To do the collection justice, several visits are necessary.  But keep in mind that every time you make the journey inside, you’re certain to find new and incredibly interesting gems.  And the frosting on the cake?  It’s all free!"
"Written September 19, 2019",Must Do,"This is a must do when in London. Make a day of the British Museum, VA Museum over the road. Easy access by Tube "
"Written September 18, 2019",All sorts of Stuff ,"I’d loved another heap of hours, possibly a whole day to search out so much more than the snippet I saw. Wow. There is so much ancient history we do not have in Oz as we’re such a young country. "
"Written September 18, 2019",An interesting journey,The museum is very big and it is difficult for someone to see it in one day but it is worthing the time. There is a huge variety of exhibits from different ancient and current civilizations all over the world. It is amazing and worth seeing! 
"Written September 17, 2019",Must See for any Visit to London,"There is so much to see here that it can be overwhelming. Best taken in small chunks with timeouts to recharge your mind. Whatever time period interests you, there will be something to hold your attention."
"Written September 17, 2019",History for Free,"There are tons of historical and interesting items on display at the British Museum, and it's FREE! On the downside, there are very few restrooms on the upper floors."
"Written September 17, 2019",Amazing collection,Great museum . It undoubtedly will have something that will interest you.Beautiful building and location.Surrounded by nice restaurants and pubs.
"Written September 16, 2019",Lots to see at the museum. ,Too much to see in one day. So go back as often as you like it's free.... My fiance wanted to see Egypt exhibit so we spent about 2 hours just looking at that . 
"Written September 16, 2019",Museum,A comprehensive museum with an overview of many different epochs. They need to revise some of the content from the colonial art to reflect the great damage colonialism inflected in indigenous communities.
"Written September 16, 2019",Totally Worth the see!,"A lot in a short period of time. It was long days but so worth it. I crammed a lot into my 4-days in London. In my short stay I was able to see Buckingham Palace, Coca Cola Eye, Madame Tussaud's, The Tower of London, London Bridge, Stonehenge and the British Museum. I only missed a few things on my list so of course I will be planning a London 2.0 and adding some Scotland days in there as well. The British Museum which of course I totally recommend if you have the time and love really old history. It’s a great museum with so much to see and you have small cafes and the great convenience of clean bathrooms. All of the places that I saw above had clean bathrooms which is great to know when planning your journey around London. Here are just a few samplings of my little adventure thru London."
"Written September 16, 2019","So much to see, so little time","Wow! Wow! Wow.What an amazing place. One can easily spend a whole day meandering through the different exhibits.With artefacts from different parts of the world and from different time periods, the exhibits provides clues on how people lived and interestingly enough, what happens when they die.For me, the highlight was the Egyptian and Mayan exhibits. You can take a break in your adventures thru time at the excellent cafe which serves delectable cakes and tea and coffee.Admission to the British Museum is free. Highly recommended for your visit to London."
"Written September 23, 2019",A must see,"This museum is enormous and filled with so much to take in. You could spend an entire day here, so definitely set aside a few hours. The exhibits are wonderful and informative. Seeing the Rosetta Stone was incredible, and the replica there that you can get close to and touch is a nice touch. The exhibits for the Parthenon and such were incredible. "
"Written September 23, 2019",All encompassing.,"Loved it,every aspect of history under one massive roof contained in floor after floor. I saw people with wheelchairs so thats also a plus thats its easily accessible for them. Entry was very quick even though it was a busy Sunday. I would add that more staff could have been visible as a just in case more questions needed to be answered. Clean and cool atmosphere and if course very well stocked. Souvenir section was quite cute."
"Written September 23, 2019",Great to see it all again after 40 years,"I visited the Bristish Museum back in the late 1970's and was overwhelmed by how vast a collection they had. It does indeed take days to absorb it all, and coming back to the exhibits I saw before, and the new additions was well worth the visti. While the first day we were there it was very busy, with lots of visitors, the 2nd day was quieter and I could get to the exhibits I really wanted to catch without difficulty. It is a fabulous facility to see a wide range of history and prehistory."
"Written September 22, 2019",Something for everyone!,There is some thing in this museum for everyone. You will see something new or unexpected around every corner. We really enjoyed it! We wish we could have spent more time.
"Written September 22, 2019",Three hours was not enough,"After three hours, I thought I had seen everything but after I left, my son informed that I missed several important objects, including the Flood Tablet. Ugh! I went at 2pm on a Sunday and had to wait in line to get in. The museum closes at 5:30pm, except on Friday they stay open later. There was quite a crowd but not overwhelmingly so. Much more organized and pleasant than The Met in NYC. I enjoyed seeing the Rosetta Stone, The Royal Game of Ur, and the Astrolabe. Plenty of shopping with very nice trinkets and gifts. I will return again!"
"Written September 22, 2019",Must see,"One of the most beautiful museums I've ever been to. It's free, organized and clean. The Egyptian and Greek collections are impressive. "
"Written September 22, 2019",Amazing Throughout.,This place is a must see. We were amazed with everything. We could have spent a week in here but only had a few hours.
"Written September 22, 2019",British Museum visit,"My visit to the British Museum was to see the Rosetta Stone.  I was not disappointed!  Due to limited time available, I saw the highlights that were outlined in the official brochure.  The Assyrian Lion Hunt display was brilliant and I would say be sure to spend time looking at this remarkable piece of art work.  Highly recommend this museum."
"Written September 22, 2019",Make a day of it,"We spent the day in London and decided to come here. We left our bags in the cloakroom, the charge was dependant on weight - is this a London thing??? It cost £7.50 for two bags.  There were lots of visitors present but as the building is so large no area was crowded.  The building was very clean. There are some sections that are free and others where there is a charge. We visited the areas without charge including the Egyptian mummies which was extremely fascinating. The shop we visited had a wide range of unique products including jewellery, crystals and soft furnishing. It was like an exhibition itself. I really feel you could spend the whole day here which is what we will do in the future. "
"Written September 21, 2019",Must visit ,It's very nice and historical but it is very crowded and noisy. Not very comfortable for people on the spectrum There should be some sort of wall isolation to fix that issue 
"Written September 13, 2019",See the highlights in the best museum in the world?,I didn't have much time so this is what I advise if you're in the same situation. Buy the £2 map which has the top 10 items to see in 1 hour! This will not only ensure you see the Rosetta stone and the Elgin marbles but will ensure you go all over the museum to get a taste of what is there so you can spend longer next time. Really you could be there for a week and not see it all! Be aware you have to queue for security. Good places to eat everywhere and a fabulous shop. Enjoy!! 
"Written September 12, 2019",Amazing artifacts,An absolutely stunning array of items from so many cultures and history. The preservation of items that would have been destroyed in their original location allows all to enjoy the beauty of ancient civilizations.
"Written September 11, 2019",Just OK.,"Like the Smithsonian museums in the US, you can only take so much.  Maybe an audio  or tour guide would have made it more interesting."
"Written September 11, 2019",Amazing place!,One of the best place to visit in London! You need two days to see everything! Love it! Lovely Japanese section !
"Written September 11, 2019",Overwhelming selection of treasures!,"I visited on a Sunday afternoon with a limited time frame.I managed to get through the Top 10 things to see, but it took me 2 hours rather than the 1 hour identified on the map, as I got distracted by other treasures, as well as by admiring the space in which they were housed. The only exhibit that was rather crowded was the Rosetta Stone, but that is to be expected, I suppose. Would love to go back when I have more time!"
"Written September 11, 2019",Good way to spend the day,"My husband and I went in and had coffee at the Court Cafe before we did any sightseeing and then separated to see our chosen sections. I spend a lot of time in the Egyptian section and he went to the Sutton Hoo exhibit. We returned to the Court Cafe for lunch. At either the coffee stop or the lunch stop we got a ticket for free coffee. So, after some more visits to exhibits, including the Rosetta Stone, we went back for our free coffee and had dessert with the coffee. "
"Written September 11, 2019",Wonderful Museum!,Wonderful museum and interesting artifacts. Did not have the chance to visit the museum on a previous trip and was so glad that we did on this trip. Something foreveryone to enjoy!
"Written September 11, 2019",One of the best world wide,"This is a real jewel, probably one of the best museums in the world. It is huge and overly crowded, as it is free. The exhibits are organized by civilizations and are very well selected. The British fid take back a lot of objects from their colonies, that is not a happy thought.. A part of it is actually saved this way, to be fair. "
"Written September 11, 2019",Intense but manageable,"Our hotel near Bloomsbury square was a 5 minute walk, and we arrived  30 minutes before opening time and experienced no lines. Inside, the signage was very helpful, and we found the galleries we wanted to visit easily. The exhibits were awe inspiring, some times at a grander than life scale. We specifically enjoyed Ancient Greece and Egypt, and early European. In fact, after, I went to a small antique store and bought an authentic silver ring from 1200 AD, a Knight Templar momentum that I know I’ll treasure. We didn’t take the audio tour, because each piece was thoroughly described in writing. But we did take the time to read some of the explanations, and learnt a lot. It’s not a giant museum like the Louvre, so it was manageable. And it’s free. By the time we left, at 11am, the crowds began to stream in. So, go early.  "
"Written September 10, 2019",Wonderful,"My wife and adult son had a wonderful time viewing the exhibits, we wish we had more time. It is impossible to see everything in one visit. We are planning our return visit, the museum is huge, but well mapped out. We greatly appreciated the African and Egyptian exhibits, so much history."
"Written September 26, 2019",Bible tour,"Incredible artifacts that take you back in time . Well worth a visit, even if you are not a history lover."
"Written September 26, 2019",Treasures of the world ,It was amazing to see so many fabulous displays. I particularly liked the European and Egyptian displays. I hope they return the Rosetta Stone one day. 
"Written September 25, 2019",World class but way too hard to manage,"This is one of the world's great museums.  One cannot give it a rating less than 5 stars.  So as a museum, 5 STARS.  But it is a real pain to get anything done there.  We visited in September 2019.  It was not terribly crowded but when people think they should take minutes doing a video on an inanimate object, one after another, it becomes way too hard to see anything.  We watched people walking around, up and down stairs, with their phone video going.  They ran into each other and it made the experience way too complicated.  We will go back but never during a time close to tourist season."
"Written September 25, 2019",Fascinating and Carefully Curated,"Spectacular! Many pieces, but the experience is not overwhelming. Well-curated so that each piece still feels special. I would like to have taken a guide or tour. Exhibits close well before the designated closing time, so come early! (We messed up but still loved it!)Improved disabled access would be appreciated. "
"Written September 24, 2019",Award presentation,"An amazing place lots to see and do, we were attending an awards presentation with a small buffet afterwards. The staff were very attentive and the walk around the exhibits afterward was mind blowing. I highly recommend a visit !"
"Written September 24, 2019",Fascinating! ,"I love the fact most museums in the uk are free with the option of donations which we kindly did. The museum was still quite busy (11am on a weekday morning in term time) and the electric fans were most welcoming as it was very warm in places however there was still plenty to see. It was a bit of a pain having to carry coats and bags around but I wasn’t prepared to pay the £11.50 it would have cost my partner and I to put these into the coat check. Still, the cafe we ate at was clean and tidy and the food and drinks were delicious. Not really a place for children though despite the number of school parties around. Some of them looked quite bored! "
"Written September 24, 2019",Very interesting ,The only problem is that it would take many many visits to really see things properly. We limited ourselves to one area. Very highly recommended 
"Written September 23, 2019",The whole world in one building!,It was amazing and everything you come to expect. The entrance is stunning and then when you get inside the sleek modern look theta then spreads into the historic parts of the building with all the exhibits is amazing!!Everyone needs to do this.
"Written September 23, 2019",Too Many people,"I had visited the British Museum in 1981 and was excited to share this experience with my husband, daughter and son-in-law.  It was a total bust.  There was no way to stop and look at anything or read about the exhibits as the crush of people was out of hand.  t was so disappointing as I love Egyptology and loved what I had seen in 1981 and even though the exhibit seemed much larger it was impossible to do anything other tan cruise by.  Until something is done to limit the numbers this is a no-go spot for me"
"Written September 23, 2019",You could spend days at the British Museum,"This museum holds treasures. It would take days to review each exhibit and really appreciate the piece of history it represents. The displays are beautifully done. We had to go on a Sunday, so it was busy, but we still saw everything we wanted. Such a fantastic museum. Allow plenty of time if you like to listen, look, read and learn. Enjoy!"
"Written September 16, 2019",Well worth a visit,"Had a fantastic time at the museum, so much to see and so little time.  There was a very big queue, the security guard t9ld us they have opened a back door entrance, 4 min walk, no queue and straight in.  It’s mind blowing the amount of artefacts held here, so interesting.  It was very busy when we went, around 2pm, maybe head there early to avoid the masses.  Well worth a visit,  we would recommend this."
"Written September 15, 2019",Free and amazing ,"I have been here many times with my kids, it’s amazing and largely free. London is great for offering free museums; I’m not sure the rest of the word appreciates who amazing it is. There is so much to do here and to see. Go see it "
"Written September 15, 2019",Late family summer trip,"Ok, this is a lot of fun and lots to see.  The Egyptian floor was most important to us as was the Rosetta Stone.  There is enough to see in this museum though, that it would truly take you at least a day to do.  Plan accordingly.  Also, dress ready for hot rooms.  The A/C is non-existent."
"Written September 15, 2019",Awesome,"If you enjoy museums, this one is fantastic. So much to see, it was difficult to pack it into one day. The Ancient Egypt section was fascinating, as were the exhibits on Ancient Rome. Many truly mind boggling, overwhelming artefacts to check out. Well worth a visit. Personal highlight was Lindow Man."

"Written September 14, 2019",At least a 2-day trip,"We went there in a low season, mid September, the crowd was not too bad.  1.  The audio guide, I asked staff there, they whispered it was not necessary if you buy the guide book.  I found the description there with the exhibit explains well.  2.  The place was massive, i do suggest you research a effective route for yourself and priortorize your specific interest.  3. I spent 1.5 day there, I felt like i can spend more time there.  2-day may be necessary.4.  Many restaurants are nearby, you can go in & out.  Have lunch out there. No regret.  One of the places to visit for a lifetime.  "
"Written September 14, 2019",Loot from my country on display here,"I am impressed by the fabulous collection of sculptures from my country here. But I want to know why are these treasures displayed in a British Museum? Why have they not returned these items to the former colonies who are the rightful inheritors of these items. I am sure Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Syrians, Iraqis etc etc feel the same way"
"Written September 14, 2019",An absolute must see.,"This wonderful collection takes hours to appreciate.  I was thrilled to stand next to the Rosetta Stone.  Too many fabulous things to take in on one visit.  And, allow plenty of time or you'll miss so much."
"Written September 13, 2019",So much to see!,"Because of the British empire, so many different cultures are represented - and some that were not part of the British empire.  Parthenon exhibit particularly interesting as is the Rosetta Stone."

"Written September 20, 2019",Impressive Collection,"Housed vast collection of artefacts collected during the British Empire. I was particularly drawn to the Greek, Roman & Egypt collection. I was also surprised to see a Pompeii section. The internal circular architecture is impressive. "
"Written September 20, 2019",Don't miss this,"We traveled in early September, after the summer rush and before college students arrived in London, so there were no lines and it wasn't over crowded. We spent about 3-1/2 hours there, but you could spend days. It is one of the world's big 4 museums. Don't miss this if you're in London."
"Written September 20, 2019",british museum,"The Rosetta Stone is displayed here, and it was incredible to see the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, Demotic script, and Greek script, something I learned about in middle school. We only had an hour here, so we visited the Greek Parthenon exhibit, and also saw Japanese samurai armor and the Royal Game of Ur. My sister stumbled across exhibits of the Tower of Babel and the Easter Island moai, which I was so bummed I missed."
"Written September 20, 2019",Need to visit!,Please reserve all day to discover most wonderful pieces of art from ancient Mesoptamia till today. I need to revisit because I haven't got enough tome to see it all. Must see!
"Written September 20, 2019","It's the British Museum, for heaven's sake!","This is one of those places that you need to visit again and again. The treasures (no matter what you think of the acquisition methods) are spectacular.We hit the highlights tour, but found ourselves distracted by the wealth of treasures.Go! They ask only for a donation!"
"Written September 20, 2019",Great Exhibits and a Great Exeprience,"We went early on a weekday morning. The security line was not too long and it went pretty smoothly. I was taking my Dad, and wanted to see the objects suggested for a 3 hour visit in the Museum website. Though the room numbers were given, it was pretty difficult to locate the objects in the room. A map with location in the room would be helpful. The crowd in front of the Rosetta Stone was huge, but the other objects were easily viewable. Overall, a great experince."
"Written September 20, 2019",it's big...,"Had the chance to walk around for 1,5 hours after my business visit.Impressive, the huge Greek, Assyrian and Roman arefacts they present. I thought he rooms about early Britain were nice too. Entrance is free, but you are asked for a contribution quite stern... 5 pounds is ok"
"Written September 20, 2019",Amazing!!!!,It’s huge and simply amazing Incredible collection A day is simply not enough Interesting temporary exhibitions as wellVery nice reasonably priced restaurant upstairs Don’t miss it!!!5/5
"Written September 20, 2019",Great manga exhibit,"Liked the special exhibits, they were big and well curated. I loved the. A game Exhibit. Their permanent collection of Egyptian artifacts and caskets is really something. I wish the pricing for exhibits could be combined or was lower. It can get very high if you don’t have special tickets. "
"Written September 7, 2019",Huge,What a huge place. So interesting for history buffs. It covers such a various part of history its amazing. Overwhelming. I would advise to go twice and divide the time because it can be a lot to take in especially for teens. Don't miss it. 
"Written September 7, 2019",Wonderful ,An amazing place.  We took an Egypt introduction tour and were not disappointed.  Very interesting for the whole family 
"Written September 7, 2019",Great tour that gave the highlights,"The British Museum has huge collections, which while wondering could be overwhelming especially for people with limited time. Our guide, Becky,did a terrific job giving us a high level overview of the history of the museum and then took us through the highlights. Becky was enthusiastic and resourceful. At the end of the tour, we felt that time just flew by and we learned so much. Thank you for a truly wonderful experience, Becky!"
"Written September 7, 2019",Beautiful museum,"Beautiful museum! When we first arrived on the premises, we were quite shocked at how long the line extended outside. Although it looked daunting, the line moved very quickly and we were in the museum in no time. In addition, because the museum is so massive, it wasn't too crowded"
"Written September 7, 2019",Where Are We,Great and interesting exhibits if you can find your way around. Mapping unclear and difficult to understand 
"Written September 7, 2019",History for days,I went on a solo trip to the museum and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I did like the fact that there were chairs you could carry around with you inside the museum. Food was obviously a little bit more pricier but that was expected. The toilets were clean especially since there were multiple tour buses of visitors that came in all at once. There were heaps of tourists but that was expected given that it is Summer holidays. I enjoyed the history and being able to see all of the wonders the ancient world had to offer 
"Written September 6, 2019",What an awesome museum!,My sister and I visited the British Museum while visiting London. The admission is free but they do take donations. We strolled around for an hour or two. My favorite exhibit (and probably the most famous) was the Rosetta Stone. There is a security check point that takes maybe 20 minutes to get through. I am sure this varies by the day and time. 
"Written September 6, 2019",Wonderful museum,This was spectacular museum! We hardly saw any of it. Would like to return for more. There were traveling exhibits as well as permanent. 
"Written September 6, 2019",The museum,Well organized. Nothing to say about Neive points. Don't miss the Rosetta stone and the pantheon area.
"Written September 6, 2019",Great miseum,"Free admission is unbelievable. Great collection with cafes, shops and sitting areas if you’re tired."
"Written September 5, 2019","Doorway to human history, art and culture!","Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely sourced during the era of the British EmpireThe Museum holds the largest collection of Egyptian objects outside Egypt. Highlights include the Rosetta Stone, a 5,000 year old sand-dried mummy, wall paintings from Nebamun’s tomb and sculptures of Ramesses II."
"Written September 4, 2019",Amazing!,So many things to see at the museum and so little time. I enjoyed looking through the different expositions and learning about their history.
"Written September 4, 2019",British Pride.,This is pride for British people. Every British should visit this place once in their life. Highly recommend.
"Written September 4, 2019",Breath taking,"The huge space, the main hull  and the big variety of both permanent and temporary exhibition makes you loosing time and continue to wonder around  "
"Written September 4, 2019",World Wide artifacts of different eras,"This museum is very big, so give yourself time probabbly 5 to 6 hours going at a good pace. It has different shops, coffee shops, restaurants and bathrooms through out the building. Sundays is free entrance and you find lots of tourists and locals incoming from the time the museum opens. Very well put with permanent and itinerant exhibits."
"Written September 4, 2019",One of the Best Museums,"The British Museum is one of the best museums I've visited. It is huge so plan no less than half a day so that you don't rush. There is simply a lot to take in. If you're visiting during the high tourist season, go as early in the day as you can to avoid as much of the crowd as you can. Ideally go after the summer season, although I understand there are still crowds, just not as overwhelming. The Museum is on our list when we go back. "
"Written September 4, 2019",Could spend all day here,There was a line for bag check but moves fast.  There so much to see I didn't cover it all in 3hrs.  I ate there & had an English Tea.  It was good plus as others said I considered it a donation since its free to see unless you want give 5 pound donation but I say save your money and eat there.  I didn't get a map but I should have gotten one because I wonder thru the same areas several times.   I some how missed the center of museum but enjoyed it alot.  Go see it
"Written September 4, 2019",Absolutely amazing,"The British Museum is huge. I didn't have time to look round everything. There was a Roman section with statues of Roman Emperors, an Egyptian section, all different sections from different times in history. The antique jewellry was amazing. The building itself is an arcitectural masterpiece."
"Written September 4, 2019","AMAZING, do not miss!!!",Anyone even remotely interested in history should check it out! I mean it’s free! You could spend days here looking at all the artifacts. I would very highly recommend checking it out and spend as much time as you feel compelled to!
"Written September 4, 2019",All this and it's FREE! Don't miss it.,"What an amazing collection of artifacts from almost every part of the world spanning almost all of time. You could spend days here and still not really take it all in.Everything is very well laid out and displayed with great detail, the write ups have a good amount of info without going into too much detail. It's just incredible how much is here, there truly is something for everyone. Though the circumstances of the appropriation of many things is questionable we are lucky that they did as much wouldn't have survived back where they came from and that it is all provided without an entry fee makes the history attainable to anyone who wants to see it."
"Written August 28, 2019",So much to see,This is an amazing museum. Free to enter (they would like a small donation) so a cheap day out. You need to plan what you want to see as there just so many exhibits too review. Something for everyone regardless of age. Recommended
"Written August 27, 2019",best museum in London,"I  enjoyed going to this place, I am planning  to visit this place again during  my few days vacation  in London "
"Written August 27, 2019",Exquisite!,This is the type of museum that you need a month to see everything. My main focus due to time constraints was the Egyptiania and it did not disappoint!   A truly glorious exhibit!
"Written August 27, 2019",Great family activity,"We did the British museum as our first excursion in London.  It didn’t disappoint.  It was very busy but there was a special queue for families with young children in prams.  There was also a superb children’s Centre with great changing facilities, lockers and a picnic area.  There wasn’t a baby feeding area but theChildren’s Centre was quiet and spacious enough to allow for this.The museum is also host to enough attractions for a wide audience of children ranging from teenagers to toddlers.Really well laid out to handle crowds and great for all ages."
"Written August 27, 2019",Always worth visiting ,"This incredible museum has so much to offer, that you simply need to keep going back.Best tackled by subject matter, so that you are not overwhelmed. Wonderfully presented displays of artefacts from around the world. There is something for everyone.Worth fitting in on a visit to London."
"Written August 26, 2019",Classical Antiquities,"For those interested in archaeology, the British Museum will not disappoint. Here, there are the classical antiquities of that of Egypt and the ancient Near East as well as that of ancient Greece and Rome. There are also displays of indigenous civilizations from other parts of the world. This is a five-story building which has a varied souvenir shop and a small restaurant. This museum could rival that of the Pergamon Museum in Berlin and a half to full-day tour here would be recommended for groups of people."
"Written August 26, 2019",Much too hot on a hot day,"We came to see The Rosetta Stone and the sides of the Parthenon. It has amazing artifacts, I must say. But amazingly it is not Air Conditioned!!! It was an amazing facility but it became an endurance contest to see how long you could last in the stifling heat, madeWorse By lack of air movement."
"Written August 26, 2019",Popular place,"We got there 10 minutes before opening, so had a coffee. 10 minutes later a huge queue. But it moves fast. Museum itself is fascinating and lots of very helpful staff. We needed a wheelchair - free and easy to grab. Signage not brilliant so great having staff everywhere. Exhibits fantastic of course. But two hours brain not coping any more. Nice snacks available - on a hot day iced chocolate was wonderful."
"Written August 25, 2019",A must see museum in London,"This is an amazing museum....its a must see even if you have a short stay in London. There was a long line when we got there on Sunday about noon.However the line moved fast...took us half hour to get in. First thing we did is get the museum guide. We then headed to the the Egypt section on 1st level. We saw the Rosetta stone, wrrtten in 3 languages about year 300BC. This is a stone has writings in three languages, hieroglyphics, ancient Egyptian, modern Egyptian and Greek. This stone writings allowed scientists decipher hieroglyphics. We saw the mummies, African, Ethiopian art and artifacts.Probably the best collection of artifacts and antiquities in the world.I highly recommend this museum if you're in London.It will be worth it if you rent the head phones which explain each of the artifacts."
"Written August 25, 2019",Stunning! ,Amazing building and loved looking around. The exhibitions were really good and fantastic value well worth the donation. A Must visit! 
"Written September 1, 2019",World class museum,"Free admission to a hugely impressive building with fabulous roof to the Great Court.  With so much to see, August is definitely a month to avoid as its incredibly busy, but worth it.  Must sees include the rosetta stone, parthenon marbles, lewis chessmen, the Rothschild bequests and the egyptian mummies."
"Written August 31, 2019",Great visit,"This place is huge and has so much history from mummies to the Rosetta Stone. It offers so much as each one of our kids had something on their list they wanted to see there. We didn’t have the whole day to spend there, but will have to go back next time we’re in London. "
"Written August 31, 2019",Whole world under one roof!,architecture from outside is impressive enough but inside much better. The representative photo is where you stay at entry. There were a lot of historical pieces also from Anatolia (Turkey) and Persia which of course interested me most. Also ancient Egypt was impressive. What i didn't like was there were too much restaurants inside and the open kitchen created a lot of smell. This can be solved in better way I think.
"Written August 31, 2019",Amazing,"I tried to visit the British Museum at least every other trip to London. Their standing exhibits are nothing short of extraordinary and  rival just about every other antiquities exhibit.  In terms of their ancient Egypt collections I have only seen one other better than this.....I recommend everyone visit the Egyptian museum in Turin, Italy."
"Written August 30, 2019",It´s good but London has better to offer,"Don´t get me wrong, this museum has the best collection of historic artefacts from around the world, but for me it feels like it´s too big and too crowded,"
"Written August 30, 2019",A place for History seekers,"There are a variety of things to see here, from Egyptian tombs to Greek artefacts and from Indian pillars to Roman sculptures. I would not suggest this if you have a young kid as our little was bored but the adults in our group enjoyed. There was something for everyone."
"Written August 30, 2019",Very Nice,"Very Nice and Big museum with restaurants and souvenir shops to cafes.Lastly, the museum had a lot of greek and egyptian"
"Written August 29, 2019",Worth the wait!,"Where else can you see so many of our collective cultures in one place? Amazing artifacts from all cultures. Arrive early and try for a weekday to avoid the queue, but go anyway if you cannot."
"Written August 29, 2019",The Best,#1 place to visit in London. So much to see we ran out of time and will make a poiunt of visiting again next time
"Written August 28, 2019",Worth the line-up,"Great museum with historic pieces on display. Sutton Hoo treasure & Pattern welded crucible steel sword found in the boat burial is an unbelievable item considering the steel technology used to make sword wasn’t known in Britain again until 1800’s. The Rosetta Stone, Lewis Chessmen & Fine Artworks make it worth the wait in a queue that stretches out the entry gate & down the footpath outside."
"Written September 9, 2019",Too much to see,"The place has a lot of exhibits and huge too. We went there late in the day to avoid the crowd. It's good because there's no wait but ran out of time to see more. Since the admission is free, can always go back."
"Written September 9, 2019",Private tour of The British Museum,The British Museum is amazing!  Our guide showed us 10 - 12 less frequently viewed exhibits over two hours.Also managed to view the Rosetta stone in passing.Definitely inspired to go back.
"Written September 9, 2019",Holiday ,The interior was nice. An impressive collection.  It's free and worth the visit!  Make sure to set aside a few hours. 
"Written September 9, 2019",British Museum,One of the best places we visited.  Had artifacts from all over the world including mummy's.  Went in the early morning before it got crowded.  There is alot of history there.
"Written September 9, 2019","Wonderful place to go and free, my very favourite price!",I went on a Bible tour where we followed the ancient Assyrians and their drama.  We were a group of around 20 from England Ireland and Holland ages from in the pushchair to over 60.

After a brief lunch break we were exposed to early European eras that included the Viking and Saxon presence in early England, Scotland and Ireland with a finale in South America where Axtec and Inca periods were briefly visited.  Our guide was well spoken Irish Archeologist - well worth the long day...(made our PM Pub Visit all the more appreciated!"
"Written August 22, 2019",Interesting Museum,"We spend half a day there and be prepared to walk and walk and walk. Best of all, it is free entrance and seek donation if you wish to contribute. Worth while going for it. Be warn of the crowd. "
"Written August 22, 2019",great museum but a bit too crowded,"The British museum is a must see, be prepared for the crowds and heat. While this wasn't our first visit to the museum, it was our shortest. We unfortunately picked a busy summer afternoon, it was really too hot and crowded to enjoy much. We visited the Egyptian collection and then left. ( excellent collection)"
"Written August 22, 2019",Day out on a saturday in high season,"The bad:No soap or soap dispensers in restaurant toilets!!! It is not clearly visible that visitors can make a donation using card (instead of cash) at the information desk - donations are key to keep this marvellous museum going!The good:Everything else. Wow. What an amazing museum - this was a brilliant day out, a privelege. Restaurant food drink and service also very good."
"Written August 21, 2019",Not enough time!,"There are not enough hours in the day, in several days, to really do this justice. I've heard stories from UK residents who've gone 20-30 times and still not managed it all. So, I had hoped to see a temporary exhibit but since we weren't sure what time we'd arrive, I hadn't booked ahead - BAD MOVE! By the time we arrived it had been sold out for the remainder of the day: Learn from my mistake! Clearly, we planned badly and had only 2.5 hours to spend before needing to be elsewhere. Can I just say that it took almost 45 minutes to get through the entry line, and then we had 1.75 hours and barely managed to get through 2 exhibits on the ground floor! And at a quick-march... Oh, but what we did see! I could have spent hours just in a single exhibit, reading every little placard, absorbing the coins, and the pottery, and the jewelry, and the stone works, and statues, and... the list goes on and on.If you have the time, dedicate at least two days just to this museum (it's free) and do your homework so you can go directly to those exhibits you most want to see."
"Written August 21, 2019",Superb & free!,"Worth a good donation though. We didn't do this place justice in 3 hours & think we didn't even get through one wing of the building.Will return soon to continue the epic. If you think of something you are interested in, you can find it here."
"Written August 20, 2019",Amazing,"This museum houses an amazing collection of artefacts from Egyptian, Roman, Greek, Anglo Saxon, Viking, and later times, all for free. The Sutton Hoo collection is a must see! Security to get in involves a bag search and can involve queues, but well worth it once inside. If possible, avoid toilets near the main entrance. They are heavily used, with consequent queues and smell issues. There are plenty of others on different floors. Café is decent but quite pricey, although as all profits go straight back into the museum, I didn't mind that. "
"Written August 20, 2019",Great times,"Amazing museum, very helpful service. Offered my kids and myself a great exposure on cultures of the world."
"Written August 19, 2019",Too Busy,Went here on Friday(16th)Was very very busy and too hot.We literally went into the anatomy area and dinosaurs and then left.
"Written September 9, 2019",Allow lots of time.,"An excellent place to visit.  I wish we had had more time.  One could spend days here. We did a quick walkthrough the Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Assyrian and Ancient Greece is exhibits. Quite interesting. "
"Written September 8, 2019",Very Busy,"Busy, bustling museum with plenty to see.Might be best to plan ahead and decide what you really want to see.Food and drink like most museums in London is pricey but then entry is free.You will have your own favourite sections in the museums, given its central location and ease of visit, well worth taking a look for both overseas visitors and day trippers alike."
"Written September 8, 2019",HUGE and amazing,There is seriously not enough time to see everything in that museum. One of the most captivating collections of ancient artifacts from so many civilizations I have ever seen in my life. Do yourself a favor and dedicate a day to it. You will not regret it. 
"Written September 7, 2019",Just wonderful,Between the amount of rooms to go into and the vast selection was amazing to see. The signs around the museum are very informative. Also the staff can point you to what you want to see when you ask them. Looking forward to another visit there.
"Written September 7, 2019",So much to see!,Went to the British Museum in June with my mom and teenage daughter. It is so big that you really have to plan for it. We allotted about 2-3 hours and we barely scratched the surface. You can easily make a day of it if you want to but we were already tired from other site seeing. There is the cutest little tea shop directly across the street for a rest and some great afternoon tea. It rained which only made the atmosphere perfect London! Will go back!
"Written August 19, 2019",Egypt,"Brought my nephew, he loved th e grimness. Especially all the mummified Animals. Good for his school project."
"Written September 3, 2019",Amazing artifacts,Other than the fact that many of the most amazing artifacts were stolen from Egypt this place is full of amazing history. I’m sure Egypt is sorry they gave this all away for nothing but it is surely England’s gain.
"Written September 3, 2019",Amazing Spectacle,Amazing things to look at.  Leave hours to see it all (like 4-5 hours) especially with the crowds. Very eclectic selection AND it's free!!!!Was a little warm for this American in summer but not unbearable.
"Written September 3, 2019",Really neat interior architecture,"So i wasn't necessarily here for the exhibits. I was photographing the interior (just look at the ceiling!) with my brother and came up with some interesting patterns/compositions. Really liked it. I have only heard great reviews about the exhibits, so will have to visit this museum again for that next time.Well worth it."
"Written September 3, 2019",One of the most comprehensive museums I've ever visited,"One of the most comprehensive museums I've ever visited. The museum is huge, you need 4 to 5 hours to explore every section. Their iconic glass dome is beautiful and put some artsy touch to the building.They have Egyptian mummies, modern artifacts, Easter Island's statue, you name it! Avoid weekend and holiday because it can get very crowded."
"Written September 2, 2019",Loved it!,"You need 3 to 4 hours to enjoy this. All I can say is I could have spent 8 hours here. Take your time to ensure you do not miss anything that is on display. The history is outstanding . Very easy to get around, well laid out. "
"Written September 2, 2019",Amazing ,I am Greek and 50% of the museum has Greek art. You should return the sculptures back to Greece. Also there is art from other countries 
"Written September 2, 2019","Amazing exhibits, a must-see in London!","This was my first visit to the museum and I wish I could have stayed all day. We went mainly to see the Egyptian collection which didn’t disappoint but the other collections were very good as well. Amazing to see the Rosetta Stone in particular, that was the real highlight for me."
"Written September 2, 2019",Worlds histories artefacts are to be found here,Spacious museum with wonderful artefacts plenty of things on ancient Rome and Egypt but also from the Arabic world and wonder Asian cups made  of shells
"Written September 2, 2019",Very exciting - as always,"British Museum is always worth a visit. It's such a beautiful building and there are SO many astonishing things to see. You should allow yourself at least 4 - 5 hours there.Staff is very kind and helpful.Vibeke, Aalborg, Denmark"
"Written September 1, 2019",Very nice collection & free of charge,"It’s a great museum to visit because of their extensive collections, from Greek artifacts to Egyptian mummies. You can spend a whole day here if you visit everything but if they have listed the highlights if you have a very limited time. Best of all, entrance is free! Don’t get discouraged if you see a queue outside, it’s just for security check. "
"Written August 25, 2019",Totally worth it,Beautiful building with great exhibitions. Temporary exhibitions are kind of pricy but rest is free. A must when visiting London even if it's not for a long time.
"Written August 25, 2019",British Museum - not just the Rosetta Stone,The British Museum is where the Rosetta Stone is but there is a lot more in the Museum than the Stone.  There is a vast collection of antiquities. I suggest that you go on line and explore what's there before you go; that way you can plan what you want to see.  It can be absolutely overwhelming because of the depth and amount of objects.
"Written August 25, 2019",Don’t miss! ,"The British Museum was not on my agenda when visiting London, however my 12 yr old daughter really wanted to go after seeing lots of recommendations on social media.  I was happy we gave in and went.  It’s a beautiful museum.  Just the building alone is awe inspiring. The exhibits are organized in a pleasing manner.  The museum is huge and there is no way you could see it all or even a fraction in a few hours.  We read up in the highlights and a few others my daughter wanted to see. We were there for about 3 hours.  We will definitely go back someday.  Getting in was easy.  There was a long security line, but it moved quite fast and efficiently.  It was crowded as was every single place we visited during our 6 day stay.  There were many tour groups.  My only peeve with the tour groups is that they crowd around an item with their guide and don’t move aside for others to see.  This is everywhere.  So annoying but not a reason to not visit this museum or any other sight. "
"Written August 25, 2019",Brilliant,"What a wonderful experience.  Do as many have recommended and be there before the opening (10am). You can get inside the museum proper, get your audio guide and simply wait outside gallery 4 (with others) to race to see the Rosetta Stone. However, the time saved in waiting for an endless line and the lack of crowds just beyond the main attraction are well worth the early arrival.  So many great objects to see and learn about!"
"Written August 24, 2019",British museum,"The time spent at the security checks at the entrance can be reduced if you don’t have backpacks or large hand bags . You can purchase a map of the building or pick up one with a voluntary donation inside the entrance. There is a guide to essential exhibits to see if your time is limited ,less than 3 hours,i.e Rosetta Stone etc. Good lighting throughout and explanatory plaques in several languages near exhibits.A wonderful experience without an entrance fee."
"Written August 24, 2019",Unique exhibits of different cultures under one roof!,"Admire magnificent artifacts, travel through centuries and countries. One day is definitely not enough! A must for everyone visiting the UK! The refreshments are an excellent idea and the gift shop offers great variety."
"Written August 24, 2019",Crowded but worth it. ,"I always love the British Museum. I entered through the Montague St entrance, it is less known and faster than the Great Russel St entrance. The wow factor of this museum is a 10! I always start at the top and work my way down. I always take 2 days to enjoy this museum. I did not see everything. The Egyptian mummies are always impressive but the room is always overly warm. I am guessing the artifacts need the temperature and the hordes of people. Be patient so you can fully enjoy the amazing collection.The Japanese Collection was more impressive that I first thought, the Rothschild Collection is just wow. I needed an extra day to fully appreciate it. One aspect of the museum I REALLY appreciate is that when you enter a new room they highlight some of the more well known, important pieces with a picture so you can identify them. Take your time and enjoy this museum."
"Written August 23, 2019",Free Entry - worth a visit,One of the free things to do in London! It’s worth a visit. There are so many things to learn. They provide free guided tour. Visit their website for timings. I recommend this place while you are in London.
"Written August 23, 2019",One of the Biggest Collections I have seen,"One could spend days at the British Museum. Audio guides are great.  There are some short guided tours.  The one we took on ancient Rome was good and interesting, but very hard to hear the guide.  She was too quiet. Since the museum is free, you might want to consider going more than once.  Loved ancient Rome and Egypt exhibits.  Would have liked to seen more. We did have to wait in line more than 30 min to get in the building.  It gets very busy in the summer, especially when it rains."
"Written August 23, 2019",A great Collection,"One of the top Museums in the world, filled with very good artifacts that tells world history. You have to plan well before your visit and you must do more than one visit. But they will all be worth it. I visited the Munch Prints exhibition and it was incredibly good."
"Written August 17, 2019",Breath taking,"A place  which connects times , and in which u can find and learn so many  interesting thinks , I would come back :)"
"Written August 17, 2019",ancient treasures badly displayed,"Amazing museum with pivotal ancient treasures, definitely not to miss!! free entry really appreciatedunfortunely the different sections and paths are very badly organised, all pieces are piled up one on the other and no one really valued! really a pity"
"Written August 16, 2019",Worth a visit ,If you enjoy history then this is the place for you. So many wonderful exhibits! Wish we had had more time to spend there. The exhibits on Assyria & Mesopotamia were quite fascinating. Check out their website for a list of all their exhibits - too many to mention in the review. 
"Written August 16, 2019",Too hot!  Too crowded!  Too much to see or enjoy!,I’ve been to British Museum before & looked forward to view exhibits & be there. It was waaay too hot. No air or breeze.  Too crowded-busloads of tourists-unwilling or just culturally dim-witted & moving as a block-preventing access to view much. All in all -terrible experience. I traveled from Boston & missed out. Would Not recommend.
"Written August 16, 2019",Best tour guide ever,Our guide was an archeologist amongst other things a d really told a great story...it was all about how we got to where we are today...I have been to the museum 5 or 6 times before this but I did it by myself...Trust me having a knowledgeable guide make it so much more enjoyable
"Written August 16, 2019",Fascinating museum,"Joined a tour of the archives room where an enormous amount of archeological materials are kept. Also did a quick tour of available, free exhibits.  An impressive collection, including one of the Rapa Nui (Easter Island) moais (that probably should be returned to the island and the chess set used in Harry Potter. Some of exhibits require tickets."
"Written August 16, 2019",Always something new to discover - Brilliant Activity Packs,"Two adults with a seven year old grandchild who particularly wanted to look at some aspects of the ancient Egyptians which she had been studying as part of the school curriculum. Collected an activity pack (no charge and not pre-booked) on said subject (designed for 7 to 11) and this was a really impressive creation by the BM which engaged the child in an exploration of the mummies etc. The pack was full of material which had been really cleverly thought out and, among other benefits, may take some pressure off of addressing the barrage of questions that bright, inquisitive children produce. There are several activity packs available which are apparently tailored to what schools are addressing. On a Friday morning in the August school holidays the museum was rammed with people included a huge number of visitors from the East. I have been coming to the BM for over fifty years and never known it busier. So, unless you want to queue for a long time just to join the queue inside for the security check, I suggest you get there just before it’s opening. A few galleries (notably including some addressing Ancient Greece) are closed some days or have limited opening hours. So if you have particular visiting plans check the website for details. Also you can download a map and plan your visit in advance. Check out the lift locations which are not always obvious as these will help if you’re part of a group with a wheelchair and/or a buggy. If you’ve never been there before it’s important to realise that there is too much to see in even several visits so have a plan which, with children involved, may help to avoid arguments and confusion on the day. FREE but don’t be mean, make at least a modest donation. "
"Written August 15, 2019",Amazing place,Huge and amazing.  We spent around 1 hour there on a very busy summer Friday.  It was exceptionally crowded and hot. Even with this the museum is unbelievable; you would need days to get through it all.  There are suggested highlights which we did and that way got to see some galleries but just focused on 1 item.  this was doable in one hour and I recommend doing this if short on time.
"Written August 15, 2019",Visit British Museum,"The British Museum is free, however it’s worth getting a map and an audio guide. These both will enrich your experience tremendously, especially the audio guide because it has additional information on many collection pieces ( on various collection items you will find a number, just plug in the number and listen to the story of info).The museum is vast , so plan to spend there many hours ! The absolute must see are the ancient Egypt collection ( which has huge magnificent pieces , among which are the famous Rosetta Stone and statues of  pharaohs ) and the mummies collection ( which contains the Gebelein man and many other interesting mummies and info about the mummification process). On regular days the museum closes at 5.30( check the schedule online for the day of your visit ) and the closing time it’s pretty strict ."
"Written August 14, 2019",Wonderful but so crowded.,"We visited twice during our stay because it was around the corner from our hotel.The first visit was in the middle if the day and we went to the Egypt room as I remember being very impressed by it as a teenager when I last visited about 25 years ago.It all looked just as impressive now but was impossible to enjoy because of the massive  overcrowding. The place was thronged.The next morning we were there at opening time and visited a paid temporary exhibition on Manga which was very good.  By the time we were leaving this exhibit about 2 hours later the sea of people was evident again and we were glad to make our escape.An amazing resource and beautiful building and all for free other than donations, which really impresses, but if you’re there in the high season you might be as well off to give it a miss due to the crowds.

"Written August 19, 2019","Fascinating, but always very busy","This is a fantastic museum with an impressive collection of artefacts. However, it is to some extent a victim of its own fame and success, as it is invariably heaving with tourists. Therefore, expect a lengthy visit as you shuffle along trying to get close to the more popular exhibits like the mummies. One visit will not be enough, so it's best to pick one or two periods of interest and focus on these."
"Written August 19, 2019","One of the ""Jewels in our Crown""","If you do nothing else while in London, you should visit  even if only to see the Oxus hoard and the Sutton Hoo treasures. There is then about another 200,000 things to wonder at from Egyptian mummies to modern coins - including lots and lots of things ""acquired"" when we English  ruled about 25% of the world. "

"Written August 18, 2019",Unable to visit because of security checking queue,Wanted to visit the British Museum for first time in years but when we arrived the queue to go in must have been over 500m and showing little sign of moving. Need to sort out the security checking.
"Written August 18, 2019",Family,"Amazing place. If you are interested in history, this is the place. You had best be comfortable in crowds though, because this place is extraordinarily busy. Thousands of visitors will be sharing your experience.  Worth it, in my mind 🙂"
"Written August 7, 2019",Too popular for its own good,So difficult to get in.. what are all these people doing? The displays lack information.. I went to see the Solomon show.. disappointed.. saw more in the main exhibit in the big hall. The Chinese gallery now has removed the fabulous Burmese and Thai and Sri Lankan.. oh I know the excuses.I could go on.. so sad . The BM was 40 years ago a wonder house.not any more
"Written August 6, 2019",Wonderful collection of artefacts,Spent a couple of hours and probably only covered half the museum. I love history and classics and this was just the job. Lovely ambience but navigating between the exhibits can be a challenge. Recommend taking the map so you know where you want to go. Lovely cafe in the old reading room area.
"Written August 6, 2019",British museum,We have been to the British museum every time we go toLondon as t is one of our favourites. This time we decided to skip the Elgin marbles and Egyptian section. The regular collection is quite interesting and we had a wonderful time.

"Written August 6, 2019",Absolutely amazing! ,Fantastic family visit with out 8 year old twins. They loved the treasure hunts for the most famous articles in the museum. We will definitely come again! 
"Written August 6, 2019",Trip to museum ,Just had a fantastic day out here which was also free as you are not obliged to pay. Saw the Rosetta Stone and attended a Roman Britain tour. Will be returning 
"Written August 5, 2019",Great place to experience history,"We could have spent our whole visit at this museum. Floors and rooms filled with over the top artifacts. Word can not do this place justice. Would visit again and would spend more time here. I liked the rosetta stone, the ""kings collection"" and the Egyptian artifacts displayed. "
"Written August 18, 2019",Interesting but crowded,"The crowds were the first thing we noticed. It was summer school vacation so the lines at opening time we're horrendous. Having said that, I was really impressed at the speed with which the people were moved inside. The galleries where the Egyptian statues etc were held was a nightmare mainly due to large numbers of tour groups appearing to be mainly from one world region. They are generally interested only in their own agenda and unlike many others, ignorant of consideration for the rest of the people in the area. The displays are first rate and once you leave the more popular sections there is adequate room for viewing. The museum shop is extremely well stocked and the prices reasonable.The cafeteria is also very good and has reasonable pricing."
"Written August 18, 2019",Treasures,"We came for husband who wanted to see the Sutton Hoo treasures and we weren’t disappointed. It’s pretty amazing. For me they need better ventilation as the rooms were busy, hot and stuffy. Plus the long queue for the ladies down stone smelly stairs was a low point!It would take you days to see everything, so we’ll return in the winter on a quieter day."
"Written August 18, 2019",Great activity for all ages,"We have to keep coming back because we just can’t fit it all in. So much to see which keeps the interest of children, and adults of all ages. It’s a great place for a rainy day in London, it’s free and educational and has exhibits you won’t see anywhere else. We love the Egyptian mummies and the Easter Island statue. There is always something new to discover on every visit. The cafe has a great selection of cakes and drinks although is on the pricy side, especially painful if you have a large family. "
"Written August 18, 2019",Wonders of the Wall,"I went here as ""something to do"" with a friend, his wife & 2 small children.It's a fantastic under-advertised attraction (I've lived in London all my 30yrs & had never heard of it).I enjoyed all the interactive aspects & learning all it had to offer do much I returned a month or so later with my father & partner.While there we heard announcements advertising the guided walk of the Wall. So we jumped @ the chance & Daddy & I enjoyed ourselves immensely. (Partner, less so tbph, but tyg, not his style).I would (& have) recommend visiting the museum to anyone looking for ""something to do"" with children & the Wall walk to any person interested in the history if London."

"Written August 17, 2019",Great collection of unique treasures,"Huge museum, we only saw a part of it, including the Greek-Roman and Cypriot collection, the Egyptian one and of course the Marbles of Parthenon. World wide legacy antiquities require our fully attention and respect. I would definitely  pay another visit next time I am in London and I strongly recommend it to everyone visiting London."

"Written July 27, 2019",Great Museum but Don’t Eat There,"   Took our grandchildren to see the famous Rosetta Stone and other exhibits. Wonderful items to observe.    We were there at lunch time and purchased some very tasty food items. However, there was NO place to sit and eat.    All available seats were taken by young folk sitting and playing with their phones. Consistently sitting and playing with their phones (not eating). Apparently this is quite acceptable to the museum’s personnel.    Imagine going to the great British Museum so you could sit in the food court and stare at your phone?!?!?   Don’t eat there unless you like sitting on the floor. "
"Written July 27, 2019",Must see,"We stayed right off Russell Square Park and around the corner from the British Museum and were able to visit twice in two days.  The Rosetta stone, Parthenon reliefs and statues, and entire Greek collection are a must see. We also viewed a traveling exhibit of Munch prints, which was excellent.Wish we’d had more time—we will return."
"Written July 26, 2019",Don’t bother,Way too crowded in the summer. Not enough variety..... most.y ancient artifacts- not my cup of tea. They charge for certain exhibits which is so wrong! Sorry I wasted my time
"Written July 26, 2019","A Great, Nearly Overwhelming Adventure","The British Museum is a comprehensive experience offering a widely diverse exposure to historic cultural artifacts and displays. You could easily spend a week here and fail to see all that is essential. Use the map to get the highlights. If you are in a hurry, but want a “condensed version” - make tour way to the King George III Library. You get an exposure to sculpture, manuscripts, art, and history in a beautiful, quick setting. By all means, take the time to do it right!  But if you just can’t, visit the Kings Library at a minimum. And if you do have time, enjoy afternoon tea upstairs!"
"Written July 26, 2019",Very interessing museum ,Impressive museum in which you can learn a lot about culture and human nature. The children realy enjoyed our stay for more than two hours yesterday! 
"Written July 25, 2019",It’s free! ,You can spend the whole day there and still not be able to see everything. It’s very busy so get there early as possible! 
"Written July 24, 2019",Excellent museum,It's helpful to get an audio guide to access the tours of the major pieces in the museum.  Unfortunately it was very crowded when I visited in July so was only able to see the major pieces of art.  Also the cafe in the main area is very good.
"Written July 24, 2019",It's a museum,"So it's one of the greatest museums in the world, but it's still a museum. Lots of walking, lots of crowds, pushing to see, etc. I loved museums as a kid, but these days, my electrate tastes demand more (bells and whistles? interactivity?) There's a long security line in front, so be prepared. It's free, but I'm sure that the audio guide would be worth it to provide some of the context that I was missing (guided tours are also available, both from the museum and from independent guides). If it were just me, I'd give it a 3*, but I know it has cultural treasures, so reluctantly pushing it up to 4."
"Written August 13, 2019",Clean and organized museum,Free museum with some late nights.  We went early(when it opened at 10 am).  The Rosetta Stone was tough to see; even trying to get there prior to the crowd; still worthy the effort.  We pretty munch stayed on the ground floor.  Plenty to satisfy everyone.  We would visit again if in the area.  We arrived by bus from Islington without any problems.
"Written August 13, 2019",Special Collections,"The British Museum is a must-see. I, being a librarian, knew I would be interested. My husband was just as enthralled. Be sure to get a guide. Alan Turing. The Beatles. The Magna Carta... and that’s just naming three."

"Written August 11, 2019",Excellent special exhibitions -- Munch (last days) and Rembrandt -- Good accessibility,This is a substantial museum with a major collection and excellent temporary exhibits.  It is also easy to access for disabled people.  There are reserved parking spaces and a ramp at the entrance.  Lifts to upper floors.
"Written August 11, 2019",Amazing museum and free,"Wow this museum is amazing. Now it’s not as big as the Louvre in Paris, but this will take you at least half a day to look through everything, plus it’s FREE. Clean and if you come in the morning, you can avoid the crowds."
"Written August 11, 2019",A visit to learn,It was so interesting to visit the museum. You can see and learn a lot. But you need to go to the museum earlier as it takes some time to enter. Keep in mind that it takes a whole day to examine every exhibition
"Written August 10, 2019",Not worth it,"It was the hottest day of the summer in London so we decided to find activities that had air conditioning. The British Museum seemed to be a good choice.  I lasted all of 10 minutes and had to call it a day. Firstly, the museum seemed sort of run down although it was hard to see much given the seemingly hundreds of tour groups traipsing through the museum which was the second problem.  There were so many tour groups that it was impossible to see any of the displays and difficult to walk around the museum. The attractions weren't impressive enough to make it worth dealing with the crowds so I would skip this one. "
"Written July 24, 2019",Intriguing museum,"Free admission, however, you can donate to them. Roughly 5 floors of different eras including Europe, Asia, Egyptian, Greece and Roman (to name a few!)It’s worth a look and you can certainly stay in there hours on end! "

We spent the whole day going round the manga exhibition and exploring the other areas of the museum, took us all day! Such a great day out for families and couples, would definitely recommended going! We did have to pay for the manga exhibition meaning we skipped the security bag queue which was ridiculously long so make sure you arrive early! "
"Written August 9, 2019",A must see,"This is of course amazing, but please consider putting some sort of traffic direction on the Rosetta Stone as they do, for example,  at the Tower for the Crown Jewels; at the moment, it's impossible to view it in any detail without hords of  photo-snapping ****** getting in the way. On that topic, I was gobsmacked to see someone get excited about a stunning piece, but rather than look at it 'in the flesh', they took a photo and then showed that to hs friend and then got excited about the image!! "
"Written August 9, 2019",Fabulous - but don't go on a rainy day in the tourist season!,"I have lost count of the number of times I've spent many hours at a time at the British Museum and there is still more to see. It is a wonderful repository of international history which is truly awesome. However, I would advise avoiding busy times if possible.On my last visit it was a very wet day and I felt the museum was very overcrowded - it was completely impossible to see the Rosetta Stone for example! People posing for photos and the use of selfie-sticks didn't help.The number of visitors also meant huge queues for food, drink and the shop. Nevertheless it is an absolute must for Londoners, UK visitors and overseas visitors. Fabulous!"
"Written August 9, 2019",3rd floor in The British Museum,Ir is so wide show of human history and also contemporary items that one could use days in this venue. I focused this time to 3rd floor only - seeing the times fron ancient Egypt and Mesopotania to European Enlightment. Free entry is making this a very popular venue to visit.
"Written August 9, 2019",Travel the world and back in time ,"I arrived at the museum at 11:30, only an hour and a half after opening and the museum was already packed as you would expect. There was a helpful member of staff at the main entrance towards the back of a rather long entry queue who said it would be quicker to get into the building via the back entrance-this is on Montague Place. It appeared the main reason for queuing was for bag checks though no bags were looked through so everyone just went right in. I would recommend taking a free map of the building and firstly scouting for your preferred areas of interest. You could quite easily spend several days here and still not have seen everything so find what you most want to check out and then look at everything at a leisurely pace. I did not do a tour on this occasion but this may be something I do in the future as I am sure it would allow for more of the museum to be seen in a day. I was here for several hours enjoying the permanent pieces and free exhibits. There were some areas which felt a lot like a sauna. Unfortunately the only option for cool air were some large fans in the corner of rooms and with the amount of people there as you can imagine, especially on a hot day in August it was necessary to take a few breaks standing in front of the fans. My favourite sections were all the rooms about east Asia (so much ceramic), the Middle East including Ancient Egypt and Prints and Drawings. Don’t forget to check out the King’s Library. I enjoyed the free exhibitions about Captain James Cook and his voyages. This closed on 4th August 2019. I would highly recommend the museum to anyone who loves to learn about history, art, different cultures and loves jewellery- there was plenty to see. One tip- take plenty of water.  Another visit in the pipeline to explore more of what was missed. "
"Written August 8, 2019",Amazing visit!!!,Had such an incredible day with my daughter. We walked our socks off all over the museum and were sad when they actually closed and kicked us out lolThe investigation exhibit was absolutely incredible- we spent 2 hours in there alone. Go into the garden and have a peek at the plants and pond! Beautiful. Food is overpriced which was expected but would recommend packed lunch if you don’t want to spend your pay check on chocolate brownies and lattes!!Can’t wait to go again!
"Written August 7, 2019",Amazing!,Free museum! Just say yes. If you love mummies and world history this is the museum for you. You could spend an entire day here but I recommend at least 3 hours. Bring water. You can't bring food or drink into the exhibits but you can always refill a bottle at the water fountain. The food is expensive but it was tasty.

If short on time be sure to see the Rosetta Stone and King George’s Library.  From the library proceed to the room with treasures donated by the Rothschild Family.  A wonderful experience.  The museum’s entry hall is breathtaking!
"Written August 4, 2019",Amazing and Overwhelming,"There is so much to see!  My husband and I decided to focus on one area--Egypt--so we could feel accomplished.

"Written August 1, 2019",Fun for all ages,This was the first time I had been to the British museum in over 10 years and also my first since starting a family. We were not disappointed! any museum/gallery can be a tricky thing with young kids but I would thoroughly recommend this one.
"Written July 31, 2019",Typically British understatement ,"A very hot July day, unusually hot so I hoped for some respite inside the museum, however it was very hot and staff warned visitors to take water.A fantastic display of artefacts, I suggest investing in the audio guide if it’s the first time o have visited the must.Well stocked gift shop and nice teashops.A must while in London."
"Written July 31, 2019",Challenging,"Possibly a victim of its own success. The place was overcrowded which made it difficult to move around and keep together as a group. The displays and content were very interesting however, spending time at most spots was difficult due to being swept along in the flow of visitors. We had to cut our visit short because of the crowing and difficulty moving about. Groups of visitors, including school groups, were sitting on the concourse floor and on stairs, again making access and movement problematic. There seemed to be as many people sitting and taking a break as there were attempting to navigate around them. We would have liked to have stayed longer and seen more but it proved too difficult. We had a person with a disability in our group and they found it very difficult to cope. I witnessed rude and inconsiderate behaviours between visitors barging, pushing and shoving. Families with younger children and buggies also appeared to be struggling. What a pity that such a treasured resource should be reduced to a combination of a January sales rush and the Tube at rush hour.Prepare for battle..............."
"Written July 31, 2019",All that missing stuff,"So there was all the stuff missing from all of the other museums around the world. We spent two hours in the museum just in the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Greek collections. A very good display of a small selection of the huge collection and even something as important as the Rosetta Stone didn’t disappoint. The museum could have gone on for days but it was laid out in a way that was manageable and not overwhelming. If we had time there are so many more areas to see, we just didn’t want to spend all day there. I would certainly go back for the Asian collection alone. The Elgin Marbles were amazing too, how awesome would a fully intact Parthenon look?!"
"Written July 30, 2019","Amazing Museum, but not on a hot July day","One of the world's great museums no doubt. So much to see and such great examples of everything. Purchase terrific map which shows how to get to highlight items. But be forewarned, everyone else in museum also has a copy. Or perhaps they just don't have somewhere else to go, because there were SO MANY people in many galleries that it was impossible to move. The Elgin Marbles were mobbed. The Rosetta stone was barely visible between the hundreds of craning heads. The Egyptian galleries were packed and hot enough to be in Cairo. The ancient Britain galleries were actually quite comfortable and not as crowded.I don't think I would have missed visiting even if I had known how hot and how crowded it would be, but try to plan to visit when more children might be in school and fewer visitors in town, if you wish to take your time and see many of the items."
"Written July 30, 2019",Exceptional but not British...,There is no doubt that the British museum is an exceptional one but there is not a variety of exhibitions about Britain's history.  Most of the exhibitions are from Greece and Egypt . In general the museum is big and there is no entrance fee. You can donate an amount of money if you'd like. 
"Written July 30, 2019",Best Museum,Absolutely amazing museum!  You can't go to London with a stop here!  Treasures from all over the world!
"Written July 30, 2019",Enjoyed - long overdue,"Despite 10 plus visits to London, never had the time to visit the British museum. Nice place to spend 3-4 hours - good central place to view things found in museums of Greece, Egypt and Rome. Suggest you focus on 10 most important items first and if you are not tired of walking approach other exhibits."
"Written July 30, 2019",History of whole world is in your hands,The museum is huge - it will take a week to see everything - history of whole world is in your hands. The upper floors are narrower and overcrowded. Gift-shops has a great selection of souvenirs and gifts. Admission is free.
"Written July 30, 2019",Always a delight!,"This museum never fails to delight and astonish. We love the written descriptions of each exhibit that are missing in other places such as the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The only failure is the cafes lack any gluten free options and for drinks, there is no such thing as an ice cube in "
"Written July 30, 2019",Manga Exhibition,"After a full day in London, my partner and I ventured to the British Museum to take a look at their manga exhibition and what it has to offer. As an avid manga reader, I was excited to see what they have in store for us. From the start straight to the finish this was jam-packed with everything manga to the origin story of manga to modern-day production and the top mangas at the moment. I will highly recommend this to anyone who reads manga as you can spend a while in here reading all the information they have to offer."
"Written July 24, 2019",Just too much to see!,"Enjoyed our time here, but so much to see and so little time. The cast Museum was pretty spectacular. Saw my ancestor Isabella of Angoleme  here. Was stoked!!  Was saddened by the stripping of the marbles and the Assyrian artifacts. "
"Written July 24, 2019",A Must Visit,Whether you live in London or are simply passing by this place is a must visit. Best day to visit would be on a Sunday.
"Written July 23, 2019",Need a whole day to make the most of it!,"This museum is great, there are so many artefacts that it’s hard to keep track of what you’ve seen and what you haven’t. Would recommend for anyone visiting London!"
"Written July 23, 2019",Busy,"Had brief visit, mainly for the Egyptian treasures. So busy had to view closely as too many people! Next time will choose term-time when hopefully not so many tourists "
"Written July 23, 2019",I like to visit museum,I would like to visit museum in every country because i love museum of the every country i have visited
"Written July 22, 2019","Vast, Yet Managable","My adult son and I spent a very pleasant late afternoon here, both looking at exhibits and enjoying the cafe. Most memorable is the beautiful enclosed courtyard. As many others must mention, note there is not much indigenous to Britain itself. Still a great collection and worth your time."
"Written July 22, 2019",Plenty to see,"Had a lovely time visiting this museum. They had alot of things to see and I enjoyed it. If visiting, spend the whole day and you can walk around"
"Written July 22, 2019","Go with a plan, and it will be great.","You should definitely figure out what you're interested in at the British Museum before you go. It is a massive museum and you'll be over it after about an hour or two, so pick out the exhibits you want to see and do them first! For example, I wanted to see the Rosetta Stone first. I suggest going at off-peak times because people are everywhere and it is really packed."
"Written July 22, 2019",Amazingness never ends and jaw-dropping exhibition in every section!,"Was staying in a hostel right next to the museum, making it super convenient to visit the place from time to time. Not only that I enjoy the in-door exhibitions a lot, but I was also amazed by the outdoor exhibition activities during the weekend. The only pity was that I never get to finish going through all exhibition rooms... There are simply too many to see!"
"Written July 22, 2019",Make a selection before you go in,With over 8 million pieces it's impossible to see all of it. My advise for a half day visit would be to select one section. I selected the Egyptian section and was surprised at the amount of statues that you can get close to without any glass encasing. Some top pieces are protected but most are very open. Entering the museum was quick even though nowadays there is a security check. The entrance is free. Donations are welcomed. Tip if you want to fast-track; buy a ticket to special exposition and you have a shorter line to get in on busy days.
"Written July 22, 2019",Just awesome ," Came primarily to see the Rosetta Stone, but then got absorbed by the Greek, Roman, Egyptian wing as a whole, just wonderful.There was a pamphlet justifying the holding for part of the Freise from the Parthenon as the Greek Govt are claiming it back, and we found their reasoning a little weak and self serving.Only other downside was the huge number of people attending but that is to be expected, just take your time and go with the flow."
"Written July 22, 2019",Spent a memorable day at the British Museum,Had an amazing day just wondering through the museum. No planning and just a walkthrough. Went to see the special Edvard Munch exhibit and it was so nice to see the SCREAM.
"Written July 21, 2019","If you love history, this place is best to find out more","I am honestly not a mueseum person.Hence , not much comments. Well maintained place. Lot of places to eat inside. Lot of benches to sit and take rest for a while. Guides to explain. Washroom on all floors.Helpful and courteous staff."
"Written July 21, 2019",Great family day out,Museum quickly got us through security check. For a Sunday it was relatively quiet and we went straight into the specialist exhibitions. Manga - Great stuff we all enjoyed. By 2pm it was busy but the catering served us quickly and food was excellent. Engaged staff who were very helpful. Got tickets to see another exhibition and afterwards went and looked round Japan exhibits. All really interesting. Exhibit rooms nicely cooled on a warm day. Left at closing time having had a great day.
"Written July 21, 2019",The same but different ,"Every time I go, I notice something different.Mediæval caskets, garnets and runes; Assyrian murals and sculptures; Greek temples and statues; Anglo-Saxon pottery; you name a part of history and you’ll find something.The lower floors were sadly busy with the expected school trips and tourist hordes, but further away and you were pretty much left to your own devices.Fabulous place."
"Written July 21, 2019",What a Treasure,"We did the ""around the world in 90 Minutes"" tour. Highly recommend this tour- as where on Earth would you start in this huge place. Nearly missed the tour- as no info on tickets or website- so we waited at the sign posted meeting point. About 11.28 when no one arrived I grew suspicious so went to info desk- to find tour had just left. Ran back across the Great Hall to collect hubby- and we caught up with them in the first room."
"Written July 21, 2019","Very busy, but as expected ","The London Museum is very, very crowded in the summer. This is expected and you just have to deal with the crowds. We bought a map for 2 pounds right at the entrance that proved helpful. We went through the Greek and Roman rooms in about 2 hours and saw the Rosetta stone. Some of the Greek rooms are closed during other days of the week. If you are interested in a particular thing, the web site is very helpful for planning. We had an agenda and a checklist. I think it would be very difficult to just wander around during the summer. There is supposedly a statement somewhere about the Elgin Marbles and Greece, but we didn't see it. The staff was very helpful in directing. They were also visible but not overbearing.   It's crowded because it has all the ""good stuff."" And it's  free! Bite the bullet, brave the crowds, go anyway."
"Written July 21, 2019",A classic - for a reason,"British museum is a must if you visit London. So much to see - you really can't see everything in one go, so I need to return to see the rest of it. The cafe is expensive and not that good, but the museum itself is just great."
"Written July 21, 2019",Great collection and definitely worth a look,"There is see much to see at the British Museum you need to devote a good two to three hours. Our time was more limited so we focused more on British History rather than the other displays. Given the amount of material there is on other parts of the world it is a bit disappointing to see how relatively little space is devoted to local history. I found it hard to follow the development of Britain through the ages, and particularly would have liked to see more on the different ethnic groups that occupied the British Isles, how they were colonised and how culture has changed and developed over time. Now all of this may have been included, but I found it hard to find this information."
"Written July 20, 2019",Amazing,This was my second time visiting the British Museum and I would gladly go back. Wonderful collection. Don't miss it!
"Written July 14, 2019",Free Visit - wonder exhibits,We went early to avoid crowds and had a lovely time.  Amazing exhibits and overall a wonderful experience.  They had folks walking around in period costumes you could take pictures with as well.  Was a bit hot in some of the rooms but I'd definitely recommend it.
"Written July 13, 2019",One day is not enough,"Where to begin?The British Museum has an unbelievable collection of artifacts from around the world across history. Beyond the big draws of the Roseta Stone and mummies exhibits are displays organized by region and time period. While many exhibits focus on places and time periods, others explore topics such as money beginning with the earliest forms of currency through modern paper money.Admission is free but I highly recommend spending a few pounds for the audio guides. The information really helps to provide a deeper understanding of what you are looking at and provides excellent historical context."
"Written July 13, 2019",Incredible collection,There are a lot of things to see here!Incredibly this place is free to the public!The exhibits are amazing. The Egyptian collection has a huge amount of artefacts spanning centuries of history.You could easily spend a couple of days in here taking everything in. 
"Written July 13, 2019",Things you will see nowhere else ,"We only had a limited time to visit so we narrowed our tour to Egypt/Assyria/Greek/Roman and found North America on the way out.  The most astonishing thing was an ancient building within the museum - amazing.  Also, the Rosetta Stone is on display.Please note:  it is VERY hot and humid in the museum in July and the crowds are immense!  Lots of folks not in their best behavior!  Wish they could find a way to cool down the exhibit rooms."
"Written July 13, 2019",Incredible collections,This museum is incredibly large.  Plan your visit ahead of time to know  what rooms to visit.  Wanted to take the introductory free tour but found out it is only offered 2 times per day.
"Written July 13, 2019",Culture ,As located nearby had a few hours walking around this amazing British institution Arrived around 3 ish still huge crowds both leaving and going in very popular as a group visit Maze of barriers prior to security but guessing for safety and protection Well laid out with decent maps to guide you not every thing is free as some of the exhibits carry a pay entry fee the rest is free with the custom £5 donation Every thing for all ages great to see so many young children being stimulated along with us oldies well worth a visit.
"Written July 12, 2019",Almost perfect,"I thoroughly enjoyed all the exhibits I saw. Unfortunately, they closed some of their exhibits early and I didn’t have the chance to see them."
"Written July 12, 2019",Fantastic but need some air ventilation in Summer ,Always visit here when I have the chance. Our kids loved it and stayed engaged much longer than I thought they would for a place so big and busy. Love that it’s still free ... I would be prepared to pa an entry fee though if they would consider some air cooling or ventilation higher up in the popular displays. Highly recommend for families with kids of school age. (And others not to be left out) 
"Written July 12, 2019",It was amazing,"No wait and my son loved it, its worth visiting it , and it was and an easy access to get there thanks to Oyster card."
"Written July 12, 2019",Great free museum,"We went here at 10am on a Sunday and joined the small line of people. The museum is huge and so you don’t feel crowded, even with the large amount of people in it. Lots to see and read about. The mummies are especially cool. Would definitely recommend spending a few hours here. The building itself is stunning too. After leaving the main entrance, we were so happy we went through the back entrance as the line at the front was huge. "
"Written July 29, 2019",Incredible museum with about a week's worth of stuff!,We did the highlights tour as that was all we had time for. The highlights tour is very recommended--it gives you insider knowledge and appreciation of about 10-12 different items around the museum. I could come back and visit this museum every day for an entire week. Maybe I will have to do just that!
"Written July 29, 2019",Probably the best museum in the world,"This is probably the best museum in the world. It's sheer scale rivals that of the Louvre but it is much easier to get around, much better designed and free for everyone to enter!It's worth noting that the BM (in the past) has been accused of acquiring its collections using less than legal methods, so a moral question remains of whether to support the institution. "
"Written July 29, 2019",My Favorite Museum ,What a treat: a free Museum of international acclaim.I headed to the Egyptian displays on 2 floors and could have spent a week looking at everything.Do not miss going to the museum.
"Written July 29, 2019",The history of the Western World under one roof,"Loved this museum, massive collections, the Rosetta Stone is a must see, fantastic objects, well presented"
"Written July 29, 2019",Day at the museum,Fantastic exhibitions. unfortunately it was during the heat wave and we almost cooked - no air conditioning so the most popular exhibits were a sauna.   Sadly ran out of time 
"Written July 28, 2019",what an amazing collection!,"sad that many exhibits are there as a result of being 'won' by the British but on the other hand this has probably secured their longevity.  Almost overwhelming in size, we spent an entire day there.  Well worth a look, but note that it really is a history museum, and not much in the way of natural history so set aside at least another day for this one!"
"Written July 28, 2019",Something for everyone!,"My daughter wanted to go here because they had a special (priced tickets) exhibit called Magna...about anime.  She really enjoyed this.  The rest of the museum was free and held an interesting mix of things.  We visited the highlights (Rosetta stone, Tang Dynasty figures, Easter Island statue) and enjoyed it.  Spent 2 hours here excluding the Magna area but could have spent more."
"Written July 28, 2019",Great museum but you get what you pay for,"With the British museum being free to the public this review is more on the crowds, heat and logistics rather than the actual exhibits in the museum. You will find larger crowds who have not concept of personal space, hygiene or manners. As such you may have a hard time navigating the museum and seeing some of the more popular items. When we were there the outdoor temperature was high and unlike many other museums we have visited, it is poorly air conditioned, if at all, and in certain places almost unbearably hot. The only area that was pleasantly cool was the extra cost exhibit about Manga, which we didn't opt for based on personal interest. "
"Written July 28, 2019",British Museum,"I only had 3 hours, so I concentrated on one section. I chose the Egyptian Collection. WOW!!  The Rosetta Stone was intriguing.  The other exhibits were fascinating.  I recommend getting there at opening time ( Sun it is 10am, Due to security screening. The lines later  on get very long. Devote a whole day to the visit and choose what you want to see the most. It is a huge complex. ."
"Written July 28, 2019",Fabulous! Worth a visit,"It’s certainly worth visiting the British Museum if you’re in London for a few days. The collection is awe-inspiring. It houses too many marvels to name. Make sure you have comfortable shoes on as it’ll take a while to walk around all the halls. Also stay hydrated. The museum is very well-managed with clear maps, signs and information boards everywhere. There are some shops inside for refreshments, water and souvenirs. The entrance is free but you’re expected to donate something at the entrance - they accept cards as well as cash at the donation counter."
"Written July 18, 2019",Very impressive and informative.,"Much of this we probably wouldn't know, without the british empires conquests! If you want to see it all, use more than 1 day."
"Written July 17, 2019","Lots to see, clean and free entrance","So much to see, can spend a few hours there, only a few places is crowded, mostly ok. The place is clean, some halls are a bit warm."
"Written July 17, 2019",Very Interesting!,"Loved walking around this museum! It was wonderful to see the statues, displays and the Rosetta Stone"
"Written July 17, 2019",so much to see...,"This is a fabulous museum for those wanting to see things gathered from across the world, in fact its probably too much to see in one day.We spent about 4 hours and only saw a few floors.  There were lots of people making it hard to read some exhibit descriptions but generally it was a good place for families.They say it's free to get in but at the entrance you are specifically directed to a person who asks if you would make a donation and then are also charged about 2.5 pounds for a coloured map where further inside maps are given out for free. However if you have a few kids it's still an excellent way to spend time in London."
"Written July 16, 2019",Too crowded,"The exhibits in the museum are very interesting. Museum is large and it's not even possible to see everything in one visit so it's better to decide what would you like to visit. However, it's very crowded and very hot during the summer inside. I understand it's free so many people are visiting, but it's not possible to enjoy the museum under these circumstances. I think introducing a limit on number of people that can be inside at the same time could help."
"Written July 16, 2019",Well setup and a lot to see,Allow a good part of the day to see the mesum. If a history buff you could spend a whole week. History from many countries and guide book for 2 ponds is helpful. 
"Written July 15, 2019",Always A Must Visit,No amount of time will even scratch the surface for viewing their incredible collection;even see the Rosetta Stone. No where like it.
"Written July 15, 2019",Very impressive ,You’d definitely need more than a day to see everything here.worth the visit.good place to take children too.theres just so much to see.its free but some exhibitions you have to pay a fee for entry.
"Written July 14, 2019",Rosetta stone and more!!!!,"What an amazing collection!!!! Open to all for free. We saw the Rosetta stone which was much larger than we expected,  Egyptian and Greek collections. Didn't have as much time as we would have liked. One of the finest collections in the world. Certainly warrants a second visit.  Our 14 year old son loved the visit."
"Written July 14, 2019",Amazing Collection,"Lots of wonders in this museum. However, in the middle of summer it’s packed and the air conditioning can’t keep up.  I’d love to come back in the winter and spend a few hours. "
"Written July 20, 2019",A world beater,"Where else could you find such an astonishing variety of artefacts from around the world. Everything is beautifully displayed.  Concentrate on a few fields or you will exit exhausted. Worth checking before you go what special exhibitions are on short term loan or you might miss something really special, e.g. Up on the 4th floor. Excellent plans of the buildings are free and available just when you get inside."
"Written July 20, 2019",It would take days...,...if not weeks to go through the entire collection. I suggest going on the website to check for what section you want to look at and just go for that if you are strained on time. The entrance is free but a guide book would cost you 6 GBP and a map would set you back 2 GBP.
"Written July 20, 2019",Excellent 1 hour highlights tour,We came with kids who are not that into mueums. It's recommended to go in the back entrance there's a much shorter security line. The museum map has a very detailed 1 huor tour of the museum's highlights whihch we did and was wounderful. It actually took us 1.5 hrs. Beautiful and important museum.
"Written July 20, 2019",Great curation!,I really enjoyed the various exhibits of the museum. Followed Rick Steves’ guide book tour - the Rosetta Stone is an amazing highlight to see. Be aware the crowds on a Saturday but security was pretty quick to go through for a bag check. 
"Written July 20, 2019",Amazing museum ,"We only managed to spend a couple of hours here but could easily spend 2 days! The exhibitions are interesting and informative on a large scale, so much to see especially with the special exhibitions in summer on as well. Highly recommend it but perhaps allow a longer time for the visit. It is very crowded with tourists however still worth visiting."
"Written July 20, 2019","How can you not make this a ""5"" - well, pick better times to go","July afternoon 2019 - packed like sardines would be an understatement.  Being a ""rude Yank"", I actually ended up pushing some people out of the way so a guy in a blow command wheel chair could see the Rosetta Stone ...That said, it is a great experience.  However, go very early in the AM, go in January or February, go anytime the crowds are not there.  There is a ""90 minute"" tour for the top 10 highlights so I'd start with that (mapped out on the guide) and then come back to the places of your interest."
"Written July 19, 2019",Great Historical Museum,We really enjoyed this museum all about London.  We had the London Pass so we received a free catalog booklet which has lots of references of the museum.  It’s easy to get around and nicely done.  If you have time take the kids there as well.   Dry helpful staff.  There’s an eatery there and you can get bottled water for a reasonable price.  
"Written July 19, 2019",Stunning collection ,We visited with our daughters. Our focus was primarily Greco-Roman; Egyptian and Mayan. We were not disappointed. Clearly one of the worlds great museums. First it is free although contributions are constantly being solicited. The collections are the best primarily the Egyptian and Greco-Roman. The layout can be overwhelming but the employees are more than ready to help. They also have very knowledgeable volunteers that conduct tours of sections. Just plan accordingly as the schedules vary by section. Certainly one of the reasons to visit London. 
"Written July 19, 2019",Must see,Such a great museum!  I find this easy to go into and see what I want- or dig deeper in a section.  I think it is laid out so much better than the Louve and other museums.
"Written July 19, 2019",Stunning building,"Was there only for a couple of hours. This places needs more like a couple of days to explore.  Went to the Egyptian section for one of the largest collection of mummies.  My daughter enjoyed that pretty much. Would need to visit this again some time later.  The building itself is stunning and worth a visit just for that.  And the best part is that it is free, which is a big thing in London."
"Written July 9, 2019",One of the Worlds best museums,"One of the Worlds best museums, a must see location, fantastic content through multi-periods, very busy in high season."
"Written July 9, 2019",British Museum ,Friendly staff. So many different collections that are worth visiting. The standard collection is free to visit. 
"Written July 9, 2019","Great museum, wonderful artifacts","We visited in March. Entry to the British Museum is free, though they will accept donations. When we arrived, the line was long to enter, but after someone incorrectly directed us to a second side entry that was not open, the staff at the entrance more than made up for it by directing us through the member line (a quick walk in and done). Get a map when you enter. The first item of note when you enter is the famed Rosetta Stone. Once in the center rotunda, there are three or four floors with wings off each floor for displays, for all periods of history. The sections on Egyptian, Assyrian, and other ancient cultures are outstanding, and there is so much more. The biggest regret I have is not being able to go back for the several days it would take to take it all in. Food is available in the center rotunda. Great way to spend a day (or more)."
"Written July 9, 2019",British Museum,Absolutely loved it! So much to see and do! Could spend a few days there!!! Several floors divided by time period and genre. Definitely recommend for the family. Something for everyone
"Written July 9, 2019",Incredible Displays,There is far too much to see in one day.  To view everything would probably take at least 3 days.  Check their web site before you go to see what's on display and then prioritize the area(s) that you are most interested in.  It's well worth spending a day there and is something that you don't want to miss.
"Written July 9, 2019",Greatest Museum!!,"You will need lots of time to view it all, book more than one day if you like history, 03 at least :)"
"Written July 9, 2019",Overwhelming ,You need several visits to even scratch the surface. The finest collection of antiquity we’ve ever seen. 
"Written July 9, 2019",A must see,Marvellous building and marvellous exhibits.Well worth going to however short you London visit.Lovely part of London.
"Written July 9, 2019",Can't Miss,"When in London, don't forget to visit the British Museum. I had fun touring the place when I was on holiday there .It's free and they have a huge collection of permanent artworks so you can take selfies alongside them if you like. I was there before lunchtime and there's not a lot of tourists yet. If you love art, you can't miss this."
"Written July 8, 2019",The British Museum is great but not in all in one go,"Like many Londoners,  I have dragged my children or rather been dragged by them around most of London's museums. Especially this one, the grandest of them all. And it's a bloody marathon. I learned long ago to decide in advance what to see and get in and get out without being distracted. Now my kids are adults and I have a granddaughter. And one day I shall show her my favourite place in the entire museum where we can sit and enjoy a relaxed lunch - the peaceful room housing the Elgin Marbles. If you don't have time or this is your first visit please pace yourself. Ideally, it's better to remember the exhibits than the slog. "
"Written July 8, 2019",Very rice history ,As expected it is a place to learn about all the world history and civilisations. You cannot cover it fully in one visit .. so bug and have hundreds of items. Free to access which was great thing. Some items and it's descriptions were hard to match. 
"Written July 8, 2019", A very good  experience ,We went to this museum  to look at the history for fun.  We were desperate to see Mummy  because  it was shown on the films. We also like the section on Greece because  of the story of Tory.  The section of China was a little bit boring. The area on the section of Solomon  island  and Syria  were very hot so we could  not stay long. You couldn't  finish it in one day if you were lover of history. There was no entrance  fee so that you could come again and again .
"Written July 8, 2019",Ye olde mummies of London,"We felt that we had to come to the British Museum when in London. The map has a very handy key code of ""items not to miss"". This really helped us as it is so big we wouldn't have been able to bring the kids to each exhibit. There are some really fascinating exhibits here - particularly the Egyptian section. But I just couldn't get away from the fact that I felt they should be in Cairo. I didn't think that I would feel that strongly before going - but lots of the items just feel out of place in the ""British"" museum. However - it is still a great place to visit"
"Written July 8, 2019",Historical Artifacts Galore,"If you like history, this museum has amazing artifacts from many civilizations and eras.  It’s free!  Definitely purchase a map and hit the highlights if you are in London.  You cannot go through it all in one day - information overload.  It is an amazing museum!"
"Written July 8, 2019",Interesting,"Interesting exhibits at this big, busy museum. We got there for opening time and the crowds were already there so I think it’s busy all day every day."
"Written July 7, 2019",Must go,This is an incredible museum with so much to see.  We love reading about each thing.  You can spend a long day here.  It is worth taking the time.
"Written July 7, 2019",One of the world's most important art collections,"Aside from the famous Elgin Marbles, Rosetta stone and the Greek vases, this museum has a world-class collection of art from countless other cultures and traditions. The crowds can be overwhelming at times so consider coming during off peak times. It can also be overwhelming since it is so big so it is best not to expect to see everything in your first visit."
"Written July 7, 2019",Top 3 Museum in World,"Loved my FREE visit to the British Museum. If ancient civilizations and antiquities interest you then you will be in heaven here. Greece, Egypt, Middle East, Roman, China, India, etc was well represented. Rosetta Stone, Mummies, Statues of all kinds. I loved this museum that represents the worlds great treasures. Thank you British Museum for saving and showing them to me. WOW"
"Written July 7, 2019",Classical Greek Sculptures,This museum is worth a visit just for the Elgin marbles. There is a lot to see here so grab a map and plan your visit. We spent most of our time visiting the Ancient Greece and Rome and European galleries. Check out both the free and special exhibitions.
"Written July 7, 2019",The British Museum never disappoints!,"We weren't sure if we would visit the museum this time around, but our 13yo granddaughter spied an advertisement in the tube station for a Manga exhibition and thought that sounded awesome -- so off we went. We couldn't believe we ended up spending over four hours at the museum; she was interested in so many displays, from their stunning Egyptian artifacts and mummies to the ceramics from all over Asia. It's a gorgeous museum with something for everyone -- impressive galleries and collections, bright, airy open spaces, gorgeous bookstore, and delicious cream tea with scones when your legs need a rest!"
"Written July 7, 2019",Very quick visit on a busy summer day,"Went here on July 1 which was a sweltering hot Saturday. It was very crowded, but the queue to get through bag check was faster than I thought it would be. At least it was in the shade. The museum was packed with people and we sort-of rushed through a lot of it, just hitting the highlights. I suppose the upper floors don't have air conditioning, so it was not the relief from the heat we had hoped it would be. We got to see the main attractions including the mummies (cat mummy is a favorite) and the Rosetta stone and Parthenon marble carvings (AKA Elgin marbles). The gift shops were great, but long queues here, too. Didn't eat there, but wanted to. You needed a reservation for the good restaurant in the middle. All in all, it's an amazing place with the (stolen) treasures of the world, just not a perfect outing on a busy, hot summer day."
"Written July 6, 2019",Spectacular Museum,"Easily one of the greatest museums in the world.  The British Museum holds some incredible art and artifacts.  Even for those who aren't museum fans (eg. my 10 & 13 year old kids) this museum will delight.  Plus, like all museums in London, its completely free!! So you don't have to worry about staying to get your money's worth and seeing every item and exhibit.  We made sure to see the Rosetta Stone, the mummies and the Elgin Marbles along with some of the other art and my kids really enjoyed themselves.  Definitely a must visit for anyone coming to London and a place you can go again and again and never get bored with."
"Written July 6, 2019",Another great site.,Lots and lots to see. We were lucky to have a private tour guide and she asked what our interests were before we started.We were there over 3 hours and could have gone back again and again.
"Written July 5, 2019",Fascinating collection,Our family spent 2-3 hours just looking at the ancient civilizations rooms--we could have easily spent the entire day here.  Arrive early (at opening time) to avoid a wait to get in.
"Written July 4, 2019",Great place,This was an awesome museum to see however it was unbearably hot inside. There is no air conditioning so prepare to be melting as you walk through the museum. Great place to take kids and the price can’t be beat!  Free!!!!
"Written July 4, 2019",GOOD,"“The hotel has a very modern decor and beds very comfy, location is city centre. I like how you didn't have to pay extra for preferring a twin beds as some hotels charge more. I asked for extra pillows and a room that face the back so was nice and quiet. Didn't get a chance to try breakfast or other facilities but we will be back for sure. ”"
"Written July 3, 2019",FREE & MUST SEE even if controversial,"First, it’s free. Second, this is the greatest vault of stolen (controversial, right) historical artifacts in the world! Third, the Rosetta Stone.Stolen or not, one thing is for sure - that the British Museum is absolutely preserving and taking care of everything they have.  This place is just amazing. I would recommend at around 2-3 hours to peruse.  The external facade and indoor lobby are amazing to behold.  I couldnt stop taking pictures.  I went late Friday afternoon - the only day of the week they open late.  I highly suggest this - less crowds for sure.  The gift shop at the center is pretty extensive.  There were some awesome totem poles in the lobby area too.  This place is massive, you could be here all day if you wanted.My must sees if you are tight on time:1. Rosetta Stone2. Lamassus3. Elgin Stones4. Rapa Nui Statue5. The amazing Egyptian section of Mummies and sarcophagi - this area blew my mind"
"Written July 3, 2019",Excellent collection of anthropology and antiquities,"Went with  a tour group. I had a guide. If you're interested in Anthropology, ancient civilizations and antiquities this museum would be for you. I wish I had more time. The only drawback I have to say about this museum is that it was very crowded.This is a free museum. It has a little cafeteria. It also has a nice assortment of souvenirs."
"Written July 3, 2019",Fabulous Munch exhibition,"Attended this exhibition after a long absence from the BM and love what they've done to it since I last went. There were long queues for the bag security but as I had booked a ticket to the exhibition online I could whizz past these via the vip queue and straight into the main entrance. I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to take my bag in and would have to put it in the cloakroom as has happened at other museums but this was not the case here.The exhibition was all about Munch's prints so not many paintings but it was deliciously dark, reflecting the experience of the artist. I think he cheered up a bit after he had a nervous breakdown and cut down on the booze but this is an excellent display of his existential angst."
"Written July 3, 2019","Amazing exhibits, but very crowded","The Rosetta Stone, mummies, displays celebrating world cultures--this museum really is amazing.  The only downside was the absolutely packed crowds that made navigating the rooms a bit difficult.  Hit the lower levels early if the tour buses and school groups haven't arrived; otherwise, take the lift to the top and work down.  The formal tea service at the restaurant (not the cafe) was excellent, but a bit pricey for a family."
"Written July 12, 2019",Audio guide is a must,"This museum houses lots of amazing things, including the Rosetta Stone, some of the Greek Parthenon and an Easter Island statue. However, without the audio guide seeing these attractions kind of fell flat. When we arrived around noon, the audio guides were sold out, so get there early! It is truly amazing that entry is free, so take advantage if you’re at all considering going."
"Written July 11, 2019",Fantastic museum,"The museum is a must see. There are thousands (literally) of things to see from all over the world in one building. I arrived mid day and it was already quite crowded. It might be better to arrive right when it opens. Bring water to drink and a snack depending on how long you plan on staying. There were a variety of of places to get food and drink but seemed fairly expensive. I don't recall seeing any water fountains. There were many staff members that could provide assistance, others who were at stations where you could handle certain items, and periodic short tours within certain exhibit areas. One thing to note is some of the rooms got very warm and stuffy."
"Written July 11, 2019",Lots of vairety,I really like how many different things you can see in this collection of different periods. I have been there several times and I differently would recommend others to visit but my only complain would be that toilets are always smelly and not that clean.
"Written July 11, 2019",OK if you are into ancient artifacts,"a bit overboard on Egyptian artifacts, but lots to see, and it is free so that is a plus, wait not too long on a weekday"
"Written July 11, 2019",Really nice meal in the museum restaurant.,Top quality beetroot and monkfish risotto.Love the big glass ceiling. Blew my mind to find out that each piece of glass is individual. No two are the same!
"Written July 11, 2019",Fast fee and easy to see.  Daughter loved Rosetta Stone,We arrived at 10:15 on a weekday at the Montague entrance. Waited about 15 minutes behind a couple of groups - moved fast. Great to arrive at that hour - grade straight tonRosetta Stone.  Museum Map is great in pointing out “must sees” if you have 1 hr or 2 hrs. 
"Written July 10, 2019",Interesting,"Loved it. Not completely organized as one would expect (sometimes just a little confusing). Tons of people checking out the Egypt colletion, other parts not so crowded. Beutiful museum, I just wish people took a little more time watching the exibition, reading about it and not be taking soooo many pictures all the tim"
"Written July 10, 2019",Amazing and Free,"We were told not to my the British Museum during our first trip to London and it was great advice.  The place is huge and I could easily spend several days in here.  The Lobby is breathtaking.  We had three kids of different ages and each one of them got to do an activity which the other kids enjoyed and was very informative.  The staff members were very friendly with the children and helped them figure the activity they wanted to participate in.  I cannot believe the amount of artifacts and all for the public to enjoy for free.  There are donation boxes and we felt it was worth giving to this institute.  We did go early in the morning and were in without any waiting, however on our way out we did notice that there was a line.  This is a fun place and well worth the visit.  "
"Written July 10, 2019",Very good,"This place is very interesting, however on our visit i think every school in the local area visited too!The exhibits are very good, definitely worth a visit!"
"Written July 10, 2019",Fantastic Museum,"From start to finish, an excellent museum to see!  Entrance is free and there are programs you can donate a couple pounds to have.  I found the programs super helpful - there are suggestions of the top highlights to see which guided me and I was able to see them all!  The map is easy to navigate and the museum is so well labelled that I had no difficulty making my way through the museum.  From the Egyptian collection to the Rosetta stone and the Japanese Gallery, there is something for everyone.  A must see when going to London!"
"Written July 3, 2019",So very interesting...,My wife and I spent many enjoyable hours in this great museum.The staff are helpful and its designed for ease of viewing and taking in the wonderful exhibits....Well worth a visit when in the great city of London....👀Allow yourself a few hours to see most of it...Enjoy👍
"Written July 3, 2019",Edvard Munch exhibition,"Gives a great understanding of the life and work of Edvard Munch. Allow about one and a half hours to see this. Get a slot when it's not too busy. A must see, the pictures are mainly on loan from the Munch museum in Oslo.Very well thought out, information about each item well done and easy to read. Several videos with audio and subscript useful for appreciation by all in booths. Most people have heard of the Scream and seen an image of this, there is so much more to learn about Munch His skills as an engraver and printer, his travels in Europe. Most of his work was using engraved plates and wood blocks. How these were produced and used in monotone and colour printing is fascinating. Don't miss the chance to see this exhibition."
"Written July 2, 2019",Amazing Museum!,This was an amazing museum that you could literally spend multiple days in.  I had a great time seeing the amazing collections!
"Written July 2, 2019",Beautiful,"A beautiful museum with so much to look at! My best recommendation is to go in the off period though. The museum got very very crowded and not all of the rooms have fans so it was a little uncomfortable for a summer visit.The Rosetta Stone is a must see, as well as the mummies."
"Written July 1, 2019",Great museum!,"My friend and I spent a couple of hours, wandering through the British Museum. I've been there several times before but there's always new exhibits. I especially enjoy the shopping as they have unique gifts which always please my grandson!"
"Written July 1, 2019","Fine collection of ""stolen"" relics","This museum is free to the public and is stocked full of artifacts from all over the globe, especially the territories conquered by the British Empire.  These stem from all corners of the globe, so there is literally something for everyone in this museum and you could spend days here trying to see everything.  Keep in mind that this museum is open later on Fridays and happens to be in a trendy neighborhood that has tons of shops, eateries and bars.  Well worth a visit."
"Written July 1, 2019",PLAN PLAN PLAN... but awesome!,"The place is VAST and has so much on offer!  We didn't plan and just turned up and feel we wasted too much time deciding on what to go and view... in the end, we found what we wanted and had a great afternoon... we'll definitely be back again in the future. "
"Written July 1, 2019",Go there with fresh feet..... it’s huge.,Simply awesome but so big you will need hours and hours.  The problem is you will lose interest after a few hours and the kids will start wining after 90mins and won’t get to see everything.  Do it over a few days and you will enjoy it more.
"Written July 1, 2019",Not to be missed,"We took a semi private tour of the Egyptian exhibit which started prior to the museum opening to general public. If you can, sign up for this experience! We later toured several other rooms. My favorite was the Mayan Stella exhibit. The Roman classical art was tremendous. "
"Written July 1, 2019",Oh the Places You'll Go!,"My pre-teen has been reading the Rick Riodan books for a couple of years now; this was a ""must visit"" on the birthday trip.  We spent an extensive amount of time in the Egyptian, Roman and Greek section including some time discussing the Rosetta Stone and what it meant to our understanding of the Egyptian culture.  Of course, the Manga exhibit was like the cherry on top!  "
