"Written January 26, 2020",A Sunday with Leonardo da Vinci.,"I have just come home from seeing the excellent Leonardo da Vinci exhibition which was cleverly laid out. A real insight into his work which was an altar piece but the demonstrative methods of explanation and history were stunning. We are members and so the £20 entry cost was not applicable to us but that is VERY expensive for a one-off, particularly as it is a piece of art they already own anyway."
"Written January 20, 2020",Leonardo Exhibition,"The exhibition focuses on one famous painting ""The Virgin of the Rocks"" and is quite interesting.I would allow about 30 minutes for the viewing.The entrance fee of £20.00 plus can not in my opinion be justified for this exhibition."
"Written March 6, 2020",Still free!,"With a wonderful selection of art, right in the centre of London, the National Gallery remains one of the best places to visit on London.The special exhibition seem to be fairly expensive BUT are beautifully presented and worth the money.A must see in London"
"Written March 20, 2020",Great on site guides :),"I absolutely loved it. The on-site guides are knowledgeable and kind. I appreciated how they suggested additional works of art based on my particular interests. It was well worth my time to visit. There is so much material on the free access floors, but I would gladly make a donation on a regular basis or pay for the special exhibits. The description of the paintings was much more robust and engaging than other museums I visited."
"Written January 17, 2020",Great place to while away an afternoon,"Some great works of art here, lots of recognisable pieces and lots of new things to be discovered every time you visit. Free entry (donations recommended) mean it is accessible to everyone to visit.Friday evening late sessions are particularly enjoyable!"
"Written February 22, 2020","amazing collection, busy","this is an amazing museum which has some truly exceptional pieces of art from the prerenaissance through the impressionists.  The Titian exhibit was closed due to preparations for new exhibit.  Pieces by Botticelli, Raphael, Rembrandt, Van Gough, Monet to name a few.  Entrance donation is 10 pounds, and the audio tour is a must unless you already know it all or simply have no interest.  You need at least 4 hours to do it justice.  "
"Written October 21, 2020",National Gallery - Free route,"It’s a while since we’ve been to the National Gallery and our first visit with the Covid measures in place.There are 3 routes for the free collection (free ticket needs to be booked online). Everybody does A and you can then choose B or C. On arrival you are directed to the left queue if you have tickets for a paid exhibition and the right for the free collection. Both moved quickly once let forward. The time given for each route is the minimum and you can go more slowly, though sitting and sketching appears to be discouraged - understandable as they need to limit numbers in the building at any one time to be sure those inside will be able to maintain social distancing. Inside there is a one way system - clearly signed on entry to each room. It was explained on entering route A that you went to the end, followed the one way system round and then did the second aisle. Good to see the collection with less people, though it might be necessary to hold back temporarily at some pictures. There were quite a few loans / new acquisitions. We heard a number of staff telling people which rooms certain pictures were in and how to get there on the one way system so if you want to see a particular picture do ask on your way in. Staff were all polite and helpful, though understandably they sometimes had to stop people going where they wanted as it was against the one way system."
"Written January 24, 2020",Truly Epic. Must Visit.,"One of the best art galleries in the world. Full stop, period, end of discussion.  The Monets, Van Goughs and Rembrandts always draw a crowd, but whatever floats your boat is at the National Gallery.  From 13th century Medieval art up to the Impressionists leading into the 20th century, it’s on display at “the National.”Good to know: Allow a couple of hours or more on your visit.Good to know: Admission is free although they request donations. Rightfully so.If you found any part of this review helpful please hit the “Thanks” button below, and my thanks to you in return!"
"Written January 3, 2020",Feast your eyes if you love art!,"My son loves art and we spent hours and hours going thru the art collection, where my son was telling me all about Titian, and the various Venetian artists, how styles of painting have evolved in different eras and how painters as unique as one may be also copied styles from other artists... the gallery was just perfect for him, we spent hours.  I wanted to rush to the famous Van Gogh, Monet and Rembrandt paintings... but we instead we walked our way through each time period.  For art lovers, feast your eyes.  And for those who just want to click and post a picture of the art... oh well, the museum is free :) "
"Written January 4, 2020",At long last!,"I have been wanting to go here for ages but just couldn't get anyone who has an interest in art to join me. So, this holiday it was my call. We are going to the gallery and that's that and off we went.The National Gallery is just so worth while! At long last I saw sooo many of the pictures that up until now I had only seen in encylopaedias, magazines and text books. Some were much better in real life and some weren't. Overall it was just awesome.You need to be ready for crowds in the impressionists rooms especially where van Gogh's Sunflowers is to be seen. There is a permanent buzz around it.I am visiting from a country that is globally renowned as ""high risk"" at best, I was absolutely stunned to see how close a person can get to the artworks that are so fabulously valuable. It's just soooo crazy! I was unable to suppress a suspicion that I might probably be looking at copies of the famous artworks. There is just no way you would get this opportunity in South Africa.Guys and girls, with times and events changing as they currently are, I would get myself down to the National Gallery asap before someone makes a decision that maybe this treasure belongs under lock and key in a vault because that shameful day is coming sooner or later."
"Written April 29, 2022",Never disappoints!,"If you wanted to see the entire collection, I do think you’d have to spend most of the day here - but as the admission is free, if you’re short on time it’s worth visiting even just to see a few rooms. Looking at a picture of a painting in a book or on a screen will never measure up to standing in front of it and seeing it in real life - I’ll always remember the first time I stood in front of ‘Whistlejacket’ and I make sure to see it every time I visit the gallery. The range of art on display means you’re sure to see something you like, and the gallery definitely holds up to multiple visits. The shop always has such a wide range of things to purchase. The price of exhibitions can be a little steep for those on a budget, but when I have paid for exhibition tickets in the past I haven’t been disappointed."
"Written January 12, 2020","Historical collections, worth to visit","I spent only a few hours in the National Gallery, but was glad to manage to see Van Gogh, Picasso and Monet's original paintings with my own eyes.Lots os knowledge and history in this place. Need to spend a good few days to see them all."
"Written March 2, 2020",World class gallery. And it's free! But you have to walk past shouting beggars.,"World class gallery. And it's free!  It has been some years since I was here. So long in fact, that the last time I was here I entered through the main doors, rather than through the modern building to the left. Not sure what advantage to the public it is to have to enter via the modern building, because there is now a long walk to get to the gallery popular. Also, I didn't like having to walk past the official beggars just inside the entrance who  want you to pay to enter a free gallery that we already pay for through our tax contributions. If the gallery want more money, they should ask the government, not the people. Imagine entering a hospital and having the same experience. Not nice.   A donation box is fine, but the shouting beggars are not."
"Written February 4, 2020",Immersed myself with Monet masterpiece,Had a great time studying and appreciates famous and talented work of arts by legendary and other amazing and talented painters. Looking at the art strokes can make oneself  going inside the picture and you in that place of the actual location of the paintings. Imagine that!
"Written April 27, 2022",Extensive collection,"Firstly , it’s free to get in but you are welcome to leave a donation supporting the art. Although initially I saw a sign that said £24!, a quick Google and found out it’s free to enter although you do pay extra for the special exhibitions.What I did find is that a lot of the exhibits are very religious, not my cup of tea, but each to their own. Or of naked women with cherubs I think you can use your imagination. Again not my cup of tea.To get to the Van Gogh, Monet etc exhibitions you have to go to near the end of the gallery. But wow it was worth it.  I was shocked at the size of Monet’s water lilies. It’s absolutely massive. Probably 10 times the size I thought it would be. Although I didn’t think the actual painting quality was as good as I thought it would be. A little smudged, blurred perhaps. The Stubbs collection is excellent.I think what it taught me walking around is how talented these painters were. Whether the painting was my cup of tea or not. It’s hard to take in these are paintings and not photographs and how old they actually are. All this under one roof, amazing.I loved the mosaic floors near to the exit.Go through the doors to the outside and take some photos from the balcony, overlooking Trafalgar Square and Nelson Column spectacular.It’s well worth taking some time out of your day to visit."
"Written February 22, 2020",A touch of enlightenment away from the shopping,"Right on Trafalgar square, the National gallery beckons, but I rarely respond. This time I walked in. If you have a taste for the classics, you can spend a  few hours with Van Eyck, Velasquez, Rembrandt, and the like. I think more modern fare than the grand masters of yore would not go unappreciated, but this us definitely a must. "
"Written February 9, 2020",In the company of masters,"The National Gallery is always wonderful to visit as one of London's gems. To be in the company of the various masters and feast one's eyes is a gift, to do so for free is just unreal. The National Gallery requires multiple visits. "
"Written April 10, 2022",Good exhibition but not my favourite museum in London!," I love museums but don't come here that often as most of the exhibitions don't appeal to me.  I came today after a while to see the Kehinde Wiley - The Prelude which was very good.  Entrance is free.  This exhibition was very small so you don't need long.  I really enjoyed it.  The only thing is that the museum is super busy on a Saturday afternoon so it was difficult to appreciate the art without bumping into people.  It appeared to be or maybe I got it wrong is that they were managing numbers and I had to book a free timed entrance ticket. This was not checked however so not sure what the point was.  I may have got it wrong as I said but check online.  They will do a security and bag check.  There was a line to enter the museum but it moved really quick.  The museum is well laid out.  Staff were pleasant and friendly.  Entrance and what appeared to be most exhibitions were free but again check online.  Nothing else appealed to me when I glanced around but I would highly recommend Kehinde Wiley - The Prelude (only on for a short time).  I went early April, 2022."
"Written March 8, 2020",An art lovers paradise,I've been to the National Gallery a few times in my life now and I can honestly say every time I go there is always a new part of it that I discover. If you like art the National Gallery is definitely a place to visit. The collection is huge!
"Written June 21, 2020",Definitely worth a visit.,"This is a fabulous museum. I walked in as soon as they opened and didn't leave until they were closing. There is a wide variety of art from an assortment of artists, styles, eras and subject matter. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. While there was a lot of other visitors there it did not feel crowded."
"Written January 22, 2020",A beautiful place to fulfill your love for arts,"A beautiful place to fulfill your love for arts. There is also wonderful vibes around, music, very friendly turist and locals, There so many things happening at the same time outside the gallery. That Is definitely a place  that you should visit. I loved it. "
"Written September 1, 2021",Really good Rainy day option,"Love the National gallery as there is such a wide variety of paintings and masterpieces on display. Its just great to see so many master pieces that you learn about over the years. But also the building itself its utterly fantastic. Ticketing process is straight forward where you book a ticket online and then you get an email with a QR code in it. If you show up on the day they have a sign outside the main entrance which you can scan and it will take you through to the website. I spent about 1.5 hours inside just wondering through the rooms, they have three routes that you can follow and I think I covered all the rooms in my stroll around."
"Written February 1, 2020",First Visit,Having only become vaguely interested in art in the last year or so (I am early fifties) I had never visited before but my wife and I had a wonderful 2-3 hours walking around fairly haphazardly and thoroughly enjoying this time.How privileged we are to be able to enjoy such fine art for free (donations welcomed). We will definitely go back but maybe with more of a plan as there is so much to enjoy. Worth noting it is open later (9pm) on a Friday. 
"Written February 11, 2020",Lots to see for art lovers,"Visited many times, usually to see a specific exhibition, but there are also talks of interest often relating to the current exhibitions. Loads of galleries showing art from different eras and a lot are free.  Once you've been here you will probably want to return."
"Written April 10, 2020",Take time to enjoy the masterpieces,"Truly one of the world’s great art collections.  This is a museum to be enjoyed slowly.  Too many people rush through and miss some of the greatest treasures - including signature works by Rembrandt, da Vinci, Vermeer, Raphael, and Turner (among others).  Their dining rooms are a great place for a meal or snack.  "
"Written March 6, 2020",A fantastic treasure chest,"Not many cities can offer a selection of masterpieces completely free.. So take advantage of this opportunity and visit the NG! Since entrance is free you don’t have to spend hours inside just to get your money’s worth: pop in to see some paintings, and maybe come back another day and look at another section. Italian masters are fantastic, great Turners and Constables and an impressive collection of Impressionist paintings! A good tip for quality gifts is the museum shop, it offers such a variety of items you wish you’d been there before buying all your souvenirs!"
"Written July 17, 2020",Perfect Post-Lock-down Gallery Visit.,"This was a lovely way to return to visiting galleries post lockdown.I was very pleased when The National Gallery reopened and booked an open visit-something which now needs to done.The organisation is excellent- well done to the director and staff!The queue is not long, and everyone was able to enter at their allotted time. There is a choice of three routes to follow.I chose Route B, which includes the Flemish/Dutch Old Masters and The Impressionists- both favourites of mine. The route is clearly marked and the lack of crowding makes it so much easier to view the works clearly and at leisure.The staff are helpful and the whole experience is calm and relaxed.I have already booked to visit the Titian exhibition next monthAll in all, a perfect return to London's wonderful art world!"
"Written March 9, 2020",Beautiful paintings,If you love paintings then  you would love this place and you could quite easily spend 2-3 hours. The paintings are absolutely mesmerising  and appealing to all ages. The Gallery  encourage School trips and run exciting workshops.
"Written March 17, 2020",A must for art lovers,"The National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery have a vast collection of portrais from all the best and most brilliant painters of all time. While you walk around the contless rooms displaying masterpieces you probably have never seen before, except in art books, you learn also a lot of the context, the history behind what you are seen. To visit the National Gallery is a must see for art lovers."
"Written February 25, 2020",A national treasure,"One of the greatest collections in the world.  An incredible array of painters by all of the European masters. DaVinci, Rubens, van Dyke, Rembrandt, Constable, Turner, Canaletto, Raphael.  But my first reason for going is always to spend time in the impressionist galleries.  I think this diverse collection and the beautiful galleries/building that houses it are a must see for any art lover, but also a wonderful way to experience a gallery for the first time.  With free admission to the public every day and the central location of the gallery (hundreds of feet from the actual center of London) at the north edge of Trafalgar Square, it would be a shame not to go inside an experience even a small part of what the collection has to offer."
"Written March 6, 2022",Beautiful facility and collection,"Enjoyed my brief visit to the National Gallery.  All the masters are represented with works displayed.  If you're particularly into works from the medieval period, you'll find rooms and rooms full, along with later pieces from names you recognize from Michelangelo, Reubens, daVinci, Raphael, and impressionist masters like Monet.  Van Gogh has several works here as well.I spent about 2 hours wandering through.  Serious art lovers will spend all day.  Lots of people inside, but because the facility is so large, it never seemed crowded while I was there."
"Written January 6, 2020",A must visit place..,Great building. Wonderful paintings. Stand so close to the old masters. Brilliant. All for free. Don’t miss go see. Paintings to delight some will even give you a fright. All for free. Don’t miss go see. 
"Written September 12, 2021",Wonderful Art,"Visited with my 18 year old brother who is an avid art enthusiast. He absolutely loved it. If you are visiting allow plenty of time to get around the whole building. We were there 2-3 hours and still didn't see it all.The museum is free admission with a voluntary donation if you wish. Tickets are easily downloaded, we scanned a barcode outside, entered our details and tickets were emailed straight to us. There is toilets within the building and a couple of lovely, quirky gift shops. Would delivery go back. "
"Written March 17, 2020",a marvellous London museum for all art lovers,"the permanent exhibition is great but the new titian temporary exhibition is outstanding, and don't miss the film. All their temporary exhibitions are a treat - the recent Gauguin and the upcoming Artemisia, not to be missed. Cafe is also delightful."
"Written August 6, 2020",Incredible museum with immersive collections,"My favourite museum in London! Situated in the central Trafalgar Square, it contains unique collections and pieces of art that only there you are able to find. Van Gogh, Vermeer, Monet, Rubens, Rembrandt, Michelangelo, amongst many others famous artists have some of their work here. Definitely recommend! "
"Written August 28, 2020","Amazing.  Visit from 30 mins to all day, depending on your time limit.","This builkding houses some very famous paintings from some very famous artists.Definitely worth visiting, even if its to rush around for 30 mins.If you are trying to fit this into a busy day, then ask the staff where the most famous paintings are and you can see the 'best' of the museum in less than 30 mins  ;)"
"Written August 6, 2021",Nice day out!,"The National Gallery has an excellent reputation and is truly a magnificent facility. Experiencing and absorbing everything in these collections will require several trips. It is an impressive building from the outside as well as inside. A visit to this museum is definitely worthwhile. It was a pleasure to talk to the staff and learn more about the paintings. The museum I visited was very interesting. We discovered various painters, seeing different styles of paintings, and reading notes for each painting, which effectively informed us of the paintings concerned. There are several different architectural styles in the rooms."
"Written February 20, 2020",Great way to spend a few hours,"Free to enter, yet full of the most amazing pictures by the worlds most well known artist. My partner was crying with emotion as we sat looking at some of them. Just sit down, look at one area and focus on that area then slowly move out from that spot to take in all the hidden details. Loved it, this country can do some things so well, and art galleries is one of those things. Well worth a visit, and caters for children to, with art sets so they can try their hand at forgery!  "
"Written January 14, 2023",Excellent Freud exhibition apart from nude paintings of his daughters which made for uncomfortable viewing.,We came to visit the Lucien Freud exhibition which was quite expensive at £24 each. There was a lot to see and it was fascinating. There are a couple of paintings he did of his young daughters naked which made me uncomfortable and I am not sure these should have been shown.
"Written February 18, 2020",Amazing,This is such a great experience. Just the area around the gallery is so nice to visit - it is touristy but also has the Canada house just right across it. The trafalgar square is also amazing. The gallery itself is awesome as well. There is no cost to visit but you should truly make sure you have time to go through all the floors.
"Written August 26, 2020",A great free museum,The National Gallery is a great museum with free entry and is a good day out alone or in a group. It has many different wings with thousands of paintings including famous pieces such as the Sunflowers by Van Gogh. Definitely more for renaissance fans though as there is not much modern art.
"Written August 6, 2021",We are very lucky to have this collection available for us all to enjoy,"The Rembrandts are the best, although I do also enjoy some of the Impressionist paintings. Unfortunately, I am not able to visit very often, and on the very day that I visited, one of my favourite paintings had been taken down that morning. (the Vigée Le Brun self portrait)  However, one of the gallery staff directed me to another of her paintings which I hadn't seen before and also to a Gentileschi which he thought I might like, so I would like to thank him for his thoughtfulness and assistance."
"Written February 20, 2020",Great and Free!,"We went early - 10am at opening time and walked straight in. Make sure you go round in room number order, or you could miss half the gallery out.  I went for the Turners and Van Goghs.  So great stand inches away and imagine the brush strokes being applied!  A great cheap way to spend half a day."
"Written January 30, 2020",Great for a mooch in art environment,"This is a great free venue in the heart of London, metres away from the Tube and opening onto Trafalgar Square. It has a very impressive range of artworks and sculptures from all ages. Free entry and a great restaurant. Not cheap but you can sit there for hours and chat to friends,"
"Written May 31, 2021",So Great that one of THE great art galleries in the World is open again..,"It wasn't until we were actually inside that we both realised how happy we were. You sometimes dont know how great something is until you cant have it. Please ignore the bad reviews. It's really simple to book on line, then you wait until your time and you are in about 2 minutes. There are three pre set routes and you you can do them all if you want. It's was fun for us to do just one and look at paintings we hadn't noticed before. The cafe and shop are still open and neither are too crowded. And at the end look out for the six candidates for the Trafalgar Square plinth. Make sure you read the blurb as each is fascinating in their own way.Are you a Tourist..absolutely 100% visit here. It's even free! Thank you to the staff BTW. Very helpful and happy.Our tip for first timers? Dont try and see everything. And look at the architecture too"
"Written August 12, 2022",Loved the Raphael Exhibit,"In July the museum was overcrowded, many were not wearing masks, groups of students were there adding to the chaos, and it felt a bit overwhelming after pandemic lockdown mentality. That said, the Raphael Exhibition was a once in a lifetime event and I am thankful to have been able to see it. Employees and volunteers were helpful and well informed. It was a bit of a maze to find everything and having seen it all I was feeling as if I had been overloaded with beauty and so saturated I needed time to process it."
"Written November 6, 2021",Great museum but too few post 1800 works,"Very nice museum. But, too much of the exhibited Art is medieval. There’s only so many portraits or religious icons that you can see before losing interest. That said, there are a number of pieces that made our day by Van Gogh, Monet, Gainsborough, Renoir. Just too few comparatively. Signage is not particularly helpful in getting you to the periods that interest you. Lots and lots of unmasked people. You’d think art lovers would be more considerate of others. Since we visited on a Thursday, it wasn’t crowded so we kept our distance."
"Written October 23, 2020",Three well-designed routes,"Of course, you have to book in advance, but that's no problem, as long as your phone shows the booking!.  Be on the safe side - print out the ticket.  The Gallery has managed to lay out quite a few of its holdings in three separate walks, so you can see the periods of art you are particularly interested in."
"Written August 21, 2020",European Paintings over the centuries at the National Gallery.,"This place is a huge sprawling space. Trafalgar Square is always teeming with tourists. So it is really crowded. I happened to be there on a day when the population was scarce. One just gets an idea of how big the place is in the center of the London. There were street artists performing there . A bagpiper was there playing a melancholy tune. The National gallery inside is large with a lot of paintings. And I think one day is not enough to see everything. There is no entry fee. There are small eateries inside. So one can relax and take a break from continuously gazing at the canvases. Th know a little more , read London-Life around the Thames at Papumashi the Nomad."
"Written July 28, 2023",One of bucket list,"Waited 45 mins in a queue  to get in entry free, but paper maps £2 download map  done. Special Exhibition charged if you've booked you go through quick queue.   There  are  all sorts of ways to view the painting, audio, (reception)tour, and self guided. Shops on all floor no eating or drinking in the gallery but only 3 places to go to eat and drink  down stairs and then only if you buy their food and drink. (Expensive)  saw everything  I wanted to see. Went back to base."
"Written September 3, 2020",Covid secure & well planned,"I enjoyed an afternoon visiting 'old friend's (paintings) at the National Gallery. Easy to book, well organised and once inside you had enough freedom to wander where you wanted to - just like prior to Lockdown. Of particular interest was the refurbished and newly opened Rausing Gallery - magnificently restored and hung."
"Written July 25, 2021","Use the loos by the exit, the main entrance toilets don't get cleaned","I am putting this on here as a warning and piece of advice.Whilst this is a great gallery to visit. I have noticed that if you get cut short, use the loos by the exit/espresso shop. As they seem to be cleaned on a regular basis and are not a mess. I found the toilets by the entrance in a mess and the gents cubicle loos  always blocked and toilet roll everywhere. It's a shame that whilst they keep the rest of the building tidy, they want you to start off with a awful experience, and when you notify staff you just get shouted at saying 'we are busy today.' Awful customer service when I was kindly notifying them and not complaining. Well that's no excuse when you're one of the busiest attractions in London and I am complaining now, if you didn't want to listen to me the first time.Sort your cleaning schedule out, especially with covid around!!!"
"Written July 16, 2022",Fabulous art gallery,Great place to visit and free. I was slightly miffed that I booked tickets online and whilst they were free it was completely unnecessary; you just queue up at the door. The art work is varied and beautifully displayed. It’s easy to access and you can walk through and focus on your particular interest. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. Gift shops are wonderful and have so many exciting things.
"Written August 18, 2023",NATIONAL GALLERY,"The national gallery has priceless masterpieces. Famous painters like Pablo Picasso, Van Gogh and many more have their works on display here. It is located in Trafalgar Square and can have a queue of up to 2 hours. Prior booking is recommended. Guarantee 2 hours to be able to see everything and the gift shop too."
"Written March 9, 2020","Large, well presented art collection","Right in Trafalgar Square, this large art museum has an extensive collection with free admission (donations welcome).  We focused on the impressionist rooms and enjoyed the informational signage on each picture.  We spent a couple of hours, but one could spendf much longer.We saw, and spent time 2 very nice gift shops, and there is also a cafe and restaurant on the premises although there are many, many restaurants in the immediate area."
"Written January 14, 2020",A Must,"A treasure, a joy. Where else can you walk in on a whim and see a stunning collection of paintings by great artists- without paying a cent. In addition, every special exhibition (for which you do have to pay, of course) has been part of my art education. But the permanent collection! Well, the paintings in the galleries have become old friends. We savour them on every visit. The commentary on audio guides is, of course, something you must hear. We love this gallery, so much more manageable and inviting than the unique universe of The Louvre, paradisal as it is. This institution is one reason to stay happy about the world, life, culture. I mean, every visit to London we go. Without fail."
"Written October 12, 2020",print your tickets warning,"Just a word of warning rather than a full review, please make sure you print off your conformation tickets before you arrive. The staff have to scan the QR barcode thingy and I, as well as several others could not get tickets to download on our phones whilst waiting outside (and yes all brands, not just Samsung/iphones etc). The staff where helpful if a little harassed at all the people having the same trouble. Also, it's a good idea to arrive a good 15 mins before your allotted time. If you can't print off the tickets before arriving, like me,  then arrive a good 30 mins before your allotted time."
"Written May 17, 2022",A young person's perspective of the gallery,"As a young person visiting the gallery, I was initially worried about whether it was for me, due to the stigma surrounding art galleries. However, I ended up being pleasantly surprised by just how captivating the art being showcased all over the gallery was to me. I would definately recommend to people of all ages, not just adults as it is far better than what usual art galleries are presented as."
"Written February 23, 2020",No surprise-great collection!,"A great museum with something for every art lover.  If you like Impressionism, the Gallery has a great selection; if you like other periods, they’re equally well represented.  A don’t miss:  The Execution of Lady Jane Gray by Paul Delarouche — superb!"
"Written January 5, 2020",Plenty of information and staff on hand to help,The exhibits here are a hood mix of modern and old. There is a member of staff in every room who can answer questions about the paintings. Each painting has information about it on the wall. The only issue we had was that it is like a rabbit warren and naps on the venue were difficult to find. 
"Written August 18, 2021",It’s the national gallery - worth your time.,"You could spent hours/days fully appreciating the art work here.From popular know artist to talented artist you may not of heard of.Come and enjoy your day, losing yourself in the art.Cafe and toilets availableHad to book in advance (Covid)"
"Written July 31, 2022",One of the top five large museums in Europe,"The National Gallery has something for everyone. You won't find an art museum this extensive for free anywhere else in the world. Leonardo, Van Gogh, Van Eyck...this collection has several masterpieces. Spend 1-2 hours seeing the highlights or spend an entire morning or afternoon and see the whole collection."

Some exhibitions are chargeable, but you have the option.Cafes/restaurants offering snacks with drinks to cooked meals for both the hunters and farmers.Adequate seating in each hall/room should you need to take a rest."
"Written March 4, 2022",A Good Way to Kill Time,"It's a free museum that you can spend as little as 30 minutes or as long a few hours inside. The inside of the building has some really amazing marble work, intricate ceilings, as well as some amazing frames. The paintings are nice as well but I enjoyed the other aspects more personally. It's a great escape from the rain and a good way to kill time if you aren't sure what else to do with your day. Plus! there is a really cool view of Big Ben right outside by the statues."
"Written April 3, 2022",Worth your time,"I did a speed-run through this, as it was an impulse to go in, and I had a date with my husband later on to go to, but I spent 40 minutes and got to see all the artists I wanted to see. As a plussize person with back problems, I would love more seating throughout, but I suppose that's a covid or securitymeasure. But don't speed-run it like me - there's so much to see!"
"Written December 3, 2020",There's never been a better time to visit.,"Selfishly, have never enjoyed being able to wander the galleries so much since it was almost empty. Their crowd control and routing has been magnificently done. Even the 15 minutes waiting outside in the rain and cold was bearable thanks to the quips and encouragement from their security gentlemen."
"Written September 26, 2020",Wonderful Museum,"First museum visit post lockdown. It was a wonderful experience being in the gallery with very few visitors but I think I prefer normal life with the crowds. This is a magnificent gallery, rooms filled with artistic treasures and save for special exhibitions all free.  If you live in London and love art it is worth becoming  a member."
"Written January 24, 2023",A must see while in London,"The National Gallery is a must see if you are visiting London. Entrance is free. We went during the Christmas break so you can imagine it was crowded but still as the place is really big and we went 3 hours before closing then we were able to see eveything without the million of people around. I would recommend going on a Friday as they close later. All the paintings they have are amazing, you will find something you like for sure, all the galleries were beautiful and it's easy to follow a path and not miss one. Great place to visit if you like paintings and even if you don't at leats to have a look around."
"Written October 24, 2020",Great art collection,"The museum is fairly large so you want to plan your visit accordingly. The art collection is deep and covers several art movements. It is well worth a visit, especially considering that it is free. There is a cafe' inside so you can rest when you want to take a break. "
"Written November 3, 2021",See the special Poussin Exhibition,"I recommend going to the time-limited exhibit on Nicolas Poussin.  The exhibit explains HOW artists work and includes some wonderful companion pieces from antiquity as well as the famous triple portrait of Cardinal Richelieu, a patron of Poussin.  The catalogue is detailed and worth purchasing."
"Written July 12, 2020",Unique Opportunity,Just returned from a lockdown visit to NG. We went to see the Titian exhibition but also visited the equally interesting show about Dutch master Nicolas Maes. But most incredible of all is that you get to see everything with no more than 10-15 people in a room at once. Many rooms are completely empty and you have them entirely for yourself. Grab this amazing opportunity whilst it lasts. 
"Written February 11, 2022",wonderful,"it has always been a must see for for many, many years and the one thing I always do when visiting London. the overly cautious and tiresome entrantance requirements are unfortuneately a sign of the times but once in the joys of centuries of art is there to be seen. although I appreciate 'the blue boy' the turners and monets are where I tend to spend my time"
"Written August 29, 2020",Wear comfortable shoes !,"First time visiting but well worth it to see such famous and inspiring works of art.Reubens the Lion Hunt is a very underrated gem.Booking system great as let’s in a set amount of people every 15mins so social distancing easily kept. A lot of walking and standing around looking at wonderful art you can stretch out and almost touch, wear good shoes though."
"Written September 22, 2020",Back to normal life?,It was so great to be back! London was quiet but that did not spoil our day at the Gallery. Very well organised outside and inside so you feel safe and are allowed to admire the masterpieces the way you used to do. And the Shop was open too!
"Written July 24, 2022",A must see while visiting London,This is a wonderful place to visit while in London. You can spend hours here viewing some of the greatest artists in the world.If you are tight on funds (you can visit for nothing) but if you can please leave 10-pounds. I guarantee you will be amazed by the beautiful art that is here
"Written January 28, 2023",The quality is declining,Every time I go to National Gallery I gel like the quality of the experience is worse and worse.The art is interesting and you can definitely find artwork to suit your preferences. However the management is terrible. I’m not sure why there is an online booking in place if you have to queue to get in anyway. Also I would imagine the reason to book is to limit the amount of people inside so you have a better experience.  But apparently I imagined wrong. Cafe and restaurant is not in the best shape either. Better have your coffee beforehand.
"Written February 1, 2020",Leonardo exhibit,"Always a pleasure to go there, we heard the curator give a talk about mounting the exhibition. It was interesting but l found that it was difficult to maintain the interest for the whole time. I may not attend future talks of this nature."
"Written January 21, 2021",Great place. Starting from middle-ages ending in 20th century.,This is a fantastic Art Gallery with fabulous paintings.  They have an exhibition on at the moment showcasing the art of Artemisia Gentileshi an amazing female Baroque painter who was trained by her father.  The colours are sumptuous and the paintings all tell stories.  Well worth a visit.  They also have Titian and other great artists.
"Written August 1, 2022",Free Masterpieces,"I wasn't planning to go to an art museum in London because I didn't have a lot of time, but I walked by the National Gallery and saw that it was FREE. The collection is amazing, and it gave me Stendahl Syndrome. I appreciated that there are several suggested routes with estimated times for each route--so if you're on a tight schedule, you can choose what you want to do. I spent around an hour in the museum, although I was tempted to linger longer. They have DaVinci, Michelangelo, Van Eyck, Impressionists. In every gallery my jaw dropped, and I thought ""THAT is here!?"" I was really excited to see Canaletto's paintings of Venice.  The entrance is free, but I got in trouble in the gift shop."
"Written August 1, 2022",So much to see and it's free!,"We've walked by the National Gallery so many times on previous trips to London and finally visited. The line was very short so we went in. Glad we did. It's filled with so many treasures. The signage gives an estimate on how long it takes to go through each main gallery but maybe only if you speed walk and see the highlights. We ended up spending a lot more time here - maybe 3 hours - and we didn't see it all. Love how you can go from the earliest pieces in the collection to more modern art. You could easily spend a full morning or afternoon exploring the galleries in more detail. There is no entrance fee, like many large London museums, which is absolutely amazing."
"Written October 11, 2020",An example for others to follow.,"Post Covid the national gallery has shown others how it should be done. They opened as soon as possible, the cafe is open and all of the exhibitions are open and well worth a visit. Yes you have to pre book but that is u fortunately life at the moment. Where other institutions complain, out reopening in the too difficult pile and get the begging bowl out, the National Gallery has got on with reopening. Well done."
"Written February 20, 2022","Great collection, but you wonder through it aimlessly","The collection is impressive and vast, and the spaces are inviting, well lit, with information plaques by each painting and comfy seats. However, while galleries are dedicated to specific artists and schools of art, the order of galleries is nearly random, and the 3 suggested rautes don't provide information beyond a list of artists, let alone thematic or chronological order explained. Since covid, there has been no audio guide, and all you can do is stand very close to the paintings and read, trying to figure out where you are and where to go next. "
"Written February 18, 2022",Book ahead,"We booked on line and entered at opening time. Leaving there was a big queue and this was Friday morning, Saturday morning the queue was even longer.The building inside is worth seeing as well as the art of course. We were fortunate to see the Blue Boy, this was last in the National Gallery 100 years ago.Great cafe, a touch pricy, but it is supporting the gallery and the cakes were very - very good."
"Written October 26, 2020",Great Gallery...........,"We had prebooked our entry to the gallery although it was free to visit. We were unable to enter until our allocated time as it was fairly busy. Gallery staff were very helpful.Although we saw most of what we wanted to see we found the one way system quite restrictive in as much as if you make a wrong turn you can’t go back. Fully understandable in the circumstances. Some paintings ie Sunflowers were out on loan.Recommended but would like to go back when the restrictions are lifted.Could have looked at The Haywain for ages, beautiful."
"Written November 30, 2022",Not to be missed!,"There was no need to line-up, whilst entry was free.  The art on display was excellent and would highly recommend, if you have a few hours to spare.  To do it proper justice, spend the day, taking in this treasury in Trafalgar Square."
"Written October 18, 2020",Not too much to see but cannot complain as it is free.,Majority of the artwork is Christian themes and not of the works of famous artists but of their portrait work they would have been employed to complete for various unknown people that had requested their services. Some of the artist names promoted are misleading as such as having Michael michaelangelo's name in the signs only to have 1 unfinished piece by him but the museum had a vast collection. The latter stages of the gallery and more interesting works. Mostly cannot complain as it was free.
"Written June 14, 2023",Impressive Collection of Paintings,"Some forty rooms to explore. It has an amazing collection of masterpieces with works from Botticelli, Caravaggio, da Vinci, Michelangelo, Monet, Raphael, Turner, van Gogh and more. The Ambassadors and the Arnolfini Portrait were two classic paintings that I had read about and finally got to see. Reserving a time slot online allowed us to bypass the line on a Saturday. Great art museum."
"Written June 29, 2021","Wonderful, varied collection of art","I come to this gallery again and again, as my favourite in London. There is an outstanding array of art displayed beautifully in the architecturally stunning building. For anyone visiting London for just several days this is the gallery I would tell them to visit."
"Written June 26, 2022",Displays great. Staff attitude sucks!!!,"Displays and building amazing. Staff suck!Loved our short time Looking at the amazing displays they have but the staff let the place down. Had a child with us and wanted to use the restrooms on our way out and where refused even though it was only 5.49pm. Even when trying to tell them it wasn’t 5.50pm and all the other bathrooms were already closed, hence why trying to use  the ones at the exit we were still denied. The 2 Staff manning the toilets wanted to do just argue, and say we should have come sooner. Really? I have been trying to take the kids to the bathroom since 5:40pm when the announcement was made when we were in the depths of the C section!!! All on that side where already closed!!!!But attitude changed when we indicated we would write a review, about how staff trust kids!!! Their attitude changed and then begged us to use the restrooms. At this point we declined as why should someone have to argue for a child to use a restroom. National Gallery, sort your staff out. Not only have they given your wonderful institution a bad image, that’s all the kids remember of the day. They couldn’t use the bathrooms. Sad!!In short, if you need to use the bathroom, make it a priority over looking at the wonderful artwork!"
"Written November 5, 2022",Lucian Freud + the classic masterpieces of this museum work wonderfully together!,"I have been here many times and I am a fan of this museum - and this time it was extra good for two reasons: it was Friday night, and open till 9 pm, which meant that there were many people there, and many apparently on dates, and discussing the art in a most charming way. The atmosphere was lovely, high spirited, filled with expectations and joy. Also: there was a Lucian Freud exhibition on display - and he was a master of grotesque human portrait (often with a dog). I have not seen this many of his works together before. And it all makes sense, from beginning to end, including a finding of peace with his mother. So my advice is to buy a ticket to the Freud exhibition and be happy. And always see some of the other masterpieces on display. This is best of the best; best from old times."
"Written January 30, 2022",Durer's Journeys- National Gallery.,"This lovely exhibition is well worth a visit. Anyone who is an art lover, especially of renaissance art, will thoroughly enjoy this.There is plenty of information, the works are well and chronologically arranged and the journal extracts are fascinating.The works are well spaced too and the booking system means that the galleries do  not become too crowded.All in all, a very worthwhile and enjoyable  exhibition visit.The espresso bar downstairs serves good coffee too!"
"Written December 15, 2020",Seen/unaeen,"Visited the interactive gossaerts adoration sense  unseen exhibition. What a revelation! Please present more paintings in this format. Wow!

"Written November 20, 2021",Great collection of art you've likely only ever read about,"My wife and I have toured london several times and always seem to miss this gallery. We made it a point to include it on our most recent trip. The museum is laid out nicely, and the works are not too cramped with lots of space provided for those who wish to really lean in and pick a painting apart. Three routes are available, ranging from 25 min to 45 min each. Over all not disappointed, and I would suggest a visit even if you're not particularly an art fan. Our visit didn't have any guided tours (Covid19) but I was told they normaly do them regularly and that is the best way to see the National Gallery. "
"Written February 24, 2020",Utterly stunning art.,"The art that me and my saw was absolutely stunning. Some of the paintings are jaw droppingly beautiful. We spent two hours in there, Entering the building from the right hand side as you look at it from the square outside. Even after two hours it felt like we only scratched the surface.Even if you are not a fan or art this place is free to enter. Honestly one of the best places i have ever visited in London."

Anthony was engaging, bringing the history alive with stories about the artists,  the collection, England ( and Europe), as well as his personal experience working for the Vatican.  Great museum and great guide in Anthony!"
"Written August 17, 2020",Caravaggio's Are Supreme,"MY wife and I visited the National Gallery in August 2020 and really enjoyed it.The COVID restrictions were well thought out, plenty of social distancing and hand sanitiser.The gallery is huge. For us it was all about the 3 Caravaggio's. The road to Emmaus was amazing. and we recommend a visit. We had  a great morning enjoying all the world class art."
"Written April 3, 2022",Lovely way to spend two hours,"This Gallery should be on everyone's bucket list to do in London at some point. The array of art is staggering and the added technology allows additional insight into the works in front of you. There is probably too much to fully enjoy in one helping and given the scale of the collection it is probably better not to rush and miss Sunflowers by Van Gogh, The Blue Boy by Gainsborough and a whole host of famous works by the likes of both British and European artists"
"Written February 10, 2020",Leonardo da Vinci- Virgin of the rocks,Very interesting analysis of the way L da V thought and studied the way light falls on objects. there are many displays and it all leads to his painting of the Virgin of the Rocks. A very well presented exhibition and worth going to if it is still running.
"Written August 29, 2022",A DO NOT MISS while in London!,"This is a MUST SEE while in London, England. Admission is FREE, and this museum is air conditioned (a BIG plus). Tickets are easy to reserve on line, but there were people getting in without Tickets.  Backpacks are allowed, and we brought in a bottle of water.  There are bathrooms,  a gift store and restaurant.  This museum features European Art from the 13th to the 1900 and has paintings by renowned artists such as Monet, Leonardo Da Vinci,  Titian, Vincent van Gogh and Rembrandt. I loved the way the gallery is organized, and the way the exhibits flowed easily. Staff were present, but didn't 'hover' , like they donin some museums. A MAGNIFICENT Museum, in every way"
"Written June 19, 2023",Visit spoiled by bad experience in the gift shop,"We had a wonderful time in the Gallery. One of the great things about London and coming to visit in central London are the number of galleries and museums that you can go to, with the vast majority of them being free. The range of paintings and exhibits in the National Gallery are amazing and there are pieces that will appeal to everyone's tastes. You don't have to be an expert to have a view upon art or to appreciate the skills and craft of some of the artists upon display. We booked a morning slot on a Saturday morning (you can queue on the day to get in, but I would advise going online and booking a slot in advance) and we expected it to be busy, and it was. But strangely enough it didn't feel too bad. Normally when you go to museums and galleries or to any popular tourist attractions, you can end up feeling 'rushed' and slightly hemmed in by the crush of people around you, and this is especially true regarding popular exhibits. In the National Gallery, although it's busy, there are always moments where the hurly burly settles, and you find your those moments of peace, to enjoy the works of art. And with plenty of seats (something other galleries and museums could learn from), there are chances to wait things out, and just sit and enjoy the experience. It was all a great day out until we stopped off in a gift shop just as we were leaving the museum. Upon waiting to pay for some gifts a member of staff refused to serve me, instead serving another customer, even though she looked up and saw I was next in line waiting to be served. I was instead served by her colleague, who when I raised the matter apologised, but It unfortunately tarnished what had been up until that point a great day out."
"Written May 17, 2020",Incredible art collection,"An elegant museum housing a very nice collection of over 2,300 paintings. Approximately two-thirds of the pieces were donated by private collectors (likely in exchange for a tax receipt). Wonderful collection, and rated as one of the world's top ten."
"Written September 15, 2023",Big and busy but still really enjoyable,"In spite of being very large and busy I really enjoy the National Gallery. I didn't do a tour, preferring to just wander at my own pace, and spent about 2 and a half hours. I'd last been in 2021 and there were a surprisingly large number of works that weren't on display the last time. I visited during the After Impressionism exhibition which I really enjoyed. I have a National Art Pass, which works out very good value if you're going to visit a number of galleries, and even though the National Gallery is free to get in the temporary exhibitions are often paid entry."
"Written July 13, 2021",A relaxing visit,"This gallery has a comprehensive array of stunning early English and Flemish pictures which we particularly wanted to see as well as fantastic Caravaggios, Rembrandts,Pre-Raphaelite art and so much more. Good social distancing made this a stress free experience. Well stocked shop, too. The only down side, as we came out was the site of the poor cleaners having to sweep up the huge amount of glass around the lawns and shrubs left by the football mob which descended on the square. The guy out front looked crestfallen as they`d also destroyed all the shrubs."
"Written February 29, 2020",Alot of famous paintings here!,"I was finally able to visit this museum on this trip and loved it.  They show cased a Vincent van Gogh gallery, 2 unfinished Michelangelo's and 2 Leonardo da Vinci paintings.  I was blown away!  3 magnificent artist under one roof.  I will prob be back again soon to visit more parts of the gallery!"

An awesome experience from start to finish.Simple and efficient booking online, well organised queuing system for your allotted entry and friendly and welcoming staff.My visit lasted 3 hours and I can honestly say I enjoyed every minute of it. The building itself is beautifully maintained and the pieces of work... Well, stunning.I felt extremely privileged to be able to view and photograph so many canvases in such a beautiful environment.Absolutely amazing visit. "
"Written November 19, 2023","Awesome, and free","TIPS: As with all great museums, do some planning beforehand and decide what it is that you want to see. Then go early before the crowds and, for this gallery, do book - its free and you can book even a few minutes before entry. Booking allows you to go to the front of the queue. Enjoy ! "
"Written April 19, 2022",A grand day out,"One of the great museums of the world crammed full of beautiful pictures in a building which is a work of art itself in stone. It has many of the iconic pictures with which we in Western Europe are so familiar, and many more pictures which are arresting in their beauty and skill. Every gallery has something to make you stop and stare and marvel at the artistry that lay behind it. We went to see The Blue Boy and were not disappointed with it- a work of radiant beauty. It is displayed beside other pictures by Gainsborough and Van Dyck to put The Blue Boy into context. We are so blessed on London to have so many of these magnificent Victorian museums and I think the National Gallery one of B the best."
"Written January 23, 2021",National Gallery,"You don't have to be an art lover to love this place. Even if you didn't know anything about art before, after one visit you surely will. Because they have painitings there that can capture and mesmerise even a dumb brain dead person like me so it means it is definitely something.Besides just like many other world class museums in London, it's totally free so you have the right to remain silent and not moan/complain even if it's not your cup of tea. Because unlike many low levels attractions in US, you didn't pay a dime to go inside."
"Written January 1, 2020",Outstanding,"After having visited London several times over the last 25 years i finally manged to visit the National Gallery. What a treasure and and unbelievably free. Great layout, easy to navigate and if you know what you want to see you can access those rooms with ease. Yes there's a scrum at Sunflowers but be patient and you will be rewarded. Brilliant selection of the impressionists and Italian masters. An absolute must for art lovers"
"Written April 24, 2020",World class art collection with a programme of art exhibitions,"We are indeed fortunate in London to have the National Gallery with its world-class art collections and programme of international exhibitions, which have moved on-line in the current environment. On of the joys, not to be missed, are the smaller exhibitions, often of more contemporary or modern work, complementing the main collections.  Earlier in the year, one such exhibition was of paintings and studies by the young David Bomberg alongside paintings he admired and was inspired by in the National Gallery.One was so controversial in its day – a study of Canadian tunnellers as a First World War memorial – that is was rejected as an ‘abortion’ by the Canadians’ art advisor.  You can understand why – it must have been challenging at the time; today we can admire the energy, power and darkness that Bomberg created in the work.Not only a link into the collections of the National Gallery itself, but also to other galleries in London which display Bomberg's work."
"Written March 29, 2021",Stunning,This is definitely one of the best thing you can do in London. The fact that it is free just makes of even better. We went there twice on two different days in the late afternoon after we've already visited other monuments. I just can't believe the art collection they have there. The old part of the museum where the modern paintings stand is very well organised. The new part with the old paintings from the 1200/1300s is not as well organised but you can still enjoy the artworks. 
"Written June 9, 2020","A top 5  ""must visit"" location in London.","There's something for everyone here and because entry is essentially free (donations gratefully accepted) , one can spend a short time viewing selective paintings of interest within an hour. We aimed for  Sunflowers by Van Gogh and Ballet dancers by Degas. A very enjoyable experience. "
"Written February 25, 2020",Stunning Art collection,"National Gallery is one of my regulars galleries to visit in London. It is massively big with stunning art collection. the location is also convince in central London near Waterloo, Leicester Square and Piccadilly circus. I like Impressionist and Post Impressionist rooms and often rest at the cafeteria after a couple of hours visit."
"Written September 27, 2022",Brilliant as always,"If I am in London, I am at the National Gallery no matter what, so it was my fifth visit. This time I had only 90 minutes to spend because I had a timed ticket to the newly renovated Courtauld Gallery. As always, I headed to Leonardo Da Vinci’s “The Virgin of the Rocks”, the painting I adore along with its other version in The Louvre. Then it was divine Botticelli’s “Venus and Mars”, which had a whole new meaning for me because just before my trip I had finished reading “The House of Medici” by Christopher Hibbert. Continued with the Sainsbury Wing admiring masterpieces of Van Eyck, Michelangelo, Andrea del Sarto, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Hans Holbein, Durër… all of them wonderful…I also had some time left for the two paintings comparison exhibit: Picasso’s vs. Ingres’s (Madame Moitessier). In all honesty, I didn’t find any similarities, except for the pose of the two women, but it is not too important - both paintings are beautiful. Do not get discouraged by the long line to enter the National Gallery - it moves very fast and you will pass security check in no time."
"Written March 3, 2022",Big building full of paintings,"It is what it is.  It’s free to enter (which is a bonus) and, if one can avoid the school parties, a relaxing and interesting couple of hours low-key entertainment.For the art-uneducated visitor I found it quite it interesting to stumble across famous works and to be surprised by their size and details which are missed in printed depictions.The gift shop was surprisingly well priced (possibly catering for the aforementioned school trip purchases).All in all there are worse places to kill time on a rainy day in central London."
"Written October 27, 2023",Great museum,"We reserved these tickets online during our layover, and they were Free, requiring only advance booking. Exploring the plethora of exquisite paintings and artworks was a delightful experience. Although art isn't my particular passion, I found it enjoyable. The gallery is conveniently situated in the downtown area, near Westminster station and other notable landmarks. If you happen to be in London without any prior engagements, I highly recommend visiting this cultural gem."
"Written June 26, 2020",Great works of art,Definitely a must see if you're visiting London. So many great works of art are located here and all are available for a donation. Allow yourself a minimum of 3 hours to go through the museum to really enjoy what it offers. You will see amazing works of art from the masters.   
"Written January 9, 2020",Great place to visit - inspiring exhibitions,"I always love popping into the National Gallery or National Portrait Gallery next door, when I'm in the area. They are big enough to handle the crowds of tourists so that you won't really feel them. The exhibitions are extraordinarily well-curated and worth checking out. "
"Written December 29, 2021",Exhibits Five Star,"The art is exceptional: no doubt about it. The layout is genius and the building is stunning.The gallery is let down by organisation. You have to get your free ticket before entering. This entailed everyone standing around a QR code on the wall, completing a long form and waiting for their ticket to arrive by email.Then you queue again to enter. Someone waves a torch inside some of your bags and finally you are allowed to enter the gallery."
"Written March 1, 2020",Enjoyable afternoon,"Spent a very enjoyable afternoon, looking at the impressionist art and gift shop at the national gallery. It’s free to visit and we’ll organised. They ask for a voluntary donation, we’ll worth a Visit if you enjoy art."
"Written December 14, 2020",Breathtaking exhibition of paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi,"An astonishing achievement to bring so many paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi together at one time, including some from private collections and others from across the world.  Amongst those I have not come across before was her 1636-7 “Bathsheba bathing“, with David almost invisible away in the background a virtually amorphous dark lump on a balcony: all the colour; all the personality in Bathsheba and her maid servants, and the relationships between them.  The staff were universally welcoming and friendly: not easy with the various requirements to wear face-nappies &cetera: these requirements are not of their making, and even though pointless they have to be enforced.  A fabulous visit.  "
"Written January 12, 2020",Great in theory,"I know this will go against the grain. The National Gallery is free, it is a beautiful building, it is full of famous and less famous paintings of the highest quality from across the centuries. If you are an art historian or budding art historian it must be one of the greatest resources in the world. Sadly I have my fill of messiahs, wistful saints and impenetrable allegory pretty quickly (there's one that's captioned ""this might be an allegory on the pain of love or it may be a picture of a girl"", if they don't know...).There is little here I would have on my wall at home and they are the paintings I can gaze at and enjoy. So from a purely selfish, subjective viewpoint there are galleries that appeal to me far more than this one, hence the rating.Go, enjoy but don't expect to enjoy every room. On top of everything else they do well the dining room is good too."
"Written February 12, 2020",The gateway to Westminster!,"Trafalgar Square is very impressive - it was only 10min from Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace! There is also the sublime National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery and there are always shows or activities for every occasion including Chinese New Year, Christmas, Hanukkah and even demonstrations where people cry their hearts out on stage below Nelson’s statue.Finally Trafalgar Square is what it’s name says - I personally love that the statue of Nelson is face to face with that of Napoleon in Paris. An old rivalry so close to British politics and heart. And, if I’m not mistaken it is just a few minutes walk away from the famous Savoy hotel! Who’s name comes from the Palais de Savoie which previously stood in its place and was The designated place for French foreign royal emissaries to stay when they came to visit the British Crown before the revolution of 1789. Perfectly located between Westminster and The City.A great visit and must see for any person who wishes to have a feel for what London is about."
"Written March 5, 2020",For the love of Art.,"A rich learning experience. Breathtaking. Art through the ages. Paintings by Old Masters. I particularly visit 'The National Gallery' to see Impressionist and Post Expressionist artists like Degas, Monet, Modigliani and Cezanne and Chagall. I particularly like portraits. I enjoy pottierng in 'The Gallery Shop' and stopping for a spot of cafe lunch or a cup of reviving afternoon tea at 'The Cafe'. A great place to spend a rainy afternoon."
"Written February 11, 2020",Great for the 1st date,"A little bit of culture goes a long way, that's why many a good relationship as started from treading the galleries at the Nat....beautifully designed halls welcome and encourage you to explore its interior. Straight away from outside you are greeted by the smile of the Roman columns across the gallery facaded....but once inside the world of Art is there to show off it's very best from throughout the ages and across the globe. I for one believe it's a natural place for a 1st date, and set within one of the worlds most romantic cities."
"Written February 10, 2020",lovely gallery,"I always like coming to the national gallery it is very clean, the people who work there are helpful and the things in the gift shop are usually quite nice. it might be nice if they had more of a variety of mini-prints in the gift shop, but mostly can appreciate the paintings in real life when you are there. The cafe has good service also and isn't as overpriced as some of the other museum cafes in London."
"Written February 24, 2020",Jetlagged but awakened by masterpieces,"We got into our London lodgings and then took a bus after dinner to see some sights.  We got off right in front of the National Gallery -- and it was open!  I was revitalized by this art, many pieces I remembered from my ""History of Art"" class in college.  Well worth visiting. I used to go to the Smithsonian and Phillips Galleries a lot when I lived in DC. So I'm used to great art but this place is spectacular."
"Written March 15, 2020","I know what I hate, and I don't hate this.","We had an hour to kill before our train home, so we dropped in here on our way to the station. Entry is free, though they do ask for donations. We went to the rooms that feature mostly 19th century artists, such as Turner, Monet, Cezanne and Van Gogh - some of our favourites. The gallery is laid out in a way that's very easy to navigate and find what you are looking for, and the rooms are presented in a very logical way. Take care to look up while you walk around as the building itself is beautiful and well worth a second look.Visit. You are certain to find something to please you."
"Written January 16, 2023","Just amazing, must see artwork in the most beautiful setting","There's a pleasant surprise around every corner at this amazing gallery. I went to see the Lucian Freud, the Turner and the Manet & Eva Gonzales exhibitions all of which were truly brilliant. There's just so much to see that you could spend weeks in there and still not tire of seeing what's available. Lots of instantly recognisable artworks as well those less well known but equally as breath-taking. I turned a corner and found Van Gogh's Sunflowers which was wonderful to see. I ended up buying myself membership and their guide to everything that's on view throughout the galleries so I can make a plan to visit different areas in smaller visits. Can't wait to go back for another visit!"
"Written December 16, 2022",Vast exhibits continue to Improve,"We returned to the National Gallery in October and were impressed by the  improvements they continue to make to both the facilities and exhibits.It is also free to visit which is remarkable in pricey London. The only disappointment was their new, upscale restaurant which we found to be cramped and the food quite ordinary. Their adjacent simple restaurant is a better value in our opinion."
"Written September 1, 2022",Free and wonderful italian masterpieces,Still free. Along the years I noted in several museums (slightly everywhere) different rates for locals and tourists. This incredibile museum is still free - even after the recent past years have had great changes.Always impressed by the amount of italian masterpieces.
"Written January 1, 2020",Nipping in to the National Gallery.,"I was in London attending a funeral and after the reception I past through the National Gallery and thought I would go in. It takes your breath away, so many wonderful paintings! The restaurants are good, the best one being on the ground floor at the Charring Cross Road end of the building. It’s best to book a table if you can, but the self service area is very good, but usually busy. I like the shops in the gallery. My favourite paintings are the Cezanne still life’s, but there is so much to see."
"Written February 10, 2020",Amazing Exhibits,"The National Gallery houses a huge selection of paintings from around the world. There's something for everyone here, no matter how fleeting your interest in art may be. The gallery also has an excellent gift shop with some brilliant things to buy from postcards & notepads to books and t shirts."
"Written August 15, 2021","Vibrant, delightful, and decorated","The National Gallery is a beautiful site: not only does it house some delicate and delightful paintings from across the Globe, but it also is a beautiful building in itself. The decor is pleasing and serene, and sets a contemplative ambiance.We visited recently in COVID-19 times. You queue up outside, and very friendly staff guide you to enter and be scanned. Routine bag checks are still conducted. You are advised to book in advance.You climb the stairs, and get to select a route to walk. We only had an hour due to an engagement afterwards, so we took a shorter tour. Rooms have an expert sat in there, awaiting any questions you might have. Paintings have information about them. There are many new additions on loan, so now is a good time to go and explore.The paintings themselves are varied: there are many portraits, landscapes, and different styles of art: from Impressionism to Modernism. I don’t really know a lot about art, but I liked the variety and vibrancy of the pieces.I would definitely come again."
"Written June 27, 2021",A wonderful visit,The National Gallery offers a huge variety of art with many famous original paintings. Entrance is free though you are able to make a voluntary donation. Pre-booking is essential due to Covid 19 . We loved it.
"Written April 29, 2020",Premium London Museum,"If you're in the region of Piccadilly Circus, the National Gallery is worth a visit. This is quite an extensive museum with loads of exhibits for every taste. You'll view pieces like Sunflowers (Van Gogh), Venus and Mars (Botticelli), and Water Lillies (Monet). Even someone who isn't all that into classic art will see some exciting and recognizable pieces. You could spend all day here!"
"Written December 19, 2021",Stunning collection,"It was a wonderful experience to visit the National Gallery and view the amazing collection of paintings. So much to see, it would take a few visits to absorb it all properly. However, we saw all the paintings on our shortlist, apart from Constable's, The Hay Wain which is currently not on display. The admission is free but donations are welcome, there are also some nice shops within the building."
"Written April 15, 2020",Facsinating,This museum contains one of the largest art collections in the world next to the big museums all over the world. Its Europeanian collections and mainly the English are huge and fascinating. Its entrance is free so you can come again and again....
"Written December 7, 2020",National Gallery 4.12.20,"This was my second visit this year(1st one in July).I love visiting but on ths occasion I was a little disappointed.Here are the reasons why;1)You have to arrive fifteen minutes before your time slot,on Friday 4th December it was very cold and raining,so you coat gets wet and then once inside there is no cloak room!not a great start!2)You cant have a break to get a drink/lunch,although some of the staff say you can!after two hours I wanted to have lunch,one staff member told me this was ok and said he would look out for me to let me back in.This didnt happen,another staff  member(more senior) tried to stop me and said I wasnt allowed to return to the gallery and treated me like a naughty school for attempting to do so!I know there are covid rules in place but this was ridiculous! Iwas allowed back in(i had to be escorted back in!) I spoke to a more helpful staff member who informed me that most people only stay in the gallery for 2 hours and that I am a rare breed who wants to take her time!She advised me to book 2 slots if I want to return in the future,Ithink I will wait until things are back to normal!and visit when I want without these awful restrictions.You even have to choose the route you want to take otherwise you can miss the art you actually came to see!They should tell you that when you arrive,the staff should be adequately trained to give out the right information!This is the longest review I have written!but feel people need to know what to expect!"
"Written January 3, 2021",Great collection of art and history,"You must visit the National Gallery. Having been abroad to other nations galleries and museums, you have to pay a fee to get in, not the case with British Museum's. The collection of the art and the history on the walls are a fantastic way of getting in touch of the bygone eras. The rooms, the staff and the layout are all helpful and brilliant."
"Written August 4, 2020",A well curated visit,"Pre-booking a time slot was the way to my heart and this proved to be a fantastic way to see the incredible works of art. Three different routes around the gallery ensured that you didn’t miss anything (unless you wanted to!). Face coverings were required, but some people seemed to have rejected them by the time it got to the Impressionists. However, it was great to be able to feel safe - and there still weren’t too many people. "
"Written February 16, 2020",Such a great place!,"On a seriously wet and windy Sunday, there's no better place to go, although a lot of people had the same idea. It's a warren of rooms with  amazing art to lose yourself in from Rubens to Titian to Constable to Seurat. My favourite room, always crowded, is the one with all the impressionist art. The cafe has excellent service and wonderful food at a reasonable price. Too much to take it all in one visit but a place to return to many times. It's actually, a great place to visit, no matter the weather."
"Written March 19, 2020",Afternoon visit,I was here on last Sunday. It was a wonderful experience I saw many beautiful paintings. There was a huge variety of artists and the Gallery is huge. Spent a few hours here to try to appreciate and see everything I highly recommend going here 
"Written December 15, 2022",A Stunning Collection of Paintings,"The National Gallery in London is one of the best museums in Britain. Home to famous paintings such as the Hay Wain by John Constable, The Fighting Temeraire by J. M. W. Turner, Virgin of the Rocks by Leonardo da Vinci and Vase with Fifteen Sunflower by Vincent van Gogh amongst many more. The Gallery is also marvellously decorative with every room looking really stunning and rich. I spent 2 hours looking around, but I recommend you can spend 3-4 hours looking around taking a more of a detailed look.   There are over 2000 paintings in the National Gallery plus some temporary displays which can sometimes have an entrance fee. While I was there they had a Turner temporary display in which you can view paintings such as Cologne, the Arrival of a Packet-Boat: Evening and Harbour of Dieppe: Changement de Domicile. Overall its a wonderful experience visiting the National Gallery."
"Written August 19, 2020",Raphael Exhibition rip off,"I have been visiting lots of galleries and museums with my son this week and included a visit to the Raphael exhibition at the NG. However, I was horrified to be charged £5 each to scan a QR code so we could hear a guided tour on OUR phones, using OUR headphones. The exhibition cost a whacking £25 each and then £10 on top of this was a total of £60 for us both. We were not charged to scan a QR code for a guide at any other museum or gallery. I find this to be greedy and poor judgement on the part of a reputable gallery.This is no way to entice a post pandemic audience in who are feeling the pinch with the added issue of the cost of living going up. I wouldn't say the guide was worth it either. Disappointing is an understatement."
"Written July 15, 2022",Great art / hard to navigate,Undoubtably contains a trove of great art.  With all large museums though it can be a little overwhelming especially if you are familiar with the history or the range of artists.  I would suggest planning your visit before you come so you dont get overwhelmed.
"Written January 4, 2020",Titian exhibition,"We were pleased to be able to see some art after many months without a visit to a gallery.  The Titian exhibition was very good and was well organised from the Covid perspective at the arrival point, although inside not all visitors are quite so good at maintaining social distance as you might hope.  The instructions are clear though and fortunately with limited numbers it is fairly easy to find space to avoid those individuals."
"Written October 8, 2020","We like everything of it, also the cafeteria.","It is one of the places that I could always visit, all year round, every day, in the snow, in the rain, even if, to tell the truth, I know almost all of its works, apart from those of the special, temporary exhibitions.The National Gallery is full of great Italian and foreign artists.We have admired Raphael, Tintoretto, Titian, Vasari, Mantegna but also Van Gogh and Gaugain.Not to mention the many English artists.One remains breathless for hours in front of so much beauty.Admission is free, the museum deserves more than one visit.We like also its cafeteria!Highly recommended."
"Written March 21, 2021",Great museum,"We reserved these tickets online during our layover, and they were Free, requiring only advance booking. Exploring the plethora of exquisite paintings and artworks was a delightful experience. Although art isn't my particular passion, I found it enjoyable. The gallery is conveniently situated in the downtown area, near Westminster station and other notable landmarks. If you happen to be in London without any prior engagements, I highly recommend visiting this cultural gem."
"Written October 27, 2023",Great works of art,Definitely a must see if you're visiting London. So many great works of art are located here and all are available for a donation. Allow yourself a minimum of 3 hours to go through the museum to really enjoy what it offers. You will see amazing works of art from the masters.   
"Written June 26, 2020",Great place to visit - inspiring exhibitions,"I always love popping into the National Gallery or National Portrait Gallery next door, when I'm in the area. They are big enough to handle the crowds of tourists so that you won't really feel them. The exhibitions are extraordinarily well-curated and worth checking out. "
"Written January 9, 2020",Fantastic ,"This is such a beautiful space. The works are wonderful - as you tend to get with national collections - but the gallery is just put together in such a gorgeous way. I always love visiting.£5 for the audio tour Photography is allowed but as usual, no flashes or tripods."
"Written February 24, 2020","So tiring but, amazing to walk around and free","So many amazing works of art everywhere, To visit is free though, booking a time lot during the pandemic was essential.Staff very helpful although a word of caution, do not upset them!During our visit two visitors decided the one way system didn't apply to them, it was made abundantly clear it most certainly did.There are three routes to choose from though you can do them all of course. Each takes around half hour or so depending on a lot of factors like time spent in awe or just struggling to walk.Plenty of seating although it is perhaps a little too low for many so not so easy to get up again if in pain.Clearly divided into sections which make sense and easy to skip any areas not of interest or, at quieter times, dwell on those which are of interest.Lifts are easy to get to and great for those in a wheel chair. I am disabled and left my stick at the hotel which I rapidly regretted! It really is a lot of walking and, like an idiot, I used the stairs to try and be 'normal'. Will I ever learn?"
"Written July 6, 2021",AMAZING!!,"We are  so lucky that we can go to London and enter such places like the National Gallery for free.  You don't have to be a ""luvvie"" to enjoy this experience - there is something here for everyone.  In truth it is overwhelming when you see what the National Gallery has to offer.  It breathes history - the location, the building and the collections inside.  As I get older I appreciate more and more what has gone before me. Take time out to visit the National Gallery (more than once)."
"Written June 13, 2020",Lots of art,"I fully appreciate that I may be an art philistine but wanting to drink from the cup of culture and expand my horizons I booked a tour through the National Gallery. All it did was cement my earlier opinion, (forged at the pretentious Tate Modern) that art is akin the “The Emperors New Clothes “ (You may not get that reference if you are under 50.) Insecure fools feel the need to rave about art to give themselves a feeling of superiority and a personality.Now, contradicting myself I can appreciate the immense skill of some of these artists in producing technically impressive paintings so long ago. However too many had no idea of perspective,  see a pretentious arty term, and produced work that could have been produced by a 5 year old. Oh my God, Van Gogh’s Chair.... really?If art’s you’re thing, go, but take a long hard look at yourself and see if you can’t get a life."
"Written October 20, 2020",Don't bring a large umbrella if you don't have £2!,I respect the fact that large umbrellas should go into the cloakroom in order to avoid hitting the paintings with it. But you can't demand that I put it in there and charge me £2 to do so.I understand why you charge £2 to leave something superficial like shopping which one could simply just carry around with them but you can't charge for an item that you demand someone to leave.In the past you didn't charge for large umbrellas.I work in a museum which requires its visitors to leave large umbrellas in the cloakroom but we wouldn't have the audacity to charge them for it.Also is there some reason why you don't care about your own collection getting hit by an umbrella? It would have appeared I could have walked around with it had I not visited the exhibition.

"Written August 23, 2020",Wowwww,"I arrived early (before opening at 10am) and booked my tickets on the spot so that I could join the pre-booked tickets queue which was much shorter. I’m amazed that the admission to the Gallery is free given the expansiveness of the art available on exhibition. I thought that my children (6,3 and 1 years) wouldn’t enjoy the Gallery but I was wrong. They were equally impressed by the artworks and I could see them getting immersed by the experience."
"Written December 13, 2022",No stress and we could see everythig we wanted,"Our  'Post Lockdown' visit was perfect! From the queuing to get in, the bag check and stairs up to the toilets it was safe and welcoming as possible.  You didn't feel as if you were entering a 'COVID Complaint place as everything was done with the minimum amount of fuss and stress. I do recommend visiting the toilets before you start the tour to wash off all the hand sanitiser.We had tickets for Titian: Love, Desire, Death which was really interesting- but it was just one room. `I wish I had done a bit of research beforehand, but it was all well laid out with excellent explanations. We then followed Route C then picked up Route B and ended up in the shop and cafe for a well-earned cup of tea. They limit the number of people in each room so 'social distancing' isn't an issue and you are not peering over someone's shoulder. If you see a queue into the next gallery then don't fret, enjoy the paintings as you wait as the queue moves quickly.  An excellent few hours."
"Written January 3, 2020",a good visit on a Friday evening,"by going on a Friday evening, it is open until 9pm we missed the crowds and we able to see the Gauguin exhibit in peace. Restaurant is also open, although we did not go their this time. Great gift shop"
"Written August 20, 2021",Wonderful experience,We visited London specifically to go to to the National Gallery. Entry was well regulated by prior booked tickets and this enhanced the experience with reduced numbers moving around. This gave the opportunity to appreciate the artwork without huge crowds. We were surprised how close we could get to the artwork to really appreciate the detail and techniques. Good clear signage on the floors to guide visitors around what could be a slightly confusing building. We really appreciated the ability to take photographs of art that we particularly liked and wanted a record of. A wonderful national treasure with top grade artwork. Well worth a visit.
"Written February 6, 2020","Van Gough, Monet, Cezanne, Rousseau and alot more...for FREE!","Can one tire of viewing famous old artists close up...and for free? Besides seeing lesser known but equally lovely and inspiring artists' works such as the beautiful, awe inspiring ""Whistlejacket"" by Stubbs or ""Pan and Syrinx"" by Bougher or the exquisite ""A Child with an Apple"" by Grueze and hundreds perhaps, thousands of others. Additionally, how can one not mention how the gallery rooms are designed with lovely colored walls and carved cornices and marble pillars extending so high. It is all a bit of a maze and it does one well to have comfortable shoes. Allow a goodly amount of time to properly see all the major works not to forget the outside of the museum itself with Lord Nelson looking down and the giant and majestic Lions standing guard. Many street performers as well entertain. A must see when you are visiting London."
"Written February 13, 2020",London's best painting collection.,"This gallery has by far the best and largest collection of paintings in London. There is so much to see, I usually only visit two to three rooms at a time, coming back time and again to work my way around. They also have a handy 'highlights' guide, if you don't have much time and put on some amazing special exhibitions.The shops are also fantastic, with a wide range of beautiful  items for sale. I particularly like their seasonal Christmas decorations."
"Written February 25, 2020",It's always better to see it face to face,"Whether you are a total art lover or not, the National Gallery has to be worth an hour or two of your time. From 15th century paintings that still display the most dazzling colours to the Masterpieces we all know by Van Gogh, Turner & Constable. There is too much to see but as the National Gallery is a free to enter museum then you can see what you like and go back again later. Great to see workshops laid on for younger visitors too."
"Written February 23, 2020",Quick Friday night visit left us wanting more,"We were in the area after eating at the Cafe in the Crypt (we highly recommend!) and dropped in. Because it was the end of a long day at the end of long week, we weren't able to stay long (my kids are 9 and 7). We all wanted to see more but did see some pieces by artists my kids had learned about it school. They asked to go back, but we had to leave the next day. We will definitely go back our next time in London. It is also a great chance to hang out in Trafalgar Square and take the 15 bus to see some sights."

The Gallery’s collection is among the most visited art museums in the world, after the Louvre, the British Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.We spent about 90 mins going through as much of the gallery as we could but we could not see it all. Very nice and each room is color coded. Must visit and see. "
"Written March 2, 2020",An art museum for everyone,"This is one of the top art museums in the world and well worth a visit even if you don’t love art. There are some famous pieces here that are must-sees like the Velasquez Venus and some other exciting pieces like the Gentileschi works (father and daughter) which are highlighted by the excellent guides. Many museums have excellent cafes but we were dissatisfied with the main dining hall here-overcrowded and not appropriate for people with allergies or vegans. But really, it’s London, get your food elsewhere! If you come in from Trafalgar Square, take time to walk down to the fountain and take pictures; it is a great view!!!"

You could easily spend a whole day just walking the halls although 3hours should do it for the casual visitor.Recently, I’ve been especially impressed by the COVID measures put in place: limited entry for bookings only, one-way walkways (that are actually monitored and enforced!) as well as required masks in all areas. Due to the slow drop-in of people it’s possible to enjoy the art more and feel like you have space around you. I felt very safe the whole time."
"Written March 16, 2023",Superb guided tour,"We booked a tour guide to show us the highlights of the National Gallery, and it was definitely worth it. A 2.5 hour tour, we could then spend time in the gallery to view other pieces. A fantastic range of artworks, from da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks to Holbein's The Ambassadors, Monet, Van Gogh and so many more. You could spend days in there - and of course, it's free! Incredible to see such a range of artwork without it costing a penny."
"Written January 7, 2020",Centuries of Art for everyone.,"The National Gallery is probably my favourite museum in London.The collection is wide and various, everyone can find something interesting related to the pictorial side of art, because almost seven centuries are covered.I usually visit it for a really short time: the collection is huge and takes several hours, so it's better to take some time to admire just few artists and come back the day after with some more attention.It is completely free of charge for the permanent collection, so it's the best place to be when outside is too cold and you need some time to think about the beauty of the world."
"Written January 14, 2020",Always Something New,Our third visit and we are always amazed at what we discover in this beautiful museum.

"Written January 18, 2020",Artist Leonardo da Vinci 'The Virgin of the Rocks' Experience a Masterpiece exhibition,"I happily went along to see artist 'Leonardo da Vinci' show, as a guest of a member of the National Gallery, expecting to be blown away.When we entered the 1st room, what we saw was two enlarged digital images of  landscapes, one either side of the room.These images had been blown-up to act as a backdrop, both you had to see through a wall made-up of open ended small metal squares, some of the squares had Leonardo's typed thoughts on paper. Neither of us were impressed .The second room we entered, had 3 light boxes with various objects in, all three had 4 gig sticks - that you had to move manually up or down to change the different shades of lighting, and a forth image was on a wall, this time you moved a semi circular light controller on a plinth. Yet another disappointing visual and manual activityThe 3rd room, was meant to refelt the artist studio, with all the paraphernalia and the image, one that automatically changed from outline digital canvas, colouring in the artwork, for my money, little more effort could have been done to create the studio atmosphere,  by adding some candelabra, fake or otherwise, instead the were angle poised lamps, yet another damp squidFinally the forth room, was the saving grace of the whole exhibition, with the artist Leonardo da Vinci second version of 'The Virgin of the Rocks' oil on poplar, that it is said was probably made to replace one (now in the Louvre, Paris) that Leonardo sold because the confraternity refused to pay him adequatley for it. A true masterpiece and this left me feeling, the concept was good but the implementation lack imagination"

Escape the bustle of Trafalgar Square and enter an oasis of calm and beautiful paintings for the afternoon! My daughter recently studied art history in high school so this was a must-see on our list as she adored The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck. What's nice is there is a range of time periods represented so you can view Medieval Art, Renaissance up through the Impressionists (Monet, Van Gogh, etc). so there is something for everyone! The gallery walls are painted in deep, dark colors so the paintings really pop out - a visual delight!"

This place is full of so much fantastic art you'll won't have enough time or ability to take it all in! There are a lot of very famous pictures and artists but also a lot of unknown art and artists which are all really really superb. We loved it so much we joined as members so we can go to other exhibitions. If you have time or even just a couple of hours go as it's a must to see so much really great art. The facilities and services are spot on too. Can't think of a negative thing to say about it.

Whilst I prefer more modern art styles like surrealism, cubism and the like, there was still a lot here for me to appreciate. Tip? Start at the oldest painting first and work your way chronologically - you will notice the techniques and styles change over the years"
"Written March 20, 2023",A truly magnificent art gallery.,"This may not be one of the world’s largest art galleries but it is definitely ‘up there’ with the best.It is superbly located on a raised level on the north side of Trafalgar Square.All the greats of European painting are featured here; outstanding works can be found in every room.In recent years it has expanded its usual remit of paintings of the European tradition up to around the year 1900 - I’ve been fortunate enough to visit 3 times in recent months and have viewed 3 superb temporary exhibitions; 20-and 21st Century British artist Lucian Freud, 19-and 20th Century American realist Winslow Homer, and 2 masterpieces of JMW Turner on loan from New York City’s Frick Collection.As with other national institutions entry to the permanent collection and certain temporary exhibitions is free, although a charge is made for the major temporary exhibitions."
"Written July 31, 2020",A great opportunity right now,"A positive side effect of the virus control measures is that limited entry means you get to see some amazing works of art with very few other people jostling for position. There were times when we were the only people in the room. A privilege, but also completely free (the optional donation when booking tickets is worth considering)."
"Written January 15, 2020",Gauguin exhibition. Ends Jan 26,"The public must be torn - Gauguin's art appeals to modern tastes, Gauguin's personality is anathema to the MeToo movement and modern sensibilities. But his attitude of 'art is me' is thoroughly modern - and is well represented in the exhibition. Highly recommended."
"Written June 13, 2022","Amazing collection of artwork in a stunning building, well worth seeing.",What a fabulous way to spend an afternoon. It's free to see the main exhibition but you have to pay for the special exhibitions. There's a huge selection of artworks from many famous artists from various historical periods.  The interior of the building is amazing and the galleries are beautiful.  It is a long walk around but there are plenty of seats available. There is a shop and resturants.
"Written February 14, 2020",National collection of classical art.,"This is one of the best collections of classical art in the world containing works by da Vinci, Rubens, Michaelangelo to name a few. There is an extensive pre-Renaissance collection in the Sainsbury wing that is most enlightening. It is a big collection and takes a good day to wander around casually. Enjoy."
"Written February 16, 2020",Saturday 16 February 2020,"Yes, it was a horrible wet Saturday afternoon but I adore the National Gallery. Even for someone who doesn't really know his art, it's a wonderful experience just to wander through & marvel at the beautiful building & artwork and ponder history. Very enjoyable & highly recommended. "
"Written March 6, 2020",A very large museum,"Having visited the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, I feel that this museum is quite disorganised. Partially due to the fact that they were doing restoration works in some of the rooms. The main highlght in the museum is Van Gogh's sunflowers and the Bathers at Asnières."
"Written July 7, 2023",Great museum …must see,Wonderful art museum and it’s free! I would recommend getting timed tickets before going as there are two lines and two separate entrances: no tickets and pre booked. There was also “After Impressionism” exhibition (you have to pay for exhibition) which was worth it.You must come here as it has wonderful works of art.You can’t see it all as large museum ….just take in what you can but don’t try to see everything.There also was a wonderful St Francis exhibit at same time.There is a great restaurant adjacent to museum not affiliated with museum but you can walk into it by walking past gift shop it’s called Ochre and was greatthere was a museum worker/ volunteer who was so friendly and unfortunately I forgot his name but he was amazing! but all the staff were pleasant!
"Written February 11, 2020",The Art of Us,"The museum is a cornucopia for art lovers. Some of the artist exhibited are Michelangelo, Rubens, Raphael, Rembrandt, Gainsborough, Leonard da Vinci, and Van Gogh. Please get the audio guide, it often gives information on the origin story of many works of art."
"Written January 11, 2023",My visit,"Sometime, during the year, I'd read the National Gallery would be having a Lucien Freud exhibiton of all of his paintings and drawings.  Everyone, who could go there during an evening, would be able to pay how much they could afford.  I was one of them.  But, I arrived half an hour too early but the person checking the tickets didn't mind.  I could take as much time as I liked to look round.  There were seats in the rooms for me to sit down.  There was a small shop, which sold the accompanying guide book, but I thought it was very expensive.  Afterwards, I was allowed to walk round the gallery seeing their paintings.  But, I couldn't stay long as the bus to the hotel didn't run all night.  So, I went back to Charing Cross underground station."
"Written May 16, 2022",Amazing collection of beautiful art.,"This magnificent collection occupies a number of buildings on Trafalgar Square. Entry is free, there is a cloakroom with a modest fee per article stored for the visit. The complex is huge with good signage between the various galleries but it is easy to get lost. Lifts can offer an easier passage for those a little less mobile. It is worth doing your homework before attending so that you know what you wish to see or study and maximise your time spent there. It really is an amazing experience to be able to see your favourite works up nice and close. You may know the series of Venice by Canaletto but to see up close the detail in the small figures on the quays and boats leaves one in awe of the artist. Likewise the details in the ruffs and clothing from the Dutch Masters. Toilets are clean and well maintained and there are shops to do your art or souvenir shopping. A wonderful place to visit in London even if you are not overly interested in art or history. We visited twice over a week as one’s concentration tends to wane after a couple of hours."
"Written September 22, 2021",Destination paintings.,"We travelled four hours round trip to visit the NG in a day and it was worth this and more. These are destination paintings and glorious. We spent over six hours here and still insufficient to see everything. We booked tickets online although you can just turn up but you may have to wait. You can still follow route A, B or C which was introduced after they reopened but thankfully you can now go your own route and we did. Mask wearing was encouraged and most had them on. The staff were beyond helpful and thoughtful, we interacted with several staff members and they were all lovely. We ate in the espresso bar, where the staff were equally kind and polite. The coffee and caramel brownie were delicious and reasonably priced for London. The shop had numerous books and cards to choose from. It was a wonderful visit. We joined as members and would encourage anyone who appreciates art to do the same. You get 10 % of the shop and cafe as well as free entry to the exhibitions. Moreover, it supports the gallery, well worth every penny!"
"Written August 4, 2020",Lucky to visit while it was so quiet,"Pre-booking required due to restrictions on visitor numbers. This means there is plenty of opportunity to get up close to the beautiful artwork, even the famous paintings. No pressure to move on. All staff friendly and helpful."
"Written October 27, 2020",Artemisia,"Visited the Artemisia exhibition at the national today.Good queuing system and timed entry.The Artemisia exhibition itself did feel a little too busy; I don’t feel it felt any less busy than in ‘normal’ times and it was very difficult to maintain social distancing- although everyone was wearing masks.The paintings were amazing and having been a fan of Artemisia for a long time, it was great to see so many of her works. However, I felt they could have made it a bit more ‘young person’ friendly. When we went to see the Madonna of the Rocks exhibition, they had some excellent information about painting, light and shade etc... for my almost teenage daughters, it would have been great for some more visual/ interactive information about her painting techniques and her life. After the exhibition we took one of the planned routes out; these worked well and the rest of the gallery actually felt much emptier and more pleasant."
"Written January 26, 2020",Lots of pictures!,"The national gallery is free which is amazing really. They ask for a donation as you go in which is fair enough. We went on a Saturday when it was quite busy. Many very cultured people spending ages looking at each picture and even taking pictures of the small explanation at the side of each one. So obviously some people think this place is the business! At the risk of sounding like I’m completely uncultured, there are an awful lot of paintings, many of which look fairly similar. (I know, I can hear many of you muttering in the background).There are some famous paintings in amongst all the others and those are the ones I wanted to see. However... I could have done with those being in a room all on their own.Sorry national gallery, you can’t win them all! "
"Written February 14, 2020",A WHOLE LOT TO SEE for FREE!!!,"I chose to visit the Sainsbury Wing after reading an experienced guide's advice. This wing has a mostly pre-Renaissance and Renaissance artists along with the Dutch Masters, Reubens and El Greco. I paid for the audio guide (5BP) which was extremely helpful. I spent 5 hours in the Gallery altogether and was exhausted. I am sure the rest of the Gallery was as interesting as the Sainsbury wing. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!!"
"Written July 19, 2021","Very nice gallery, definitely worth a visit","The gallery was very beautiful and easy to get to, The staff were mostly very helpful and understanding. There were some lovely paintings and I would definitely recommend the Monet and Van Gogh paintings. The only issue I had was the one way systems don't make sense and also don't allow you to see all of the room, they tend to make you choose between rooms and then you can't get back into the other ones because it's a one-way system. Luckily we had some very nice staff who allowed us to ignore the one-way system to get into the other rooms but it was quite confusing and stressful. Overall though a nice day out if you can navigate the Ikea like maze of routes. "
"Written August 5, 2021",Beautiful museum with lots of fantastic artwork.,Always a fantastic place to visit.  Easy to get lost - so do pick up a map or ask directions from some of the very helpful team who are all over the museum.  Some fantastic pieces to see and enjoy.  Some really famous paintings and some less famous but mesmerising.   In the current climate there are arrows so routes can be followed to help maintain some degree of social distancing. Masks are required.  I think if going with children it is better (if you are able to) to do a couple of shorter visits rather than one long one as otherwise there is a risk of them getting somewhat overloaded.  Really fabulous place to visit.
"Written August 19, 2021",Great gallery and a must see when in London,"What a gallery. Not a massive art buff but this place is amazing. Didn’t take to the earlier ‘God’ art of the renaissance but really enjoyed the trip through the 1600’s with some amazing art work from the Dutch masters. The building itself is beautiful and an amazing piece of art but doesn’t detract from some of the paintings. Experienced the Van Goghs and the Monet’s which would have covered the entry price themselves but there isn’t one, this place is free! Make sure you book tickets if in London as you have to visit this if you are there. Made a donation when booking the tickets and also picked up some souvenirs in the shop on the way out (obviously as I was with the kids!) so supported the gallery. If you go you will enjoy this. Assign a good couple of hours to really appreciate this attraction."
"Written January 18, 2020",Brilliant exhibitions...,"Visited the Sainsbury wing to see the Gauguin portraits, many of which have never been in the UK before.  Easy to access, minimum wait for ticket purchase and marvellous exhibition space.  Wheelchair access via the lifts, too.  Excellent gift shops as well."
"Written November 16, 2022",Suffolk Landscapes By Constable,"It was pretty crowded when we arrived at 130 pm, but we managed to make our way across the several rooms.There was a lot of focus on Italian painters and religious artwork, as well as Impressionists like Cezanne, Gaugin and Manet.  There were even a few paintings by Van Gogh.I was happy that I saw two landscapes by John Constable of his native Suffolk, and also a large painting by Sargeant.  There was also a small area featuring Turner."
"Written February 26, 2023",Excellent Collection of Impressionist/Dutch/Italian Masters,"You can wait on-line to get in, or book a ticket on-line and make a donation, like five pounds, for example, and get in at the members entrance a short walk from the main entrance, without a big line.  It worked out great.  Digital ticket.  Easy to do.  Great collection of Impressionist, Dutch, Italian paintings.  All on one huge floor.  Elevator access to the floor is available.  We were able to see all we wanted to, all the highlights, and more time on the excellent Impressionist collection, in an hour and a half.  Right on the top of Trafalgar Square."
"Written September 9, 2022",Closed for the day!,"Closed this morning, without any advance indication on the website! Bemused visitors and tourists milling around the closed doors. If the V&A could stay open today, why did the National decide to shut? Who benefits from this sort of arbitrary decision? Plenty of people suffer inconvenience or worse. Post COVID the London galleries and museums have not restored their attendance figures so why delay the recovery by closing when you don’t need to?"
"Written July 9, 2021",Truly Brilliant,"Amazing collection of art , and very well laid out. Perfect spacing for social distancing and it made viewing the collections so much more enjoyable not to have hoards of people pushing and shoving to get to the front.Staff were professional and helpful. Always try and slip in a visit here when I come to London, mind refreshing."
"Written July 16, 2021",Amazing art - for free!,"The National Gallery is a true treasure in London. Among the firm favourites of the art world, you’ll find provocative and beautiful pieces which are all special in their own way. The architecture is stunning and is not to be missed!"
"Written August 11, 2022",15 sunflowers!,"Flying visit, main entrance wasn't accessible however far left side another building, they were operating a queuing system and bag check. Moved fairly quickly,  once in I looked for the lift as I was not prepared to climb all those stairs. Floor 2, took a right turn to the bottom of a very long corridor and rooms, another right at the end and finally another turn and I was there....room 43!!!Surely these 15 sunflowers weren't really painted by Vincent? How come I was inces away from a priceless painting?So many questions.......It looked fab and in tip top condition. "
"Written February 2, 2022",Need more time,"We only popped in here to escape the rain. I was overwhelmed by the scale of this building, vast rooms lead onto more cavernous spaces. Many famous pieces to view by an array of artists. I could have spent longer here, to take it all in would take around 3 hours, well worth a visit"
"Written October 28, 2021",Half term visit,"Fantastic visit during half term. Amazing art gallery with fabulous art displayed in beautiful rooms. We pre booked our tickets about 6 weeks in advance and went straight in at our designated time slot. We thought the app for children was an excellent idea and kept our 6 year old entertained during our visit. It turns paintings into my little pony! Lots of fun for her!Can’t wait to return, loved our visit!"
"Written February 3, 2020",You need Time,Plan one of two galleries before or after lunch in the Gallery restaurant.  There is so much to see.  You can always go next door to the National Portrait Gallery if you still ahve time.We did see a bunch of tourist walking through the gallery videoing everything on their mobile phones!!  No comment!
"Written August 1, 2023",Still amazing,"I used to work near here so would often head in on the way to Charing Cross station. 15+ years later I went with my 8 year old daughter who's far more artistic than I'll ever be, and she loved it. It's still a wonderful place - not only the collections, but the building itself. The only thing that has changed is you can book advanced tickets (for free) to avoid the queue. Didn't know this until I got there but we were lucky, however this is worth knowing during school holidays and because one of wings is being renovated. There are few places on Earth that have so much beauty."
"Written December 11, 2022",PRE BOOKED TICKET SHAMBLES,"I had booked tickets for entry to the National Gallery on Saturday 10th December but was told by a member of staff that I must queue like everyone else, it was over 1 hrs wait. I was actually standing next to the sign that said  Pre-Booked tickets and I showed him our tickets but he would not budge or call his Supervisor. Another family group were having the same problem and they were very annoyed, so in the end we all just walked passed him. I felt sorry for the man, as I think he was just following incorrect orders and was not briefed on how the entrance to the Gallery worked.  Staff must be better informed.However, once we got in, we had a lovely time and the National Gallery is fantastic. A must see. All other staff were very nice and Muriel's cafe very good too for a light lunch."
"Written May 2, 2022",Some of the greatest artists and their works are housed here.,We spent 4 hours at the gallery and still didn't see everything.  It was amazing to see so many great pieces there in person that we had admired for years.  It's a very popular gallery but we never felt like it was overcrowded.  A must for anyone coming to London.
"Written March 6, 2022",Spontaneous visit and well worth it,The portrait gallery was closed due to refurb so we headed for the National Gallery and it was a wonderful visit. Our kids (ages 2-8) had a lovely time walking around and asking questions about painting. Some famous ones to spot also. We noticed some kids were on the floor copying the pictures they could see so joined them and it was just so nice to relax somewhere and take it the atmosphere. It was half term and it was busy but not over crowded. Kids felt very welcome.
"Written August 8, 2022",A must-see museum in London,"I loved the National Gallery. It has an amazing collection of paintings from various famous artists, and the gallery itself is a beautiful building. The children, who are not familiar with any these famous artists, appreciated the gallery less than I did. But the price (free!) was just right and there was no advance booking needed (just some queueing outside to enter). Don't miss this museum if you're in London."
"Written July 15, 2022",Masterpiece Art,"I visited the National Gallery on a recent trip to London.  As an enthusiast of fine arts, I was excited to visit an art gallery of this caliber. I viewed period art from the 15th and 16th centuries. Most of the art was reminiscient of Christ, the crucifixion, etc. The remaining art work was that of the 18th and 19th century Europe. There were docents available, but it seemed that patrons were literally walking in front of me while viewing the art, which I found rude. I was in and out in 40 minutes."
"Written April 13, 2022",Fantastic Art Gallery,I have visited this gallery in the past and now have the pleasure of taking my son (12) to experience this himself. We took our time and while most of the artist's are unknown to him (and myself) you can't help admire the works. To see the artwork and some of the most famous artwork and all for free entrance is truly amazing. Well worth a visit.
"Written August 13, 2022",One of The Best Galleries in the World,"We spent a few hours here enjoying some of the best painters in history. All of our favorite painters are represented, and one can enjoy from Rembrandt to Picasso. The Gallery was well organized as far as entry goes… The numbering sequence of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired, but entry is free, so not going to hold it against it. We went at opening hour (10:00AM) and had some of the rooms to ourselves. This is a popular tourist destination, so it fills up quickly. The A/C works well in there, so no problem to visit during hot summer days. The food in there is very good and reasonably priced. The staff is most friendly and helpful, so we highly recommend it. The entry is free, but donations are welcome."
"Written September 18, 2022",One of the Best,"If you are a lover of art and museums, this is an important gallery to explore. Free to enter, the National Gallery in London rivals the Smithsonians in DC and Metropolitan in NYC. Be sure to determine which specific areas you want to see and don't try to do the whole thing in one visit."
"Written January 17, 2023",Muriel’s Expresso Bar,"I stopped off at this bar to buy a cup of tea. My sister who was with me wanted a drink of water. This was refused. They were selling small glass bottles of water for £2.80. I was , somewhat reluctantly, directed to a drinking fountain but there were no cups there. My sister and I are independent pensioners and able to manage but I think all bars and cafes should provide drinking water on request. Children and elderly people can easily become dehydrated on a day out in London and charging £2.80 is quite simply a rip off."
"Written May 27, 2023",Best Art Museum in London,"One of the last things we saw on our England trip was the National Gallery.  While I had see both Tate's, this was the best art museum in London with the most diverse collection with the best artist and pieces.  The paintings are masterpieces by the greatest artists, de Vinci, Titian, and Vermeer to Impressionist like Monet, Manet and Renoir and Post Impressionist like Suerat, Cezanne and Van Gogh.  There were even interesting paintings from British history.  All of this it a great building that was decorated for the season.  Again, there are many art museums in London, but this is the best."
"Written August 24, 2022",Wonderful Experience with the Old Masters,"Absolutely loved our visit to the National Gallery! Seeing the Old Masters - Rembrandt, Monet, Manet, Titian - live, up close and personal was a dream come true. We could have spent many more hours in here. It is absolutely a must see destination for any self respecting art enthusiast!"
"Written January 19, 2023",Amazing!,"one thing that i love about British Museum is the free entry. I enjoyed walking around the national gallery, a wonderful museum for classic art lovers with famous paintings fro VanGogh, Monet and others. If you have time please go and visit it. "
"Written August 20, 2023",World class art gallery that is free and accessible to the public,"Incredible art gallery that I love and have returned to about once per year for about 10 years (almost every time I am in London from the US).Special shout-out to Alan who works there and made my entire day during a recent visit. Alan is passionate and knowledgeable about art. I was concerned because I could not find my favorite Claude painting (Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba) and Alan not only immediately knew what painting I was describing, but knew where they moved it. He also knew key facts about the work, artist, and reason for where it was moved too. Thank you Alan and National Gallery for another memorable trip - See you soon!"
"Written February 9, 2023",A must-visit for anyone looking to explore the world's greatest art,"With over 2,300 paintings from the 13th to 19th centuries, the museum offers a unique insight into the history of art. From Renaissance masterpieces to Impressionist masterpieces, there's something for everyone. It's a great way to experience the best of European art in one place."
"Written April 15, 2021",Great gallery,Great spot located in Trafalgar Square. We've been to the Gallery many times before although on this occasion we didn't go inside. It looks really  historic on the outside and some of the pieces on the inside are fantastic. Really recommend visiting when in London.
"Written January 13, 2023",FAMOUS ART,I could spend a whole day in here but due to limited time I only saw maybe 75% of the gallery.  I printed out a map prior to arriving and circled the rooms of which pieces I HAD to see. My favorite was Van Gogh. Be prepared to wait since that's where it's mostly crowded. 
"Written May 19, 2023",Brilliant... apart from the mobile phones everywhere!,"Though the art is exceptional, please, please why do you need to take photos of every single piece! I had a camera shoved in front of my face multiple times around this breathtaking gallery. I’m hopeful the National will start to do something about this problem when viewing art, to actually view it... taking selfies in the corner of the gallery or do your own personal photoshoot is just not what these special places are about!"
"Written April 26, 2023",A wonderful place to visit,"We were pleasantly surprised at how many wonderful artists works can be seen here: Degas, Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Constable, Turner… the list goes on. We spent a few very enjoyable hours wandering round and appreciating this fabulous place. If you’re visiting London it should definitely be on your to do list."
"Written September 13, 2023",One of the best in the world,"If you are a student of art, especially Old Masters painting, there are only two other museums in the world to touch London's National Gallery. So many masterpieces, and I felt they were all hung better this trip than in the past, especially the Venetian paintings (and their collection is second to none in this category.) Breathtaking canvasses from Van Eyck, Holbein, Veronese, Titian, Rembrandt, Van Dyke, and Bronzino. A colossal Stubbs horse on a blank background. Moroni's incomparable tailor. A room full of ravishing Rubenses! Two Vermeers. Great big Turners (I was Turnered out after being at the Tate the day before.)A fun thing to do is spending some time with the Rembrandts and the canvasses formerly known as Rembrandts that were struck off the list and re-attributed. The museum is very clear about the status of each of their works. These were all bought by Kings, Dukes, and Millionaires as Rembrandts many years ago, and frankly, it is very hard to see the distinctions, but it makes for some interesting sleuthing. It might prompt some follow-up reading about the great Rembrandt re-shuffle of about 25 years ago.Also: don't miss the very good Impressionist collection, with a magnificent Van Gogh Cypress painting and a huge late Monet water lily painting to rival those in the Orangerie. Plus a very unusual Renoir painted in two of his different styles!Here's something to look for: The curators have cleverly put massive canvasses featuring horses at the ends of hallways. From one you can see another far off through a few rooms. It's quite fun. Also notice how little attention is paid to the daVinci and Michelangelo paintings. There's so much other good stuff that they simply fit right in. The daVinci drawing is really good (unlike much of his work) and you can get right up close to it.Right in Trafalgar Square! The National Gallery is one of the great places in the world."
"Written August 18, 2022",Magical,"Magical. Wandering through the galleries it seemed that every one had a stunning painting that I'd known all my life.There was a minor problem, finding a way round. Pocket maps are no longer available from the entry desk or bookshop. The small guidebook """"A Quick Visit"" is a great souvenir of a enjoyable visit, but has no gallery map! The staff are very helpful, so we survived. Maybe this is a generation thing. Please don't forget the oldies. Otherwise what a marvellous place."
"Written August 17, 2022",Do not Miss This Museum.,The museum opens at 10:00AM and is free.  The collection is mostly of paintings and includes Michelangelo's and da Vinci's.  da Vinci's Madonna of the Rocks took my breath away!  The museum is easy to navigate and accommodates those with limited mobility.  There are also many helpful docents to answer questions.  Allow at least 3 hours.
"Written July 3, 2023",Very impressive - but requires a lot of time if you want to see all.,The place is amazing. Especially since the entry is free.The gallery has so many amazing paintings it's overwhelming.There are so many rooms and paintings that you really need to make time for it all.One can focus only on some of the more famous paintings.
"Written December 26, 2021",AMAZING!,"The museum is free and filled with extremely beautiful artwork.  The guides are helpful and it's easy to maneuver through.  Also, the small coffee cafe has the biggest and tastiest almond croissant I have ever had."
"Written September 27, 2022",WELL WORTH A VISIT,This is a must visit place for all art lovers.  Entry is free (donations are gratefully accepted) & they have lots of paintings from all the grand masters to enjoy.Their regular exhibitions are also worth keeping an eye out for. 
"Written September 28, 2022",Winslow Homer is a superb exhibition.,"We went for the Winslow Homer exhibition. He is one of the foremost 19th century US artists. We thought the exhibition was superb, with plenty to see and a good variety of his work. The paintings were grouped by subject matter and also by the location. There was plenty of interesting explanation by the curators but some of it was probably a little wide of the mark as the artist didn't like to explain his work at all."
"Written August 2, 2023",St Francis of Assisi,This is a spacious and well set out exhibition but is largely a collection of religious paintings completed some 300 years after the alleged date of death of St Francis.  There are also clips from more recent movies but hardly any artefacts from near the time of his life - not surprisingly.  It will be mainly of interest to religious experts and also Italians. The power of the story of the life of St Francis is demonstrated by this exhibition.
"Written May 3, 2022",FREE! No need reservation,"What a cool place! FREE Entrance!March 2022 - You don't need to reserve your time to enter the museum, even with no reservation they will let you go in. Amazing art! Don't fancy see everything as the place is gigantic. Impossible to see it all at once. In front of the building there is the Trafalgar Square."
"Written October 15, 2023",Please add signs to indicate the way out and put the safety of your visitors first,"To be clear, I have rated my experience in the National Gallery as average based on the lack of signs within the Gallery to clearly indicate the way out within a set of rooms and a lack of signs to clearly indicate the exit from the building.  This is not just a matter of convenience for visitors who might be delayed in finding the art that they want to see or who might take more time than they'd like to find the toilets.  This is an important matter of safety for all visitors.  I would strongly encourage adding more signs and taking other steps to improve the safety of visitors to the gallery."
"Written October 17, 2021",Well worth a Visit,"Visiting the gallery is an experience. We aren't particularly arty people but we loved being in this wonderful place with it's beautiful sense of history and past - it's timelessness. Seeing the pictures for real is so very different to seeing them on a screen, we thought it was just lovely. "
"Written June 20, 2020",Many works,"Magnificent pinoteca smaller than the Prado or the Louvre. In a spectacular building in Trafalgar square. From works by the most important European painters such as: Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt, Velásquez, Monet, Manet or Vincent van Gogh. I would highlight the Virgin of the rocks and the Sunflowers. Visiting this gallery in London is a must. Free entry all the time."
"Written March 8, 2020",Amazing building ,"Ironically I'm not one for art, but enjoyed seeing some famous works whilst there. However, the building itself is absolutely sensational and a work of art itself. Worth a visit for the architecture alone. Free entry."
"Written October 14, 2022",Great museum to see artists from Renoir to Picasso,"If you are an art lover than you would love this museum.  My husband went to London for our Anniversary.  This museum did not disappoint.  It can be done in 4-6 hours.  You can see any artist from Renoir, Manet, Monet, Picasso to Van Eyck. The rooms were nicely labeled and we were able to see all the art we wanted in limited time we had.  I downloaded an art app to help explain the paintings. The museum said they do not have an audio tour. Really worth a visit."
"Written January 26, 2020",Gaugin exhibition - brilliant! ,What a brilliant exhibition. So well displayed with so much attention to detail. I learnt a lot of new information about Gaugin and saw some pictures that I'd never seen before. Wish it was on for longer. Finished today. 
"Written May 17, 2021",National Gallery 17.5.21(1st day of opening!),"Hooray,the museums are open again,I have waited five months to return to this wonderful gallery.In my last review in December 2020,I  vowed that I would not return until everything was back to normal(no 1 way system in place),but the gallery rules and restrictions cant keep me away! I have missed Caneleto.Constable,Monet,Gainsborough and more,its not the same online or you tube.Still got got confused with the 1 way system and nearly missed the main reason for visiting,the stunning Canelettos!This time my husband joined me,we had a wonderful 2 hour visiting,then off to lunch we went, indoors!"
"Written December 14, 2022",A Mind-Boggling Collection,"With its immense collection of artwork and free admission, the National Gallery is easily among the top places to visit in London.  My wife and I have been a couple of times before and we have never been disappointed.  One of the paintings we wanted to see was loaned to another museum, so we will be returning in spring on our next trip to London.  The gift shop also has some very nice, good quality items."
"Written December 18, 2022",Picture Perfect Christmas,"I went to the Christmas Show at the Gallery in the theatre.The show is billed as a 'Fun, Festive, musical show for all the family' and it really lived up to it's expectations.I went on my own as I was in London but there were families there with children from about 18 months onwards.It was based on Heinrich Avercamp's famous painting of a frozen lake with people skating and getting into the Christmas spirit.There were lots of singing and music, and a baddie who is  set out to ruin our two heroes Frederick and Maakies day but with the help of woodland creatures they meet along their way it all works out well in the end. I found it enchanting and very easy to watch even as an adult! It wasn't full on Christmas but subtle and suitable for all ages. The theatre is very comfortable and surprisingly bigger than I thought"
"Written March 16, 2022",Pleasant and informative,"Brought my primary school aged daughter for a visit as we were in the area. She had been looking at Monet pictures in class so I brought her to see the real things.The building is beautiful. The location is fabulous. All staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. We had prebooked tickets online but this was not necessary for our visit and we walked straight in. The site was busy, but no more than I would expect for Saturday afternoon. We only looked at a small section of art but we really enjoyed what we saw. My daughter liked our visit and would like to see more if we have time. All in all, very pleasant."
"Written June 5, 2022",Wonderful gallery with works from outstanding artists,"We loved touring the gallery.  Many works of great artists such as Monet, Renoir, Donatello, Gauguin, Michelangelo, Van Gogh, Raphael, etc.  Allow at least a half day for this tour and if possible, a full day.  "
"Written June 22, 2022",Great for art lovers,The national gallery is a good place to go in London for art lovers. There is a wide selection of paintings and something everyone can enjoy including classics by Van Gogh and Picasso. It was great to see some very famous paintings
"Written March 9, 2022",National treasures,The National Gallery is a must see in London. It's a vast collection of masters combined with changing exhibits. View one masterpiece after another as you go from gallery to gallery. The current exhibit titled The Prelude by Kehinde Wiley is not to be missed. Plan at least a few hours to see even part of the collection.  
"Written May 5, 2022",Always the best,"NAtiona gallery never fails to impress - so many great memories over the years. The collection of art is one of the best in the world, the staff are very helpful and even the coffee in their local coffee shop is excellent. Keep it up!"
"Written January 28, 2023",A National treasure," We spent an hour in the National Gallery which is nowhere near enough time to even scratch the surface. However we did get to wonder at some amazing art and it’s quite breath taking to be stood in front of Constable’s The Hey Wain or one of The Sunflowers by Van Gough. We also got to wonder at a Turner Seascape. The free entry is such a boon for visitors, the gift shop is lovely with gifts and souvenirs to suit all pockets so anyone can come away with a keepsake of some description. We’re definitely planning return visits with more time to take more of the exhibits in. Highly recommended."
"Written August 7, 2022",The building is more interesting than the paintings.,"I found the building to be stunning and the rooms spectacular. Overall, the paintings mostly looked the same. What I did enjoy was the student artwork exhibition and the wonderful gentlemen who asked my opinion of the work and had a discussion with me about children and art. He was very enthusiastic."
"Written April 3, 2023",Amazing art collections ,Amazing first visit to this delightful art gallery. Fascinating artwork and could easily spend hours in there. So many collections and rooms to see. It is free to visit and if you pre-book on their website you can get in a bit quicker. 
"Written August 12, 2022",A hidden gem - the Ochre Restaurant at the NGA,"The National Gallery is one of the great art wonders of the world. Do not miss it, when in London. I am focusing this review on the museum's fine restauarnt,  Ochre, Tucked just beyond the gift shops and one door away from the madness of Leicester Sauare, the Ochre has a limited menu but offers a fine dining experience. I had the pasta bolognese which was outstanding. The service and surroundings are impecable. Treat  yourself to this unique experience - it enhances an already wonderful experience of a museum visit."
"Written August 18, 2023",Wonderful Museum,"Our visit today was the second time we visited here. The first time was in 2015 and a few of the rooms were closed (I think the security staff may have been on strike). As such, I missed seeing two of the paintings I’d hoped to see: Hans Holbein’s “The Ambassadors” and Van Eyck’s “Arnolfini Wedding.” I said then, “next time I’m in London.” That next time was today and I got to see both.This is a great collection here. To just walk in and look at the regular collections, it is free. There are a ton of well known masterpieces.My favorite, though? Camille Pissarro, “Late Afternoon in our Meadow.” That painting appealed to me deeply.Right outside is Trafalgar Square to enjoy. You are also a short (maybe 15 minute walk) from Buckingham Palace and even closer to Parliament."
"Written August 14, 2023",Exhilarating experience,"Brilliant ""Impressionism:Inventing Modern"" exhibition.  The paintings are beautifully hung for maximum effect and, although the galleries were crowded, we had more than sufficient time to view each of them and to make notes. We described the exhibition to each other as being exhilarating. We finished the visit with a coffee and talked over what we had seen.  Our only disappointment was the female toilet facilities which left much to be desired. "
"Written August 16, 2021",Always worth a visit. Free entrance to all the main galleries.,"The National Gallery in the heart of Trafalgar Square is a must see. Charing Cross Station (tube and mainline) is right opposite. The paintings are wide ranging in age and style, there is something for everyone. Special Exhibitions are always and eye opener, many are free.  It's a quick walk from there to the River Thames or to Buckingham Palace or to Leicester Square and Chinatown and also Convent Garden. I believe their restaurant is well rated. I'm not a 'foodie' but if you are on a budget then ITSU is opposite. "
"Written January 8, 2020",Short but sweet,"school trip for an hour at the museum. Unfortunately, my friends rushed to look at all the paintings and masterworks. the museum was spacious and we could sit down and study one painting. Some places were crowded. From what I saw it was still a nice exhibition."
"Written March 30, 2023",Priceless paintings to appreciate,"The museum can seem a little overwhelming at first but gets easier to navigate once you follow the room order. The paintings on display are awesome, amazing, and once in a lifetime experience ie: Monet, Picasso, Cezzane, etc. Allow yourself at least 2.5 hours to walk around and review the paintings."
"Written April 13, 2022",A wonderland with a free entrance,"The first thing which surprises you is that the entrance is completely free, even though you can leave a little facultative tip. It’s a wonderful journey across art history, with many paintings from famous as well as less-known artists. There also are artworks by Lorenzo Lotto and Gian Battista Moroni!"
"Written May 10, 2022",Stunning gallery,"It’s been a while since I have been here and there have been a few notable changes. The entrance has moved and there are now colour coded routes set up for you to follow to see your favour artists, which is very useful. Staff are very helpful, I asked one of them where I could find the Caravaggio paintings and he literally led me to the hall!Great place to have a look stopping well worth a visit."
"Written June 7, 2022",Good opportunity to enjoy art,I visited the National Gallery several times throughout my London visit. The National Gallery is convenient located by Trafalgar Square and it's a great venue to visit when you want to escape the hustle and bustle and crowds at Trafalgar Square. Great stop for washroom break as well. The facility is well maintained and not too crowded. We enjoyed looking through the exhibits and admiring the artwork from famous artists throughout history.
"Written August 18, 2022",Family Trip.,The gallery is in a busy area which we did not mind. It has loads of restaurants around. Booked our spaces last minute as well and we still got in. The art was amazing and I recommend visiting it. One of the artists whose paintings where there was Van Gogh. NOTE: The Van Gogh painting/s are in the room 40+ (cannot remember accurately).
"Written May 22, 2022",Botticelli and Impressionists Galore,"We went specifically to see Venus and Mars.  There was a lot of Impressionist paintings as well.  The outside fountain and statues also provide many “Kodak moments.”  Reservations are required, but admission is free."
"Written June 1, 2022",Outstanding collection of art across the ages,This is a free museum (voluntary donations encouraged) with a collection spanning nearly 800 years of art. I was especially excited to see Leonardo Da Vinci's works. I recently a biography of Da Vinci where these works were discussed and it was really gratifying to see them in person.
"Written May 7, 2022",Great place for lunch - even better for paintings!,"We started our visit with lunch which proved to be a Really Good Choice! Lovely food and even with so many others there, didn't feel too crowded. The real reason for the visit, to soak in some great art, was always going to be too short a visit, but we  revelled in Rembrandt, goggled at van Gogh and peered at ...A fabulous place to go - again and again if possible."
"Written August 29, 2023",great place to visit if you are looking for free admission attractions,"it was a pretty great gallery to visit, lots of artwork by different artists. but it feels pretty crowded (not sure is it due to bank holiday). i prebook the admission ticket therefore entered without issue but i see people without admission entering straightaway as well, therefore i wonder if there really is ""crowd control"" since that's the whole purpose of requesting visitors to prebook tickets isn't it? "
"Written August 4, 2021",Old art masters dream ,An interesting visit with some restrictions still in place so advance suggested.  The staff have set out 3 routes to follow depending on your likes but of course your free to view all 3. Certainly plenty to review and take time to stand back and enjoy. There are some on going refurbished in the gallery but one recently opened ( photo below) it really makes the building look great and sets of the art nicely. 
"Written February 25, 2020",Amazing,"It's amazing. Some of the greatest masterpieces in the world are here. What more is there to say? Not, as in some galleries, minor works by great artists and great works by minor artists, but major works by major artists. The Holbeins are superb, the Caravaggios, Michelangelos, and the Leonardos there aplenty. And it's free."
"Written September 1, 2022",Magnificent Art Museum,"The National Gallery is a magnificent art museum and among the greatest in a city with such a dense collection of museums in a country with many of the greatest museums in the world.  It large with a varied collection and the complex of buildings is very nice to be in. It specifically contains some very famous pieces, such as what is probably Turner's most famous masterpiece, The Fighting Temeraire as well as some of his others such as Rain, Steam, and Speed - The Great Western Railway .   There is a nice gift shop, the museum is free as with many museums in Britain, and it is open late on Fridays.  One could do a short visit to see key items one might want to see and come back several times since it sis free, but one could spend hours here."
"Written December 22, 2021",Don’t miss out!,"Free admission to a beautifully designed building that has some world famous pieces of art inside. Can’t believe I have been to London so many times before and not been in!At present you enter through the Sainsbury Wing to the left of the front entrance (if you were facing the building). You need to book a free ticket to get in, it’s worth doing before you get there.Loved seeing the Turner, Constable, Monet, Pissarro, Caravaggio, Gauguin, Seurat, Da Vinci and Van Gaugh. I took lots of photos that should be attached with the review to see some snippets.There are marked routes to see different pieces, but I found myself always taking the wrong turn. Shout out to the employees Alan and Anton who separately gave us tips and directions when we were wandering about. They were so knowledgeable and friendly, they’re a credit to the gallery. All of the staff we encountered were helpful, I hope that they are appreciated by the national gallery bosses."
"Written September 20, 2021",Great for a wander around plus the Bellotto exhibition is excellent.,We booked a time slot and wandered around for a couple of hours. The Bellotto exhibition in room 1 was excellent. We avoided the busiest rooms (Impressionism) and focused on Dutch and Flemish painters. We spent 2 hours here. There is a basic coffee bar that does a few cakes and sandwiches but catering is limited at the moment.
"Written November 3, 2022","Wonderful paintings, if you can find them!","What a lovely place to visit, and it’s free! Terrific location and vast space to exhibit an excellent collection over centuries. Saw many paintings we just loved to stand in front of and admire. It’s extensive and a large number of individual rooms, each with a particular focus. We’re we’re there for 5 hours are saw pretty well everything we wanted. There are helpful descriptions on the side of each exhibit which is good. Nice to have occasional seating in rooms as there is a lot of standing time. We struggled to get a clear grasp of the layout and while there are overviews at the start by the time we had visited a few rooms, that was distant memory.Visited cafe couple of times, got seating both occasions but can imagine this area would be a nightmare in a busy summer.So pleased we went. There seemed to be a cut off for more modern art, but there are other London galleries we should visit to see them."
"Written September 11, 2021",Return Visit,"On our last visit Van Gogh’s Sunflower Painting was out on loan so decided to go againReally pleased to be able to the wonderful painting and to have opportunity to view our favourites again.Booked online so had our slot when we arrived.Lovely air conditioning was appreciated as it was a hot day, 28C  when we went.Staff friendly and knowledgeable "
"Written August 14, 2023",Nice Collection ,"Visited on a Monday afternoon with a group of 4 - had no tickets or advanced reservations. Waited in line for about 10 minutes and entered (free entrance). Spent about 80-90 minutes exploring gorgeous art and work from famous artists. Did not get to see the entire gallery as we had to leave, but could've easily spent more time admiring. Restrooms, food, and gift shop on site."
"Written March 29, 2023",The National Gallery,"The National Gallery is an exceptional art museum that showcases an outstanding collection of paintings from various periods and styles. The museum is well-organized, and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The admission is free, which makes it accessible to everyone. The building is beautiful and well-maintained. The only downside is that it can get quite crowded, which may make it difficult to fully appreciate the artworks. Overall, I would highly recommend visiting the National Gallery."
"Written August 4, 2021",Well worth a visit,"Soooo much to see. As a bit of a philistine when it comes to art (paintings especially), there are a few I know, and many I don't.  Worth a visit, but get a map! The place is a warren of art. Some big names are there (Van Gogh, Canaletto, Van Dyck, Titan, Vermeer etc) most of which I have heard of. For me, the Canaletto's were the best; his depictions of Venice were beautiful and clear."
"Written December 20, 2022",(In)accessible,"I’ve been before, and this is of course one of the world’s premier art collections.  But on consecutive days this week, I was faced with long queues to get in.  This never used to be a problem. There was a big entrance right in the middle which now seems to have been closed off, leading to a bottleneck situation. I find it rather ironic that something presumably done in order to improve accessibility has actually made it more inaccessible."
"Written May 1, 2023",Must in London,"Located in the Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery is an excellent art gallery, hosting lots of iconic artworks. In my opinion, it's a must see. The entrance is free, which surprised me when I planned my trip to London."
"Written May 5, 2023",Super After Impressionism exhibition ,We came here for the After Impressionism exhibition which covered the period from about 1886 until 1914. It is a huge exhibition in 8 rooms and contains many paintings I haven't seen before probably as they are in private collections. We were enthralled and spent 2 hours here. I particularly liked the Van Gogh paintings. I thought the narrative within the rooms was a bit confused though.
"Written October 21, 2021",Dreadful jobsworth and pointless exercise in time slots when they were not observed anyway.,"When looking at website it states walk in tickets available each day, but when arriving  Jobsworth on the door will ask if you have a smart phone, tell him no and he will let you walk in and get a ticket straight away from the desk which yau can then throw in the bin as no one checks it. However if you say yes you can then join the crowd of people outside who are all stood in the rain trying to get the ticket booking to work. The funny thing is, that after going through this pointless exercise you can then mingle with all the maskless people inside. I only found this out about the ticket as we stood outside with other furious and wet people because I happened to hear an old couple say that they had no internet, so we did the same and were ushered straight in."
"Written July 23, 2023",A maze of extraordinary works,"A beautiful building with some of the worlds most famous paintings. I came for the Van Gogh works, in particular his Sunflowers.The layout of the building is a little confusing; I would have befitted by being given a simple map at the door as quite often I felt like I was in a maze with no middle. There was an amusing children’s gallery near the beginning, where kids from many schools around the country had created works of art based on a real painting. The theme this year was the sea and there were some beautiful and thoughtful pieces which I enjoyed. Overall an enjoyable couple of hours."
"Written December 9, 2022",Nice relaxing stop,This square is full of great photographic and historical opportunities. The fountain is beautiful and public bathrooms are clean. There were several cafes in the area. There is a free elevated platform in a building not far away which name I do not remember.
"Written September 28, 2022",So Many Masterpiece’s,"This place is huge! We spent at least 3 hours and I don’t think we saw it all. Be sure to take your map with you because it’s like a huge maze. There are so many great works of art by so many famous painters. Van Dyke, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubins, Gainsborough, Leonardo DaVinci, Botticelli and my personal favorites, the impressionists. Claude Monet, Manet, Renoir, Cezanne, Gaugan, Van Gogh, Picasso just to name a few. If you like famous paintings, do not miss this!!!!"
"Written July 23, 2021",Inspiring art,"My wife and I visited to view the Copernicus portrait and the new Bellotto exhibition. These are outstanding and inspiring pictures, beautifully hung and curated. The Gallery is dealing really well with the trials of COVID-19."
"Written April 17, 2023",A must-visit for anyone interested in art,The knowledgeable staff are friendly and helpful and the free admission is a great bonus. The stunning architecture of the building is a sight to behold and the convenient location is easy to find. It's a great place to spend an afternoon exploring the vast collection of artwork. Highly recommended!
"Written February 21, 2020",Stunning and amazingly still free,"There is not much in life that’s free but this is still something special. For an uplifting experience that feeds the soul then the NG still amazes me every time I visit. as well as the art the building itself amazing, take time to look at the architecture. They have updated the shop which is also very good. If I had a criticism it’s the dreadful concoction of ‘hawkers’ outside. No problem with some of the real talent but 2 Yoda’s and criminally poor ‘pavement art’ on display outside today....Come on London we have so much talent surely we can do better."
"Written July 10, 2022",Worth a day to explore,"I love art. The National Gallery is a vast art gallery. If you love art, put on comfortable shoes and clothes, charge your phone or camera, and get ready to enjoy a spectacular art collection. I came for a specific type of art movement, so I covered a few art sections in half a day. The National Gallery is a must-see while in London."
"Written June 30, 2022",Like what we like,Only had time for a quick visit before going to see the eagles at Hyde Park. Every trip to London I go to view the painting of lady Jane grey being prepared for her execution. It's both beautiful and sad and transfixes you. My girlfriend's favourite Italian artist is canaletto and we spent some time mesmerised by the detail in his paintings of Venice. We will always make a point of visiting when in the capital 
"Written May 21, 2022",Art for everyone.,"Something for everyone that want to see art. Entrance is free of charge, the docents are plentiful and helpful in many aspects. There are so many pieces to see that you’ll not be able to fully take it in on one setting - but that leaves you something for “next time”. Worth a visit!"
"Written June 1, 2021",Home away from home,My favourite pictures welcome me back but I love discovering new gems as well.  Best is the talks and tours given by knowledgable and enthusiastic art experts.  Have been attending virtual Zoom sessions over the last months and can't wait to get back to London and the National Gallery in person
"Written November 20, 2022",A FREE experience worth the visit,"We got there 10 minutes before opening on a Thursday morning, were entertained for free by animal protesters until the door opened, The 30 to 40 people in front of us in the queue were processed quickly. We headed to the main gallery and were impressed by how much space was afforded. We were never crowded even in front of the biggie masters! Plenty of food and drink options for us. We enjoyed the morning and price of admission was free, a nice break/treat! Worth swing by on your visit. Enjoy/"
"Written May 15, 2022",A classic of England,"The National Gallery is free and that's a big plus. It's a great place to pop into when you are in Trafalgar Square. You don't have to make it a special visit place.  Just wander through a few galleries and get the flavor. The layout is easy. ""Blue Boy"" by Gainsborough is the highlight now for good reason. It was just returned to England after being in a private collection in the U.S. for 100 years. Even if you're not a ""paintings aficionado"" you'll enjoy the gallery Blue Boy is in along with Gainsborough's other portraits."
"Written September 11, 2021",How wonderful to be back in a gallery!,"The paintings are truly amazing. I know it goes without saying but it really is so much better to view them in person than online or in a book, and it's free - we're so lucky in this country to be able to see these without paying - make the most of it! I'd definitely book in advance. Apparently they limit numbers at particularly busy times and it's very easy to do this either using the QR code on the poster outside the gallery, or via their website."
"Written July 21, 2021",Peaceful and calm - definitely worth a visit,"I visited with my daughter Tina (16), who loves art.We arrived at the gallery on a Saturday and there wasn’t too much crowding, relatively calm atmosphere and friendly guides. I really liked the architecture of the place, it was made of rough white stone that held up the roof, clever design.The Van Gogh and Da Vinci exhibitions are amazing, they showcase a portion of the most excellent art in England. Tina really enjoyed photographing them. The rich colours and abstract styles are mind blowing."
"Written February 24, 2020",Over Officious Staff,Whilst the galley contains the most amazing collection of paintings the staff need to learn to treat all visitors equally.I visited last week with my 11 year old (foster) son.  On two occasions he was admonished by staff for pointing at details on the paintings.  He was NOT touching them.  He witnessed adults doing the same thing and not getting told off.  As a result he did not want to look at any more pictures and sat as far away from them as he could.We left without completing our tour
"Written May 29, 2022",Beautiful collection,Be prepared for hours of remarkable art work from major painters. The building is very attractive and large for accommodating many viewers. This gallery is free! One will see the finest paintings by some of the greatest artists.
"Written March 1, 2020",Busy but great,Visited with a friend to see Sunflowers by Vincent Van Gogh. The gallery was extremely busy as we went on a Saturday. It got less busy as the evening went on. Well worth a visit.
"Written February 23, 2022",Full of Masterpieces - where to look first? And all free,"Went here for a quick visit yesterday for a specific reason.  I had seen the Andrew Marr - Greatest Paintings of the World on TV and wanted to see the JMW Turner the Fighting Temeriere in real life - which I did and was very impressed with it.  Nothing like seeing a painting in real life.  I also saw the Sunflowers by Van Gogh whilst there - this was the subject of another Andrew Marr programme.  I also saw lots of other very recognisable paintings whilst there including those by Rousseau, Monet, Cezanne, Gaugin etc etc.  Wherever you turn, there is a masterpiece.  Next time I will go back for longer.  I booked a free ticket online in advance to save queuing."
"Written December 29, 2022",An absolute must!,"The National Gallery is my favorite museum in London, and it is a must if you’re visiting the city for a few days. The exhibitions are absolutely gorgeous and historically enriching, I could wander around for hours without getting bored. This is number one thing to do in London!"
"Written January 25, 2023",Spectacular Collection,"Spectacular collection of art and stunning building. Could spend a whole afternoon or more, or can hit the more famous pieces (Monet, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Picasso, etc) in an hour or two. Was better than the British Museum IMO. Next time we are in London we will be coming back!!"
"Written January 26, 2022",Wonderful,"The National Gallery is a great treasure and filled with wonderful, priceless pieces of art. It is free to get in so you really can't complain. We were there a couple of hours. Much of it turned out not to be to our taste but there were absolutely stunning paintings. The Turners were a highlight, the Monet waterlilies, the Red Boy was incredible and the Da Vinci absolutely mind blowing. A wonderful visit as long as you don't miss anything! We also had a coffee and slice of cake in one of the cafes which was decent."
"Written December 8, 2022",Masterpieces await!,"The queue moved swiftly, so don’t be deterred. How lucky to wander through the vast collection. Browsing Canaletto, Monet, Turner, Degas, Van Gogh in vaulted and well directed rooms. The cafe was full at lunchtime with a quieter restaurant offering beyond. Bespoke and carefully crafted items in the shop."
"Written December 8, 2022",Beautiful place to spend some time,"Never tired of the National gallery I’m just in love with this place. If you like art this is the place to spend good hours… the entrance is free, you can easy eat in here there are nice coffee stores, is located in the heart of London in Trafalgar Square. Easy access by bus, food , train or underground."
"Written May 5, 2022","Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Renior, Da Vinci, etc.","The National Gallery is a great way to spend a couple of hours. The gallery is free and there are hundreds and hundreds of pieces of art, including some very famous paintings. The impressionist section was our favorite, but they had work from many different periods. Definitely worth the visit. "
"Written September 5, 2022",Good to kill a few hours,"As we were close by we wanted to use up some time before heading back to the train station. As the National Gallery is free to enter this seemed like an ideal way to ass the time. It has been a few (many) years since we last went and it's just as good as before. Of course there are the high profile paintings, but as this was towards the end of the summer and on a week day, it was not overly busy. This gave us chance to enjoy the paintings and read about them rather than standing from afar.It looks like the building had been updated a little since last time. Though something could be done about the smell from the lavatories. Otherwise, this was a nice time spent and we ended up walking around for about 2 hours without realising and probably didn't see everything as it is a large maze. In a good way."
"Written September 3, 2023",Such amazing artwork on display in a beautiful building,"We decided to visit the National Gallery the day before, so booked our time slot online, which was an easy procedure.Really enjoyed wandering looking and appreciating such classic works of art. It's one thing seeing them on television, but another thing altogether to see them in the flesh. From the colours, to the size of the paintings and just being able to appreciate them for yourself. So many artists' work on display, and free to see. "
"Written January 5, 2022",Our day trip in our home town,"My middle daughter wanted to visit a museum and we had not been here before. My youngest 9 even enjoyed herself! The place was well organised and staff were friendly and approachable. I would advise booking a ticket beforehand, there is an optional donation but it isn’t that much. A place worth visiting."
"Written September 7, 2020",Coping well with COVID-19 ,"I visited to see the Titian and Maes exhibitions, which were both good. Although the Titian was set in the main galleries to provide more space for social distancing, this didn’t detract, though I was out of the exhibition before I realised. There were definitely fewer people and the Gallery was properly enforcing timed entry. And the art is pretty good!"
"Written July 10, 2022",TWO visits in past 4 months!,"I saw the Gainsborough Blue boy and the wonderfully done Raphael exhibit in April but did not have the time to see other rooms. Ii just returned from in early July second visit and took in the 3 routes which cover 14,15,16,17 and 18,century masters. Plan to spend at least 6 hours to really absorb the wonderful collections."
"Written June 13, 2021",Room to move and view,"With Covid, you need to make sure that you book your time slot. With this and designated routes that you have to take, it actually means that you aren't getting large groups in a few galleries. People are more spread out and I think you actually have a calmer visit.We had a 9 and 7 year old in our group. Following the green route we saw enough to capture the children's imagination, but I don't think they would have wanted to spend much longer in the gallery. The only disappointment was seeing a disabled gentleman being turned away from the coffee shop as he didn't have a card to pay. He only had cash. I appreciate the difficulty with cash, but remember, not everyone has access to cards."
"Written October 15, 2022","For art lovers, this is London's most important place to visit",One of the best things about the National Gallery is that it is free. Not to mention that it is centrally located. So I recommend not trying to see everything in one visit. Go in for an hour or so and enjoy the painting until you've had enough. Then return in a day or two to see some more. And again and again. Why not?
"Written July 6, 2022",A must see!,"The museum has a rich variety of rare historical pieces. Greek, Asian and Islamic and Christina history placed with such elegance. There is something to see for every generation. Not the best place for children. Lots to learn and enjoy. I plan to go back. A must see."
"Written January 31, 2023",Turner on tour,"I have to admit, I could happily have sat in some areas all day. Seeing these paintings in person makes you realise the talent these artists had and shared with the world. I am biased as I adore the works of Turner and for me,  these were the stars of the gallery. Seeing his work in person made me feel many different emotions and for me , that’s what art should be, how it makes you, the individual feel. A free visit, donations are very much a must as you are preserving history for future generations so be generous and pop some donations I. The boxes to ensure we keep these wonderful works safe forever!"
"Written April 30, 2022",Always a Delight to Visit,"Whenever I visit London, I most often visit the National Gallery. On this recent visit, I bought the ticket to the Raphael Exhibition. I have to say that it was a bit underwhelming. However, I still enjoyed my visit, large because you can always get a lot out of the permanent collections. Oh, Gainsborough's Blue Boy was a treat!"
"Written September 28, 2023",The best free collection in the world,The National Gallery doesn't need a description. But if you're thinking of going plan your visit as there's too much to see in one hit. Do some research first and focus on particular eras or artists. Personally I love the older works (pre-1500) in the Sainsbury Wing and Spanish religious art. Both are well represented.Also look for the free guided tours and/or the talk and draw sessions on Friday lunchtimes.It is open late on Fridays and best avoided on Sundays as its too busy.
"Written May 20, 2022",Stunning,"A national treasure. Stunning exhibits, no crowds, immediate access without booking (10.00am Wednesday). The 'guided routes' not signposted well enough, it's easy to get off track and miss things."
"Written May 10, 2020",Visit to National Gallery and its Restaurant - November 2019,"I enjoyed the Gaugin Exhibition very much.  However, one thing I did not enjoy was my visit to the restaurant afterwards.  It was  dimly lit and very uninviting.  I decided to order a small pizza which cost £7.90.  When it was delivered to my table, I could see immediately that the pizza had been overcooked because the crust was dark brown.  I attempted to cut a piece off to eat it but was unable to get my knife through the pizza. I turned it over and could see that it was black underneath.  I then asked to see the Manager and showed it to him.  Simultanelously I asked to get a refund because I was not prepared to accept this as an edible pizza.  He then returned to the cash desk and refunded my money.  He did not apologise to me, which I thought was totally unacceptable.  I could not in any way recommend this restaurant. "
"Written July 23, 2022",Surprisingly cool National Gallery Trafalgar Square,"Superb art well displayed in airconditioned comfort. Visitor flow well managed so you never felt there was a crowd.  Free entry but we paid to see the Raphael exhibition.Excellent experience finished off by well priced great food in the relaxing and stylish cafe. Highly recommended, especially on a hot and humid London summer day (did I mention the airconditioning?).Great location on Trafalgar Square with the underground."
"Written August 23, 2023",Not to be missed !!!,Went for the « After Impressionism: Inventing Modern Art » exhibition. Very well done and explained; the selection of paintings was excellent. Saw some amazing Picasso’s. After the exhibition it is alway nice to stroll in the different galleries in order to discover or rediscover the exposed art works.
"Written March 19, 2023",One of London's Must-Do Activities,"What can you say, really? It's one of the most famous and robust art collections in the world...and it's free to view! I've been here several times over the past two decades and am amazed at what I see every time I set foot in the place. There's always something new to learn, and always more time you can spend here enriching yourself. One of the best things to do in London!"
"Written August 26, 2022",Wonderful Experience...,"Great place to visit, very unique experience. Truly wonderful experience. Collection of the best paintings from all over the world , best pieces by old masters like Monet , Rembrandt or Titian and many others ."
"Written November 3, 2022","Gallery is Breathtaking, Avoid the Tea Shop!!","I typically detest when reviewers write about something beside the actual attraction but since it is a safety issue I think it is important. Avoid the tea shop if at all possible. Shortly after arriving we realized we were famished and went down there. My husband ordered a coffee and a tea, and the tea was literally boiling. The cup was so hot it burned two of his fingers. The toilets only had room temperature water, it didn't get cold. I went to the counter, told a man what happened and asked for ice. They didn't have any, he was not remotely concerned but did say ""i have some burn gel if you would like it."" I did, and I also paid £3 for a tiny cup of ice cream for my husband to cool his fingers. After the initial concern we went to the restaurant and asked for a cup of ice which we were given. Yes, tea is supposed to be hot but not so hot in burns the skin, and served in very flimsy paper cups. Just a thought, if you need to stock complimentary burn gel at your tea shop the water might be a wee hot."
"Written May 17, 2023",No Absence of Paint here,"After Impressionism Show a must see. Many works from Private Collections. Look out for Piet Mondrian’s 1906 tree tryptich (depicting his arriving at abstraction) Picasso’s portrait of Gustave Couiot, Van Gogh’s of Madame Genoux (from memory)and Vuillard’s shadowy Lugnie Poe, to name a few. You’ll get visual Indigestion and want to see this twice. But there is more in the permanent exhibition."
"Written August 5, 2020",Amazing.,Just loved it all to be honest. It’s quite humbling to stand in front of such beautiful works of art. I love Vincent and I always get a certain buzz when I see his works. All these years and he is still so loved. Staff are very friendly and it’s a must if you are coming to London.
"Written August 6, 2021",Unnecessary restrictions,"Booked a timed ticket, arrived 40 mins early, told to come back in half an hour. OK. Had a coffee, came back on time, was told that the backpack I was carrying was too large and there were no left luggage facilities. Was directed to the left luggage at Charring X Station! Why not tell me half an hour earlier. Anyway, decided not to bother. Annoying, since we had made a voluntary donation on-line when booking."
"Written August 6, 2023",Very poor service and extremely expensive,"We had afternoon tea at Ochre the National Gallery and rather expected, given the price quoted at £42.95 it would be exquisite. Sadly not. The food offered was acceptable but not stunning. It certainly bore no relation to the After Impressionism exhibition it was supposedly based on. The service though was poor. A chipped and cracked glass, and when I asked for lemon with my tea I was presented with a jug of milk. Afternoon Tea was advertised as After  Impressionism Afternoon Tea and offered 10%discount for ticket holders,  this didn’t manifest on our bill, nor were we asked if we were ticket holders,  but service charge was added making the whole exercise extremely expensive for a mediocre experience."
"Written October 3, 2022",Interesting museum,"We went somewhat close to closing time so were slightly rushed. However, we still go to see the highlights. The museum wasn't too crowded and had lots of interesting pieces. The building itself is also cool to look at. "
"Written October 29, 2022",Worth a visit - free entry!,We had a really lovely time at the gallery. We only queued for about 10 minutes before going through security and bag searches. The inside was well manned with security and everything was sparkling clean. Lots of seating options and water fountains available which was pretty cool!
"Written August 16, 2022",Always something to surprise you!,"I have been there many times and everytime something touches me differently. Rafael's exhibit is really impressive. And Caravaggio's Emaus Supper my favorite. The restaurant is nice good salads, modern service. good option for a quick stop"
"Written December 12, 2022",Huge Collection,"Wow, the expansiveness of the museum, and it’s free! Save for the special exhibit. A lot of really great artworks here. They cover a wide range of time periods. Big names like Renoir, Cezanne, Peter Paul Rubens, Manet, Michelangelo, Da Vinci. Definitely not to be missed! It was a lot to see, so plan accordingly. There are over 2,000 works here."
"Written February 12, 2020",Second visit,A long time ago there was so many people I couldn't see a thing and I gave up. This time I managed to see the exhibits in several rooms without any problem. But you need 10 visits to see everything this wonderful museum has to offer.It is a pity that some of the most famous paintings weren't on display.
"Written January 21, 2020",Amazing paintings! Friendly helpful staff,Wonderful classical paintings.  Amazing condition. Friendly helpful staff. Gallery shop had huge array of products & cashiers very professional. Really enjoyed walking through those rooms full of treasures of Art.
"Written August 25, 2021",Bit of a effort to get in,Went for an afternoon stroll. Bit of a effort to get in. You have to register and then wait for a couple of email which may or may not go to your junk box. The galleries were not to busy and the safe had great customer service 
"Written January 2, 2020",Always worth the visit,"We had some time to explore between adventures and headed to see the Gaugin exhibit... but it wasn’t open yet, so used to time to explore the Gallery proper. Some familiar sights, some new discoveries, even just watch the farces in the crowd...all are treasures."
"Written June 3, 2021",They let us in with no booking,"Great exhibition, amazing staff, lift for pram. Would not miss it if  waking by. Silence, history and great art work from the past,( 13th -20th century) nothing contemporary. "
"Written April 25, 2022",Ochre restaurant at the National gallery,"More chore than ochre!!I went to the above restaurant for lunch on my own after a visit to the gallery.The place was not crowded. I sat at the table for over ten minutes and felt like an invisible diner.No waiter came to give me the menu, or even acknowledged my presence. The table of six next to me having champagne … I realise that eating on your own is quite rare but, I do it a lot all over the world.I eventually had a wonderful lunch at Cicchetti. The Italian waiters were charming. Shows you the difference in culture."
"Written September 5, 2022",Wonderful museum with a great display of famous paintings.,It was my first time to visit the national gallery. I was stunned by the interior and the wonderful display of paintings by the most famous artists. The restaurants serve great food (salads) and the best espresso in town.
"Written December 19, 2022",Very good visit,"We had not been to the National  Gallery for many years, so it was firmly on our agenda for this London trip. It lived up to our expectations, well laid out, easy to sit and gaze at wonderful art. Particularly love the Turner's andConstable 's ."
"Written October 4, 2020",Artemisia exhibition ,Amazing paintings and story. Somewhat let down by the unpleasant treatment received in the queuing process. I was told to move when I sat on a bench in the exhibition. I was told for the social distance to work I could not sit around but move on. I was actually waiting for the people around the 4 portraits to disperse to not crowd them. And I also wanted my group of husband and 2 kids to stay together.
"Written November 12, 2022",World class gallery showing iconic pictures,"Amazing collection of the superstars of the art world in a great venue. Unfortunately for us, as a result of its star status, it was incredibly busy so spending time with the masters was not very restful.  It just means we will have to try again at a quieter time (if there is such a thing?!)"
"Written March 16, 2022",So Much to See,"Whenever I come to London, I always stop by the National Gallery. It is one of my favorite museums in London! My husband and I spent about 3-4 hours at the Gallery. We made online reservations, but I don't think that was necessary. There is so much to see here, so allow plenty of time if you're an art lover."
"Written June 14, 2022",Great gallery for Renassiance artwrork,Was highly impressed with collection. Went on a Monday early afternoon and was still quite busy. Audio guide took assistance to actually get it to coordinate with exhibits. Very large so plan on spending several hours. Location is right on Trafalgar Square for before/after visit activities.
"Written September 6, 2022",Immersed in Beauty,"So much beautiful art in one place, covering work of many centuries, in a building with beautiful architecture. There is so much to see that it can't be done in one visit.  Best to concentrate on a few areas.  And it's free!  What a gift.  "
"Written August 1, 2020",Well managed in current circumstances ,A great visit. Beautiful rooms and really amazing art works.Social distancing was managed very well thanks to well sign posted one way routes.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Stunning location at Trafalgar Square.
"Written July 30, 2022",Great Collection,"Lovely museum with free admission, though do prebook a ticket so you can skip the long line waiting to buy tickets. Well laid out, so fairly easy to follow rooms in sequence and not miss anything. Raphael is still the best in my opinion, and he didn’t disappoint here. One of the best art collections in the world - do not miss."
"Written June 12, 2023",Amazing,Absolutely huge Gallery. Arrived an hour before closing so didn't get much time to see everything but had a great experience with one of the security guards who told us all about the history of the Wilton Diptych. He clearly loves his job and made our short visit very memorable. It was great to see the enthusiasm he brought to the place.
"Written November 15, 2021",Amazing art collection,This was a wonderful (and free!) stop in London that could take up a couple of hours to see highlights or could take days to see everything.  The extensive collection is very well displayed and the staff is super friendly and helpful in finding specific pieces.  Highly recommended stop!
"Written April 7, 2023",Always great,Superb collections. Always worth a visit. Be aware that you cannot take a poster in to the gallery. It will be held at security for you. Someone recently framed a poster and stuck it to the wall near an original-All sounds a bit Mr Bean but caused great embarrassment for the National .
"Written May 31, 2022",From classics to the surprising,Fabulous collection housed beautifully. Clear routes and plans help you determine how long each wing might take. Free. Donation encouraged. Not busy on a Friday evening in March. 
"Written March 27, 2022",Beautiful,Visited the gallery twice during two days. I spent 12 hours there. The place is really beatiful and large. You need at least 6 hours to visit all the rooms. The best gallery I have ever visited.
"Written January 2, 2020",A must see art museum,"This was far better than I thought it would be - we actually came back a second day to see more of it. I'm not a huge art guy but my wife is so we made sure to see it but it was far better than I thought. Wonderful exhibits, well spaced, nice staff. Just perfect."
"Written May 11, 2022",One of London’s best freebies!,"I still find it refreshing that it is still free to come into this wonderful Gallery. The staff are so helpful and as a wheelchair user, it is very accessible. One slight criticism, difficult to press the buttons on the lift and as I was on my own I had to ask people to do it for me. It will not dissuade me from giving them five stars , A tiny problem which was outweighed by a fabulous visit."
"Written July 26, 2022",Wonderful,A great place to spend several hours. Was not able to take my umbrella in - had to use cloakroom which I guess is understandable until i saw others walking around with umbrellas! £2 charge per item for cloakroom. An amazing gallery and well worth a visit
"Written February 23, 2022",Great minimalist art installations,Incredible modern minimalist art. I am a graphic designer and come here to get inspiration for my work. Great environment and family friendly. The cafe in the museum is friendly and has some great bites. highly recommended!
"Written June 21, 2020",A must to visit in London!,"I visited the National Gallery in May mostly because of the Blue Boy painting. I booked my Gallery Entry ticket online, entrance: Sainsbury Wing, worked very well. Unfortunately I couldn't visit the shop after seeing the gallery as there was a fire alarm and everybody has to leave immediately. I will go there in September again."
"Written April 13, 2022",you need more than view hours to enjoy them all!,"beautiful paintings, and beautiful building. But to have this feeling, you are surrounded by those great paintings is another level. Great atmosphere. it is free (sure you can donate if you wish).  if you can spare at least a half day to spend there , that would be great. And no worries, their cafeteria has best cakes! "
"Written July 17, 2022",Always a great place to visit.........,"My wife and I were in central London so decided to pop into the National Gallery.  You can not fail to spot something new, no matter how many times you visit. World class paintings well displayed. Although busy, it didn't feel overcrowded.No charge for entry although certain exhibitions are chargeable, I believe.Well worth a visit."
"Written March 21, 2023",Art at its best,The staff were friendly and in the past made sure we always got in without any issues ( COVID times so had to book with a ticket we didn't have a ticket but still found space for us to visit) Art is incredible just so much history! it's free go donate if you wanna! Check out the best of london
"Written March 5, 2020",Fab...but no Sunflowers!,"Wonderful museum, free to enter but we were happy to leave a generous donation. Particularly enjoyed the impressionists - sadly Sunflowers was out on loan. Also great to see several great Turner pieces and enjoyed the Canaletto's. All in all a great place to visit, terrific building and a superb location."
"Written March 1, 2020",A masterpiece!,"This wonderful free museum houses such a special collection. Always enjoy visiting and finding new favourites, as well as going back to see old friends!Security and cloakroom staff were really friendly and helpful so they deserve a shout out! We visited twice this week when we had a bit of time to spare and really had a lovely time. Look forward to coming back soon! "
"Written January 5, 2020",Beautiful every time!,The National Gallery is a place to visit time and again. Always something new and plenty of the standing collection to discover each time. And free!  Certainly appreciate donations but not required.  If you've seen the Louvre - the National Gallery is on that order of magnitude.
"Written November 4, 2022",Amazing exhibits,"The National Gallery is the main art museum in London. Very nice place for European art. One of the best museums ever visited. Go and see some masterpieces, make a little donation if you can."
"Written August 21, 2023",Excellent selection ,"Wow, so many wonderful pieces of art. Highlights were from Pablo Picasso, George Seurat and of course Vincent Van Gogh. It was an absolute treat to see my 13 year old spot the Bathers by Seurat, after enjoying reading the Katie books. Her smile was worth a million dollars.  Seeing the Sunflowers which she'd studied in school was also a high light for her. We also enjoyed the gift shop very much lol. "
"Written January 23, 2023",depressing basement cafe,"Had coffee in the downstairs cafeteria.   Service from counter was slow due to poor queue management; staff were young and a bit overwhelmed by the weekend crowds.  Little choice of snacks from depleted  display.  Decor basic, really unfit for national gallery and destination visit."
"Written April 24, 2022",Great but money grabbing bistro,The catering's improved immeasurably since I was last here with the bistro offering a nice eating space BUT with a caveat..they weigh the salad!! As if they're not making enough money out of you.On the upside it remains one of the best galleries I've ever visited.
"Written February 27, 2023",wonderful,What a gorgeous place - you could get lost in it for days.  The art is so magnificent you almost become used to its wonder.  Though the audio guide was good my children got a bit bored an hour in (the philistines)
"Written August 29, 2023",Immense art gallery,"A truly beautiful art museum and adding the fact that admission is free, a visit is almost a must. Lots of works by different artists from all over the world.I only took two photos in a hurry because I didn't have much time, I wanted to enjoy the moment of the visit more."
"Written September 7, 2020",Titian,"Delighted to have the opportunity to explore the exhibition. Signed up for membership and tickets on line very easily. Arrived at alloted time and directed to exhibition, after leisurely visit continued on two of the trails and visited Maes. "
"Written December 22, 2021",Book your tickets online!,"There was a long queue when we were there but since we had booked tickets online prior, we didn't have to queue very long! There was also Xmas markets outside of the National Gallery when we were there so just take note if you are going in Nov/Dec.There is also a multi-faith prayer room available, just ask any staff and they will direct you. Thank you to the staff of National Gallery!"
"Written January 25, 2023",Brush strokes,Midweek afternoon visit to the gallery. Beautiful place with plenty seating areas and staff to help with directions.Beautiful paintings although I found the text on the information cards far too small. Lighting was a little darker than I expected but the one thing they could improve on was the room numbers. Better signs to prevent the repeated walking around in the same direction thus no need to feel exhausted at the end of the trip.
"Written February 9, 2023",Enjoyable visit,"We went when the Japanese exhibit was there. The workmanship was superb. The silver displays in their permanent collection were also exquisite. The paintings were wonderful but, at least in my eyes, were overshadowed by the other exhibits. All in all, it was a very enjoyable visit."
"Written April 18, 2021",Wish you were not here,"The staffs had a long long time of no work. Now this place is open, staffs are of feeling that we are bothering them. The staffs want no one to come through the door. At least, that s th message that was transmitted t us here!"
"Written October 5, 2021",Good routes to choose if you stick to them,All free unless you go to a particular event.  There are routes to choose to go past certain artists.  It can be quite difficult to stick to your chosen route as there is so much to see.  Nice shop.
"Written June 12, 2022",Beautiful Art,"The National Gallery is a must visit if you are on London. While art isn’t my thing, I am still glad I went because I was able to see art from some really famous artists. Get tickets in advance even though it’s free!"
"Written June 11, 2023",Overwhelming experience without guidance,"Quite overwhelming to be honest. It’s definitely worth a visit, their collection is impressive. Seeing everything is almost impossible, and here comes the only drawback of it that I can see. The staff isn’t helpful enough, for example when I asked how I can get to something I was answered that I didn’t have enough time to get there( it was 30 min to closing). In my opinion it isn’t how you treat a guest. Apart from that great experience, but only if you have a lot of free time. In other case, you have come and try to see at least the highlights."
"Written January 17, 2020",Always a delight,Always a delight. Free to visit but fee for special exhibition. Special exhibition a bit steep priced. Well worth the time. Excellent selection. None of the time I follow the map and always see something unexpected.

Cant wait to go again next year to see any other exhibitions that may be on."
"Written October 11, 2022","National Gallery, world treasure!","I paid another visit to this treasure on my last trip in late September, 2022.

Great value, as I didn't feel the need for a guide. Plenty of group, and self-directed options, if you would prefer one. Fantastic day out."

Place was clean, tidy and pleasant temp. Would have liked a map for the different rooms on paper (it was on the walls and maybe I just missed the paper ones), because the rooms a bit of confusing and there are many options.I also liked the museum store."

The building itself is lovely and everything is laid out well."
"Written May 10, 2023",Good collection of art from famous artists,"Pretty good collection of paintings from artists like Van Gogh, Monet, among others.  Admission is freel.  The interior of the building and the grounds are really neat to look at and take in as well."

As expected for a Saturday afternoon it was busy but staff appeared to be coping well. They have a fab menu here. Our food arrived and looked great…but tasted amazing! Really nice portion and the menu is well priced. We had a lovely time and are already planning on returning. Well done Ochre!"
"Written February 14, 2020",Cool museum and it's free too!,"One of the perks of staying at St. James is the proximity to everything touristy.  This was one of them.  We couldn't be happier on how we planned our trip.  For being 1st timers in this country/city, we did good.  We even brought Mr. Sunshine with us from sunny California (after raining everyday for a week) before we got in.  So much to discover and learn and this place is a good start."
"Written August 18, 2023",You must stop in if even for an hour!,"We came here yesterday with a friend. We stop here for a visit every year while in London.

But I will say, it's really hard to follow.  Some rooms are numbered, some aren't.  We spend close to 3 hours there and I'm sure we missed entire rooms.  Oh well, it was free, and there is just so much to appreciate.  Would honestly go revisit on every future visit to London."
"Written January 14, 2023",Breathtaking and I am not an Art Fanatic!,"Awe inspiring paintings from 800 years ago to 20th Century. Van Gogh Sunflowers made me cry! I saw so many that I recognised from TV, Film, Books. Loved Monet’s Waterlilies too. And it is FREE!"
"Written October 15, 2020",Great rainy day activity,"Incredible building. Historic art work. Plenty of room inside so you can avoid the crowds if you want. It is very dark inside, so rainy day is best. It would be a shame to visit on a bright sunny day."
"Written April 10, 2022",Worth a Visit,"Amazing collection of art. There really is A LOT to take in, so make sure that you give yourself enough time. I would suggest booking as well as it can get booked up fully at the moment due to covid. Avoid the cafe, it's very expensive. Even for London."
"Written March 23, 2020",A Treasure,"The National Trust has provided the citizens of the world with free access to a global treasure. The permanent collection here is staggering in its depth and breadth. I can always spend more time than I have available and after numerous visits, I know I still haven't seen it all. "

"Written February 12, 2020",Free attraction!,I was shocked that this fabulous attraction was free!  I would definitely have paid visit this fabulous gallery.  We spent nearly 2 hours roaming the various exhibits and still had more to see.  We did not have our kids for this trip as it was just adults but we will definitely be back with them.  Unheard of to get something for free these days.  A MUST SEE for anyone visiting London!

Need to visit again as far too much to take in. Spent a couple of hours wandering around and it was great. Actually recognised a couple of artists' work.  Wonderful staff in every section. Highly recommend. 
"Written April 22, 2022",Would highly recommend ,Wow. Fantastic experience.  Loved it. Beautiful Art work  to see. Photos taken as a reminder of what we had seen. Free entry is a great bonus to see something so good.
"Written February 6, 2020",Chock full of wonderful art but it is like a maze in there.,"This is another great, free to enter museum.Bursting at the seams with fabulous artists.But it is so overwhelming. We were in there for about 3 hours and it was more than enough, we had to get out for air haha! It is a rabbit warren of rooms that even my husband (who is excellent at directions) struggled to find they way.But saw Van Gogh's (yes I say it Goff) Sunflowers at last as it was on loan last time."
"Written July 14, 2023",Well worth a visit ,"Great gallery with beautiful paintings. Definitely recommend a visit, coffee shop is good too. Advise pre booking your visit,  still free but can avoid queue outside. "
"Written October 17, 2020",Rebooking of tickets ,I had to reorganise the date for visiting Titian Exhibition. The staff via email were so helpful in rebooking my original ticket. No charge. I have also spoken to staff on the phone earlier in the year and the person was lovely. 
"Written March 25, 2021",Incredible Museum,"I have always wanted to go in here and I am glad we did.  I was in London in July 2019 for a conference and had a chance to do so.  The artwork, paintings, statues, etc were incredible to view.  This is a place I could spend the day in, and would still not be able to see everything it has to offer."
"Written March 1, 2020",One of those London experiences,"This is one of those places that has to be seen when visiting London.Its huge of course and its easy to immerse yourself into the spaces.The collection is very eclectic .We enjoyed a wide range of subjects , from pottery to fashion to architecture.The rooms were busy but everything was accessible.They also have wheelchairs for those with mobility problems.The staff were very friendly, and would often come up and suggest options and points of view."
"Written September 1, 2022",Always worth a visit,I love this museum.  The art collection is varied and the interior architecture beautiful. I miss the old entrance but the new layout works.   I go there every time I visit London and Trafalgar Square is always a great place to be. 
"Written February 22, 2022",Great art gallery - especially 'Blue Boy'.,Had to queue to get in but well worth it. Whole lot of art to see although the highlight this time was Gainsborough's 'Blue Boy'. Impressive painting. Good to see it alongside other paintings of the time. 
"Written January 7, 2020",A MUST. ,"Fourth time in London.  First time at National Gallery.  A Surprise. Allocate 3+ hrs.  Pizarro, van Gogh, etc.   The xmas market at Trafalgar Square was a welcomed surprise. "
"Written July 6, 2022",It was great place. Clean. Beautiful.,"It was great place. Clean. Beautiful. There were lots of people in there, as aspected. The down side for me was the fact that there was no guide.I know there are tabs on the wall to explain some of the paintings, however, there were some things that had no explanation and there was no one to guide us.Overall, it’s a good place to hangout for the weekend."
"Written July 31, 2022",A lot to see,A lot to see and you can really enjoy ART. Unfortunately I wasn't alllowed to take pictures with my 360 camera because staff said I cannot raise camera and make pictures. For security reasons or just shovinistic people? 
"Written August 10, 2023",A feast of fabulous art,"Iconic building with vast rooms of wonderful art, so much to see let alone the exhibitions that are chargeable.Excellent little cafe with the best-ever almond croissant, great service and reasonably priced, we refuelled to see more rooms.  So many treasures it is a wondrous experience. We did not have a tour - just wandered at leisure."
"Written March 30, 2020",Unexpectedly facinating.,Went in to escape the rain. What an amazing place to be able to enter free of charge. It really brings history and it's characters to life. Right up to date with a brilliantly executed portrait of Ed Shearan. Would go again to cover the areas we had no time for.
"Written July 26, 2023",Great exhibition,Plenty of works from Constable and other artists. Also saw few from van Gogh and Picasso (They were the most crowded). The building itself was pretty too. Booked in advance. Visited 20th of july and it was only mildly crowded.
"Written September 22, 2020",Lovely experience,"Have visited the tItian exhibition twice now. On both occasions social,distancing exemplary, staff are friendly, doing their absolute best. Lovely browse around other rooms too.i was unsure previsit about the route to take but an email was quickly answered with a helpful reply."
"Written October 25, 2022",Wonderful Gallery,"I went first thing in the morning so the crowds weren't too bad. The entrance is at the South-west corner of the building. You could spend all day, taking your time walking through the gallery. They have a wide variety of pieces."
"Written January 26, 2020",Fantastic art gallery ,"I had an hour or so to fill around Trafalgar Square so I popped into the National Gallery. I had a coffee and cake in the cafe which were very nice and then had a wander around the Gallery. I love all the old Masters. There are some beautiful paintings. Very good place to dip into and out of, with a nice restaurant and cafe. "
"Written August 25, 2020",Top art,"I visited the museum 20 yrs ago and went again last week, because of covid not as crowded as I remembered.You need to book before visiting. The new exposition are amazing, the art is the top outside Italy."
"Written May 27, 2021",no customer service/ assistance to book a ticket,Today I did not receive any help by trying to get a ticket for the National gallery.I arrive without online ticket and did not get any help to get in. First I was advised to return another day. Than to book online (I do not get smart phone) or call the gallery (I did not get phone at that moment with me) or to look for internet cafe to book online. The security guy said there is nobody who can help me if I do not have online ticket.I had bad experience and it seems that national gallery is only for elitist with phone with online connection.When I called to book slot I could reach only voice mail machine. To obtain a ticket for the gallery is challenging task. Good luck if you wish to visit.
"Written May 29, 2013",Unfriendly place,Guards will scream at the top of their lungs if you were not aware of no photo policy (I was actually photographing the ceiling and not the paintings). Lol. The art was pretty great.
"Written March 23, 2013",Art lover's mecca!,"The collection of art in this gallery is outstanding.  The Sainsbury wing houses the earliest paintings, some dating from the 13th century.  It also has a wonderful restaurant.  The original part of the gallery has paintings up to and including the 20th centuriy.  Their masterpieces are too numerour to mention.  Since the gallery is free, if you have the time, it would be best to visit  for a couple of hours over a number of days, so you don't ""burnout."""
"Written March 9, 2013",disappointing,"sorry I find art museum such as this one very boring: paintings, paintings, paintings.... and it's all. Quite boring stuff. Never again!"
"Written January 18, 2013",Always a joy,"A stroll or an in-depth visit, the museum will always have something new and exciting on. On top of that the food is always good so it makes a great places to meet friends and experience the best of culture."
"Written January 6, 2012",It's the national treasure box,It's hard not to be overwhelmed with the sheer beauty. And it's all for free. What a national treasure!
"Written January 1, 2012","Leonardo Exhibition, on-the-day tickets","In short: queue earlier than you think sensible.The Gallery does a fantastic job of informing people of their chances of getting a ticket-on-the-day by having staff on duty outside the Sainsbury wing from 8 a.m..  We went at the end of December and the earliest arrival had got there at 5!  We were there at 6 and by 7 there were about 150 people in the queue, each of whom could buy up to 8 tickets each.  The gallery staff went along the queue asking people how many tickets they were wishing to buy, to give them an indication of when to advise people that there would be little/no chance of them getting a ticket for that day.  On our day, it meant that anyone who arrived after 8 a.m. was advised that they would be unlikely to get a ticket and anyoe arriving after 8.15 was a definite ""not today"".The atmosphere in the queue was one of great camaraderie and there was much swapping of tales of cultural highlights.  Our four-hours in the queue passed remarkably quickly and it was fun watching London wake up.  There are plenty of establishments for refreshments and toilet facilities around Charing Cross station.Would I do it again.  Definitely, as the exhibition is beyond comparison with all the drawings adding greatly to one's understanding of the art on display.Whoever designed the exhibiton had great fun positioning the painting of Il Moro's wife and mistress: if you follow the former's gaze, she is glaring directly at the mistress (The Lady with ermine)."
"Written September 19, 2011",Best things in life are free,"I visited the Gallery just by the Trafalgar Square on a perfect summer afternoon. With thousands of European paintings on display, this has to be one of the largest galleries of its kind in the world. No wonder more than 5 million people visit this place each year. I'm impressed by the paintings of Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titian, Velázquez, Van Gogh & Renoir. To see a similar range of paintings in the Lovre one would have to endure long queues and high ticker prices. In London, there's no queue and it's free. I guess that's why there's an Enlish adage: the best things in life are free. This surely is one of them !"
"Written August 28, 2011",Amazing!,"Free museum (but still provided donation) that offers plethora of art from Leonardo to Van Gogh. Busy but well worth it! Super nice, helpful staff. Get audio guide!"
"Written April 20, 2010","Fantastic Museum, Okay Dining","First off, the museum itself is a treasure.  Everything from the amazing approach via Trafalfar Square, even the fun and engaging street performers, was enchanting. There is so much here to see that you'll have to pick what your priorities are, enjoy them, and come back another day.  Each person in our family of four chose several rooms that we wanted to see. When we'd seen each person's highlights, we were ""arted up"" for the day.  Do get the map they give you. It can be fairly confusing to find the various rooms without one - and even with one!  The lower floor coffee shop has great interactive computers that will help you plan your day, help you find specific paintings or artists, even make a mini tour. You can print it out after you plan, and I recommend that. The dining room was ... all right.  Pretty, with fairly inattentive service.  The food was just okay, and for the prices, that wasn't good. I agree with the other reviewer who said her starters were  great. The chicken liver was divine as was the potted crab. Our roast beef, though, was tough, and the lamb not up to par with any other we ate while in England.  The vegetarian meal, with hazelnuts and mushrooms, was bland and uninspired.  I left, toward the end of the meal, to visit the ladies, and as I did, passed the attached cafe. After looking at their offerings I wished we'd eaten there instead. Better looking food with much lower prices.The museum shop, while larger, wasn't as good, I didn't think, as the one for the National Portrait Gallery just next door.All in all a wonderful day out."
"Written January 23, 2010",Well worth a visit when in London,"The National Gallery is a fabulous place to visit when in London.  The building is beautiful and it is in a fantastic location.  The Gallery is actually free to visit , although donations at the exit/entrance are welcomed. There is a marvellous collection of art which will appeal to everyone.  Some modern, although most of it is the older more classic pieces of art.  The rooms are very lights and airy, and the pictures are very spaced out - unlike some other galleries i have visited.  There are also plenty of seat throughout, so if you do get tired or just want to sit and admire some of the art, this is possible.  During weekdays there are normally quite a few school trips, however should you stand near some of these tours, you do get to find out some interesting facts about the artwork !For tourists and sightseers it is in an excellent location, right behind Trafalgar sq, just down the road from Piccadilly Circus and Regents Street, a short but pleasant walk from Buckingham Palace and in the other direction Westminster.  You could easily spend a day if not more in this area.  For those travelling by tube, the nearest station is charing cross and the Trafalgar Sq exit is the most convenient.  It's well worth a morning out of your day"
"Written July 2, 2022",World Class,Works by so many masters! This is a must see for any art fan.  It was incredible and its free!  I love Monet and saw some really beautiful works.  Could spend days here.  Will definitely be back. 
"Written January 23, 2020","Beautiful gallery, a must visit ",Beautiful gallery with their spectacular collection of art pieces. Only had a short time to through the few rooms. The rooms can be a little confusing but all rooms are marked with number to help direct. Need to go back!

"Written September 14, 2023",Art in an Hour,"Seven of us visited as we walked through London with a darkening sky.  We only had an hour ... not long enough for this huge gallery.  However, we split up and  each searched their favourites.  The result was a successful visit in a short time."
"Written June 26, 2022",Many galleries! Many famous works!,"Beautiful exhibitions in a beautiful building. Great place to visit, honestly one of the nicest art museums i’ve been to. Great staff and organized and clean rooms. Extensive galleries you won’t get bored."

But, we did find Boy and Girl and Cat and Eel, which was the highlight of our visit :)Seriously, some lovely paintings and so interesting. Well worth a visit."
"Written July 3, 2023",Phenomenal collection even better customer service,"The collection is phenomenal but what really makes the visit is the staff. Dave and Maria were incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. They really made my visit special. All the staff were amazing and so kind. Will visit again."
"Written November 3, 2018",Wonderful experience viewing beautiful & exquisite art,"This Trafalgar Square located art museum specializes in paintings produced between 1250 and 1900, of which it has over 2,300 paintings. Some of the collections are temporary and change with time. Over the past 20 years, this is my third visit, and many of the pieces are new to the National Gallery. The art of many world masters are on display. This is a very impressive collection of paintings and artefacts."
"Written March 22, 2016",A wonderful collection.,"What an impressive building to visit, with beautiful paintings by Rembrandt, Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh, Constable, and you don’t have to pay to get in.  However, because it is free it can get very crowded.We spent an enjoyable couple of hours wandering round and saw a superb collection of the world’s finest works of art.  There must be at least 50 rooms here, all tastefully arranged with beautiful paintings.There is a nice café in the basement where we enjoyed some tea and cakes.I would definitely recommend the National Gallery to anyone visiting London."
"Written August 19, 2016",A very impressive art gallery and it’s free!,"The National Gallery is one of London's best known attractions and is free to the general public. However, they do ask for a £5 donation, which we were more than happy to pay. We had a very enjoyable visit; it is an impressive building with a superb collection of paintings, I was not expecting to see so many beautiful works of art in one place.  There are so many rooms, all displaying wonderful pieces of art.The gallery was not too busy when we visited and there are lifts for the less mobile and mums with pushchairs.There is a gift shop where you can purchase reprints of the paintings on display in a range of sizes and there is also a cafe.The National Gallery is definitely worth a visit, you really are spoilt for choice because there is so much to see and it’s free!"
"Written February 18, 2006",A Must for any London Visitor,"The National Gallery is a must for any visitor to London - art enthusiast or not. The halls of the National Gallery hold some of the finest (and most recognizable) artistic masterpieces. I visited the gallery on a weekday afternoon and did not find it too crowded. To help my untrained eye I rented the audio guide (provided by voluntary contribution) which was easy to use and provides excellent background information on the 30 highlighted paintings and many others. A free full color map was provided that contained images and directions to the highlights. I was able to view works by Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, Monet, Rembrandt and many many more. My personal favorites were The Virgin of the Rocks (Da Vinci) and Sunflowers (Van Gogh). I also visited works by Vermeer who was the subject of a recent film Girl with a Pearl Earring."
"Written April 10, 2004",Priceless Art in a Grand Setting!,"While I agree with the American visitor from Sunnyvale, CA that the National Gallery does contain lots of second-rate art (and a few ""unfinished pieces""), it also has some of the greatest masterpieces of Western art in its vast collections. I made two visits to the Gallery in early April, and both times it was somewhat crowded (mainly school groups from France). Many of the works from the Low Countries, France, Italy and Britain are masterpieces that art lovers will easily recognize. The Rubens were incredible! Don't plan to see it all in one visit - each of the four wings will take appox. 90 minutes to view! The view from the front steps is also priceless!"
"Written December 31, 2013",Pride of Britain,"This public collection contains a breathtaking display of European art covering seven centuries. Entry is free. Look out for Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks, pre-eminent amongst hundred of treasures."
"Written July 19, 2012",Sensory overload!,"There IS such a phenomenon as too much of a good thing.  I didn't really believe that until 1) I was introduced to Strongbow and 2) I visited the National Gallery.  The former gave me a bad head, the latter throbbing piggies.This is easily the most wonderful art museum I have ever been privileged to visit, and I LOVE me some art museums.  (When there is no admission fee, I love them even more.)  My problem  was two-fold:  I cannot decipher museum maps and I didn't MAKE A PLAN.  My interest in Etruscan relics and Cambodian art only goes so far, but I can gaze upon the Impressionists and Old Masters until the cows come home.  After an hour of aimless wandering, I sat down on a bench across from a lovely Vermeer and said to myself, ""Lori12309--what do you want to see?""  That made all the difference, because there is no way in Hades the casual tourist can digest everything in this museum.One thing that really, REALLY twisted my knickers was that visitors were snapping pictures when expressly forbidden to do so.  (I found this to be true all over London.  Flash photography damages paintings.  Full stop.  Knock it off.)I wish I lived in London so I could do a room a day.  This was one of the best cultural experiences I have ever had."
"Written March 5, 2005",Outstanding collection with excellent audio guide information,"Definitely one of the greatest collections of paintings in the world. The audio guides are excellent, there's information for almost every painting. Go early and visit the most popular part  first (1700-1900), thus you can avoid the crowds a bit."
"Written August 13, 2019",Impressive steps,"The National Gallery is an impressive building that occupies one side of Trafalgar Square is looms over the area with its massive steps and if nothing else offers a different vantage point across the square, well worth the climb."
"Written July 13, 2018","Beautiful, world-class collection of paintings","The National Gallery (also known as The National Gallery of Art) is home to over 2,300 beautiful paintings. Beside each painting, there is some info on the artist and the painting. The rooms are large, giving viewers lots of space and angles from which to see the paintings. For audio guide reference, each painting is numbered. Many of the paintings depict religious scenes. In some rooms, there are benches and other types of seating for visitors to relax while viewing or taking a break. Although I like the art collection and rate it as “Excellent,” I prefer the collections of Hermitage Museum (Saint Petersburg, Russia), and Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires, Argentina). It likely isn’t so much the collection of masterpieces, but rather my personal preferences. That said, I’d be happy to go through the National Gallery again. The paintings are beautiful and tell stories. The famous masterpieces, among others, include Sunflowers by Vincent van Gogh; a self-portrait at age 34 by Rembrandt; The Virgin of the Rocks by Leonardo da Vinci; The Madonna of the Pinks (“La Madonna dei Garofani”) by Raphael; Venus and Mars by Sandro Botticelli; The Supper at Emmaus by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio Doge Leonardo Loredan by Giovani Bellini; Seaport with the Embarkation of Saint Ursula by Claude; The Fighting Temeraire by Joseph Mallord W. Turner; Samson and Delilah by Peter Paul Rubena; and more. There is no admission fee."
"Written August 28, 2017",Ruined by a staff member,"We were enjoying our visit and our daughter came across a painting she had learned about at school. She pointed at it while explaining about it to us. Let me point out she was the right side of the rope barrier and no where near the painting when she pointed. A staff member told her off and told her to keep her arm over the rope. She was extremely upset, I was livid! I couldn't see a name badge on him or I would have took it further. Ruined the trip. This obnoxious  rude old man should respect the younger generation not intimidate them."
"Written July 10, 2011","Some good art, free attraction, staff could be more pleasant","I would echo a combination of the previous reviews for the gallery. There is literally a ton of art there and some of it is very good. I particularly liked the Van Gogh. There's no fee to get into the place and you could easily spend several hours here for free. The cafe could have been a little cleaner, and there were some rude members of staff in the place; having a go at children, but overall I would recommend."
"Written October 28, 2017",'Reflections': Total tripe,"Don't get me wrong. I love the National Gallery. And Van Eyck. However, the 'Reflections' exhibition is one of the most spurious curatorial money-grabs i've ever seen. The Guardian certainly got it right. Absolute rubbish. Whoever curated (not to mention approved) this pretentious grab-bag needs to be slapped. A rip-off to cash in one of one the masterpieces of Western art."

"Written January 18, 2015",Paid exhibitions at Sainsbury Wing,"On the whole, the National Gallery is great. However, after paying my second visit to a paid exhibit at the Sainsbury Wing, I feel compelled to mention the experience here.. I first visitied the Sainsbury Wing a few years ago to see Titian. The range of work in one place was a spectacle worth paying for that I am unlikely to see again. However, I was a little overwhelmed by the number of people crammed into the basement levels, considering that the tickets were on sale as timed entry, which would make you believe that safe numbers of people had been calculated. I doubt that very much.I visitied again this weekend, to see Rembrandts Late Works. Again, the paintings on show, together in one place were amazing, and I was also saw some pieces I was less aware of, particularly one of the portraits of an elderly gentleman seated. However, the overcrowding this time was unbearable. People were literally being knocked over. The whole atmosphere was angry and stressful as a result. I think it was much worse here than at the Titian exhibit, since a number of cases were positioned in the centre of the rooms, which aren't big to start off with. If there was something on the other side of the room you wanted to see, it was quite impossible to get there without physically pushing people out of the way. I barely saw any of the smaller sketches.It may be that during the quieter times in the week this is not as much of a problem, although you would think that timed tickets would safely limit the number of people anyway. Had there been a need to evacuate the building this weekend, a number of people would definitely have been hospitalised.I will try again next time, and take time off work early in the day mid-week in the hope that the situation is better. But I would definitely NOT recommend visiting a popular paid exhibit at the Sainbury Wing at the weekend."
"Written January 14, 2015",Membership is a waste of money,The National Gallery is one of the UK's most prized treasures but do not make the mistake of joining as a member. We did and travelled down from Newcastle for the Rembrand exhibition only to find that no priority is given to members. At 9.45am we had to join one queue of over 300 people trying to gain entry for the 10am opening and once inside the members queue was so long they estimated it would take another hour and a half to gain entry. The staff couldn't cope and I was embarrassed to see such an ill organised venue. I felt sorry for the visitors from abroad. We visited the Uffizzi and Prado last month and had no such issues.I love the Gallery but their marketing promises huge member benefits that it simply cannot deliver so membership is of no value whatsoever and is nothing more than a cheap con.
"Written November 20, 2014",Overcrowding at the National Gallery's 'Rembrandt: The Late Works' exhibition,"Breaking a two year resolve never to visit another popular exhibition in a large public gallery again, I was tempted by the Rembrandt to become a member of the Gallery and visit more than once, at times of my choosing. I shouldn't have bitten the apple. Visiting this over marketised, massively hyped exhibition was a mistake. In spite of having booked a ticket for a time slot which I had been advised was less busy, there was queuing to get in  and queuing to view (sometimes even restrictedly) each picture. The art (what we could see of it ) was sublime, the experience in this badly lit (glaring and dull at the same time), depressing basement gallery was dismal. I have visited many major galleries and seen big exhibitions in other European cities, but only in London does one endure this crowded, jostling, catching sight of a painting over a shoulder, out of the corner of one's eye, wholly frustrating and unsatisfactory experience.This is an exhibition where the main thing on display was profit margins."
"Written October 30, 2014",Rembrandt exhibition,"I queued for 20 mins for a timed ticket, queued to get in even though  it was the correct time.  Finally got in and could not see the pictures at all.  Way too crowded too many people let in.  You pay £18 to get in and then unable to see paintings.  Would not recommend going."

I go on every trip and cannot get enough. i love that they keep it all 'fresh' with new items on loan and other special exhibits. It is FREE but they ask for donations in drop box/wells around the museum. They should charge for what you see...just think, you are 3' away from priceless items...some worth tens of millions of dollars...gives me the chills. It is a beautiful thing to take in...enjoy. My favorite, ALL VAN GOGH! "
"Written November 27, 2018",Start with the Sainsbury Wing!,"The National Gallery is simply breathtaking for such an extensive collection of art through the ages. It's always incredible to see all the art come to life on the canvas in front of you that you've only seen in textbooks before. There isn't much more to say about it other than to say ""Just go! You'll love it!"" Be prepared for crowds and people with no spacial awareness with their cell phone cameras. Mobile technology is the worse thing to happen to art probably ever. The Gallery is free, so you will have to deal with a lot of people who don't care about art and don't care about taking any of the paintings in, but who just want photo documentation that they were there. Just breathe, and everything will be fine.My one big tip would be to enter the gallery through the Sainsbury Wing, which is just to the left of the main building as you are looking at it from Trafalgar Square. It's a little less crowded, and you'll be able to go in chronological order if you start there and move through that wing first before making your way to the main building."
"Written October 11, 2018",Enjoyable experience,Visiting from the USA and this was a great visit. The gallery is “free” but they push for donations immediately. It was well worth the donation so not a big deal. The gallery had a lot of nice pieces and the audio tour made it much more enjoyable. Very clean facilities and helpful attendants. 
"Written September 17, 2018",There for a short time but exquisite works,We went to Trafalgar Square and took the opportunity to go to the National Gallery. The few great works we were able to see just gave us an appetite to return when we have more time.

"Written October 15, 2016",Caravaggio - uncomfortably crowded,"The current exhibition seeks to demonstrate the influence that Caravaggio has had on other painters.   It costs £16 to enter and is a rip off, given you can't see most of the pictures properly.  On the morning we went, there were just far too many of us vying for the same small spot of space.  It really spoilt the exhibition for me and is completely avoidable if the Gallery's management chose to limit the number of tickets sold to a more reasonable number.My advice is to see the best paintings when they are back on permanent display in the main Gallery.  At lest then it is free.On the plus side: there is a good, short film, to accompany the exhibition that is well worth seeing.  Do remember also to take a booklet which has the information written beside each picture in large print - so at least you don't have to strain your eyes.One last moan, £1 for a postcard is ridiculous!"
"Written July 26, 2016",It is a must see for art lovers!,"We went there late afternoon to avoid the maddening crowds that usually take over the museums and galleries in the mornings.  We took free 1 hour tour with a National Gallery guide that was super informative but only scratched the surface of what this fabulous collection of art has to offer, therefore, we rented audio guides that took us trough centuries of the best paintings and stories behind them. You can marvel and be mesmerized looking at work of geniuses such as  Michael Angelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Goya, Turner, Monet, Van Gogh, Pissaro, Seurat and many many more.  Go there, you won't be dissapointed!"
"Written July 22, 2019",Impresses the fans of art,"Central London's main landmark is the Trafalgar Square National Museum, which immediately impresses the fans of art. Renowned works such as Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, Velázquez's Rokeby Venus, Turner's Fighting Temeraire and the Sunflowers of Van Gogh are now home to it. Works are organized in almost chronological order in the gallery. This landmark is linked by bus and underground in London, along with free entry.NIce to visit it."
"Written April 11, 2019",Incredible! ,"It was my first time in this museum and I think that is the only one which show paintings of Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Tiziano, Raffaello, Cezanne, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Monet and Manet all together! Incredible!"

"Written June 28, 2012",Afternoon Tea at the National Gallery,"We headed to the Trafalgar Square area intending to head elsewhere for afternoon tea, but heavy rain sent us inside to the National Gallery instead.  We knew that their cafe served tea, but didn't expect much.  We were pleasantly surprised to find they had an over the top tea.  You don't get the typical afternoon tea atmosphere, but what you do get far makes up for that.  We were traveling with two young children and we opted for 4 full afternoon teas. After our waiter asked ""The full lot, for all of you?"" we weren't sure what to expect.  Well, when they set down four 3 tiered trays in front of us, we understood.  We each had 4 tea sandwiches, a scone with cream and jam, and 3 delicious desserts.  The kids could hardly make it through half of theirs.  I would recommend getting young ones a cream tea, and sharing sandwiches from one or two full teas(depending on the number in your party)  It was a real treat though, and a lot less expensive than all the other tea houses we looked into.  All that, and you are in the National Gallery, which, in and of itself, is not to be missed.  The building and entry themselves are stunning, as is the view from the front steps.  Once inside, you will not be disappointed by the collection.  We had to move quickly, as I said, traveling with small children.  But what we were able to see was beautiful.  I look forward to returning with more time."
"Written March 13, 2009","""Teach Adult's about Art""","Because it is Great - and because it is FREE, I tend to visit the National Gallery a lot. Even half an hour or so here & there can be worthwhile, but that is not the point of this review.Some while ago, I was looking for things for kids to do, and came across the ""Teach your Adults about Art"" self-guided tour on the NG website, so recently I tested this out with my No. 1 Niece (now 10yr old).You 'borrow' an audioguide from the desk, for a 'donation' of 3.50GBP, you get a map, and off you go.We did not get around all of the pictures suggested, but both enjoyed ourselves looking at the ones we did see in good detail.  My niece made a handy discovery, which was that, as well as the kids commentary, the audioguide apparatus she was given contained the 'standard' commentaries too - so we keyed in the numbers for a few different pieces, and shared the comments from the kids and adults 'notes', we learned lots!  Because of the added 'extra' commentaries, we got a bit more insight into some of the pictures that we just 'liked' as well as those inculded in the kids tour.After about 1.5 hours though, she had had enough, but returning the audioguide to the desk, we were presented with 4 different 'activity' booklets for her, which I am sure she will make good use of.I thought this was a good way to spend some time, overall, and so did No. 1.  IF you are flexible, and don't expect to get around all of the tour, then it is a cheap, fun way to educate your kids a bit - and to let THEM educate you - it REALLY works!!"
"Written December 26, 2005",Best Museum in London,"This museum is the best museum I've ever been to, except for the Louvre. The architecture is beautiful, and the artworks are fantanstic. There's no entrance fee...Just donations. The museum is not too small, but not too big, so you can see it all in a couple of hours. And trust me, you will want to see it all because it is spectacular! Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Renoir, Monet...You name it, they've got it beautifully displayed. They also have a cafeteria downstairs, which offers a great selection of snacks. I ordered a selection of cheeses with a squash soup that was the best meal I had in all of London...And super affordable. If you like museums, this is the place for you. And, if you don't like them, once you enter the National Gallery, you will fall in love."
"Written April 5, 2006",Absolutely worth the time and money!,"Excellent collections, superbly arranged, easy to navigate, good opening times, reasonable entry cost (donation suggested) and the best restaurant ever.The restaurant is a must if you, like me, have always had trouble finding a decent meal in London without mortgaging the house. If you get a chance, order the afternoon tea, the scones are the most wonderful I've ever eaten anywhere in England. Don't miss this when you're in London."
"Written August 31, 2004",Don't try to do it all at once!,"The National Gallery is fantastic, but if you just walk round you'll be overwhelmed. Before you come, think of an artist or a period you like and use the gallery's website to see what pictures of that artist they have, or what artists represent your favourite period. Then, when you come, you can do that thoroughly.  I go for the Antonello paintings - only 4, all small and easily missed if you just stroll round - but if you look for them, they are stunning, and it must be the same for every artist's work.By the way, down in the bookshop you can get immediate prints-to-order of anything, yes anything in the collection.  Wednesday it's - as I write (Aug.2004) open til 9pm. Oh, and the coffee is fine."
"Written March 27, 2004",Audio Tours are Great,"We visited the National Gallery in March 2004 and greatly enjoyed the experience. By all means, obtain one of the audio tour guides. They are free, but a donation is requested. I gave 10 pounds for four of us and was treated like a visiting tycoon, so you can probably get away with less. Virtually every picture is assigned a number, which you enter into the audio device to hear a minute or two of commentary. It allows you to create your own tour, choosing the works you like. Better than a guided tour, in that you can take in more pictures and you are not part of a large group straining to hear the tour guide and to see the picture. Comically, I found only one picture without commentary. It was an old and quite graphic depiction of Zeus, in the form of a swan, consorting with Leda. I suppose they couldn't think of any thing to say about that one. By the way, entry to the museum is free."
"Written August 3, 2019",Great museum,The National Gallery is a must visit in London. It has some of the most famous and incredible works of art that have ever been created. It’s centrally located and easy to get to. It’s free admission unless you’d like to donate.

Spent the morning here by myself while I waited for Oliver in the afternoon.Morning well spent.This gallery is a must for all culture vultures out there!!!The gallery is laid out well, has some really well-known pieces and is really easy to get to!Best of all...it's free! (Although I always give donations!)The cafe served lovely food, I had a coffee and a lovely lemon tart (yum!) and the shop was brilliant! 60p postcards of paintings made for great souvenirs and the shop caters well for all ages.I recommend going the wrong way round the gallery to avoid school groups which can be pretty nightmarish when they are large groups!!!Definitely my fave London gallery...though I am biased cause I have a particular love of Wright's Experiment with a Bird in an Air Pump!!!A must see!!!"
"Written February 3, 2009",Really Excellent Collection,"We were disappointed to find many of the National Gallery's key pieces were on loan. We quickly realized the collection is not dependent on its star pieces. This collection is really fantastic.It is free, in a fantastic location and not to be missed!"
"Written May 26, 2007",Magestic,"Hard to believe that in 1941, the museum pieces were moved to the  Manod Quarry, a slate mine in the mountains above the village of Ffestiniog, to protect the collection from the Germans.  A great effort that was well worth it.  Housed in a magestic buiding in front of Trafalgar Square, The National Gallery of London hose an exceptional collection of western paintings. Visit to the permanent collection is free,  but you may get charge for special exhibitions. No pictures or video are allowed (but you may sketch if you want).  Inside, masterpieces like Monet's Water lily pond, Van Gogh's Sunflowers, Rembrandt's portraits, and the spectacular Da Vinci's 'Virgin of the Rocks'  and Raphael's 'Madonna of the Pinks' to name few of the masterpieces in the museum.  The Van Gogh room is out of this world and may bring tears to your eyes."

"Written October 21, 2021",Deflating experience,"Lovely staff but not possible to see their mouths. It feels sad. And ironic, when looking at art where the poor workers are subjugated by the powerful."
"Written November 23, 2020",Very good museum,"These are English colleagues who made me visit this site, it was remarkable, very well organized and respect for health barriers"
"Written November 5, 2020",Superb gallery let down by cafe,"We visited the Friday before lockdown #2. The process for getting free entry tickets online the day before was easy. On arrival we had a very short queue before gaining entry to the gallery. We chose gallery route B, which took us through some amazing rooms (a few too many religious ones for my personal liking) but we saw some fantastic artworks. I was skeptical about the route system in advance because as a frequent visitor to the gallery (pre-COVID-19) I knew what I liked (the spectacular room 34 and then rooms 41-44) and stuck to those few rooms. This route forced us to go through rooms I never previously visited and I was surprised how good some of them were - Peter Paul Rubens in particular, who I had previously avoided due to my dislike of overly religious artworks. So thanks National Gallery for broadening my exposure on this trip. As a member of the Tate I'm well used to the members lounge experience, which hasn't been affected negatively by COVID-19. I was disappointed at the National Gallery to see that the espresso cafe was closed and was hugely disappointed with the once-glorious cafe. Cellophane wrapped pastries and coffee in cardboard cups. If the Tate can still manage full service, then surely you can do better than that?"

"Written September 19, 2008",Go on a Wednesday evening,Really nice museum and the best part- it´s free ( because London is sooo expensive ). We went on a Wednesday because normally they close at 6 but on this day they close at nine. There are less people and you can see the square at night. Well worth the time- just wander around or check out your favourite painters. My personal favourite: Renoir´s Umbrellas.
"Written August 20, 2008",Picture Perfect,"The National Gallery in Trafalgar Square is the high point of any visit to London.  If art interests you and you want to see major masterpieces then this gallery is perfect for you.  Unlike other national collections this one is in a purpose built building of many rooms that allows you to study the pictures and not become overwhelmed by the volume on display or the architecture.  The highlights include the Da Vinci's.  The cartoon is astonishing and worthy of 20 minutes observation.  Check out the Titians and Giorgione as well as both Michelangelo attributions.  Enjoy the collection of Gainsboroughs including his portraits of his daughters.  One special feature of the gallery is that if you ask a guard for the location of a work they will talk to you about it, show an interest and make conversation with you.  Thats really rare and the sign of people proud of where they work.  Well done Trafalgar Square on a superb collection and a laudable staff."
"Written May 3, 2008",Add This Museum To Your Must See List,"We went to the National Gallery 03/13/08 and enjoyed every minute of our visit.  The Vanity Fair Portraits Exhibition, 1913-2008 was currently going on.  It goes from 13 Feb-25 May, 2008 and it is worth seeing.  There were great photographs of rock stars, movie stars, royalty, well-known people, that was very interesting.  The other portraits were great too.  We saw oil paintings of the royals, Christopher Wren, George Washington and others that were fascinating.  The website for the gallery is www.npg.org.uk for more information. The tube stop is Leicester Square.I would plan on spending an entire afternoon, possibly day at thegallery.  They have a check -in room for your belongings that looks very well attended and safe to use. We spent part of an afternoon and evening there.  They are opened till 8-9pm on some nights.Don't skip over this museum."
"Written October 25, 2006","Breathtaking, and all for free!","Went to the National Gallery for a couple of hours on a Sunday morning, before heading back to the airport, and what a wonderful way to spend those hours! The staff were well-informed and very friendly, and we found the displays beautifully laid out and with lots of room for everyone. The building itself is a delight and so light and airy. What I found absolutely amazing is how close you can actually get to all of the works - it really does take your breath away when you are within a arms length of a masterpiece - and there is something for everyone here.There was a great cafe downstairs, with a mouthwatering array of cakes, along with a large bank of computers, where you could sit with your coffee and peruse the digitally-stored collection of artworks. Kids would enjoy this bit particularly, as it was fun but educational at the same time.There was also a really good shop, with not the usual tourist tat, but some really beautiful art books, as well as postcards, interesting things for kids (kits, books, toys, etc), and copies of the pictures.Altogether it wasn't at all stuffy or formal as I had thought it would be, and it was a really nice way to spend a few hours."
"Written March 1, 2020","Beautiful museum, huge collection of works","This museum is itself a beautiful building - and the galleries inside provide a nice home, albeit crowded with visitors, for the artworks housed inside.The collections are expansive, which gives one many options. There are many major works one can choose to seek out, or one can just wander and see what catches your eye. Although I did have a map, I did find the navigation a bit confusing at times - so don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. Worth a visit - just manage your expectations when it's busy - it can be hard to get space to enjoy the art work sometimes. "
"Written January 26, 2020",Gauguin,again a lovely exhibition at the National Gallerybooking in advance is recommended but they do have a ticket office for walk-ins - dependent on availability and time slotsthe exhibition has a cost but the rest of the museum is free - the museum encourages donations from visitors
"Written December 21, 2019",Da Vinci exhibition.,"National gallery is truly a national treasure. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to all.  However, the current da Vinci exhibition does not live up to its marketing blurb. With 4 small rooms displaying metaphorical references or so-called scientific investigations of one (albeit hugely important) painting it negates the value of da Vinci's work rather than promote it.  I wouldn't mind paying £40 fir 2 of us to enter the gallery - so why not do that instead of mis-selling an exhibiton?"
"Written October 24, 2019","It is too much to take in at one go, so go many times!","If you love European art, this is truly one of the best places in the world to see it.  It can be overwhelming, so I would suggest taking in a room or two at a time.  I return to see my favourite artists, and ever get tired of visiting the Rembrandt room, where it is possible to enjoy two of his self-portraits, one done when he was in his thirties, and one done in old age, that hang almost opposite each other."
"Written September 12, 2019",Easily Navigable in 2 Hours,We really enjoyed the pace and flow of the galleries here. The art is a great overview of the master of the art world. We really recommend that you scope out what you want to see and focus on that otherwise you could spend hours here. 
"Written May 15, 2019",Excellent Gallery,Great location and great art. Try to visit early to avoid the crowds. It is free too as are all major museums in London. 
"Written March 26, 2015",Cheated by the crowds,"A staggeringly special exhibition of worldwide collections of impressionist art ruined by the crowds of people. Timed entry just not controlled properly. Just impossible to see the paintings - Supervisor apologised and excused himself by saying that too many people were staying on once inside. Not interested in solutions we proposed. Despite admitting that this was unacceptable, not a hint of a refund. My advice is DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY until the Gallery sorts this problem out! Why should a gallery be excused from complying with laws on getting what you pay for."
"Written June 27, 2011",Paintings that make you happy you are a human,"If you have any doubts, should you do this in London, or that, visit  this museum or some other, here is an easy thing that will help you make up your mind:come inside the first room with the paintings of the National Gallery in London and something will happen- to most people this is what happens- they stay in that room, and then go to the next one, and then to the next one, and then...London is a great town, a huge and non-stop living-bursting place, and you can shop, you can have fun, you can take photos, or lie in the park, but i encourage you to take some time for yourself, for your brain, and take your eyes on a stroll in the National Gallery on Trafalgar square.A huge building with columns make a great photo, doesn't it, but believe me, the most precious part is inside. You will see the art of all the famous artist that you can remember (if they lived between year 1500 and year 1900). Italian, Flemish, Spanish, all the great artists from most famous periods are there: Michelangelo, El Greco, Rubens, Van Dyck, Van Gogh, van this and van that, really all the names you can remember are there!!!And the best thing about this museum with no fee (but you are encouraged to give donation if you want, a few pennies or a pound won't hurt you!) is the moment when you come into a room and come across a group of children sitting on the floor next to a famous painting and a museum official guide talks to them like wit adults, makes them use their brains, discuss, argument their thoughts, think and talk about art- then you realize that art is nothing serious, nothing to be afraid of, it is there for a child age 5 and for a granny age 105, you just have to open the door to let it inside yourself.A great way to raise children, to make them feel special, open their mind and make them appreciate art and visit museums one day with their own children."
"Written June 3, 2011",Beautiful collection - Rude and unfriendly staff,"The collection is immense and stunning, and the building beautiful. The only problem is their staff: the most unpleasant, rude and unfriendly I have ever encountered in a British major attraction. I saw them yelling, one of them even shouted, at kids who did nothing more than dare to step close (not even touching)  to the ropes in front of the paintings, just like all the adults did. I also saw them screaming at people who had a camera in their hand at the entrance, before they had a chance to read the signs and knowing they must be put away. What happened to being polite? And why are they all so tense and on the edge?"
"Written April 24, 2009",Yes but...,"As wonderful as The National Gallery is, I have to comment about the constant closure of some rooms ( in some cases several at the same time ), phenomenon that it has become a regular feature in my last few visits to the gallery. This leaves you with a rather frustrating feel, specially when these areas affected hold some of your favourite paintings in the gallery!"
"Written August 23, 2008",Take the time,"Located in the very heart of central London, this is one landmark that should not simply reside on your “rainy day” list. My favorite museum in the world, the National Gallery is easy to find, completely free and easy to navigate for those who wish to spend an hour touring the highlights or the more dedicated who wish to spend the day. In addition to Buckingham Palace or the Tower of London, you can add to the marvels you see in this city by viewing works by the world’s greatest artists:  Michelangelo, da Vinci, Monet, van Gogh, Caravaggio, Rubens, Renoir, Cézanne and Rembrandt. Even if you are not typically a museum person, you owe it to yourself to spend some time within these walls. It is an amazing experience.If you go, the Café in the Crypt is a wonderful place for lunch. Located directly across the street, you’ll find it in the basement of St Martin in the Fields church."

"Written January 6, 2020",Leonardo Exhibition - A complete rip off,This was a complete rip off to charge 18£ in the name of Leonardo to go and see one painting and nothing else except 3 other rooms of crap. The things they sell in the name of art - Very very disappointed with the National Gallery.
"Written December 1, 2019",Drown in the Immersive Leonardo Exhibition at The National Gallery,"I was so looking forward to this. Got a ticket as soon as I could. It promised fascinating insights into The Virgin of the Rocks. Astounding new discoveries were to be explored in a fresh and exciting Exhibition.Well .......... firstly, make sure you’ve visited the toilet before entering the first room. The sound of trickling water greets you as you stand bemused at two panoramic views obscured by 1970’s style shelving units. They are cleverly designed in metal so that they reflect Da Vinci’s own mirror writing. But only if you stand with your head tilted at a tricky angle. Authentic teak with stick-on mirrors might have done a better job.You can get behind the units to see the panoramas. But there’s only so much running water music that you can stand.So progress into an open space off which runs 3 rooms. A Gallery guide helpfully tells you which room to go in first. This is a mock-up of the investigative laboratory. A floor to ceiling screen plays on a loop explaining the process and the results. Meanwhile the light on each of the stations around the walls of the room lights up the display when mentioned. It’s as if the conservators and scientists have just stepped out for a cup of tea. Unfortunately you can’t access these stations and if you do manage to sidle up to one, it consists of a still life of the conservationists arts. Without any explanation or labelling. The screen loops on and dreary renaissance music turgidly underlines the utter lack of connection between the painting and the present. Apart from one startling image as The National Gallery gives you a painting by numbers Virgin on the RocksTottering our of this room, you are confronted with a dark space with an arcade game of changing the light on objects to be immersed in Da Vinci’s work on perspective. You can also change the lighting on a mock-up of The Virgin on the Rocks. Bizarrely Da Vinci’s Virgin has been removed and one by Vladimir Tretchikoff imitating Jack Vettriano put in its place. This presumably is to make messing about with perspective all the more relevant. It’s like a therapy exercise.The final room beckons. More intense renaissance dirges endlessly on. A big transparent curtain with golden lettering greets you. The church for which the painting was originally  commissioned is sketched out on the floor. The final, piece de la resistance is the golden frame illuminated through the curtain which invites you into an annexe. (Well, that’s the theory. In practice visitors just walked around the curtain and stood in front of the illuminated frame thus obscuring the magical moment.)In the annexe - hushed, dark and reverential - is the actual painting. More solemn music - I know that there exists uplifting and passionate music from this time, so why not use it? It is surrounded by a video installation which, again on a loop, builds up an impression of the altar piece in which the painting sat. Cleverly this is projected in such a way as to defy you from concentrating upon the stupendous beauty of the Da Vinci and force you to rotate your eyes rapidly around the constantly changing panels. Forcing yourself to resist these soft focussed images , you then notice that wherever you stand there is a light shining onto the painting from the projector.The whole immersion takes about 25 minutes. In order to get my money’s worth I went around a few times to try and make some sense of the whole “experience”.I suppose they could have had some poor, jobbing actors dressed up in character telling us about the painting. Maybe a hologram of Da Vinci at work? So it could have been worse..............But not much worse. It’s patronising, gimmicky, unscholarly, ill-conceived, mid-conceived, and an utter waste of everyone’s time."

I booked on-line for the Goya Portraits and was interrupted partway through. Somewhere during the transaction, my eyesight, the Internet connection, their website, who knows, my booking went forward a week. I telephoned on the morning of the next working day in anticipation of a straightforward correction. Oh no! There are “terms and conditions” and bookings cannot be changed. I pointed out that there was no problem with availability. No: “terms and conditions”. I live in West Wales and can’t go next week,. No: “terms and conditions”. It is a simple electronic transaction. No: “terms and conditions”. Any attempt at a sensible discussion met the same response: “terms and conditions”. The National Gallery Shop, which sells the tickets, has a mission statement “To make money for the gallery”. Not if it drives away customers it won’t.Emails have not been acknowledged, still less replied to.By the way the ticket price includes a donation with gift-aid. I shall be writing to insist that this donation is returned. You see, I too have my terms and conditions. I expect a reasonable standard of service."
"Written September 10, 2015","Great, but don't try and see it all in one visit (or two, or three)","I enjoy the National Gallery, though I tend to do one gallery or type of artist at a time e.g Pre-Raphaelites, or Turner etc. I tend to glaze over after too many paintings at a time. Also I like to be able to read about the paintings I am looking at, and know something of the artist(s) and his or her story as well.Definitely one to go to, but don't try and cover it all in one go.Nice restaurant too btw."
"Written April 27, 2015",A good impression of the impressionists,"The exhibition was great, however given the number of exhibits on show I feel the gallery should have used a larger space so visitors could have a better view rather than being jostled about. The audio guide is a useful addition to the tour but only gives a commentary on about 20% of the exhibits."
"Written March 19, 2015",Bad overcrowding in the Sainsbury Wing.,"Travelled 200 miles to look forward to enjoying the very well reviewed Inventing Impressionism exhibition. We had booked a noon slot and would assume that the Gallery would control the numbers allowed in. Not a bit of it!  Each room was grossly overpacked with very fed up people, all disappointed with the chaos. I could see the amazing paintings on show but my wife was too short to see over the crowds. I asked an attendant if it was always so bad and he suggested we hang around for an hour till it calmed down at lunchtime. Why can't the NG get its act together? A complete waste of time and £32."
"Written June 25, 2014",Sadly disappointing Making Colour exhibition,"Yes it was excellent to see some of the National Gallery collection as examples of the use of different colours, but the exhibition felt incomplete to us.Explanations seemed truncated - why explain that a certain colour is a dye not a pigment, without explaining the difference?Why no timelines showing the growing availability of dyes [pigments?] over time?Why so much to read, when a few more illustrations could have made it so much clearer, and interesting?Why were all the exhibits on black walls, instead of the colour being described? Sorry, but it felt hard work, and while I learned a few facts, I didn't feel that I learned any principles to help me view and understand paintings more than I did before."
"Written September 7, 2012",Got to take the audio tour,Pay £3 for the audio tour and you will be amazed by how much you learn. Choose a day when it is quieter - like Mon to Thurs. These paintings are priceless and most of them were donated by individuals to the nation for all of us to enjoy. So pls make this trip.

The first visit was to see an exhibit on Renoir's ""Landscapes"" and the second was to see the main collection, specifically the three VerMeer paintings that are on permanent display.As many reviewers have pointed out, admission to the main collection is free and an audio guide is available for a small fee.  If the Renoir exhibit is any example, this museum does a fantastic job of putting these on with a very helpful staff.This is one of the world's premier art museums and should be on any ""three day"" itinerary of London regardless of your interests."
"Written October 2, 2008",Fantastic art museum,"I really enjoyed this art museum as there are so many different works of art from a wide variety of time periods to suit everyone's taste. Many of the works displayed are simply breathtaking and I especially enjoyed the landscapes and portraits. One interesting feature that makes this museum stand out is that they also display unfinished works as well. There really is no excuse to miss the museum as it is free and conveniently located by other landmarks, such as Trafulgar Square. It would be easy to spend a day here, but if you don't have a lot of time, it doesn't hurt to pop in and see a few Picassos before moving on to something else. The gift shop is definitely worth a peek as they have a nice selection of merchandise."
"Written October 20, 2019",Fantastic!,"It would be easier for you to simply Google the amazing things you will see here!  It is stunning. Give yourself plenty of time to explore. While you're there, people watching in Trafalgar Square is a fun time as well."
"Written October 20, 2019","If you love ART, you will adore the National Portrait Gallery",Simply amazing collections beautifully displayed. Room after Room filled with the Masters. We were there for most of a day...wish we could have been there for a month or more. THIS IS FANTASTIC
"Written October 20, 2019",Wonderful Gallery,We stopped into the National Gallery on a cold rainy day in London. What a lovely place! admission is free (donations are accepted). There are so many famous pieces on display here... it definitely is a must see when you come to London.
"Written October 20, 2019",A fantastic collection of art,A must visit for all art lovers. I just spent an hour with the impressionists at the National. The collection is superb including a good representation by Van Gogh one of my favorites. The building is extremely impressive with a good food facility.
"Written October 1, 2019",Great museum with loads to see,"The trick to this museum is to catch the free tour.  This will get you so much information in the exhibits and the museum. Along with that,  the museum offers so much to see.  If you're in one area that doesn't appeal to you just walk a step or two and you'll be looking at something that will. The layout is easy to get around and it's free!!!Delicately a great museum"
"Written September 30, 2019",History of arts and paintings across the centuries,"Strange enough that I had been a Londoner for over a decade but never found time to visit the gallery, only visualised the rooms in a DVD in my university's website, so this time I just popped in on my first day back to London for a short visit. It was as expected, so many paintings, from Constable, from Turner, most interestingly, a room full of impressionist paintings from the French painters of the Salon era. And of course, people were overwhelmingly excited seeing that 'Sunflower' of Van Gogh. But I loved Impressionism and Pointillism and spent quite a while in that room housed these two types. It's true that you need at least 3 to 4 hours to thoroughly visit the gallery, as there are so many rooms that you would miss something if you are in a hurry, but one member of our group had to leave for lunch so we stayed roughly about only an hour. I would definitely visit again next time I am back in London. I have taken quite a few photos of the paintings I liked and knew about, but refrain from posting them here cause I believe not one painting from the gallery has not been uploaded here."
"Written September 29, 2019",Gallery spectacular,"Put simply the National Gallery of London is huge. Allowing yourself plenty of time to take in the remarkable art work that is in every room on every floor. For all you travellers this visit allows you to relax in the quiet inside and enjoy time to reflect. With Free entry enjoy your step back to a time when the great masters worked their magic, remembering no trip to London would be as rewarding without a visit."

"Written September 23, 2019",Fantastic,"The collection is absolutelly amazing. The visit is free and you can spend three to four hours here easilly - if you are interested in arts. Van Gogh and Leonardo Da Vinci are here, so there is nothing more to say. Incredible "
"Written September 17, 2019",Wonderful,"Highly suggested for the beauties you can see inside. The admission is free. I suggest at least half a day to visit the most important pieces, one day to visit all the gallery. If you go to London, you must visit the National Gallery."
"Written September 12, 2020",Glorious  gallery ,to look in this is a treat marvel at glorious  paintings etc and go to its smart cafe if its open its dear but the place is free
"Written September 12, 2020","Amazing art, poor signage","The art is phenomenal. Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Monet, Renoir, Vermeer, Maes, Van Dyke, Van Gogh... Stunning!The one way system is supposed to offer Routes A, B and C, but there’s actually just a load of white arrows on the floor with no clue which route they refer to. And apparently route B takes 35 minutes but route C takes 25 minutes, but you see ‘everything’ on route C but not route B? One man went the wrong way and got shouted at by a Gallery guard - I thought it was going to get violent! 😳Oh, and on the way in the bag search guy clearly couldn’t be arsed to search my rucksack - just waved me through without even looking at me. Amazing art, rubbish customer care.(Would still go again though. Because art. 🥰)"
"Written August 29, 2020",I'd forgotten all the wonderful art here - it's free but museums are struggling so try & donate a little when booking,"One good thing to come out of the weird pandemic situation that we are all living in is that I have been looking for things to to do to replace things that I would normally do but can't.  I haven't been to the National Gallery in years but finding it is open on Friday nights to 9 pm - how great is that for us workers - I went for a couple of hours and I loved it.  It is a beautiful building, has the most amazing art that even people who don't know much about art might know a lot of and it was calm and relaxed and so nice.  I actually didn't have time to do all that I wanted so will be back to see the Artemisia exhibition in October - Renaissance girl power beating the odds so well worth a look! - and will do the amazing other stuff I didn't get to then"

"Written March 3, 2020",Lots to see,"Admission is free, but donations appreciated. Go in the morning. Have lunch in Chinatown spend another hour in the afternoon "
"Written February 27, 2020",Art for everyone!,The art in this architecturally exquisite building is grouped by era so you can spend the whole day wandering through the galleries or just skip to the era or artist you’re interested in. The museum houses some famous art such as Van Gogh’s Sunflowers and Monet’s Water-Lily Pond but it also has other beautiful paintings such as Van Gogh’s ‘Long Grass with Butterflies’ and Gauguin’s Faa Iheihe.
"Written February 17, 2020",National Gallery London is a visual treat for art lovers (and it’s free),The National Gallery is one of the best places to visit in London for art lovers and it doesn’t cost anything to enjoy the visual delights.It’s very crowded over the weekend and whenever it’s raining which is now unknown in London throughout the year :)A fabulous free treat in the heart of London that’s definitely worth adding to your list of best things to do in London.
"Written December 28, 2019",Leonardo exhibition,Very expensive. £20 each to see 1 painting. Better to save your money and go to Italy. Much better value.
"Written December 21, 2019",Great place to wander,"Great example of what London can offer to the casual tourist.Pop in and browse iconic masterpieces in a fabulous historic   building. Free entry to general areas - particularly enjoyed the Monets, Turners and Pisarros."
"Written December 20, 2019",awe inspiring collection,"Plan on spending an entire morning or afternoon here. get the audio guide, and go on a magnificent tour of some of the most beautiful art in the world. admission is free, but a donation is requested. highlights of the museum are van gogh’s sunflowers, seurat’s bathers, painting by renoir, and the list goes on. the audio guide is the most extensive and detailed i’ve ever had the pleasure of using. we visited in december, so the crowds were small. there’s a coat check, but you may want to keep your coat, as i found the rooms to be quite chilly. when you’ve finished your tour drop off your audio guide and visit the gift shop. there are 3 in the building, and all beautiful! there are also cafes on the premises. we, however, went straight to a nice quiet bar for a drink and an opportunity to discuss all the beautiful things we’d seen."
"Written December 18, 2019",A must see for anyone visiting London,"The National Gallery is like the low-key Louvre of the UK. It's a wonderful building located in central London and holds some of the finest artwork in the world. From Caravaggio to Van Gogh to Goya, all of it is here. Free entry is the cherry on top. Now that I live here, I am in the National Gallery all the time trying to absorb these classic works of art. Definitely recommend!"
"Written December 14, 2019",The Paul Gauguin exhibition is stupendous!,"If you admire French impressionists painters you should not miss the Gauguin exhibition!!Lots of portraits, but not only.Absolutely recommended!!"
"Written December 9, 2019",Great mix of old and modern,Great architecture - modern has been stylishly integrated into the overall classic presentation. Amazing collection of paintings
"Written December 5, 2019",Always a Delight for Lovers of Fine Art,"A lover of fine arts who visits London never leaves without making an obligatory pilgrimage to the National Gallery.  One traverses Trafalgar Square with the keen anticipation of once again seeing ‘old friends’ – steadfast and almost always with new revelations to experience.  Most important, unlike the Louvre (where it seems most of the visitors are bent on seeing only the Mona Lisa), at this Gallery one does not ‘jostle’ with mindless tourists and one has the space to really study and appreciate the art on the walls.For us, it was marvellous to again gaze at Hans Holbein’s remarkable painting of Christina of Denmark (a bridal candidate for the widowed Henry VIII) who had reportedly posed for a mere 3 hours for this portrait.  Note her thrillingly expressive hands in front of her stiff mourning gown trimmed with fur.  Note her intelligent face. One wonders how English history might have been if she had become Henry’s wife. (Perhaps Thomas Cromwell would not have lost his head...)Here is Bronzino’s fantastic Allegory with its rosily nude Venus and dimpled Cupid flanked by various figures, either very young and joyful or very old and angry looking.Here is Van Eyck’s painting of a married couple named Arnolfini, the wife heavily pregnant who looks lovingly at her husband, but who is turned away from her and is seemingly blind; one ponders on the small dog and clumsily arranged slippers in the foreground and the mirror in the background.And one is again rather disappointed that Turner’s Fighting Temeraire is not painted on a huge canvas!  But to see first-hand this master’s use of light and colour is an unforgettable experience. Note: a few galleries were being renovated during our visit and this was not noted in the otherwise very useful map, so one had to ask a guard and go through several corridors to see Vermeer’s intimate paintings."
"Written November 30, 2019","Brilliant Gallery, Shame about the Leonardo Exhibition","We visited for the Leonardo Exhibition, as fans of the artist and the Italian Renaissance period.  However we were disappointed by the exhibition itself.  We just didn't get the first room, full of metal boxes with quotes from Leonardo (written backwards of course!).    The sound of the gushing water simply made it like being in a toilet - it didn't add anything to the atmosphere.  The mock up of the studio didn't really tell me about the painting and as it was modern (so its a mock up of the restoration studio) it didn't add anything.  Basically you could have been in Ikea - the kitchen cupboards on the walls looked like a kitchen mock up!  the room about light and shade was clever (3 boxes of items with various lights that you can adjust to see the effect of the changing impacts of shadow) but it didn't tell me how Leonardo worked.  The fourth room of trying to imagine where the painting was original for was a waste of space.  The final room, the actual picture itself was the absolute star.  The painting is shown on a mock up of an altar, as the central panel of an altar piece - i.e what it was painted for.  The surround is plain, so they are able to project various scenes onto the surround to indicate what it could look like.  This part of the exhibition was really well staged.. we spent more time in this room than any of the others.  There is no seating though.  The church music of the time really added to the ethereal atmosphere.  They missed a trick in that room for me... church pews to sit on would have made the position better - the painting was designed to be higher than the congregation and it was a bit low.  Overall we only spent just over an hour in the exhibition.  the rest of the day was spent in the marvellous FREE parts of the gallery, especially the really early works.  the Wilton Diptych is unmissable. So, I'd save your money and spend it on the audio tour and bimble around the rest of the gallery!"
"Written November 25, 2019",A gem for free!,"Great paint collection. All second floor is dedicated to free exhibition, while first floor is dedicated to temporary Art and you have to pay the entrance. Not to miss"
"Written November 20, 2019","Amazing, but super crowded.","Range of work is absolutely world class, however do whatever you can to avoid crowds. The Impressionism collection is tops, but you'll find many superb examples in many genres/periods."
"Written November 10, 2019",Leonardo Exhibition,"While the visual displays are quite clever and interesting, there’s only the one painting in the exhibition. It’s very padded out and a bit thin. I went away feeling I must have missed a few rooms where the rest of the art might have been."
"Written September 9, 2019",Bermejo paintings .,Bermejo paintings were on display. I really like Old Master paintings. He is the best from Spain. His painting of Archangel Michael defeating the devil was on display.
"Written September 9, 2019",Amazing museum,"Great location right by Trifalgar Square.  Wonderful impressionist art, among many other types of art.  There was a special Impressionist exhibit (for an extra fee) when I was there with all the best artists displayed in one area.

It a giant gallery so you need a few days to see all the painting but it’s wonderful:) "
"Written August 20, 2019","The National gallery, the home of fine art !!!","When ever we’re in the west end of London we always pop in to the gallery. Most of the gallery is free entry, there’s the odd exhibition that has a charge, but it’s down to personal choice if you want to pay to see it. All the best known painters in the world, have a painting in the gallery. So if your around Trafalgar Square, then you should pop into the gallery & check out the amazing collection of fine art paintings, the collection is eye watering."

What an outstanding collection. We went with our children 12 & 13 I have to say they were bored spent  most of the time sitting the the big settees asking if we were done yet that aside we enjoyed it all immensely.

"Written October 31, 2019",Spectacular paintings,"I was at the place yesterday, there were a lot of people. But the art was abnormally amazing with many different artists and styles. This is a must if you have the roads past London.  It was free for everyone, which allows you to go in and take a quick look if you don't have that much time.  Good informative staff, but the guards looked angry and dazzled at one."

"Written April 17, 2018","Spectacular, well-organized collection","The National Gallery has an amazing art collection that includes many, many famous works and unknown items that should be seen.  My favorite part of this museum was the thorough audio guide that helps offer so much more detail and information. Unless you are an art expert this is a total necessity as the plaques next to the art can only tell you so much.  Curators on the guide offer context and detail- and allow you to self-pace.  The museum is also very well-organized- it is relatively easy to find your way around.My only criticism is that the audio guide did not offer any detail about the architecture or the history of the museum, how the rooms were used throughout history, etc.  Given London's past- this would be fascinating historical detail for those of us interested in more than art."

"Written November 3, 2017",The National Gallery of the world,"I have been visiting the National Gallery in London for more than fifty years. In that time, the National Gallery has changed a lot, and all for the better. The front of the National Gallery has been pedestrianised (controversially); and tacky performance and pavement arists now occupy the forecourt during the daylight hours at least. This may or may not be of interest to you, but there are photo-opportunities. Undeniably, however, the best pictures are to be found inside the National Gallery. And having passed the security test at the entrance to the Sainsbury Wing, leave your Sainsbury bags and any other encombrances you may have with you in the spacious claokroom. They like to charge you £1.Otherwise, admission to the National Gallery is free of charge to everyone; so please enjoy this gift from the nation as well as from the old masters themselves. On the ground floor level of the Nationl Gallery, there is a bookshop with an excellent range of art books which also offers at this time of year Christmas decorations ingeniously based on details from paintings in the National Gallery. Oustanding temporary exhibitions are held downstairs in the basement of the Sainsbury Wing; and entrance charges do apply to these special exhibits. My only criticism is that the subterranean rooms have no windows: electric lighting is therefore constant, and the paintings don't get the chance to react to the subtleties of changing daylight as they were intended to do by the artists who created them.This was the architect's big mistake.But there is a lift to take you up to the main picture galleries on the second floor(lavatories are located at level - 1). Here you can see the early Italian Renaissance masters - including Leonardo, Bellini, Mantegna and Piero della Francesca. The other direction will take you to the big masterpieces of the Venetian Renaissance including Veronese's famous painting of 'Alexander the Great'. On this level, there is a second, smaller bookshop where, if you wish, you can buy a short guide to the National Gallery which will lead you to those  particulart masterpieces you really want to see. And in the gallery-rooms themselves, you will find that the old master paintings are arranged according to their national schools in the old-fashioned, traditional way which many people find to be so reassuring.But if you don't want to be systematic or art historical, just wander through the rooms (the doors push both ways), and take in the paintings by Claude and Poussin, Rubens and Rembrandt, Velasquez and Van Dyck, Caravaggio, Turner and Constable, Monet and Manet, Seurat and Matisse. But please don't hope to do it 'all' in one day. I am still finding things after all these years...At ground level, there are several places to lunch or dine; (for late opening hours, please see the National Gallery's website). There is a cafe area which serves snacks and cakes. And a waiter/waitress-served restaurant where the food is good, and not that expensive. From the ground-floor level, it is also worth knowing that there is a public lift which takes you up to the main paintings on the second floor, and this is especially convenient for people who rely on wheelchairs for mobility. But if this particular lift is busy, there is another smaller, swifter lift by the staircase where the Primaticco paintings are located. To find it, you just need to say to the guards, 'Which way for the Primaticcios?'The National Gallery in London is a dictionary of great art. But don't just go once:  keep going back. Everything there is always changing; the light is changing, and you are changing too. This is when the dictionary turns into a mirror in which you and the rest of the world see yourselves reflected. Enjoy this great collection of Western European painting, and take others with you, especially the young! That, after all, is the future of the National Gallery."

Such a lot of things to see, room after room of beautiful paintings, portraits, landscapes, moderns, all laid out for me.   I wanted to see everything but that was impossible (my companion did not share my enthusiasm) so I chose portraits of people I had at least heard of.  When you come out Trafalgar Square is laid out before you so can connect with the history you have been looking at.    A lovely way to spend a wet afternoon."

Situated on theTrafalgar Square, it is as central as ti gets and really easy for the traveler to find and visit. Apart from the masterpieces and artwork that you'll find within the Gallery (from da Vinci to Klimt) the building itself is a sight for sore eyes. And it's not not just the building; the Trafalgar Square with its monuments, surrounding historical buildings, and incredible view will make you love London even more. There is no fee to the gallery, so it's even accessible for those traveling on a budget. Will visit again for sure."

"Written April 16, 2019","Crown jewel of London's many, outstanding museums","My wife and I consider ourselves to be museum junkies, and we count the National Gallery as one of the finest venues we've experienced. This elegant showcase is beautifully laid out and follows a logical chronological format. If you wish to focus on just one facet of the high renaissance, you can. The Dutch master's landscapes? Done. They put a lot of thought into making the historical development of artistic styles 'make sense'. Add to that the museum's' relative proximity to the Portrait Gallery and the British Museum, and this part of London is a museum lovers play land. Allocate at least 3 unrushed hours."
"Written April 10, 2019",A look back in time,Great visit and really informative. It was helpful when taking a student in as it helped us explain several historical links.
"Written March 31, 2019",Chronological order in the gallery,Well equipped bookshop with litterature concerning different artists in the gallery. Elevator to different etages.
"Written March 27, 2019","The National Gallery, home to world class art !!!","If you near Buckingham palace, then your very near to Trafalgar Square. And smack bang in front of it is the National Gallery, the home of some of the most famous art in the world. And the great news is that it’s free. So if you’ve a few hours to kill in central London, then pop in to the NG for a few hours of art culture. It might not be high on your list of things to do, but you might be pleasantly surprised. "
"Written March 26, 2019",Great visit,The National Gallery and the National Portrait are right next door to each other so make sure you go to the right gallery! We did a quick tour of the gallery (around an hour and a half) and I had looked up ahead of time the pieces I wanted to see. The rooms are laid out by period so you can plan your visit depending on when the works you want to see were completed.
"Written March 25, 2019",Nice masterpieces on display,"The entry is free but you could donate if you wish to. The art pieces and its history is worth to spend some time digesting . Very spacious gallery in spite of the hugh crowd , hence easy to walk around to enjoy the art pieces."
"Written March 15, 2019",Gallery for famous Paintings,"A hugh gallery, 2 floors. If you are an arts lover, best to get a guided tour.Many "" rooms "" to visit n an official is around should you need assistance.Entry is free but you need to pay £1.50 to £2.5 if you need to leave your bulky jackets n bags at the bag counter.Located in front of trafalgar square. Not able to comment about the ""items"" in the Gallery,as I was not interested n walked out after 10 minutes."
"Written February 19, 2019",A wonderful art museum,"I could have spent hours more here, but I still enjoyed it. I got in line before it opened, and once it did, I got in rather quickly. It was crowded, but it got more crowded as the day went on. I loved the building itself; and I loved seeing ""The Monarch of the Glen"". I also loved Stubb's ""Whistlejacket"" (I kept going back to see them both.) I also thought the impressionist paintings were spectacular; especially the special exhibit that I had to pay to get into (it was SO worth it!) The location of the museum is also quite nice-- lots to see around there!"
"Written August 9, 2018",Prepare yourself for sensory overload,"The paintings by the masters are a sight to see.  The best thing about the National Gallery is that it is free.  They suggest a 5 pound donation, but it is worth it.  Each room has exquisite artwork.  The number of Rubens, Rembrandts, DiVinci… painting are work the visit."
"Written August 6, 2018",Nice visit,"We took our nineteen year old daughter to visit this amazing museum.  We all love the impressionist paintings. So we went straight there    And found a lot, of amazing art.  I loved this museum because it's very well organized. Easy to find what interest you the most. I highly recommend visiting the national gallery for at least 3 hours"
"Written July 25, 2018",great to visit,"we wanted to see the exhibition on the french impressionist, Monet, Gaugin, Renoir and company and spent the whole afternoon there wondering around all the exhibition rooms"
"Written July 24, 2018","Yes, yes & yes (and free as well)","The National Gallery at Trafalgar Square is truly a treasure not to be missed.  Admission is free (a fee might be charged for special exhibits) and the artwork going back 800+ years is outstanding.  Given the large size of the National Gallery, combined with the free admission, one might want to make multiple short trips to visit as opposed to one long trip.  One of things I particularly like about the National Gallery is that there is plenty of seating inside the gallery, to give one’s back and feet a rest when needed."
"Written July 14, 2018",Supposed to be free! ,Went to National Gallery for a quick visit as we were short of time. As we went through the main doors there were about five people as for donations to get in. When someone said they had no cash they were immediately sent to a girl with an iPad so they could pay with their card. It was uncomfortable to feel that you couldn’t go in without paying and one family left as they didn’t feel they could afford to enter. This shouldn’t happen as it is supposed to be free! 
"Written June 19, 2018",Natioanal portrait gallery visit,One of the absolute best galleries in europe and a must visit for some of the finest collections.  For a view of what it was like to live in London you have to see the Hogarth work.  Fantastic!
"Written June 9, 2018",A wonderful art experience,"My wife and I really enjoyed the National Gallery.  We are not, by any test, art experts.  However, the variety and quality on display were wonderful.  We were very glad that we included it on our trip."
"Written May 24, 2018",Wonderful morning and lunch,"My husband and I went mainly for the world class Monet and Architecture exhibit (ends July 29, 2018) and it did not disappoint The paintings were borrowed from around the world and arranged to show how Monet used buildings in his art. We enjoyed a delicious sit-down lunch in the Gallery's cafe. Prices compared to similar restaurants outside the museum. It gave us a chance to rest while we ate and overlooked all the action of Trafalger Square.  We then had new energy to spend in the rest of the galleries."
"Written May 24, 2018",A must see,"If you love paintings you can see them here for free. Great artists of the world.If you come at 10 am you can enter with the first visitors, and avoid to much people inside."
"Written May 2, 2018",Must visit,"Not many places have 2300 pieces of art and a great place to view Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet and other famous pieces.You will not be disappointed with this one"
"Written February 10, 2019",Excellent collection,"They’ve got Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Monet and many many more.Their gallery is outstanding! They may not have lots of works but the ones they have are beyond sufficient! Really easy to walk around and can do a full walk of the collection in a couple of hours. "
"Written January 24, 2019",Must go,Since this is free to enter I would recommend for everyone to go there as there are lots of famous pictures on display here and the building itself is great to see from the inside.
"Written October 19, 2018",A wonderful collection,"I came early for my visit at the National Gallery, and I am happy for that. The museum is well visited and not without reason. The permanent collection is huge and the special Impressionist exhibition was most interesting. Unfortunately it can be difficult to find your way around in the museum, so I reccomend you buy a map."
"Written October 18, 2018",Amazing and massive place,I have been to London many times and I always like to get into the National Gallery to see famous Van Gogh SunFlowers. Always a great place to visit. Entrance is Free!
"Written October 15, 2018",Take three hours and wander this gallery!,"Free. This gallery offers free entrance. They take donations, and after wandering the halls/wings you will want to donate. Carve time out of hour day to sit on the steps to people watch, walk Trafalgar Square, snap a selfie with one of the most photographed lions in London, discuss the 4th plinth, and then walk the National Galkery. "
"Written October 14, 2018",A Gift to the World,"Truly one of the world’s great art museums. You simply can’t miss this when in London, and it is FREE. Conveniently arranged chronologically. "
"Written October 10, 2018",Awesome building,Visited for a morning and found so interesting we left for lunch and went back in for the afternoon.  And all free.  A donation is requested.
"Written October 10, 2018",You would certainly visit again,"I have been to the National Gallery many times and still want to go back whenever I pass through London.  You can see Monet, Van Gogn and Klimt - all in one visit without lines, free of charge and no crowds.  You will love it."
"Written September 20, 2018",Extraordinary Museum ,"If I had to choose one museum in London to revisit, this would be it.  It’s amazing to me the amount of wonderful art that spans such a vast amount of time.  When I saw the Botticelli and da Vinci paintings, I cried.  Having only seen many of the large amounts of Medieval and Renaissance art pieces in books, it was overwhelming to be able to see them in all their glory.  I gladly anticipate the day I can return there.  I couldn’t believe that I was so close to the masterpieces of my readings."
"Written September 14, 2018",Lots to see,"This is a large collection, well loved. We used the Rick Steve’s guide as a start to introduce ourselves to the museum. I highly recommend it, we saw highlights we would have missed."
"Written November 15, 2014",One of the best - and it is free,"The collection of paintings here is phenomenal.  If you look at the paintings and read the information, you can see many of them were acquired in the 1800's.  It is amazing what works of art were available at that time and what this museum was able to acquire.  These days, one minor artist's painting sells for millions of dollars.  Visit this art gallery and appreciate the paintings they have - truly incredible!!  Entrance is free, however, special exhibits require a fee."
"Written November 4, 2014",Rembrandt: Chronicle of a death foretold...,"This exhibition of the late works of Rembrandt at the National Gallery in London is a show stopper in every way. It concentrates on work from the 1650s to the master's death in 1669. The self portraits, hovering between life and death, have never been surpassed in western art. They are totally honest, chillingly executed and yet filled with acute psychological insight. You can see Caravaggio and Lucien Freud in these works.  This is the ""wow factor"" of genius.  Words fail and fall pathetically away in the face of such truth. Even the crowds you get at the start of any exhibition are not a nuisance but seem to be there as a celebration of genius. Brilliantly curated  the exhibition ""Rembrandt The Late Works"" continues until January 18th 2015. Be there!"
"Written November 1, 2014",Greedy selling of rembrandt tickets,"Totally impossible to get near the paintings so crowded it was a horrible experience.  Not worth the money!  We bought a 1pm timed ticket weeks in advance and still had to queue to get even into the first room.  Greedy selling of tickets meant a thoroughly unpleasant visit.  The security people in the rooms looked very stressed, there were way  too many people in a very confined dark space. Don't go. "
"Written October 13, 2014",Great gallery but.......,"Heard great things about the National Gallery, one of the world`s great art institutions. The collection is breathtaking but at times it felt more like a theme park. In almost every room it was hard to enjoy the paintings without the intrusion of clicking and whirring from cameras. Some visitors appeared more intent on photographing than looking at the real thing and some were just incredibly rude in the way they dominated some pictures,eg the `Sunflowers`. We spoke to a staff member who said that photography has only just been allowed. I wish I`d visited two months ago!"
"Written October 13, 2014",Absolutely fantastic...,"The National Gallery, located on Trafalgar Square, London, is one of the best art galleries in the world.  The displays are absolutely fantastic.  My favourites are the Van Gogh paintings.  Well worth a visit.  Highly recommended."
"Written October 6, 2014",Bit crowded,It's got some lovely pieces of artwork but if they could even out the amount of people in each room so that not everyone's crowded against one picture it would be good. 
"Written October 1, 2014", Disappointed,"My first time in London I went to the National Gallery twice. I love art and I loved the atmosphere the gallery had.  No lines, no loud people. It was a haven for art lovers. The gallery has my favorite paintings in the world, must sees for any art lover.  However I am in no rush to go back after my last experience. Recently the gallery decided to stop enforcing the ""no camera rule"" and my heart is broken.  The gallery now resembles the louvre with obnoxious crowds flashing thier cameras and phones, blocking the paintings. It was a disappointment all around. I would still suggest you go but try to go at a less busy time. "
"Written September 20, 2014",FANTASTIC,"Whether looking for contemporary artists or the classics, The National Gallery has it all.  We loved portraits of women and men of cinema and stage, music icons, and royalty.....as well as Renoir's and so forth.  Wonderful way to spend the day.  Enjoyed the delicious fare in the elegant cafe before leaving."
"Written September 14, 2014",Masterpieces you are familiar with - up close!,"A free, excellent, well- laid out museum where you will come upon masterpieces you've seen all your life in books and movies. Even peaceful when lots of people are there, you can spend all day or hit some of the highlights in an hour or so."
"Written June 24, 2014",National Gallery OK but not as good as usual!,"Veronese exhibition pretty good.  ""Free Guided Tour"" was a bit disappointing - too self consciously jokey and unsympathetic to anyone who wasn't able to speed along behind him."
"Written September 28, 2015",Historically interesting.,Very nice art gallery at the heart of London. Highly recommended to visit... It is crowded so have to be there early. Lots to see and must take time to absorb.
"Written September 27, 2015",National Gallery Must See,This is an excellent art gallery particularly the education section for schools. Really enjoyed my visit.
"Written September 24, 2015",London's Leading Art Museum,Nice thing is that it is free.  You can get overwhelmed by all the artwork.  Might be better to take in the gallery over a few days and see a little each day. Some say it has the best collection of European paintings.  Would highly recommend for anyone visiting London.  The museum is located in Trafalgar Square.  You'll find a number of street musicians in the area.
"Written September 13, 2015",Worth to visit,"Excelent collection and very well showed. Very important: its free, and as London is very expensive, this is very good"
"Written September 4, 2015",Visitors beware -  much of the gallery is closed due to ongoing industrial action,"We've just spent several days in London as the culmination of our trip around the UK.  A trip to the NG  was to be one of the highlights.  We wanted to see the great English art,  the Constables,  Gainsborough,  Turners,  as well as others  like the Vermeer,  Van Eyck and Rembrandt paintings. Unfortunately,  we were unable to see any of these as large parts of the NG were closed (with no signs outside the building and very little explanation inside). The remaining staff seemed to have little idea what was happening.  One told me that it might be opened by the following day,  another told me it could take months. As we were staying close,  we dropped in on three days but our target rooms were always closed.  On our final morning,  we were surprised to find the room containing Spanish golden age paintings was open,  so we did see the Rokeby Venus. Just not good enough for a national icon."
"Written August 28, 2015","Impressive collection, but go early",I stopped here in the middle of the afternoon and saw some amazing impressionist art.  I left just short of an hour because the crowds were unbearable. If I ever go back to see the rest of the museum I'll go when it first opens in the morning.
"Written August 9, 2015",It's a bit like visiting an eccentric old aunt! ,"The National Gallery building is just gorgeous in its own right. Rich colors, dark wood, large salons, plenty of places to sit in awe of the paintings and natural light. It's oozes a charm all if its own: a bit like visiting an eccentric old aunt except for the priceless artwork. But the National Gallery needs to be thought about before you go it alone. We did some reading and my children we interested in Turner and Constable. Having a focus was helpful. The NG website is full of interesting information and outlines the top 30 paintings that are 'must-sees' and that made the visit more fun too. Wear comfortable shoes and take a break for tea: the lemon drizzle cake is awesome. Just like Aunty's! "
"Written July 13, 2015",Where to start?,The UK is immensely lucky to have so many world class galleries and museums and the best part is that they are mostly free. The National Gallery (and the Portrait Gallery next door) are both fantastic. 
"Written July 6, 2015",Great art collection,A great selection of art available for view.  Personnally I like this collection better than the Louve.  
"Written July 6, 2017",Calling all Art Lovers!,"A true treat full of old masters, impressionists, and more. Enjoy Vermeer, Da Vinci, Raphael, Holbein, Monet, Van Gogh, Botticelli, Cezanne, Titian, and the list goes on and on. Be sure to grab a map/guide that tells you where all the not to missed highlights are."
"Written June 7, 2017",Two Italian friends in London,"Selected works of Michelangelo and Sebastiano del Piombo are featured in a show at the National Gallery (until June 25, 2017) highlighting their friendship and collaboration. Unfortunately, their twenty-five year friendship ended after a disagreement.There was intense rivalry for commissions among artists in Rome. Raphael was judged a better painter than Michelangelo for work done at the Vatican; this criticism was the impetus for Michelangelo to befriend and collaborate with Sebastiano who was skilled in the use of oil paints and vibrant color.Although this show received average reviews from a few art critics, I recommend seeing it because of the sculptures on display. The monks of the Church of San Vicenzo Martire in Bassano Romano have lent the original version of ""The Risen Christ"" for this exhibition; I knew that this would be the only chance I would ever have to see it. Michelangelo abandoned this work after finding a flaw in the marble; the face, back and right hand were finished by another sculptor. Nearby is a cast of the second version that can be seen in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. It was fascinating to compare the two and see the changes that Michelangelo made in the second one.The two portraits painted by Sebastiano that I found especially interesting depict Pope Clement VII (Giulio de'Medici a few years before (1525) and after (1531) the Sack of Rome in 1527. The effect of this devastating event is evident in the change in his appearance.Other highlights include a cast of Michelangelo's ""Pieta"" and a replica of the Borgherini Chapel found in the Church of San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, that Sebastiano painted with partial designs by Michelangelo. After seeing this exhibition, I headed to the galleries and was pleasantly surprised to hear a choir singing sacred music. It was especially moving when I was in the room with the da Vinci paintings. I hope to return again soon."
"Written March 15, 2017",Extraordinary Collection,"The National Gallery is one of the topmost art museum for orthodox painting with more than 2000 paintings of different art eras from the 13th century to the early 20th century. The museum is allocated into 4 zones and each of the zone is devoted to certain centuries. I have visited the galleries few time and here are some great tips to make to visit the National Gallery:1.	Do not miss the Picture of the month.2.	There is a free 60-minute tour by gallery lecturers on gallery's most definitive works and a general overview of the collection. This daily guided tours take place every day at 11.30am and 2.30pm. 3.	Friday tours take place every Friday at 7pm.4.	There is a 10-minute talks to provide a quick insight of the paintings – Monday to Friday at 4pm.5.	If you love talk on art then catch a free talk on art at 1pm in the Gallery or the theatre.6.	Tuesday and Wednesday tend to be the quietest days of the week where Saturday and Sunday are the busiest ones.7.	If you want to sketch, bring your own stool, pad and pencils.8.	Occasional music performances are held in the National Gallery; check the website for details.9.	The Dining Rooms provide good British food, an all-day bakery and afternoon teas.10.	Right next door is the National Portrait Gallery.11.

Free Admission and opening hours: Daily, 10am-6pm; Fri, 10am-9pm."
"Written January 19, 2017",Great Art Museum,"I would...and I think I have..rated this higher than the British Museum as far as where you want to be on a rainy day.  This is a huge venue with a lot of beautiful art pieces.  I do have to say that the amount of religious pieces was a little off putting, but comparing everyone's interpretation of the same event(s) was interesting.  The street performers outside also added to a great experience."
"Written January 11, 2017",Fantastically Interesting,A truly inspiring collection of artwork.  We could have spent hours wandering around.  There are so many pieces of art here that you will already have seen pictures of or heard about - to see them in the flesh is remarkable and fascinating.It would be so easy to go back for further indulgent hours of pleasurable viewing.
"Written October 30, 2016","Not just another ""art museum"" - The National Gallery is a British Treasure not to be missed","The National Gallery is a source of great UK pride - as well it should be.  The great works of art and their presentation are excellent.  Give yourself at least 3/4 of a full day to enjoy this wonder.  Save some time to experience Trafalgar Square just outside the National Gallery.  That is an experience in and of itself.  The Lord Nelson Memorial is spectacular as is the rest of the Square - which is sort of the town square of London.  If you get an early start - you can visit the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, and maybe even Leicester Square which is not far away all in the same day."
"Written September 25, 2016",Superb gallery,The National Gallery is truly one of London's wonders. Where else can you step in off the street to spend a few hours in the company of the Great Masters ? And all without any charge at all too !
"Written August 30, 2016",Amazing!,"I came here on the 28th of August 2016 with some family, we got the train up to Liverpool Street and then walked to the gallery, an amazing walk. There was places you could stop off to get a drink and eat, ice cream and the walk wasn't even that long. To see these famous painting in front of you for free aswell was amazing, mind blowing. You saw paintings from the 13th century all the way to the 21th century, to see the different styles  of paintings was amazing, it was such a good day out and will be doing it again, it had everything you needed from toilets to food and drinks in the cafe However some of the staff could of looked a bit more happy to be there and I would recommend this to families with young children as they might get a bit bored but other than that it was an amazing day out and I'm sure we will be visiting again."
"Written August 10, 2016",Excellent place to go,Spent a few hours wondering round admiring the pictures. Such an amazing experience and one I'd recommend to anyone how can go! 
"Written July 29, 2016",Comprehensive (and free) art museum,"The National Gallery is definitely one of the largest and most comprehensive art museums that I have ever been too. It hosts a huge collection of artwork from various countries, time periods, and artists that is absolutely surreal and sure to keep an art lover entertained for hours. Though the main building of the gallery directly faces Trafalgar Square, the entrance is located far on the left side (west). Admission is also free. The gallery is extremely large and therefore it may get a little boring after some time, so plan your tour wisely. "
"Written July 2, 2015",An incredible experience,"The National Gallery is an absolute *must* in London. The Sainsbury Wing with the Renaissance Art is beyond splendid. Don't miss the stunning Paolo Ucello painting in which perspective first appears. The Leonardo ""cartoon"", in a room by itself, almost feels like a shrine. There's a little bench there, so sit for a bit and soon enough you'll have, at least for a short while, the cartoon all to yourself. It is wondrous in its beauty, still luminous after all these centuries. The Monet paintings upstairs are some of the artist's finest. It's free -- really! -- so you can go for a day or for an hour; it's a haven in this bustling city, and indeed in this bustling world."
"Written July 1, 2015",Fun and interesting museum,The art in this museum is so beautiful and the admission is free. The Van Gogh and Monet paintings were magnificent in person.
"Written June 17, 2015",a dream! take advantage of their free tours,"what an amaaaaaaaaaaaaazing collection of art!!  you can see paintings from all the great European painters.  The building is also beautiful, and the paintings are exhibited in a way that you can see them up close or from a distance - as you like (they are not in safety cages, thanks god). they have two free guides a day - I encourage you to take advantage of these.  The lady was great, and she gave us the story of 4 paintings in detail - so something you would not read or hear in a standard guide.  She turned the view of my 14-year-old daughter fully around: beforehand she did not want to see anything and was angry why she had to be there; and after the one hour with the guide she started to be interested.  the guide really opened her eyes onto what one can enjoy in a painting. so thanks!! (sorry, do not know your name, a nice blonde middle-aged lady - you were a great guide!!)also the audio guide is helpful; at least much more helpful than that in the British Museum where it is only 1-2 object per room that is annotated.  Here most of the paintings have some information on them that helps in appreciating the art."
"Written June 17, 2015","Free Entrance, Worth to Visit","No admission fee to this nice place, or you can donate if you'd like. You will see lots of beautiful painting here. Audio guide is also available."
"Written June 12, 2015",A jewel of London and of the nation,"I've been to this gallery so many times, I think the first time might have been on a school trip. It never fails to disappoint.I like it ever more now that the northern end of Trafalgar Square is sealed off to traffic (just a shame that some of the tackier street 'entertainers' are allowed to congregate there).In terms of painting there is something for almost everyone. Highlights for me are one of Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers'- probably my favourite picture in the world; one of Seurat's massive pointillist paintings; a variety of Monet's water lilies, Rousseau's 'Tiger in a Tropical Storm' and the mighty 'Whistlejacket' by George Stubbs (which they have cleverly positioned so that you have an excellent line of sight).Also the building itself is so beautiful inside and out, even the modern wing.It is one of the best things about living in the UK that such an amazing place is free to go into (donations welcome). Also don't miss the Portrait Gallery just around the corner."
"Written June 9, 2015",A place to marvel at some of the best art in the world,"Words are hard to describe just how impressive the works of art are in this building, it is free to enter so you can see as much or as little as you want with out feeling any pressure to see it all"

"Written June 1, 2015","Well, to discuss the National Gallery looks strange","Well, to discuss National Gallery looks strange as there are museums which are in position to choosr their own public. And yes, it is overcrowded - though better in this relation than Louvre."
"Written May 22, 2015","Disappointed, not with the art, but with the treatment of staff","I was very, very, very disappointed on a recent visit to London to see that the National Gallery has sacked a union rep, Candy Udwin, just because she asked for information on the price of the private security company that the director's brought in to replace regular gallery staff. We were all set to go in to see the lovely paintings, as usual, but won't cross a picket line to do so. I hope the director comes to his senses soon and realises that staff deserve as much care as paintings."
"Written May 21, 2015",Just amazing,"The fact that this place is free is just beyond amazing. Fabulously curated collection of great works. I could spend days here. I highly recommend the audio tour, which is a real bargain at GBP4 as of May 2015. They select about 80 representative works in the collection as a recommended route, but the audio guide applies to far more works than that. Take the time to listen to the commentary and really enjoy the art. When we went, the curated selection was in a kind of beta test, and the staff were very happy to hear our feedback of the tour.I've been to Uffizi, the Louvre, Smithsonian, Philadelphia, etc. Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest art museum visits I've had, largely thanks to the audio guide. Best 4 pounds I've ever spent. Parts of the museum were a bit of a zoo (esp. Van Gogh's Sunflowers) when we visited on a Saturday, but it was easy enough to navigate around the crowds and pick another great work to enjoy in relative peace."
"Written May 5, 2015",Another not to be missed attraction in London,"Located in Trafalgar Square, this museum is free of cost and should not be missed.  The National Gallery is adjacent to the National Portrait Gallery, so make a day of it and visit both.  Paintings are grouped according to year.  I particularly enjoyed those of the Impressionist era and beyond.  The National Gallery is a true national treasure for the British people.The museum store contains very nice, well-priced items.  Items concern the artists and portraits of the museum, as well as general London souvenirs.  Consider purchasing your city souvenirs here, instead of elsewhere in the city, to support the efforts of this organization."

As we all know, a picture can be worth a thousand words.  With this thought in mind, we have attached 10 photos of the National Gallery’s paintings and interior spaces that caught our eyes.

"Written May 27, 2016",A wonderful place to visit!,"Gallery upon gallery of the old masters of various eras are available for all to view. Botticelli to Van Gogh, all are exquisitely cared for and displayed beautifully. Free of charge to enter and enjoy."
"Written May 15, 2016",Amazing place. Definitely worth a visit,This place is a real national treasure. A fantastic place to admire so many fantastic works of art. Recommended to tourists and Londoners alike!
"Written May 9, 2016",Nice selection of art,"Entrance here is donation only, so you can take a quick look if you want. You can spend hours here our just take a quick look."
"Written May 8, 2016",Fascinating - really highly recommended,Fabulous.  A great shame that I hadn't prioritised time to visit sooner.  Wonderful to see such a broad range of famous works.  Avoid going on a rainy Spring/summers day as it gets very crowded.
"Written February 3, 2016",The entrance is free so why i was asked to pay,I was there staying  in the queue  in the morning I arrived one hour before  and  I was the first one to wait....there were a man from the museum saying we need to pay for visiting even if it's free .. saying to pass in another doot...I didn't understand  why if the  entrance should be free... Anyway  I liked it....
"Written December 23, 2015",Be prepared to spend a day or more,"We came across the Gallery while walking around Trafalgar Square (it wasn't our destination) and decided to stop in. Admission is free unless you are going to a special exhibit. It is a large but well organized gallery. We looked for and found the impressionist and post impressionist painters and were delighted in not only the works of a number of artists but  the number of works present i.e. about 15 Monet's. Unlike many galleries, picture taking is allowed as long it is one of the museum's own works (if on loan the no pictures due to copyright issues). The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. We asked about works by Da Vinci and were directed to where there were two in another wing. The gallery also has the ability to create a print of a large number of works in various sizes and finishes while you wait. As stated, we wondered in and spent about  2 hours. You can easily spend a day or more in this gallery. "
"Written December 15, 2015",very inspiring,"inspiring and visit for free! Helps to understand English history, literature and art.Friendly staff"
"Written November 2, 2015",Beautiful exhibits and free,"There are a number of works that I had seen in books over the years such as Ruben's ""The Birth of Venus,"" and what a treat to see them in person.  This really is a beautiful collection.  Unlike American museums, you can actually get quite close to the work and see details that you would miss from a distance.  We appreciated the unusual display method of grouping works by different artists of the same subject, offering a remarkable opportunity to contrast and compare artworks.  Absolutely worth the visit."
"Written October 25, 2015",Go when there's a Tour - available daily,There are too many great paintings at the National Gallery. Do join one of their guided tours (free). There are a few tips:1. Try not to check in anything at their cloakrooms - they are super slow and will get you late to the tour.2. The tours meet at the Sainsbury Entrance (not the regular main entrance) you need another 5 minutes to navigate there if you arent familiar with the location because the museum staff does a very good job in getting you navigate the LONG route. (Tip: The Sainsbury Entrance is right across from a building called Canada House))
"Written March 10, 2015",Inventing Impressionism - 5 Star exhibition,We love our visits to the National Gallery and this latest one for the fabulous collection of impressionist works and telling of the story of Paul Durand-Ruel  was a winner. We visited on a Monday and it wasn't too crowded which combined with the excellent audio guide made it a great way to spend a day off. Only criticism was the lack of room to leave our suitcases in the luggage store ment we had to take them to Charing Cross station.
"Written March 10, 2015",Amazing,"This is a huge gallery with an amazing collection of art from many periods. We decided to go to the impressionist wing only as we knew we would get overwhelmed if we tried to see too much. The collection in the impressionist period is wonderful.  This gallery is free and you can easily spend a few hours here...For art lovers, this gallery is a MUST"
"Written March 5, 2015",Incredible,"Paints by all the famous guys that even who is not that into arts will know. The famous ""Sunflowers"" (Van Gogh) and the ""Virgin of the Rocks"" (Leonardo da Vinci) are must sees."
"Written March 4, 2015",National Treasure,"One of the places an art lover must see in London is the National Gallery. A collection of great paintings including my favourite Monet Waterliles. Not too huge, doable in half a day, scattered seats are a bonus. Even my 8 year old was beginning to recognize some styles and artists and enjoyed the visit. All for FREE! Also a few good dining options, 2 cafés for good breakfast/ lunch /dinner and that must have English afternoon tea, as well as a posher adjacent restaurant. The shops are also great, serious art books to those which introduce young audiences to great art. Next door is the National Portrait Gallery and outside, Trafalgar Square and a view of the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. Quintessentially London!"
"Written March 3, 2015",Industrial action,"Much to my disappointment, most of my favorite parts were closed due to a strike. I don't question the reasons or legitimacy of the strike, but just doesn't seem right to simply close most of such an important museum, definitely a London highlight."
"Written February 25, 2015",Spoilt by strike action,Very limited rooms available with most if the best ones closed due to industrial action  - we will go back another day to see everything 
"Written January 26, 2015",Give yourself at least 4 or 5 hours,"For free entry you get a lot! We arrived at 10am sharp as they opened and the queue was down the street. However it soon went down, but by the time we left at 12 noon, it was easily an hours wait. So a=my advice is arrive early and head straight for the 'Blue' area. That's where the dinosaur exhibit is, and that gets very very busy."
"Written January 11, 2015",Disgruntled Rembrandt,My husband and I went to see the Rembrandt exhibition yesterday (Saturday 10 Jan) and we were disappointed to find that we had to scrabble our way through choc-a-bloc exhibition rooms.  There were far too many people allowed into such small spaces and when you consider that some of Rembrandt's sketches are no more than 10x7 cm it was most annoying not to be able to view them up close and personal due to the crowds gathered around the exhibits.  By the end of my visit I felt that I probably resembled the rather disgruntled looking self portrait of the artist in his latter years and the empty folds of my purse highlighted my impecunious position since forking out £36 viewing fees.
"Written December 12, 2014",Photo museum,We went to see the Vivian Leigh exhibit. It was in a small rioom but it was nice.   The other exhibits were fine also.  Big stairwell that you have to walk up.  Be prepared to check umbrellas and coated. They do want a tip also
"Written November 27, 2014",National Gallery - or National Disgrace?,"We visited London specifically to catch two exhibitions - the Turner at the Tate Britain, and the late Rembrandt at the NG. After checking that tickets were available on both days, I first booked the Turner, then went back to the NG site for the Rembrandt, intending to visit at 10am (my preferred time). To my shock, the WHOLE of the day was taken up with 'members only' visits apaprt form the last slot of the day (16.00-18.00h), so I was forced to book that.When you book a time slot, you assume that the intention is to limit the numbers in some way to allow for a reasonable viewing experience. Not a bit of it - people poured into the tiny underground gallery, where we were packed in like sardines. It was extremely difficult to enjoy Rembrandt's brilliant paintings in these circumstances (he is, IMO, the best self-portraitist who ever lived - as I discovered on a visit to the NG for an exhibition in 1999, when far fewer people attended - at 10am).In addition, the lighting was a total disaster, with bright reflections coming off many of the works - it proved difficult to find a position to see many works properly, and the crush of bodies didn't exactly help. (I overheard one of the security guards advising some visitors on where to stand to be able to see one work - seems that this young lady, in her lowly position, has more understanding of how to hang paintings than the curator. They should swap jobs, at once!)So - for practically a whole day, three men and a dog were allowed to saunter around the exhibition. Hoi polloi were treated with Olympian contempt, and squashed into a poorly lit hell-hole."
"Written April 27, 2015","""Inventing Impressionism"" ","Travelled from Hull to see the ""Inventing Impressionism"" exhibition.  Fantastic collection of paintings - a real treat. However, the venue is simply not suitable for this kind of exhibition. 9 quite small rooms with barely enough room for the paintings  - and even less room for the number of visitors allowed in at once.  It was impossible to appreciate these wonderful paintings properly among all the shoving and pushing.This was the second time  (after the Da Vinci exhibition) when we felt that the main concern hadn't been the art but to make as much money as possible by squeezing as many visitors in as possible.  In the end, we were in the exhibition for just over half an hour before we got fed up - that's a pound a minute.So all in all, a mixed experience."
"Written April 17, 2015",Inventing Impressionism overcrowded,"We visited the Inventing Impressionism Exhibition on pre-booked timed tickets at 12 noon. The exhibition is fantastic with world famous paintings on display. However, our experience was spoiled by the overcrowding.  There were so many people present that we had to jostle to see the paintings and it was impossible to stand and read the information boards. These paintings are best appreciated from a distance but that too was impossible with people three deep in front of us standing really close to the pictures. At £18 we felt he National Gallery should have been able to a offer a better experience and we asked to speak to some-one about our disappointment. We were totally blocked from doing this by the staff on the information desk who even refused to give us the relevant names or contact details in order to complain. Hence this review being the only way to respond!!!!!"
"Written April 11, 2015",Amazed in 15 minutes,we didn't have much time to stay there but the time we stayed were absolutely marvelous. We were dazzled by the museum and the expo. 
"Written April 8, 2015",Amazing,Just to see world-famous works of art in person makes the visit worthwhile. I was stunned and amazed at the gorgeous artwork. Definitely visit.
"Written April 4, 2015",Best impressionist drawings in London,"We visited a contemporary exhibition of impressionist s drawings. It is a wonderful collection of all the best of the best  by Renoir, Monet. Manet, Pissaro and othersif you are there until May - do not miss it"
"Written April 4, 2015",Great art ,"Great art exhibitions.No need to take the audio guide, everything is written beside the paintings. I managed to go through a small part of the paintings and would definitely like to go back.  It would be nice if they had longer opening hours. "
"Written March 29, 2015",You better Gough!,Fantastic Van Gough pieces and the museum itself is beautiful! Worth a visit. Hungry after? Go to Cafe in the Crypt at St. Martin in the Field which is to the right of the Gallery if you're looking at it!
"Written March 21, 2015",A must see for art lovers,"This is my favorite art museum of all time. The impressionist section is especially lovely. When I go to London, I never miss going and visiting a few of my favorite paintings. You can spend as little or as long as you want there, so I think it would be pleasant for anyone. I highly recommend."
"Written March 12, 2015",The cream of the crop,"Yes, it's free, and yes, it's packed full of masterpieces. You could spend days wandering the galleries, or focus on a few works/rooms and come back for additional visits. Enjoy European art from the Middle Ages up to the Impressionists in a beautiful setting."
"Written March 10, 2015",What an inspiring place,"I don't think you need to like paintings before you enter this place. You'll be impressed anyway.The building is beautiful, and the collections are amazing. It's hard not to find a few paintings which will be inspiring or moving. Highly recommended!"
"Written January 20, 2009",The best museum in London,"I spent a year in London and went to all the museums and I do admit the National Gallery is simply the best. The building itself, overlooking trafalgar square, is impressive. The collection is great, it gives a really good panorama of English art. Every time I went there, it wasnt that crowed and the visit was quite interesting! It was really good to get to know more about English artists and discover how rich the culture is, because people generally tend to look English art down which is a shame! A must seen in London!"
"Written July 12, 2008",Amazing,"If you go to London, even if just for a day, make this a stop on your itinerary. the paintings are truly breathtaking, with masterpieces from so many periods of time and so many different artists. You can easily spend one whole day here. i suggest getting an audio tour, as it really enhances your experience with knowing the story behind the painting. Room after room, you'll find something that amazes you. This museum is a must-see attraction."
"Written April 14, 2008",Favorite Museum in London!,"The National Gallery is one of my favorite places in London.  It can however be a bit overwhelming because there is a lot of fantastic art to see.  I am an art lover myself and I have spent many afternoons admiring their Raphael's and Botticellis, but I had the advantage of being introduced to the work slowly and over several months.  There's no entrance fee, which is awesome considering the amount  of incredible masterpieces there are inside.  There are also a lot of benches inside in every room so that if you want to sit and really admire some of the larger pieces, you can sit and relax for a bit.  I personally think the floor plan can be a bit confusing if you are looking for a specific piece and don't want to spend time wandering around a bit, but if you are an art lover with several hours to spare, you definitely wouldn't want to miss it!  They do also offer tours and audio guides if that is something you're interested in, although I don't know much about that since I have never used those services."
"Written April 27, 2004",Best Art Museum in London!,"If you only see one art museum in London, this is the one to see! Tons of masterpieces that anyone with even a basic knowledge of art would recognize. Admission is free, but wouldn't mind paying if required (donations accepted)."
"Written August 23, 2023","Two Exhibitions, One Fee & One Free","My wife & I visited the National Gallery to see two very good fine art exhibitions: ‘After Impressionism: Inventing Modern Art’ and ‘Saint Francis of Assisi’.  We booked our entry tickets on-line to make sure we’d be admitted during the early summer holiday period.  We had also booked an Afternoon Tea at the Gallery’s Ochre Restaurant between the two exhibits, which was not nearly as satisfying as our art appreciation on this visit.  Access to the free Gallery exhibits is via the Portico Entrance, up the front stairs facing Trafalgar Square; step-free access & entry for special exhibits are handled at the sidewalk-level Getty Entrance nearby.  Ticket check & security processing on arrival both went smoothly.  The National Gallery staff were all very friendly, the facilities are modern & well maintained, and their gift shop is one of the larger ones we’ve seen at an art museum (with quality merchandise).  We would recommend art lovers visiting London take a look at the Gallery website for current exhibitions and attend one that suits their tastes.  A two-fer would be even better."
"Written January 22, 2023",Beautiful museum,"Great museum, free entrance as most British museums, varied collections, centrally located. Easy to tour rather quickly, we've seen most collections within 2h."
"Written August 11, 2022",World Class collection,"Wonderful highlights include Boticelli, Da Vinci, Vermeer, Rembrandt, Van Gogh.  Everrything nicely spread out so it can handle the crowds."
"Written August 3, 2022",A must-see attraction for art lovers.,The building itself is very elegantly structured and the art that is featured in it is just priceless. My favourite highlights were Van Gogh’s and Da Vinci’s works. Recommended for anyone who appreciates visual art!
"Written August 2, 2022",Fantastic Museum,I was super excited to see the Van Gogh Sunflowers and this museum did not disappoint.  The museum is amazing and fun to wander around and get lost in the art.
"Written July 27, 2022",Some interesting paintings,"Went there to see some paintings of the Flemish masters. (Rubens, ...). The museum is spacious and well organized. Entrance is free or donation."
"Written March 16, 2014",Rude staff,"What should be a national treasure seems to be completely ruined by arrogant 'jobsworth' type staff who far from welcoming visitors prefer to be obnoxious.  If I spoke to and treated my clients the way these people treat the public, I would surely not still have a job,"
"Written August 31, 2013","Prestigious collection, beautiful building, enjoyable afternoon","There are so many wonderful museums in London - and this is a favorite.  With over 2300 historically significant paintings on display, the National Gallery could well feel overwhelming - but instead is a beautiful museum, well designed, and easy to enjoy.That having been said, it is a large museum and a huge collection - so a bit of planning is helpful.  The website, nationalgallery.org.uk, is extremely helpful.  One of the sections on the website is titled ""Plan Your Visit"".  In this section, you will find ""Ten Reasons to Visit"", ""30 Must See Paintings"", and ""Latest Acquisitions"" - which highlights 2013 acquired paintings.  Additionally, the brochures at the museum provide similar information and include gallery room numbers - making the paintings easy to find.  While I do have favorite artists and periods - I always, in any museum, want to know what they consider to be their most important paintings and I like see what they have considered important enough to recently acquire.  There are artists here that aren't often seen - including Caravaggio, as well as artists whose work is more well known - Monet. Van Gogh, Renoir, and Michelangelo.  It is a special place and you feel that from the moment you walk up the steps to the entrance portico and enter the magnificent building.As is the case with many museums, the café at the National Gallery could be improved.  Food options are limited, service is extremely slow and cumbersome, and there is little seating for such a large museum.  If you'd like a relaxing break during your visit, the café will not provide that.  Then, again, you're there to see a museum and not to eat - but the National Gallery might follow the lead of many other museums that are upgrading dining options and give some attention to the café.Whether you have one hour or five hours, any time at the National Gallery is time well spent."
"Written July 28, 2013",The Louvre might be the Best but this is a very close 2nd,You can only manage 2 or 3 rooms at a session. Sometimes there are too many people. Sometimes it is too overwhelming. But is is always superb. Loved the Monets in Room 43 this time.
"Written June 8, 2013",Museum attendants aggressive - ok experience.,"At the beginning, we bought headphones for the tour. We were NOT told that we weren't allowed to take photos nor did we see any signs saying so - we honestly didn't know. While I was listening to the tour in my headphones, I couldn't hear that one of the attendants/security guards was telling me not to take pictures. He aggressively approached me and grabbed my upper arm VERY hard. It hurt for the rest of the day. He was extremely rude and unkind. I'm a very petite woman and the security guard hurt me unnecessarily - he could've just tapped on my shoulder. I ended up in the washroom crying and it ruined my experience entirely. The museum itself was nice - however, for a person that doesn't know a whole lot about hart, the only artist I knew of in the place was Monet. Interesting headphone tour, I recommend getting it. The staff needs to treat its customers much better. Disappointed."
"Written January 22, 2012",What would Leanardo say.........................,"## Note this review is for the temporary Leanoardo Da Vinci exhibition currently running and not the National Gallery itself ##We purchased our tickets way back in Nov 11 and waited patiently for today to arrive. Our alloted time was 5pm, so we joined the queue shortly before and walked to the gallery entrance. Immediately there was a queue of people lining up, so being British we joined it and waited... and waited...... We chose not to use the audio commentary as this resulted in the queue moving at the same pace as an asthmatic ant with heavy shopping.  The crowds were ridiculous! It was almost impossible to move around, let alone see the paintings clearly. I received 2 or 3 elbows in the ribs and that was just from some little old ladies. Some of the drawings by Da Vinci are very feint and small so they are quite difficult to see even close up, but in a darkened room with crowds of people around you its even harder. We read on the website that the NG were allowing 180 people in every 30 mins, I would say to make this even remotely enjoyable experience this number should be reduced to around 75. Yes, I know they need to make money and that the rest of the museum is free but we paid £16.00 and only stayed for about 45 minutes due to hardly being able to see anything and also that there seemed to be no air conditioning of any kind so it was extremely hot and stuffy (and its only January!)Of the 93 exhibits, 30 of them are not actually by Da Vinci himself. they are by his friends, associates and pupils. It is a shame that the NG has chosen to exhibit these incredible paintings and drawings in such a poor way, they do no justice to Da Vinci at all.I always consider visiting an art gallery should be a relaxing experience where you can take your own time to sit in peace and quiet and view each picture to appreciate it. Todays visit had more in common with being at Camden Market.All in all a very disappointing experience"
"Written January 10, 2012",Truly a once in a lifetime experience.,"Visited the National Gallery on 28th December, spending the afternoon there while waiting for our timed ticket for the Da Vinci exhibition.  The galleries are extensive and we had sore feet by the time we made it down to the exhibition, despite only seeing a fraction of what was on display.The Da Vinci exhibition was amazing.  The audio guide was the best £3.50 I've spent in a long time.  The paintings were awesome and seeing them collected together was even better than I expected.  The rooms were extremely crowded but somehow, we managed to see it all. The most surprising thing for me was how fabulous all the sketches were.  I was glad I'd taken my glasses as they were so intricate and detailed. And I had no idea the Queen owned so many of them.The only disappointing aspect was that there was no information telling us that the exhibition film was open to everyone and we could have seen it earlier in the afternoon.  As it was we took so long going round the exhibition that we hadn't left enough time for it and sadly, missed it altogether.  Since we'd travelled down from Scotland specifically for the exhibition, we are hardly likely to get the chance to see it before it ends. If you get the chance, don't miss this - it is an amazing, unique experience."
"Written December 5, 2011",Boring,Visit was ok but more enjoyed the performers outside than the paintings inside.
"Written November 2, 2011",London's greatest guided tours,"You do not have to be an avid art fan to be impressed byt the sheer grandeur of both the paintings and the place itself. A visit to the National Gallery will add to your understanding of  art, life as an artist and how paintings are made. There are two absolutely outstanding guided tours daily, free of charge. Probably the best guides I have ever encountered. You will leave after an intense 50-minute-tour with information on artists, paintings, motifs, colours, myths and legends etc. Extremely worthwhile. I place I recommend to my ESL students as well just for the guided talks."
"Written September 3, 2011",a suprise,"We know nothng about art but thoroughly enjoyed our visit having seen a few paintings and artists that we recognised There was also a Norwegian exhition on at the time and we found a few paintings that we really enjoyed. We are not at all epxerts but enjoyed marvelling at what can be achieved!!A short walk away was the 'The Harp' which is an immense pub for real ale wth good wine also, a real point to drop after a trip around a gallery!!! We sat there for hours discussing what we had seen. All in all a good place to spend some time. We willl definately go back to the bits we missed."
"Written August 29, 2011",So much beauty is priceless...,"Just to be able to sit in front of the Virgin of the Rocks by Leonardo da Vinci and all other amazing paintings by Michelangelo, Monet, Van Gogh and many others is pricelss and fills your soul with beauty. Furthermore, there is a lovely coffee place and the entrance is free. I just wish rude and ignorant visitors did not try to take pictures of the paintings with flash when the guard leave for a few minutes. These pieces of art are very precious, unique, and belong to all of us, so show some respect and culture and DO NOT TAKE PHOTOS WITH FLASH - buy a postcard instead. The photo will look bad anyway! If you see somebody trying to take a photo with flash, I would like to start the ""embarrass him/her"" campaign - tell them they should not be doing that out loud so that the entire room can ear and notice the ignorant visitor or go and report them to the guard of that room."

"Written March 29, 2011",The best art museum in the world,"London's National Gallery is not only well located and architecturally attractive.  It is also one of the largest art collections in the world, and one of the best organized museums I have visited.  Every painting is accompanied by information on the painter, the origin, and its symbolic meaning. It is simply marvelous! I have visited it over 10 times, and my favourite painting is The Execution of Lady Jane Grey.  It a the full-size portrait of the girl who was queen of England for only a few days before she was executed in the 17th century.  You can almost touch the velvet on her dress!"
"Written June 17, 2010",So Much To See!,"The National Gallery in London is, quite simply, massive. I recommend spending a pound on one of the guides, as it was tricky to navigate. They are available in several different languages and show the layout of the gallery, with all the rooms numbered and named according to how the paintings are categorised. I didn't try the audio guides, but they are available for a fee. Entry to the museum itself is free although they do encourage a donation. There is a coat room for storing bags, nice clean public toilets, and several areas to eat.  Rather than eating at the gallery however, I went to one of the chain stores across the road (pret a manger) and got some sandwiches to eat outside in Trafalgar Square, then went back into the gallery for another wander. It's a lot cheaper to do that than eat at the gallery, and the atmosphere in the square is amazing.The variety of paintings is excellent, with many well known artists such as Van Gogh (my personal favourite), Renoir, Monet, Manet, Botticelli, Rembrandt and Turner. You can find out information about exhibits and events on the website: http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/The gallery is situated in Trafalgar Square - if you're travelling by tube, the nearest station is Charing Cross."
"Written March 2, 2010",The best art museum in Western Europe,"Not only is the National Gallery full of marvellous paintings and sculptures, they are perfectly organized by centuries, countries, and art schools, and each painting presents a side note containing ample information for visitors to understand what the artist wanted to express.  It is a marvellous museum!  Also, its location is great, right on Trafalgar Square, and if you walk to the right of the museum you can get to the National Portrait Gallery in less than 5 minutes.  I have visited the National Gallery over 10 times, and every time I go to London, I go back.  It is so beautiful!"

"Written December 8, 2009",Disappointing Service for Tea at National Gallery Dining room,"I recently went with my mother in law to tea at the National Gallery Dining Rooms and we were quite disappointed with the service.  The food itself was just fine, but the waiter was quite rushed and took quite a while to come take the order and then we never saw him again until we nudged him for the check.  No additional water for the tea was brought and I certainly don't think he earned the requisite 15% tip.  Definitely would try someplace else in the future.  Having made a reservation, the seating itself all went smoothly."

Then you get out and eat a pizza. In Uffizi and Louvre you do't have this option.."
"Written February 13, 2009",A must !,"National Gallery is a must if you have even the slightest interest on painting and history of art. There are a lot of very well-known pieces here, and a lot of other not so known pieces, that are important and a joy to see non the less. It is a pleasant surprise to see that here, there is a lot of English art too, as in lots of other London museums, you can see exibits from cultures from all over the world, but not England its self !!!You need days to explore the Gallery, so maybe its better to focus on one wing at the time, or take a hight light tour fitst, if your time is limited!Main exibitions entrance is free, and staff here is in general very polite. Some donation should be done, to help keep it free and to maintain all these magnificent pieces of art!I will definately visit again when back to London!"

In response to the NG's email today offering a 25 percent discount at the shop, I planned to buy a bunch of Xmas gifts and something I have had an eye on for some time. Well, I couldn't sign in with my current emails/account, or set up a new one. After half an hour of frustration, I phoned. No one takes calls in membership, or the shop. I left a message with the general enquiry line. A woman called back, kept speaking over me before I finished a single question or comment, then told me she would terminate me because I was shouting. I am hard of hearing and because she had her headphone on or spoke lowly, I couldn't hear her well and I naturally adjust my voice to the volume I would like other people to address me. I took a deep breath and asked to speak to a supervisor. She said she was a supervisor. I asked her name. I asked her to allow me to speak with someone else. I was very calm. She slammed down the phone. The NG doesn't have staff. All the other galleries -- Royal Academy, British Museum, the Tates, are buzzing again. The Tate Modern was packed two weekends ago. When I went to the NG, I saw a total of maybe 60 visitors and I walked right across the second floor. The Poussin exhibit had maybe maximum 5 other people. Yet this so-called supervisor was so rude--when I was responding to the NG because it contacted me. She did not help me one bit and was lazy, sarcastic, and arrogant. I have several disabilities, and have a recent cancer diagnosis. I don't need to be treated like trash. The NG should get some professional staff. When I called back again to actually get someone to help, no one returned my call. No one there to help me make a purchase. Fine. Great. I have decided to cancel my membership and never purchase even a coffee from the place. They are obliged by the Equality Act of 2010 to make reasonable adjustments for disabled visitors. I could not even speak to this woman. THE NG VIOLATED ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO HELP THE DISABILED WITH ACCESS. If this is a supervisor, then the NG is not the place for me and I would caution others with disabilities against expecting any compassion or that staff at the NG will even follow their legal obligations. Their Poussin exhibition is not a must-see. And when I visited on a Tues afternoon, the NG was so somber, like a morgue. I visited the Tate Britain on weekdays over the past few months and it was busy. Hope the NG staff like basking in their loneliness and solitude. Ruined my day . Upset me for no reason except that I wanted to buy something from them."
"Written November 15, 2021",Poussin and the Dance - fabulous exhibition,"Poussin and the Dance is one of three major exhibitions in London this autumn and probably my favourite of the three (the others are Franz Hals, the Male Portraits and Royal Academy Summer Exhibition).  The story goes that the young Poussin went to Rome to study classical forms and fell in love with the female figures dancing in marble on a frieze at Villa Borghese.  What he did then was nothing short of astonishing.  He has somehow brought the movement of the women in marble to life in paint to which he has added large dollops of drunken revelry.  This must have raised a few eyebrows at the time!  Dance to the Music of Time closes the exhibition with Poverty, Labour, Wealth and Pleasure linked in an endless circle, an old man playing a harp and a putti counting down time with an hourglass.  Some critics seem to have found this depressing and others tacky.  I thought it was a fabulous exhibition!  It’s on till 2nd January…"

"Written August 6, 2020",National Gallery- an inspiring visit to Titian exhibition and more,"National Gallery- an inspiring visit to Titian exhibition and more763243177The gallery has just reopened after the Covid19 lockdown. We were lucky to be there early on and booked to see the Titian Exhibition. Getting tickets means using their website- worked well for us. Be sure to turn up in good time however done come too early either.The gallery has good measures in place to cope with Covid19The Titian exhibitions had been affected by the lockdown. Fascinating to see these famous paintings painted over several years-and transported across Europe in the 16th century. No HGV lorries in those days!Worth looking for the National Gallery You tube video before you go as it explains so much more about the paintings.Then onto the main galleries and there are various routes to follow.I was particularly struck by 2 - The view of Delft after the explosion of 1654 and the Long Road. It served to remind me that disasters of all types have happened over the centuries. Also if life feels like we are all following a long road into the distance then for those who walked or rode a horse or donkey then lockdown was a real thingTheir shop is open. The cafe was open for takeaways only when we visitedFinally enjoy Trafalgar Square nearby - it is generally very crowded but for us the lack of crowds, clean air and clear skies was part of the experience"
"Written July 26, 2020",You realise how amazing the collection is when you haven't been allowed to see it,"You don't appreciate what you have until you don't have it any more.  Well done therefore to the National Gallery to opening up in a sensitive way and allowing us to enjoy their great treasures again. Our visit started with the exhibition 'Titian: Love, Desire, Death' which opened earlier in the year and than almost immediately closed because of the lockdown. In 1551, Prince Philip of Spain (the future King Phillip II) commissioned Titian to produce a series of paintings showing classical myths mostly from Ovid's 'Metamorphoses'.All six paintings, which are now spread across the world, were reunited in the National Gallery just before lockdown and have been here waiting for visitors to return.  I bet Titian never thought that the people viewing his paintings would all be wearing facemasks.....From there you exit into a room which highlights the quality of the National Gallery's own collection of Titians, alongside other artists such as Michelangelo, Parmigianio and Sabastiono del Piombo.The Gallery now has three routes for visitors to follow. Ours took us through the newly-refurbished Gallery 32 with its dazzling colour and lighting scheme past many familiar friends.  It did however make the adjacent rooms look a little dowdy.  An enjoyable visit, ending with the shop where we bought a face mask with Van Gogh's Sunflowers - one of this year's fashion accessories.... masks are going to be with us for a while."
"Written July 18, 2020",Lots to see even if not all is open,We came to see the Titian exhibition which is momentous as the paintings in it have not been together for some 500 years but it only takes 30 minutes to see so we spent another 90 minutes walking around the galleries. We were told 50 percent is open but that is still plenty.
"Written July 14, 2020",Interesting ,One of the best art galleries I’ve ever been to-really interesting array of paintings sculptures and artwork. Interesting for everyone as they are so so many rooms and many different artists included.
"Written December 30, 2020",Cultural visit,Everything is well neat for covid-19  times and cafe is out of bounds and shop good paintings too😀in this London sight
"Written December 23, 2020",Very calm and enjoyable experience due to lack of other vistors,"My second time visiting the National Gallery was very different to my first visit back in 2014, with the lack of other visitors being the biggest difference. I had booked a ticket to see the General /free entry galleries on a day off work a few hours before the UK Government announced another COVID-19 lockdown happening by the end of the day. Trafalgar Square was empty of people (and pigeons) - it was almost shocking. My ticket for the gallery was for 10.30AM and I almost had the gallery to myself. I was allowed into the gallery straight away after my ticket was scanned. Masks were mandatory, all backpacks were worn at the front and everyone was required to sanitise their hands. The gallery floor is marked with one way markers, and all museum staff made a point of redirecting people who went the wrong way. The shop and the cafe were still open to visitors. I had initially hoped to visit the special exhibitions another day, but I guess that will have to wait until the gallery is allowed to open again. Never in my life did I think I’d be able to stand in any of the rooms in the National Gallery and take a clear picture with less than 10 people in it. I was able to stand in front of super popular paintings from Monet, Van Gogh, Degas for ages…I stood in front of the massive horse picture by George Stubbs of Whistlejacket and was able to move back and forwards as I pleased to examine the painting. The COVID-19  outbreak has devastated London tourism, but the significant lack of people meant my trip to the Gallery was incredibly nice - not to be jostled by other visitors, and a very calm and peaceful experience."
"Written December 5, 2020",A bit of culture!,Saw the Artimesia exhibit and Sun. Both excellently curated. Artemisia was very moving and such an evocative exhibition.
"Written November 22, 2020",Titian's poesie...absolutely exquisite,"With COVID-19 restrictions in place, we were able to visit the stunning Titan Love, Desire, and Death exhibition without the crowds.

"Written October 29, 2020",Accessible Art,"Only thing stopping it being a '5' was the slightly chaotic queuing system outside in the rain. Once inside, everything was really good. The vastness of the galleries plus making pre-booking compulsory means everyone is nicely spaced out (distance-wise !) and so very Covid regs compliant. You can follow a variety of trails keeping to one-way flows. Plenty of staff available to guide. And then there's the awesome paintings themselves - so many great works - Monet, Constable, Turner etc. And it's free.The 'Sin' Exhibition was a little limp and over-priced coffees"

"Written February 27, 2020",This is an unexpected journey through history,"This is a free entrance museum and audio recorder available £5.This building in itself is fantastic - look up at the ceilings inside some of the rooms .We're not huge art lovers , but can't express how wonderful  the museum has cleverly arranged each room with art work dedicated to the different times of era's and brings history to life. The art work shows the way of life /clothes etc of that particular time - without being boring. Using the audio information is easy as numbered to select the numbered art work  in different rooms to get an  idea about the artists intentions when creating the master pieces.Too much to go through audio one by one - you'll be there all week! Just walk around each room and pick two or three you are drawn to and look and listen --you'll get hooked!!!Famous master pieces are on display - a must to see and we unexpectedly felt very special to be somehow, in the presence of all these talented famous painters .Highly recommend , but very busy if it's raining !!!"

"Written November 22, 2019",The only Place I Liked in London,"And the only reason I would ever consider going back to London would be to see the National Gallery again. It was the one saving grace in a trip of less than billed hotel, The  Doubletree by Hilton, (who should be spinning his grave), cabbies than natter about Uber the whole time I pay for the ride, (I did not use Uber in London but now recommend that you do), and cold, aloof people who ignored you in an obvious way. The gallery is on a par with the best in the world, i.e. The Louvre and the Uffizi. It has space to enjoy the art and comfortable seating for those paintings that you want to linger with. It is the only thing that would give me a reason to brave London again."

A small oil on oak (26 x 19 cm). I love to visit museums having appointment with one picture only. But the red-turbaned man was missing... moved to V&A (Victoria and Albert), so the guards said, oh, for the last 8 years now, yes, such exchanges happen at the highest level. To make up for this absence, I asked the guards what their favorite painting was, please, in a spontaneous way. A lady-guard - looking like Karen Blixen in her African years - took me to the Murillo Room. And a very tall long-haired colleague mentioned Rembrandt self-portrait at age 63, es the one facing  the other self-portrait at 34. At 63, quite frail, subdued, unique, human, your neighbour. So I went from room to room, from mind to mind..."

We spent almost the entire day here meandering through each room and making a point of sitting down to really study some of the pieces. It was nice to see young artists and students in the museum doing their own sketches. There is a small restaurant area to relax in and a gift shop, which is really nice. If you are pressed for time read up on what you want to see before going in so you can plan your visit efficiently. But ideally I think any art enthusiast should plan 3 to 4 hours here.

"Written November 18, 2019",A must see,Excellent exhibition. Very friendly and helpful staff who explained when necessary. We would difinately go again. 
"Written November 14, 2019",Pop-in it’s free. ,"Only takes 15 minutes, each time I pass. This time I took the kids and they recognised loads of scribbles and splashes. However they were keen to spend all of my money in the fantastic gift shop. Great haven from the West End crowds. "
"Written November 14, 2019",Evening with art,This is a wonderful art museum with many priceless pieces. Their late hours on Friday helped us fill the evening with a meaningful visit.  And admission is free!
"Written December 11, 2019",Interesting visit,"we visited for a short visit and managed to see most of the must see exhibits, a privilege to see them "
"Written December 11, 2019","Good choice, not the Best","Good choice, not in the best galleries i've seen probaply not the must choice if you must watch one or two museums galleries in London but big variety of paintings that covers a great deal of time."
"Written December 10, 2019",Art for Art sake..,"I'm writing this review because I seriously considered that spending a few hours looking at old art might not be a good use of my valuable holiday time in a place where there is so much to do.I was so wrong. The Natioanl gallery should be considered to be on the main tourist list along with the physical attractions like Big Ben and The Tower of London etc. In my new opinion it is an essentail place to visit on a trip to London. Don't get caught up in the thing that it is just old Art.  Treat it as a pictorial overview of   Europe.  Much of the art is relevant to places you may have visited or may wish to visit.  For instance Canelettos paintings of Venice show a Venice with buildings the same as you will see today, but the differences in the detail are fascinating.  The water level for instance.  This can be seen as considerably lower than today, and it is wonderful how well he has portrayed the scenes of life from hundreds of years ago.There are too many examples of breathtaking painting and Scultural skill to mention them all here,  but to help you move around the gallery is laid out in time periods, so you if time is a factor you an visit a particular era.  It's a place to visit more than once, so if you are lucky enough to visit Londan again, just pick up from where you left, off or go back to your favourites.So much can be learned about an era through the art of the time, and this gallery allows you to become absorbed in the paintings from a period. To allow comparisons in style and shear artistic brilliance.The location is very central, beside Trafaglar Square. Ideal for a quiet break from the rushing around.  Soak up the Culture, the History and the Artists opinions of life in a wonderful pleasant environment.  Stay for a short time, or if you have plenty of it, stay for the day.  You won't run out of things to see.We'll be back"
"Written December 10, 2019",good and bad,"Tried to join as a member of the National Gallery.  The staff member and colleague were incapable. We gave up after 15 minutes.The Leonard exhibit was outrageously price and clearly not worth visiting.on the other hand, the Gaugin exhibit was terrific.  Well curated; the audio guide was well designed and spoken;  the written guide was also a wonderful adjunct."
"Written December 9, 2019",Excellent Museum!,"Never been before despite being a Londoner of 56 yrs young! Free entry, not mobbed and cool temperatures in galleries and seats to contemplate the paintings from afar. I was able to see all the collections I wanted but did end up going round in circles at one point as the room numbering is not clear. People taking selfies with the better known paintings as usual got a bit annoying but they soon move on. Didn't use cafe but toilets were clean.So many good paintings by many very famous artists. There is a tree tour in the afternoon each day that is great- we really learned a lot on the tour."
"Written December 8, 2019",Da Vinci Exhibit ... totally engaging and unique approach to one piece of art,"This is a focussed approach to one piece of art, The Virgin of the Rocks. It begins with an unusual opening in a room with indecipherable texts displayed in a mirrored boxed presentation that only became apparent once I figured out that you have to approach the mirrored boxes at an angle from the side to be able to read the texts which da Vinci had written in reverse. An interesting display in the man's own words that opens the viewer up to the man's genius. We are then treated to a 'studio' and a video that allows you to consider the work's composition and the findings of the restauration. Another room allows you to experiment with the effects of light and shadow and to understand the interplay of the two on objects. The final room is the piece de resistance with the insertion of the painting into a virtual remake of the chapel in Italy where it was originally hung. This last piece had me mesmerized and I stayed through two replays just to absorb it all. Not your typical exhibition and I was glad of it. An immersive learning experience that will enlighten you if you let it. Leave your expectations at the door and enjoy!"
"Written December 8, 2019",Gaugin exhibit,Run to this exhibit - one of the best done exhibits - easily accessible with full explanations - even comes with a book - AVOID THE DAVINCI exhibit - waste of time - 
"Written December 7, 2019",Amazing collection ,"The National Gallery hosts an amazing collection, the building is beautiful and it’s easy to move through the rooms. Visiting the permanent collection is free, though a donation is encouraged (and quite fair, considering what’s inside). I’d recommend to at least buy the map. It’s only a 2 pounds and it’s a guarantee that you won’t miss any of the most important masterpieces. "
"Written December 28, 2019",Excellent Gauguin Exhibition,"It costs £18 to enter this exhibition but I thought, for once, it was well worth it.  The purpose of such a show surely is both to entertain and to enlighten.  This exhibition scores well against both criteria.  I had been to the Gauguin at Tate Modern a few years ago and was expecting to see more of his Polynesian paintings.  Far from it: you see a complete range of work and really get to understand what drove the artist.  I had not apreciated, for example, that he was self-taught and that he gone through a whole range of styles and subject matter before we end up with the familiar portraits of Tahitian ""savages"" (as he saw his subjects) when he was searching for some sort of idiolised purity.  What really comes through is the completely egotistical approach he took both to his art and his life in general.There are seven rooms in total, with both paintings, drawings and some ceramics or wood carvings.  The interpretation is excellent, both in each room to set the scene and in the little book which gives a more detailed description of each exhibit.  Do take the book or you will miss a lot of fascinating detail.  I particularly liked the dead pan humour of the author,  I won't spoil it, but do read about painting 17: Young Breton Woman, 1889...The exhibition is accompanied by an excellent short film.  In total, you will need to set aside between one and two hours to do the whole show justice.  We went at noon on a Friday and, while busy, it was very comfortable to see each exhibit.Well done to The National Gallery!"
"Written December 26, 2019","National Gallery in London, UK","We visited this museum at the beginning of September. It is not my first time and I love that, even if it's not a huge museum, it houses so many masterpieces. Entrance is free, and if you wish you can leave a donation."
"Written December 25, 2019",Easy access to great artwork,Don’t miss this if you are here. It’s easy to enter. It’s free. And there are some amazing and famous paintings here.  
"Written December 23, 2019",Leonardo as you've never known him,"There has been some adverse comment about the exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci's 'Virgin of the Rocks'. The entry fee of around £20 may seem steep, but you will never have experienced a show like this before -- especially at London's National Gallery. The projections of the altar that hosted the painting are extraordinary. Not only visuals but music as well. For an exhibition about a single painting, it has exceptional diversity."
"Written December 23, 2019",Incredible that this is free to all,Fabulous place full of amazing art I never tire of seeing. It is unbelievable that there is no charge for entry when you think how much we have to pay when we go aboard. Fantastic staff welcoming and helpful.
"Written December 19, 2019",Leonardo exhibit a rip off in my opinion,The National Gallery is a jewel and its location and the fact that it is free makes me feel a little badly about dinging their Leonardo exhibit but I will.  The exhibit is comprised of four rooms of which only one has any meat to it.  In that room they digitally remove layers of paint to see what was underneath.  It is interesting to see how Leonardo revised the painting.  It is just not 20 Pounds worth of interesting.  One room has a nice artsy digital outline of its original location and a third room is a peculiar set of viewing cubes with sayings from Leonardo written in mirror language.  If they had asked me to make a donation to the overall museum- I would have- but I felt a little taken advantage of by their entry feel for this Leonardo exhibit.  It is way over priced.
"Written December 18, 2019",Wonderful collection and ambience.,We have been here many times and it is always different on every visit.  One of the many great (and free) attractions in London.
"Written December 17, 2019","Fantastic experience, and all for free","I'm not a great gallery goer, and I've never been here before, but I found myself in London with a day to spare, and a desire to see some of the great English artists that I've always admired from afar.  I'm so glad I did.  It was quite literally awesome to see paintings from the world's greatest artists up close, and I mean really close; you can get within inches to really see the detail.  And what detail there is in Canaletto's paintings of Venice and London, incredible.  So I got to see the Turners and Constables, etc, which is what I was after, but I was also surprised to see so many well known paintings from the great French artists.A great way to while away a few hours."
"Written December 16, 2019",Uncaring,"I visited the Gauguin exhibition in November. Prior to my visit I emailed the NG to ask a couple of questions about the exhibition. I received an automatic acknowledgement so I know my email was received, but I never did get a reply. However I did attend. I am a pensioner who has always loved art, and I always leave a gallery feeling enriched because of the art I've seen. I was surprised at the extortionate entry fee, but even more surprised that there was not a concession for seniors; even a token amount of say, £2.00 off would have been welcome. In addition, I had to pay extra to leave my bag and coat. I found the collection of paintings disappointing, although I acknowledge that the publicity did say the exhibition consisted of portraits, I was just surprised they were so ..... boring, but that is purely my own view. I compare this visit to my experience of visiting a wonderful Joan Miro exhibition at MOMA in Valencia in 2018, the entry fee was €4. I went to the kiosk to pay and the attendant said 'no charge for seniors' he didn't ask for any evidence of my age, and I'm not particularly that elderly looking. After my visit to the Gauguin exhibition I emailed the NG customer services to say how I felt. Again, I haven't yet received any sort of reply. I think the NG management need a jolly good shake-up. I'd love to meet the team and discuss with them about what they think their job is, because they don't seem to have a clue. So saying, I expect they would probably cite a funding issue, which I can understand to some extent as I believe the Department have made budget cuts, but I don't believe that my poor experience can be completely justified by simply a tight cash flow."
"Written December 15, 2019","Splendid,",Beautifully arranged paintings with plenty of seating well positioned for quiet reflection. Free entry with only a donation requested.
"Written November 6, 2019",See Art But Know What You Are Looking For,"The museum is huge with many masters to see. We found a list of the must see and then researched the room it was found in. It took us 2 hours to see 30 pieces that were scattered throughout their 66 rooms. Of course, we found other beautiful works not on the list but the list kept us going forward!"
"Written November 6, 2019",Another inspiring visit to National Gallery,"We have visited National Gallery on one of our Sunday day out in Lonion and it was a very inspiring visit. We have attended Spanish painter Sorolla exhibition and it was very interesting. We later had lunch in the cafe and it offers great coffees and nice voice of cakes, snacks and hot meals"
"Written November 6, 2019",Superb,Amazing display from every famous or other artists on view. Very tiring but worth it. A little confusing getting orientated to see most things however the staff were very knowledgeable in helping you out. Highly recommended. 
"Written November 6, 2019",A must visit gallery,"A great place to see fine portraits, paintings and there is always extra expositions available. It's free of charge. A lovely well worthy way of spending few hours if you are by Trafalgar Square."
"Written November 5, 2019",One of the world's great art museums,"There are few museums that can rank with the National Gallery for the width and quality of collection.  Rooms dedicated to artists, and the greatest of their kind.  And unlike the British Museum, it is approachable and manageable on a single visit.  If you like art, you must go.  Eat in the restaraunt if you have the time; it's better than scrambling outside for a place for lunch."
"Written November 5, 2019",Fine Portraits and paintings,If you are at Trafalgar Square then you should not miss this National Gallery. It is free of charge and collection is really beautiful.
"Written November 5, 2019",Worth a visit,A couple of hours well spent on a damp day. Plenty to see in a leisurely fashion. Cafe and shops available for a rest on your way round. Free entry also.
"Written November 4, 2019",Free!,"The National Gallery is huge and free. Although, the staff do try to pressure you to make a donation of $10. The selection of art definitely caught my attention. There were so many rooms and so many people. I only spent about 45 minutes browsing before I got overwhelmed by it all. The museum is open later (‪until 9pm‬) on Fridays so that may be your best bet for beating the crowds."
"Written November 4, 2019",GrEAT !,If you an art lover this is the place to be!A huge collection of paintings and easy access to the museum.Dont miss it!
"Written November 4, 2019",Must see,"This gallery is amazing. Not only does it have a fantastic collection of art its well lit, comfortably holds a number of guests and it’s free to enter. I’m glad we came. "
"Written November 14, 2019",Obscenely Expensive Cafe,"This is not a review of the gallery, which is spectacular. The cafe on the other hand...Paid £4.80 for a SMALL coke, not even a regular sized glass bottle. I ended up paying £6 overall, also buying a bag of popcorn, which was more appropriately priced. £5 for less than a glass of coke?? Ridiculous."
"Written November 13, 2019",If you're into paintings...,"It has beautiful artwork and some not as popular but still famous paintings that are worth seeing, despite being a free entry it wasn't as crowded as we expected. We could move around freely without bumping into people. All in all a good experience"
"Written November 12, 2019",Nice Galleries,"The museum was free to enter but they do ask for a donation. Which is pretty standard for many museums. The art work is displayed beautifully. Being able to see works from Monet, Van Gogh, Dagah, and many others was so exciting. They cafe was also very nice and affordable. "
"Written November 11, 2019","Perfect place to relax, expand your horizons and maybe learn a little about life.","I had some spare time in London and chose to spend it here. I chose to look at the free part of the Gallery and it was a real experience. It was not too crowded and you could just sit and look a particular painting for as long as you wanted. I was quite tired, not in a hurry and that visit will be repeated."
"Written November 11, 2019","Leonardo exhibition poor, all padding and little substance","We have previously enjoyed visiting the National Gallery on our trips to London, but the Leonardo exhibition is poor, its all padding and little substance. Very disappointing."
"Written November 10, 2019",So Many Paintings!,"Again this museum has so many famous paintings and artists it is not to be missed.  Be ready to dodge the large picture-taking tourist groups but it is worth your time.  The cafe was lovely too.  I just can't get over that the buildings themselves are truly amazing and deserve to be shown off, and that admission is free.  What a gift!"
"Written November 9, 2019","FREE, yeah","After visiting Paris, it was nice that some of the London attractions were FREE. Cant beat that. They do ask for a donation. So not as free as I thought. Its located on Trafalgar square which is a very happening place. At the time we went, there was some sort of Arab protest. It must be a place to do such things. Art was nice and varied in interest. Rooms were labeled numerically which made it nice to go from room to room without getting lost."
"Written November 8, 2019",Another memorable visit,"One of my all time favorite museums--the collection is phenomenal & curated beautifully.  I'm particularly interested in pre/post-renaissance, mannerism & Venetian art--the National Gallery has so many fabulous masterpieces.  As the museum is so large it helps to have a game plan to see certain works or genres, though you can have a perfectly wonderful time meandering as well."
"Written November 7, 2019",Overwhelming,There are so many terrific paintings in the National Gallery that one has to come back again and again - it is just too much to grap at once each time... ;-)
"Written November 7, 2019",Excellent,"What a beautiful place with some of the finest works a must do when you in London,the art work is breathtaking and a real treat absolutely wonderful so interesting,its very impressive a real delight to see all of the different masterpieces."
"Written December 4, 2019",Stunning...and exhausting,"One masterpiece after another. What a great assemblage of European art.  I wasn't sure how long I'd be there so I didn't get an audio guide, but even wandering around haphazardly for 2 hours, I was blown away and trying to find time on my schedule to go back. My suggestion is spend lots of time there, do some research and make a plan before you go."
"Written December 4, 2019",Wish we had more time,"Fantastic visit! You need to put aside at the least 3 hours if you want to see the highlights, however, it's easily a 4-6 hour day.  We only had certain time allotted for the visit, so we tried to limit ourselves to the highlights.  We kept getting distracted by other beautiful pieces of art, making our visit a little longer than the 2 hours we had planned.  It was all good fun though and I wouldn't have had it any other way."
"Written December 2, 2019",To the Sackler Gallery!,"You could spent your entire holiday here- and it would be time well spent.For those with of you with limited time, ask a member of staff to direct you toward the Sackler gallery, the space which houses some of the most famous British art, such as JMW Turner’s ‘Fighting Temeraire’."
"Written December 2, 2019",Leonardo Exhibit is one to miss,"I entered the National Gallery, which is ordinarily gratis thanks to UK taxpayers, and paid an extra GBP 18.00 for “Leonardo,” what I thought was a special exhibit of Leonardo da Vinci’s works. Instead the “Leonardo” exhibit is a kindergarten tour of manufactured perspectives and views Leonardo “might” have seen, capped by a single image. What a scam. The National Gallery should not stoop so low, dumbing down art and manufacturing hype, just to raise a few extra bucks. Skip this bogus paid extra and instead tour the other halls full of real masterpieces for free. "
"Written November 30, 2019",Great collection - good wheelchair access,"I visit the National Gallery regularly, most recently yesterday.The collection is amazing - high quality pictures from the last 800 years. Pretty well the whole building is wheelchair accessible. Some of the doors between rooms are heavy and none are power operated but almost always an attendant is quickly available to help."
"Written November 27, 2019",Amazing museum ,Great museum! A must see when visiting London. It has a wonderful collection of European paintings from 13th to 18th centuries. Spacious halls and a beautiful building house paintings from the top artists.
"Written November 27, 2019",Extremely disappointing ,I thought the Gaugin exhibition was overpriced and overrated. I have seen better in permanent collections elsewhere. The Leonardo experience was shameful. What a waste of an afternoon. Whoever planned this should be sacked. I want my money back. 
"Written November 25, 2019",Classic Art Museum in London,This is England’s national art museum with its most important collections of old masters and impressionist paintings. Often has good tours and exhibitions for extra charge. Has two good restaurants as well with the cafe reasonably priced.
"Written November 24, 2019",Use the audio guide/map for highlights,"The audio guide and accompanying map saved hours of searching for the paintings I wants to see. Even walking to “my” selections, I stopped and awed at scores that were not on my intended list. Rooms are numbered, and museum is easy to navigate. Highly impressive collection of world renowned art from many eras and genres of artists.  VanGoh’s “Sunflowers” is cheery, of course, but hard to catch a glimpse with all the selfie-taking buts in front of it.  Full room of Rembrandt, full room of French impressionists-1/2 was Monet; Picasso had a lot of wall space. Cezanne, 3 Caravaggio, Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo (some unfinished ones), etc....a spectacular gallery."

"Written November 2, 2019",The Arnolfini Portrait,"It's been a dream of mine for several years to see this particular painting and the self portrait of Jan van Eyck.  It was very easy to find the right gallery where the paintings were hanging and the line was quick and free.  We of course donated to the museum, but that alleviates the lines and you can choose to donate the amount you wish."

"Written November 2, 2019",Great tourist attraction,"Great museum to visit on a wet London day. You do n;t need to be an art expert to enjoy walking through the museum. Free of charge, £2 for a map which is very helpful as you can get lost"
"Written November 1, 2019",Wonderful Gauguin Portraits exhibition ,"A high quality show with an excellent free guide to the paintings and drawings, enabling the elimination of the wall mounted descriptions that are usually unreadable by reason of the press of people and the small size font. A significant improvement. At £5 I thought the audio guide was overpriced and duly declined. An accompanying 15 minute film was excellent and was viewed after the show was viewed but could be seen prior. Try not to miss, many of the paintings are unlikely to return to London (and probably the UK) in the next several years, if ever. "
"Written November 1, 2019","Great free museum, with plenty to see",We’ll definitely be coming back with sketch pads next time! Loved the shop for quality gifts too. Spent a few hours wandering the exhibits and particularly enjoyed the Van Gogh!

"Written October 29, 2019",when it's raining in London,It was pouring rain on our first day in London we did not want to stay in the hotel. we went around and discovered this place by accident to avoid the rain. We spent atleast 4 hours just enjoying the paintings. We loved it very much. 4 hours is not enough to enjoy everything.beautiful building inside and out. the facilities are clean as well and they are free. highly recommended
"Written October 29, 2019",beautiful place.,Lovely to walk around and free admission so never feel like I must see everything in one visit and can come back again.  We arrived around 12:30 and not too busy for a Wednesday in October.  Well laid out and and you can pick up a map for a couple of  pounds. Will definitely visit on our next trip to London. 
"Written October 28, 2019",How can you beat free?,"A terrific gallery worthy of being on your ""must see"" list while in London. Some of the world's best art for free! You could spend the better part of a day here if you had the time. Particularly a good stop if the weather turns nasty."

"Written October 27, 2019",Crowded and exhibits on loan detracted from the experience,"It's free and one can see some very famous paintings, but the crowds and the pieces that were out on loan really dampened my enthusiasm.  We spent less time than planned there.  We saw what we wanted to see and left.  It really wasn't a place to linger and reflect."
"Written October 27, 2019",An unparalleled experience,"We had limited time at the National Gallery, but oh my it was such a delight to be able to roam those halls.  The building in and of itself is gorgeous and breathtaking on its own.  Add the pristine preserved centuries old paintings that are expertly curated and displayed and it is an awe-inspiring experience.  To see the works of Monet, Manet, Van Gogh, Titan, Cezzane, among the other greats is such a privilege and unparalleled experience.  Even better was to see young children sketching paintings and in amazement at the works before them as they listened to expert curators.  Perhaps the best part is that admission is free, although you will be heavily bombarded by employees at the entrance to the exhibits to provide a donation.  A small and worthwhile price to pay for an unparalleled opportunity..."
"Written October 26, 2019",Beautiful Museum,"This is a lovely museum, lot of wonderful paintings and worth an afternoon visit on a rainy day.  Most of it in on one floor and can be seen in a few hours.  Had lunch at the cafe which was also surprisingly good being a museum restaurant."

We walked past the West End shows and through a couple of squares and it took 30 minutes to locate the gallery. However, once there it was spectacular.  "
"Written October 23, 2019",Day Visit,I combined this visit with a visit to the RA. Unfortunately the major exhibition did not start until the next day so i will return at a later date. I think the regular exhibits are still worth seeing and I would recommend becoming a member if possible.Well worth it
"Written October 23, 2019",Amazing artwork. Masterpieces everywhere you look,The National Gallery in London is a treasure trove of artwork. I recommend either having a guide or renting the audio tour as it is too much to take in without some sort of guide. Allow yourself plenty of time. Take breaks at one of the inside places to eat and enjoy.
"Written October 23, 2019",A Must See,"A wonderful museum, with free entry and an extensive collection with a superb educative theme. One of the best I have ever visited. If going as an adult it is an exhilarating experience and if you are going with kids then it will be an experience they will never forget. Right from the dinosaur section, to the mammals section and the wonderful display on whales and other marine life , the museum leaves you spell bound. God number of cafeteria’s and washrooms make the experience even better. Keep 4-5 hours handy."
"Written October 22, 2019",The world of art at your feet,"It's astounding that at no charge one can walk into this wonderful gallery of paintings from up until about 1900. There are representatives from all major areas of Western art. I particularly like the Impressionists and the collection here does not disappoint. Since there is no charge to enter the gallery, you can take your time and enjoy each area without rushing, because you can come back another day to continue. "
"Written October 22, 2019",One of the best museums in the world and it's FREE.,"(Special exhibitions in the Sainsbury Wing are NOT free and can be expensive) A great museum.  If you are interested in art, you will definitely want to visit.  Food in the café is expensive.  We usually head to one of the many options around Trafalgar Square rather than eat in the Museum itself.   Nice bookshop in the Sainsbury Wing. "
"Written October 21, 2019",Easy to maneuver,"Lovely museum, easy to use and enjoy the myriad of arts.  I went specifically to see a few famous paintings and was able to do so without difficulty."
"Written October 21, 2019",I love this place,"It is a fabulous museum where you can see some major pieces from Turner, Cezanne or Van Gogh. If you don’t have a lot of time the masterpieces are in rooms 34,41,43."
"Written October 21, 2019",Amazing and free,You need a good couple of hours here to see everything because there is so much. I was amazed by the Van Goghs and Holbiens Ambassadors was stunning. The gallery is so beautiful-amazing ambience
"Written October 21, 2019",Breathtaking,"The galleries in London are free of charge, but a donation is requested. The rooms are spacious and there are benches to take a break on."
"Written October 20, 2019",A wonderful Sunday afternoon,"I was passing through London and was trying to decide how to spend my afternoon and realized that the National Gallery was within easy walking distance of my location.  I love wandering through art galleries so I jumped at the chance to visit this place that I'd heard so much about.The National Gallery did not disappoint.  Wandering through the galleries you find awe-inspiring paintings by Da Vinci (Virgin of the Rocks), Caravaggio (The Supper at Emmaus), Van Gogh (Sunflowers), Seurat (Bathers at Asnieres) to name just a few.  The gallery truly lives up to its description as one of the finest collections of paintings in the world.There is no admission charge to enter, but be prepared that you will be asked to make a donation as you enter.  Maps are available but there is a charge of 2 pounds for them.  There is a coffee bar and a cafe where you can get a coffee, sandwich, or something more substantial.  I believe that there is also a restaurant, but I did not try it.In summary, if you have a few hours you can spend at the National Gallery, I'm quite sure you will find it is time well spent.  I recommend more than 3 hours, but if you want to just hit the highlights, then 2-3 hours might be enough."
"Written October 19, 2019",Among the greatest art collections in the world,Room after room of great art works from across Europe from the 13th through the 20th centuries. Cannot be visited only once. 
"Written September 12, 2019",Good ,We took the daily guided tour and found it to be very informative and pleasant. The staff were very helpful. We found that the gallery was easy to get to using public transport.. Would recommend this attraction to anyone visitors to London. 
"Written September 11, 2019",One of this countries proper National treasures.,"One visit just isn’t enough. Pile as much cash as you can afford into the voluntary donation bins. It’s worth it to stare at the Wilton diptych, Santa Croce altarpiece, Virgin of the Rocks, Haywain...... the list goes on.Then spend all you have left in the shop. Support them. And take the kids. Places like this are how we escape."
"Written September 11, 2019",World class art,Revisited after 20years.Since visited galleries in many countries.This has to be amongst the best ( and free!) Great that all the highlights I wanted to see were close together and clearly singposted Was a weekend and still.not too busy was able to stand right next to and view even works like the Sunflowers .Helpful friendly staff too
"Written September 9, 2019",Wonderful,Wonderful museum. The building is as beautiful as the paintings! Great place to spend an afternoon. Would recommend.
"Written September 9, 2019",Confused and crowded,This is definitely not one of the great art galleries of the world. Layout is meandering. Too many madonnas from the Middle Ages. 
"Written September 8, 2019",A must do!!!,"A phenomenalMuseum where you can see all the great artists! We were not disappointed and spent a great deal of time there. If you love art as we do, this is the place for you. Highly recommend!"
"Written September 8, 2019","Calm, inspiring","The first gallery I ever visited with my baby daughter aged a few months she's now in her late teens and we are still regular visitors, although the gallery has never been busier it's still possible to find a quieter time to wonder and it's the best place to have a sit down and refreshments in the afternoon with wonderful views without the crowds."
"Written September 7, 2019",Stop in to see amazing art!,"Right in the middle of scenic Trafalgar Square!  Museums are free in London so quickly stopped by since we were in the neighborhood to see some of the collection - Van Gogh, Renoir, Monet! "
"Written September 7, 2019",Amazing collection ,This was my fourth visit and the firet for my daughter. We went straight for the impressionists and it was huge and so brilliant. Top notch if you like it like I do. So many beautiful paintings. What a delight. Don't miss. 
"Written September 7, 2019",Truly a Treasure,There is so much art to see that it can be a bit daunting.  We spent a few hours enjoying our own personal highlights.  The signage for each piece and the layout for groups of art is well done.
"Written October 19, 2019",Great to see the collections housed in the gallery,"We visited on a rainy day and were very impressed with the artwork on display, the actual building and that entry to the gallery was free!"
"Written October 18, 2019",Awesome National Gallery,"what I can say? it's amazing all the things you can visit here,with a very big range of portraits from all over the world!you cannot come in London without having a visit here.I suggest to come in the morning, less crowded.it's worth the price!"
"Written October 18, 2019",How is this place free?! ,The collection of old paintings from over the years is great. Even the building is amazing. Especially the paintings of Turner. 
"Written October 18, 2019",Underrated,While on a visit to Paris & London my wife and I visited the Louvre and other Paris museums and I must say the National Gallery is as good as any with a lot less people and free admission. Highly recommend.
"Written October 17, 2019",Beautiful architecture to match the beautiful art.,This free art gallery is well worth a self paced visit where even though the paintings may overwhelm you you can return often to visit your favourites.
"Written October 17, 2019",The always excellent National Gallery,"The setting alone, in Trafalgar Square, is always a good reason to visit the National Gallery. But its collection remains among the best anywhere. Also,  it is easy to navigate; unlike, at the moment, the Louvre, which is a huge mess, especially given the current boondoggle for viewing the Mona Lisa.  And the National still has free admission!! Highly recommended."
"Written October 16, 2019",Nice visit,We enjoyed visited the National Gallery with the artwork set out in a nice easy onto follow manner. Recommended.
"Written October 15, 2019",Works of Art!,Magnificent and old collection of art works by all the top painters / sculptors over the past 600 years. Very impressive collection. Highly recommended.
"Written October 15, 2019","Nice,We saw 2 Monet's","It is always nice to be able to visit such a great place with so many painting  by the greats, There is never enough time to see everything so many visits are necessary."
"Written October 15, 2019",Surprisingly good food,"For museum dining, the cafe and restaurant offer a wide array of food choices in a very nice space. Clean, efficient buffet style or sit down."
"Written September 7, 2019",Interesting,"Interesting at best.  As I am not an art expert, my appreciation of some of the works is limited.  As such, we went through the entire gallery.  High quality displays and content.  Not for the layman."
"Written September 6, 2019",Amazing Gallery,"Such a wonderful experience...a fantastic selection of wonderful paintings displayed in a beautiful building too.,So fortunate to be able to see such a wonderful collection. Highly recommended."
"Written September 6, 2019",A True National Treasure,This is a great gallery. Last here 18 years ago and my wife spent two days here. Not as long this time. This is well worth seeing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Written September 6, 2019",Always worth visiting,"In the heart of London's West End is the National Gallery.  With some outstanding works and conscious, regular curation - it is definitely worth a visit.The Gallery provides cloakrooms, toilet facilities and of course both shop and cafe.  Remember to donate too!"
"Written September 6, 2019",Very nice lunch venue,"Lively, good ambience, very enjoyable. It is light and airy and in a good spot. I had a very pleasant light lunch."
"Written September 5, 2019",Wonderful place,An absolute must-see right at Trafalgar square in the heart of London. Piccadilly Circus is just a few steps away.
"Written September 4, 2019","highly interesting , fascinating historical veue","thoroughly enjoyed our time here , well worth a visit , one of London hidden gems. a friend suggested we go here for a visit while staying locally "
"Written September 4, 2019",Fantastic museum to visit,"There is so much to see in this museum. You will not get tired, and the restaurant is great for lunch. Absolutely worth a visit."
"Written September 4, 2019",Great place for inspiration gathering,The national gallery is one place that I would recommend to students or people who would require some creative juice flowing. The exhibits changes over time so do check before heading down.
"Written September 4, 2019",Really special ,"There is so much art to see here, you could spend hours or days! There are of course the headliners like Van Goh, but some lesser known and just as special ones too."
"Written September 3, 2019",A national treasure,"Being able to pop into the National Gallery and see some of the worlds most famous pictures is always a pleasure, after a long day at work just ten minutes in the gallery can help to transport you to another century, country or place. Just wonderful."
"Written September 3, 2019",WORTH A VISIT,"Free entry which is great as a lot of places charge to get in. The place is very large and sprawling and a bit of a rabbit warren, so best to get a map and if there is a painting you particularly want to see, then find out where it is. Otherwise, a pleasant couple of hours strolling through looking at paintings. Not to be confused with the National Portrait Gallery which is a different museum.Also a bonus is seeing Trafalgar Square and the historical monuments there. "
"Written September 3, 2019",Visit often but keep it short and sweet,I recommend going often but spending no more than the time it takes to see 2 rooms. This is of course dependent on how accessible the gallery is. But some planning prior to each visit helps to enhance the enjoyment.
"Written October 6, 2019",Paintings to Take Your Breath Away,"London's National Gallery is a must-do in London.  It is free, although contributions are suggested. The building itself is beautiful.  We focused on the Impressionists, and the museum has a beautiful collection of these.  There is a small cafe downstairs, and one can sit outside and people-watch while sipping your wine.  Pair this up with a meal and concert at St. Martin in the Fields, across the street."
"Written October 6, 2019",Beautiful ,Free!  Great exhibits and relaxing atmosphere. Can easily spend several hours roaming around!  Enjoy the street performers too!
"Written October 5, 2019",Top London Site for Good Reason,"This is a must see site! Great permanent collection that is absolutely world class! The only problem is that the collections are overwhelming, so allow plenty of time!"

Personal favourites as follows:- Rembrandt self portrait;- Turner's fighting temeraire;- Whistlejacket, Stubbs; - Various works by Canaletto of Venice.The above is a personal choice a no doubt others will have theirs. For a free gallery it really is outstanding."
"Written October 3, 2019",Gems of the City,"There are gems from every era starting with Medieval art to the Impressionists. While each room had its renowned pieces, I was especially impressed with the number of Raphaels, Rembrandts and breadth of Impressionist artists represented here.  I would love to go back and spend even more time in the gallery. Thanks for a lovely afternoon!"
"Written October 3, 2019",Perfect free bathroom location and cafe,"Ok, I’ll admit I didn’t even check out this FREE museum but I was just walking by and saw the “free” sign so I had a hunch it would be a good toilet spot. BINGO, as soon as you walk in turn right and head through the self serve cafe area and follow the signs to the bathroom. Then when you’re done you can go to the sit down and get waited on cafe or the self serve area where they have yummy pastries, coffee, tea, etc. You grab what you want and then pay for the goodies and find a seat inside or get it to go and sit out on the ground or steps. "
"Written October 2, 2019",Wish I had more time to fully experience it.,The national gallery was incredible. So clean and organised. There was plenty of staff to help if needed and the exhibits were perfect. I will be back with more time!
"Written October 2, 2019",Must see place,Can’t believe that we are able to visit for the cost of however much you want to donate. So much to see and take in that one has to go back. The cafe was of high quality as well. Tried hard to avoid the shop at the exit and failed .

There is also a gift shop downstairs that has a wonderful selections of gifts and souvenirs. Love love love the National Gallery"
"Written October 1, 2019",Memorable Experience ,This Museum rivals any I have seen anywhere. The collections are outstanding and the facility itself is beautiful inside and out. I would recommend obtaining a floor plan and marking off galleries as you go through. The rooms are a maze and I found myself doubling back on some I had seen. Be sure to set aside at least three hours to get the full experience of the Museum. If you find yourself overwhelmed take a break in the cafe. I found the impressionists section simply amazing. Admission is free. The staff are courteous and helpful. The is a cloakroom to leave your coats for a small fee. 
"Written September 3, 2019",Nice ,The gallery is not to big. Has very nice paintings For me it was OK You can finish the tour in a hour if you don’t like to read everything on the paintings 
"Written September 3, 2019",Pure art,"This is a huge place, so if you're tired or on shor time.. think again. They should sell 2 day tickets or something like this because if you an art enthusiastic there is really no time enought to see almost all of it. Tiziano, Vermeer, Rembrandt... countless pieces of pure art. Remarcable"
"Written September 3, 2019",one of the best art museums anywhere,"This is a marvelous museum with a huge range of Western Art, from medieval through to Van Gogh, with some real masterpieces and works of genius. Do not miss Leonardo's Virgin on the Rocks, two Vermeers, a few Van Goghs. And amazingly free!"
"Written August 31, 2019",Heaven for art lovers,"The architecture is impressive. Inside you can spend weeks if you want to look for each paintings. We most liked Van Gogh, Monet and Cezanne. I had high expections to the trafalgar square as its always mentioned in movies and news but to be honest there is nothing special."
"Written August 30, 2019",Go in with a plan,"It's very crowded, especially with it's location right at Trafalgar Square. I think it would be a great idea to get a sense of what you want to see the most before going so you can hit those rooms first. Then once you have your must-see items out of the way you can wander around and enjoy the rest as your time allows."

The permanent exhibition is free as in all public museums in London. "

"Written September 30, 2019",Fantastic museum - great to spend a whole afternoon at,You must check out the National Gallery if you are visiting London. There is so much art work and history contained within the building and the incredible artwork from painters such as the Renaissance. Would suggest that you prepare 2-3 hours wandering slowly through the hallways - must go! :) 
"Written September 29, 2019",One of the many free museums in London ,You can easily spend several hours wandering through the museum. There are phenomenal collections of artworks. The Sainsbury entrance is located off of Trafalgar square. Even the flooring in the central lobby is a work of art. A mosaic of 1/2 inch square tiles.
"Written September 29, 2019",Impromptu visit,"We popped in as the rain was torrential.  Was very open, plenty of places to sit down whilst looking at the art on display.  Clean rest rooms and a cafe too. "
"Written September 28, 2019",Interesting as a building and for the exhibitions.,"On a limited time scheduled we enjoyed exploring a couple of the displays. The forecourt to the gallery was bustling with artists performing. So much to see outside, possibly because it was school holidays. Worth a visit."
"Written September 28, 2019",A fantastic free gallery in London,"On a recent visit to London I spent a couple of hours looking around this magnificent art gallery. Two hours was nowhere near enough time to see all there is on offer, but it was great to spend what little time I could. Must factor in more time on my next visit."

"Written August 26, 2019",Great collection,"My first time visiting the National Gallery and I was really impressed with the early religious works, particularly some of the brilliant ultramarine works. It was also great to be able to see some of the modern works up close but this wing was pretty jammed with people. I love that it is a free museum but I hate the layout and some people seemed to have maps but I found myself continually trying to find one / figure out where we were."
"Written August 26, 2019",Nice to see seven pillars,I have been staying near to national gallery for nearly 2 months during my industrial training . I loved visiting here with my room mate and spend time on Saturday evenings 
"Written August 25, 2019",Lovely Gallery,"This is a lovely gallery with great pieces worth seeing. Given the numerous entrances, it would be helpful to have maps available at each entrance. I was halfway through the gallery before I was able to get one. Also, the person standing right at the door asking for a donation is annoying. I actually would have given more if someone with an ipad wasn't there asking for it.  "
"Written August 25, 2019",Must see London Museum,"What a bargain - a great collection of artworks with no admission charge.  Of course, you will want to contribute something after you finish viewing the many items.  We concentrated on the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works this time, but there is something for everyone, no mater what your interest.  Allow a minimum of 2 hours, but you could spend two days!  "
"Written August 25, 2019",Wonderful afternoon amongst the masters,"What can I say about this absolutely fantastic art gallery.

"Written September 18, 2019",A must see visit for any art lover!,There are Monet and VanGogh paintings in here that you have only seen on a poster! Oh and some you didn’t know existed. The museum itself is very ornate and a work of art itself.

"Written September 14, 2019","Wonderfull, free museum full of gems",We sadly only had about an hour to visit this wonderful museum. But we could easily have stayed another or more hours. What a charming museum full of gems. We loved it.
"Written September 13, 2019",Amazing collection!,"I spent a little more than 3 hours here on a Thursday afternoon, and was very impressed by the breadth and depth of the collection. I happened to arrive just before a tour started, and very much enjoyed the docent's discussion of the first work; however, the group was so large that half of us lost him on the way to his next stop (Nick walked too quickly for those of us lagging behind to take pictures). I am glad that I started my own exploration in my areas of interest (19th and 20th century art), because by the time I returned to the Sainsbury wing I was too ""museumed-out"" to enjoy the earlier works. Next time!"
"Written September 13, 2019",Free valuable art ,"A slightly beyond medium sized art museum. It has representative paintings from different periods, showing at least 1 piece from the grand masters. It is not really comparable with other important European galleries, but it is free."
"Written August 24, 2019",First visit ,"Totally enjoyed my first visit to the gallery having wanted to visit for years. Beautifully exhibited paintings, immaculate surroundings, excellent temperature despite being 30 degrees outside. Finally got to see the 🌻 after years of missing them while loaned out ..."
"Written August 22, 2019",Cathy,My daughter is doing A level Art and wanted to see paintings by Vincent Van Gogh. We went straight to room 43 and enjoyed all 5. We also went around for a while. But as all big museums and galleries it is better to do a little research and plan what you want to visit. 
"Written August 22, 2019",Beautiful  museum and collection,Family visit with three little girls. We really enjoyed the impressionist collection. The museum was busy but not over crowded. A great destination. Gift shop had some lovely souvenirs.
"Written August 18, 2019",London's free museums,There re many great museums in London. This is one of them. Yoiu need a few hours to visit and even then you need more time. Enjoyable

"Written August 18, 2019",Surrounded by art,"Leonardo Da Vinci, Rubens, Rembrandt, Rafael  and many more... Worth of visit not only for art lovers."
"Written August 17, 2019",recommended,"Absolutely not to be missed, one of the best museums in the world, works by artists of the highest level, always very popular, but it is worth waiting to admire unique masterpieces. The distribution of a map at the entrance to the museum would be appreciated, which at least addresses the best works, there are indications in the various rooms, but it is more dispersive. Strongly recommended for a dip in the art of completely free."
"Written August 17, 2019",A must when you visit London,"Close to the heart of London, this place is a must. Amazing, fascinating, so so beautiful beyond any words. Free entrance and believe me if you miss it you miss out."

"Written August 16, 2019",Amazing art,"The art was amazing.  Unfortunately we didn't have nearly enough time to really look at everything, plus we had teens.  But we saw some awesome art, and it was free to enter (They ask for a donation)."
"Written August 16, 2019",Great for a rainy day,The main part of the museum is free. It can become a little packed on wet days. But the gift shop is also worth a visit and the cafe sells delicious cakes. You have to pay to visit special exhibitions. Well worth a visit.
"Written August 14, 2019",So much art to enjoy,"The breadth of art on show is stunning, this is a place that deserves repeat visits and the fact that the admission is free means that whether the visit is fleeting or longer it is unbelievable value. It does get busy another more well known pieces e.g. Van Gogh but it is possible to move at one’s own pace and find some awe inspiring pieces. It’s definitely one of my favourites. "
"Written August 14, 2019",Wow!,So many incredible paintings to see!  We wandered from gallery to gallery looking at just so many world famous paintings and best of all it's free entry!
"Written August 13, 2019",Amazing collection of impressionists,One of the best collections of impressionist painters. Here you can see some of the best works of best known artists.
"Written August 13, 2019",A genuine national treasure,In spite of walking past here every day for years when I worked in the west end never visited. Genuinely excellent - a true national treasure. Highly recommended with friendly and helpful staff. Art is a very personal thing but there is something here for every taste.
"Written August 12, 2019",Great!,Really enjoyed my second visit to the gallery and the cakes in the coffee shop are delicious! If you go there get there when it opens and go to the furthest room and work your way back to avoid the crowds as it’s hard to appreciate some larger pictures if too many people standing in front of them.
"Written August 11, 2019",Must see free attraction! ,Considering the amount of art here I was so surprised it was free! Beautiful pieces by Botticelli who is my favourite! Really great way to spend a few hours in London without having to spend any money! Obviously donations are encouraged! Also the plaques are great here so I don’t think you’ll need the audio guides!
"Written August 11, 2019",Great Art but......,No one can criticise the large quantity and quality of the art on display throughout this gallery even if it’s not to your taste. The architecture of the old building in well worth a look at as well.I am a Londoner by birth so security checks are a part of life from the 70’s/80s and the queue moved quickly but not sure what it told them. Immediately you leave security you are greeted with people with iPads stood almost but not in your way telling you it’s free but obviously wanting a donation. The iPads clearly showed money options.  It was pressurised. This may put off people who can’t afford to visit major galleries or those who may not get an opportunity to see art. By all means have tubs around and posters explaining the costs etc but move your staff away from the security area people feel trapped by them.
"Written August 9, 2019",Great to wander around when you have some free time in London,"I spent an hour browsing floor 2 of the National Gallery with a friend. We really enjoyed what we say.I wanted to give a special mention to the guide in room 22 at around 1pm on Saturday 9 August, she really brought Rembrant alive for us, she had so much knowledge about his life it was so interesting talking to her."
"Written August 9, 2019",Great selection of portraits,Visited in the late afternoon when the crowds where certainly gone and the tour groups had finished.
"Written July 30, 2019","National Galery, London",London's National Gallery is a beautiful old structure with wonderful architecture. It is in Trafalgar Square and easy to find. The gallery itself is layed out beautifully and the collection of art is very good. They say it is free but they ask for a donation of at least £10.
"Written July 30, 2019",Still wonderful,"I used to come here regularly on working trips to London but it has been at least a year since I was here last. Even if you only have a short time, it gives such a lift to go see some of the wonderful works in the permanent exhibition."
"Written July 26, 2019",Busy,Wanted to see certain paintings by Constable and Turner it was busy but we were directed to where they were and it was easy to find our way around. What can I say if art is your thing you can't go wrong here.
"Written July 26, 2019","Well organised, free and great art - and you can take photos","One of the greatest collections of art in the world and it's free - except for special exhibitions. Getting in is easy and smooth - I recommend getting in the queue early, or following the guidance on the website for the best times to visit. It is a VERY popular place.Also, it's good to plan your visit ahead, if you want to see anything special - and go there first.The corridors and galleries are wide, with quite a lot of seating, so you can take your time, and even if there are a lot of visitors, you can wait for a crowd to pass before viewing your favourite painting.A good/bad thing is that you can take photos. On the good side, this means you can take home your very own souvenirs and selfies with your favourites on camera. On the bad side, it means some people 'hog' the most famous paintings for ages while they try to get the 'perfect' shots, or cycle through their family/tour group.And of course there are the tour groups that stand in front of key paintings for 10-minutes while the guide gives the lecture, before the herd moves on. Patience is the key.I'd never been before this visit, so it was a good experience. Light halls and welcoming galleries make the place feel open and friendly.It's not as big as some around the world, but the quality of the paintings on display beats the quantity of other sites, in my opinion. And since it's free, you can't complain.Everything is clean and tidy, and quiet.You can get audio guides - I didn't use one, so can't comment.Depending on your level of interest in the different displays, 2-hours is probably enough to see almost everything - unless you're a serious art lover, or it's really crowded.I didn't eat there, so can't comment on the cafe. The shop is OK, with reasonable selection of of books, souvenirs, etc.Definitely worth a visit for a morning/afternoon, and since it's in Trafalgar Square it's easy to get to and combine with other central London activities."
"Written July 24, 2019","If you love history and art, the National Gallery is a must.",I had been to London twice before I ever went to the National Gallery. I din't now what I was missing. I spent hours perusing the gallery and saw some the most amazing works of art! A must see!
"Written July 24, 2019",One of the world’s most important museums!,Fabulous collections. There is no filler. More than one full day or two or three can be easily justified.
"Written July 24, 2019",Great Museum,"Wonderful building and masterpieces, in a wonderful place; every room has a specific colour, very impressive; the atmosphere is magic, in some rooms there was a musician playng live music"
"Written July 23, 2019",A great gallery and location,"A visit to the National Gallery is more than just a gallery visit, as the approach is a history lesson via Trafalgar Square with a window into London, past and present. "
"Written July 22, 2019",Lots to see,We concentrated our visit in the Tudor gallery.   It actually was several galleries and the portraits were amazing.  Some dated back to the 1500s 
"Written July 21, 2019",Wonderful,It is another “must do” in London. Even if you do not know anything about art. It is wonderful and it is worth a lot.
"Written July 2, 2019",Not enough time to see everything!,"It was late in the day when we made it to the National Gallery so we just hit the high points. Interestingly the area in front of the museum is quite busy with street artists, musicians, sightseers, and locals. Even if you're not interested in the museum, it's a fun place to hang out. "
"Written July 1, 2019",A wonderful afternoon,"I visited today the Sorolla Exhibition at the National Gallery which concludes on the 7th July.I knew very little about this artist, so didn't quite know what to expect.It turned out to be a superb day out. Sorolla was a wonderful artist who bought incredible light to his paintings and made them stand out in a way that I had never seen before. The paintings seemed so ‘alive’, one of the portraits in particular seemed as though the subject was actually in the room, it was like looking at real face, not a painting of a face. It was quite incredible. It was well worth travelling to London to see this fantastic exhibition, I read that Sorolla’s work hasn’t been shown in London for around 100 years, so I count myself fortunate to have had this opportunity."
"Written July 1, 2019",Sorolla Master of Light,Fantastic presentation of a under appreciated master. I knew little of Sorolla and learned a great deal. The exhibit was stunning. Not to be missed.
"Written June 30, 2019",Excellent ,"We targeted just one wing of this gallery, as it is very large. We had prepared by reading books that introduced my children (and me!) to some painters and paintings, and it was good fun spotting those paintings in the museum. It was great seeing the detail of the painting and the size of some of the artwork. "
"Written June 30, 2019",For history lovers ready to spend a day here,This is a free museum. My family spend half day here but feel that was not enough at all. Too many things to see and it was kind of crowded. 
"Written June 30, 2019",Free Entry is a wonderful policy,"On a visit to London (21st - 24th June) we visited the National Gallery on Monday 24th June. It was a very hot humid day and our first stop was the cafe where we had a much needed snack, a cake and a drink before wandering the different galleries.  We visit the National Gallery often when we are in London and there is always so much to see.  Foreign visitors must be amazed that they can visit free of charge as comparable galleries abroad are very expensive.  This is a wonderful policy as people are not restricted by wealth and frequent short visits are more pleasant than an extended stay which an entry fee would encourage."
"Written June 27, 2019",Best museum in London,A no brainer for anyone thinking about visiting this town. A lot of ehxibitions and famous paitings. 
"Written June 27, 2019",lovely building and artwork,the museum is located next to the Trafalgar square. staff were very friendly upon entrance. it houses a vast collection of art on different floors so there's lots to see.There is access to lifts which is great for prams and wheelchair use.I asked if one of the guys would take a picture of me and my baby which he just replied No which was unexpected. apart from that all staff were pleasant.
"Written June 26, 2019",Exceptional exhibition on Sorolla,"I attended the exhibition on Sorolla and it was nothing but amazing.  I was blown away by the superb technique of how Sorolla captured the effect of light on his paintings, which included his beach collection, the Spanish people in traditional costumes from different parts of the country and some of the monumental sized works.  You can almost see sunlight coming through the sail of the fishing boat and the fabric of people he painted.  Highly recommended! "
"Written June 25, 2019",Stunning gallery,"Stopped by here on the way through the Area and was not disappointed!The building is magnificent and really accentuates the stunning art on display in the halls. The busy parts of the gallery are obviously the famous pieces (Da Vinci, Monet etc). But at the height of the day in the weekend I was surprised at how easy it was to move around.Cafe is good too!"
"Written July 16, 2019",Great and Free,"Stayed in a hotel right down the street so past by daily. Finally went in and enjoyed it. The Gallery is free to enter, as are most museums in London. "
"Written July 16, 2019",Superb way to spend an afternoon,"Called in here a few days ago, we had been meaning to call here for some time, but always had something else to do first. What a place, so much to see and do. Well worth it and we shall return."
"Written July 16, 2019",Keep Coming Back for More,"I go to the National Gallery every time I visit London. I love that I can just stop in to sit for a while with a Vermeer or a Turner or (insert name of your favorite artist here.) For Free! No line - especially if you’re not carrying a backpack/bag that needs a security check. I wouldn’t recommend trying to see everything at once. There’s just too much great art. Pick a room or two to soak in, and plan to return. "
"Written July 14, 2019",Adult culture without children!,"Normally any trip to a London includes the kids and kid friendly museums. This time we escaped and had a child free weekend. I’ve wanted to go to the National and wonder around for ages. It’s not that this is not child friendly- it is - but I wanted to spend me time looking at the art! Some amazing paintings and something for all. Loved the Monet’s, Turners, Cezanne’s and Renoir’s. All displayed in an amazingly stunning building- it’s worth going just to look around the gallery itself. Definitely recommend with or without children!"
"Written July 12, 2019",A Gallery with a collection of the most beautiful works by famous artists under one roof,"If you are an art lover, this is a must visit place as you will see the work of Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Ruben , Monet to name a few.If you are not, this place will introduce you to art and it could be a beginning of a wonderful  journey to explore  art.

"Written July 9, 2019",Superb collection,"Superb collection of some iconic artwork, many examples of the best of British and international artists work"
"Written July 6, 2019",Can't understand anyone not giving this a 5 star,"I am not an art connoisseur, but this place is impressive.  Was in London with university students and a few of us went here during or ""free time"".  Next time it will be on the actual required program.  Room after room of masterpieces and artists you learned about in school and many that you should have learned about!  We spent 2 hours you could have spend 1/2 a day or if you were an art student 1 week or even 1 month."
"Written July 5, 2019",Poor experience. Check restrictions on exhibitions first ,"Went to see Sorolla exhibition in lunchtime before it ends but refused entry as not a member. Nothing on website stipulating restrictions and nothing visible on entry into gallery prior to being told at the desk. Very poor. Don't get caught out. They had the audacity to ask if I'd be interested in a membership too. Error, of course, not."
"Written July 5, 2019",Good quick visit,"The National Gallery has a wonderful collection of paintings.  We had just a couple hours before another event and it was a great way to spend that time.  We didn't see the whole museum,  but chose the collections we wanted to see.  The impressionist gallery was my favorite!"
"Written August 2, 2019",Great museum and free,Well worth taking the time to see. Near a lot of the main attractions. Try to go on an off time to enjoy the artwork without huge crowds
"Written August 2, 2019",GO! It's fantastic! And Free!!!,"A really amazing collection of art, we could have spent so much time here and actually hadn't planned on going at all but stopped in to get out of the rain. So glad we did and ended up spending a couple hours exploring which wasn't nearly enough. Grab a tea at the little cafe next door, pay fro the headset that gives you a tour and just enjoy all that there is to see in this spectacular place. We will certainly go back!"
"Written August 2, 2019",Many Masters of the Art world,"To be so close to the works of so many famous artists was amazing even my modern teens were enthralled with the art. If not for my schedule, I could have spent more time there. You need 2-3 hours to fully appeciate the displays."
"Written August 2, 2019",Beautifully curated,Go early as it gets very crowded.  It also gets very warm on hot days. All free. amazing. Get a nap first and pan your route as you can get literally lost in the moment seeing these amazing paintings.
"Written August 1, 2019",NationalGallery,"Amazing colle tion of artwork, displayed in convenient fashion.  The staff are well versed in locations of specific paints if you're on a hunt."

"Written June 22, 2019",Loved the portrait galleries,We stopped in to see the Tudor and Victorian portrait galleries - they are really amazing to see.  No lines to get in as all museums are free in London. Well worth a visit - we skipped any modern exhibits and just focused on the Tudor and Victorian works - awesome!
"Written June 21, 2019",Excellent free gallery,Great gallery with a wide collection. The paid exhibition was fantastic but frustrating that you pay entrance and then pay again for an audio guide. Have visited the free collection many times and have always enjoyed it.
"Written June 18, 2019",Free,Wonderful gallery to spend the day with families and friends. Is possible to see the Wheat Field with Cypresses (Van Gogh) and wonderful collection of Monet. Unmissable
"Written June 17, 2019",Great collection,"This is a great collection.  anyone who likes fine art will have an exceptional experience.  Take the time to read the captions and you will get more out of your visit,"
"Written June 17, 2019",Free and worth the time ,We happened upon this museum on our way to China town and very much enjoyed it! Some very famous pieces are here and the gift shop was nice. Our favorite thing though was the view from the top of the steps when we exited. Beautiful! 
"Written June 16, 2019",Give yourself plenty of time!,"I only gave myself a few hours, and wish I had more time to look around. A must for anyone with any appreciation of art."
"Written June 16, 2019",About a weeks worth!,"Admission is free, and even if it were paid for, you couldn't possibly go wrong with spending a day here. The very fact that admission is free to such a magnificent collection of art tells us a lot about the English. It is stupendous. You could easily come back every day for a week and not see it all."
"Written June 15, 2019",Nice art collection ,"Really nice art collection and free museum. We enjoyed the impressionists (Monet), Van Gogh, large British paintings, Boticelli etc. on top floor. We live in Chicago and love the Art Institute’s extensive collection, and this was a very nice collection. Definitely worth it if you have time. It closed at 5pm and were able to see a lot in an hour. "
"Written July 5, 2019",Stunning collection,"I would suggest that this gallery is a must if in London. The collection spans decades and is unhorsed in a beautiful building. The entry is free, as I believe all art and museums really should be. Art is an expression of who we are as a world.Don't miss this."
"Written July 4, 2019",Truly an Amazing Place,"I have been going to the National Gallery since the 1980's, when I first started to work in London. I used to walk up to it in my lunch hour, from the City, escape into another world and ease away all the stresses of the working day. The painting are truly phenomenal. In an hour you can only see a very small part, you really need a full day - or two or three hours on consecutive days. It was here that I first really appreciated the works of Van Gogh. I remember standing in front of his 'A Wheatfield with Cypresses"". The vibrancy of the colours and the intensity of the brush stokes brought home what his pictures are truly about. But there is so, so much more. Turner's watercolours, Constables magnificent landscapes, Suerat, Cezanne, Gainsborough - the list is endless. And I haven't even mentioned Canaletto, in my opinion one of the best ever landscape painters. Best of all it's FREE, though you can make a donation if you choose. Make a day of it and have lunch in their cafe or dining room. It has brought me so much pleasure over the years, you really cannot help but have a super time there, even if you are not big into art. Check ou their super website before you visit to plan what you want to see. Thos is definitely one of life's MUST Do's."
"Written July 3, 2019",Quite amazing and a must if you are in London,I only had a short time for a visit so I went straight to the gallery containing the Impressionists.  Almost every painter of the period is represented. You cannot do justice to this fantastic gallery in a single visit so best to see on a number of occasions.  You can see some of the world's greatest paintings for free - take advantage of this opportunity!
"Written July 3, 2019",Always such a pleasure to revisit ,"It always happens to me: National Gallery takes much more time than I originally plan. I started with the Renaissance painters, spent plenty of time enjoying my all time favorites, Leonardo’s “Virgin of the Rocks”, Botticelli’s “Venus and Mars” and his portraits. Moved on to amazing El Greco, phenomenal “Rokeby Venus” by Diego Velázquez, Van Eyck and Vermeer, several Rembrandt’s portraits, which I had seen on display recently in the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh... the list is very, very long, so I do not want to bore you with it... Around 2 pm the swarms of noisy school children have become unbearable, so I decided to take a break for lunch in the lovely National Gallery Cafe.After much needed lunch, I went to the Impressionists, the reason why I got stuck in the National Gallery for so long. What a stunning collection! The best Cezanne, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, whom I adore... phenomenal Renoir’s portraits, beautiful Claude Monet’s landscapes, famous Manet’s paintings “The Music in the Tuileries” and “Execution of Maximilian”... I stopped paying attention to noisy school kids and completely drowned in the beauty of the paintings forgetting about everything around me. Forgot about time as well... it was already 6pm, the Gallery was closing. Will be back and hopefully soon.  "
"Written July 2, 2019",Stunning Art,National Gallery has stunning art work. I really enjoyed the portrait section. The museum is very large so review the map and see the sections you are interested first. Photos are allowed. There are benches in most rooms so you can sit and listen to the audio. They also have a coat room which comes in handy in the winter.
"Written July 2, 2019",Must see,"Enjoyed seeing the art masterpiece thanks to a very helpful curator. He pointed out the must see masterpieces (Michelangelo, Da Vinci ,   and Monet) after he noticed we were walking around with no direction. Out of the three museums we went to this museum was my favourite.  FYI — Audio guide free with London Pass.  "
"Written July 2, 2019",What a great location for a museum!,"So much to do here! There are plenty of free exhibitions as well as the paid ones. And, as well as the amazing collections of art, there is a very nice restaurant and cafe plus...the wonderful fountains of Trafalgar Square in front..."
"Written July 2, 2019",Wonderfull collection of art,This is one of the largest and most important art museums in the world. There is no admission cost.I would recommend to take it easy to be able to enjoy the art pieces you like and visit the museum at least three different days for about 3 to 5 hours each visit.
"Written July 2, 2019",Beautiful,"A gorgeous, free museum in the centre of Trafalgar Square. The art was fabulous and featured art by a wide range of artists including Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Claude Monet. Be prepared for it to be extremely busy. I went here just after lunch so it was definitely peak time. While trying to view Sunflowers, I really just ended up looking at the backs of peoples heads standing directly in front of the painting!! Also, try your best to ignore the scammers present at the foot of the stairs entrance, they can be annoyingly persistent towards tourists. I really enjoyed my visit to the museum, I loved being able to sit in the same chair as Q from James Bond! I definitely recommend visiting here. "
"Written July 2, 2019",One of the best if not the best art museum in London.,"If you are passionate about art and culture, the National Gallery it’s a must visit while in London. Just the view over Trafalgar Square from the entrance is worth stepping into the building. The gallery is divided in centuries and art currents. I’d like to advice to choose the one you are most interested in (or the artists) and visit it first. The time flies in there and it’s better to prioritise what you DON’T want to miss and walk a bit faster through the other rooms. They are selling little maps at the entrance, but you can find big maps all over the building to help you with the orientation. Enjoy!!! 😉 "
"Written June 5, 2019",WOW,If you love museum you will certainly love the National Gallery.Higly recommended for tourists and Londoners as well.
"Written June 4, 2019",Spend The Day,"The price of admission is zero. You can spend the morning, go for lunch, spend the afternoon, go for dinner, and come back at night. Is there a better way to spend a day? Not a one."
"Written June 4, 2019",It’s free! ,"And therefore can be crowded so go early. Nicely laid out, easy to navigate, wonderful collection. We didn’t have time for a docent-led tour but we would definitely take one during our next visit. Had lunch in the cafeteria and it was very good, not a lot of seating, however. "
"Written June 4, 2019",National Gallery Highlights,"Right off of Trafalgar Square this is one of the worlds best art museums.  You could easily spend all day there. Did a short tour to see all the old ""Masters.""   And it's free!!"

"Written June 3, 2019",BEST MUSEUM ON THE PLANET.... must do when you are in London,"I can't stress enough how great this museum is... and it's free.  If you ever took a class on the history of Western Art, you'll find a bunch of paintings here.  Bang a quick left when you head in and find The Ambassadors... stand to the right of the painting and the skull will emerge.  Plan on bringing comfortable shoes and allocate 2-3 hours.  Enjoy!"
"Written June 3, 2019",Well worth a visit,Always a good place to visit particularly if the weather isn’t great. Works by all the famous artists you’ve heard of and many more.
"Written June 2, 2019",Sorolla is a Must See,"My wife and I have been to the Sorolla Museum in Madrid several times and so were excited to see the artist's first exhibition in London since 1908. There is a very worthwhile introductory video and then numerous paintings sorted by subject matter or period. There are many examples from the Sorolla museum, the Prado, other Spanish museums as well as private collections. The artist was much admired during the early 20th century in Paris and America but never took off in the UK. There are many oversized canvasses of beach scenes, gardens and Spanierds in traditional costume. The expression of light and movement is genius and almost anyone will fall in love with this amazing artist that most people will not have heard of."
"Written June 1, 2019","Mind Blowing!  A Must See when you visit London, England",There was a lot to see.  Bridget Riley's Messenger's painting was a delight to see.  Some of the older stuff like  Venus at her Mirror (The Rokeby Venus) by Diego Velázquez.  That is absolutely beautiful.
"Written August 7, 2019",Excellent attraction,"The NPG is a vast experience. Chose a theme and stick to it, otherwise you will suffer from overload! The restaurants are attractive and above the usual for a gallery."
"Written August 7, 2019",As review commonly say 'a must see',A wonderful gallery to enjoy a couple of hours. I would advise going slowly and then leaving with the intention of coming back at some stage
"Written August 7, 2019",The National Gallery is world class,"The National Gallery's permanent collection is one of the finest in the world. From Renaissance greats to Impressionist wonders, from Dutch masters to Pre-Raphealite treasures, you'll find something to marvel over here."
"Written August 6, 2019",One of the world’s great art galleries,"The National Gallery is a pleasure to visit. Entry is free except to special exhibitions, so I like to go in for relatively short periods and perhaps see 2 or 3 rooms. Almost all the great artists of Western Europe from medieval times to about 1900 are represented.The rooms are beautiful and there is a nice relaxed atmosphere even though there are usually a lot of people there. There are regular guided tours and talks about particular paintings, often free. When you need a break there are a number of places in the gallery to eat or drink. I like the coffee bar on the left after you go through security from the ground floor entrance to the main building; it’s usually not too crowded."
"Written August 6, 2019",Too much amazing art!,We did this they way we often do huge museums - we went two mornings instead of taking a full day. It is so easy to get visually overloaded otherwise. We just chose a few rooms that held art we really wanted to see and enjoyed it slowly. One could spend months of mornings and not see everything.
"Written August 6, 2019",Epic from start to finish,"This is a must see for any visitor to the UK let alone London. Enter with open mind and eyes, allow yourself to fully take in all you see. Your own feelings may surprise you."
"Written August 6, 2019",Among the best museums in the world,The galleries are beautiful and so much to absorb here. One of the premiere collections of British art. The Sainsbury wing is especially worth visiting both for the collection and the architecture of the Venturi addition.
"Written August 6, 2019",Nice place,Good place if you came to London with a group. Amaizing for art lovers.The gallery is so big and there is many things to see.
"Written August 5, 2019",you need to go there,"Amazing art old and new, good atmosphere. uplift your spirit and makes you calm. i believe everyone will find something interesting"
"Written August 4, 2019",Beautiful building ,Such s beautiful building to host some lovely art.Wander at leisure and enjoy the paintings. Free to get in although they do ask for donations.
"Written June 13, 2019",Nice quiet spot,"Beautiful impressionist paintings. The Portrait Gallery is currently unavailable, disappointing as it was our reason for going. Nice quiet spot to get away from the crowds."
"Written June 12, 2019",What More can You Ask For,An opportunity to look round a Gallery overlooking Trafalgar Square and Nelsons Column. Free to enter and lots of different visitor attractions inside. See some of the worlds famous artists and their often overlooked works up close is a real pleasure. Spend an hour or 4  just wandering round at your leisure this is one of those attractions in London that makes visitors from overseas come back again and again. No its not all lights camera action - its a museum for goodness sake but well worth a wander round just to say you have been and for its amazing setting.
"Written June 11, 2019","A strange experience, for me, but an essential visit","I spent the whole afternoon here. I'm retired in my sixties now, I last visited when I was an art student in the 1970s. Its a place everyone should see at least once. The permanent exhibition contains world famous masterpieces one after another, mostly pre-1900 art. So many I've seen too often in reproduction that I have become tired of them, suddenly there in the original so I really can peer at the brushwork and the underpainting and the sometimes dodgy filling in of backgrounds. A reminder that even the greatest artists were still human. So I experienced the odd sensation of some little known works rising sharply in my appreciation while some 'masterpieces' were a disappointment. Here's another Constable, that's another Velasquez, there's another Turner. Ho hum, ho hum, ho hum. But wow! look at this! Susanna at Her Bath by Francesco Hayez, stunningly erotic. Or Joseph Wright's Experiment on a Bird in an Air Pump, amazing control of lighting. I also greatly enjoyed the two temporary exhibitions, the major one being the Spanish artist Sorolla 'master of light', the smaller one of works by the contemporary abstract artist Sean Scully. To say there's 'something for everybody' is a cliche and an exaggeration, but it would be hard to find a broader introduction to the history of western classical painting. Yes, its western (predominantly European). Yes its predominantly classical (but includes impressionist work). And yes its all painting, not sculpture."
"Written June 11, 2019",Gallery of the greats,"There is a tremendous collection of Western art in the National Gallery with works by da Vinci, the Renaissance Masters, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Monet - a parade of the greats covering medieval to 20th century post Impressionism.  You don’t have to pay to enter so this Feast is yours for free or a donation should you choose to make it.  Highlights for me were the Constable’s The Hay Wain, Rousseau’s Tiger in a Tropical Storm, Leonardo’s Virgin of the Rocks and the Holy Family, and the Wilton Diptych.  I had been waiting a lifetime to see these.  I also discovered a good many paintings that I didn’t know.  The gallery is split into many rooms and it is fun to wander but never get truly lost.   For a rainy Monday in June, the place was not too busy.  I felt unrushed and unobstructed walking around.  "
"Written June 10, 2019",Very nice visit,"Art from XV Century to today with artist like degas, constable, da vinci, van gogh etcA Pleasant visit to open our eyes to beauty."
"Written June 9, 2019",Great art in a walkable museum,"This was my fourth visit to the National Gallery. It is a stone’s throw away from Parliament is n Trafalgar Square which allows you visit several sites easily in a day. The admission is free but you must donate to get a museum map. There are tons of dosents to assist you if you choose to wander on your own. If you are familiar with NYC’s Met the National Gallery is much smaller but still chock full of amazing art. My favorites include the Vermeers, Renoirs, Van Goeghs, Monets, Degas and Klimt."
"Written June 8, 2019",Sorolla exhibition,I always enjoy visiting here for both the free galleries & special exhibitions. The difference this time is I now use a wheelchair. Having prior experience meant I knew my way round & location of lifts. As always there is plenty to see. Staff were very helpful. I enjoyed the Sorolla exhibition. Some lifts are quite small. Disabled facilities are fine and help was given at the cafe to carry my food to a table.
"Written June 7, 2019",Amazing art and artists,"After a day of sightseeing we headed to the National Gallery. We were tired and knew the visit would be rushed but this was our only chance. My husband is a wheelchair user and upon entering where we did, possibly not the main entrance, it wasn’t immediately clear where the main galleries were or what route we should take and no one to assist. We realised we’d need to go up the lift. Young ladies asking for donations once up and inside. I’d rather just pay a small entrance fee than it be free and be guilted into donating. Either way it’s massive value for money obviously, just a small annoyance. We didn’t see anywhere to get a map or assistance so started wandering through the nearest room. It’s a beautiful building inside and out, located on Trafalgar Square with lots of the usual food outlets around the square, lots of people and buzz. After wandering several rooms we got the hang of the flow and following the room numbers. We were totally gobsmacked. So many high quality artists and works all in one place. Hard to take in really, what we were seeing. Just incredible landscape, portrait and religious paintings, small and large. My husband drooling over all the Rembrandts and me just about everything else. Love that you can take photos, no flash. People were largely very accommodating allowing the wheelchair to move through the galleries and help with all the doors, and allowing room near the paintings. We could have spent half a day but had to keep a steady pace. So don’t let time out you off. It is doable in a few hours, just not preferable."
"Written June 6, 2019",amazing art,"the gallery is near trafalgar square and entranceis free, u can enjoy 2 or three floors of great art, sometimes they do show contemporary art as well"
"Written June 5, 2019",Beautiful place!,"Lovely atmosphere is gorgeous, kept clean and quiet and very well organised with large group visits."
"Written May 30, 2019",Great art,Wonderful collection of mostly British art.  We particularly liked the Turners and the Constables.  This museum has the largest collection of Turners in the world.
"Written May 29, 2019",Gorgeous Galleey,"Awesome! Beautiful setting, collection, musuem shops and cafe/restaurant. Needs several hours to see everything... "
"Written May 27, 2019",Fabulous Impressionists Exhibition.,"Wonderful place to while away a few hours,the exhibitions are well displayed and you can get really close up.To see so many impressionist art works in the same place was great, especially Monet and especially his waterlily series"
"Written May 27, 2019",Many paintings from famous painters,A must go if you are a fan of paintings. Lots of people so would suggest to go early. Definitely worth going. Entry is free but good to give donations or get something from the shop to keep the free entries going. 
"Written May 27, 2019",Lots to see,"Free admission to see Van Gough, Turner and other paintings was fantastic, the building itself is stunning.It’s bigger than you expect with lots to see and walk around.I must say it isn’t very well signposted so trying to find the artist/ room you are looking for can take a while, there doesn’t appear to be any order/ accurate signposting.It was quite busy with tourists pushing through doorways but this was a weekend so I guess that’s to be expected.The inside of the building is fabulous, the staff friendly, and the paintings fantastic."
"Written May 26, 2019",National Gallery,Something for everyone here.  Wonderful selection of art works by many different artists from all over the world.
"Written May 26, 2019",enjoyable morning visit,Had a wonderful morning/lunch and totally enjoyed the incredible art from Monet to Gainsborough  to Turner to Constable and so much more... Don't miss it!!
"Written May 26, 2019",ART,if you are interesting of art or even a quite place this is the perfect one! I Love Museum Atmosphere.
"Written May 26, 2019",Very interesting day out,"I took my daughters and I found the gallery to be very interesting, lots to see and do , plus a-lot of historical artworks, all round great place!"
"Written May 24, 2019",Mind-boggling ,"Bigger than you can imagine, the priceless works of art are hanging right in front of you and, the entrance cost is free with a donation from those who can afford it is requested. From Van Dyke to Van Gough, the size of the National Gallery collection is beyond belief and something the whole world should see."
"Written May 18, 2019",GOOD!,"I went to an ASD day ,really helped me with my autisum. it opened early so it was quieter and less busy"
"Written May 17, 2019","Always an old favourite, so much to see in such an iconic site",No visit to london is complete without visiting this art gallery in its iconic position in Trafalgar square.So many magnificent paintings.
"Written May 16, 2019",Museum of the world,National Galley is just plain FABULOUS.  AND it is free--the Brits know how to treat their art.  Around the corner is the National Portrait Gallery which is actually my favorite and it is also FREE.  Great way to spend an afternoon at two of the best sights in London.
"Written May 14, 2019",Sorrola exhibition,"Must see!Master of sunlight is an understatement Fantastic I would recommend anyone in London,visiting or else,to try to go and see this remarkable exhibition"
"Written May 14, 2019",Great collection paintings,"The location, the building in terms of architecture and the collection of paintings inside is awe inspiring. The Christian section includes paintings that are so moving and sincere and detailed... the paintings by Turner are also Byblos themselves worth visiting. A few surprises await"
"Written May 14, 2019",great collection!,a must to see in London + the fact that there is Trafalgar square in front of that...amazing :) to do!
"Written May 12, 2019","Seminal collection but not tremendously rookie friendly, one has to be a self starter here","This was my first trip to the National Gallery, yes there were moments where pieces of work took my breath away, I had no idea George Stubbs “Whistlejacket” was that huge for example. The sheer size and breadth of the collection I appreciate is seminal and the building imperial. Seeing the worlds greats in the flesh of course is a treat however I did not find the museum as a whole rookie friendly. I invested in the audio guide but it’s a laborious, long winded, mechanical affaire, not an enthusiastic highlights tour providing flow. Tate Britain for example has/had an amazing highlights tour via their app which I found a perfect introduction. Likewise I did not get the welcome feel as I did at the National Portrait Gallery nor left with the same level of enthusiasm. I’m a big fan of museums/sites catering to a millennial generation and enthusing/inspiring and find it a shame when it ends up being hard work instead. I was glad I saw it all and marvelled over some of the greats but have little hunger to go back any time soon, nor was the Friday night concept capitalised on in anyway that I noticed which was a shame. Having said all of that of it is amazing one can waltz into these institutes free of charge and see some of the worlds most well known pieces, which certainly was not lost on me and for that I considered it an honour."
"Written May 12, 2019",A must visit museum in London,"What a wonderful museum!  I love the National Gallery in DC but the London one is truly spectacular with art well-displayed.  There was no tour when I visited so I rented the audio tour -- highly recommend the audio.  The commentaries were extensive but you can skip or end at any time. If you can't find a painting or are in a hurry, you can listen to the audio for ones on the brochure.  It was crowded when I visited so great to have a more in-depth way to experience the art."
"Written May 12, 2019",Impressive!,No admission fees; donations accepted.  There are comfortable sofas to relax and absorb many magnificent works of art.
"Written May 12, 2019","Free entry, great art","Located right on Trafalgar square, the National Gallery is very accessible to a lot of nearby hotels in London.  There is a lot of great art depicting historical English events but the art is really from across the globe.  The staff is friendly and you can rent a portable tour guide if you enter through the main entrance."
"Written May 21, 2019",Timeless,I have been visiting the national gallery at trafalgar square for more than 2 decades now. It never ceases to amaze me.
"Written May 21, 2019",Always a pleasure to visit,"One of the premiere art collections in the world, this is the place to see Rembrandts, Caravaghios, van Goghs and Constables all in one day. The organization is good, the lighting mostly fine.The only disappointment comes when a loved painting is out on tour :-("
"Written May 20, 2019",Fantastic gallery to visit,"We were in London for a short break early in May, and spent a few hours in this wonderful gallery. It was very full and also very hot, really uncomfortably so . Luckily for foot weary visitors like us, there were comfy sofas to collapse into every now and again. We were very keen on seeing the two Vermeers and also the Jan Steens in the same room (Room 16). They were wonderful.  We also loved William Hogarth's satirical series Marriage -A-la-Mode (Room 35) and George Stubbs Whistlejacket - incredible painting of a race horse that hits you in the eye even before you enter the room. Another painting we saw that I won't forget was Elisabeth L. V. Le Brun's  ""Self portrait in a straw hat"", an 18C French painter. One doesn't see many female painters and she painted beautifully. A very interesting  few hours spent in the National Gallery."
"Written May 20, 2019",amazing collection of works,I love going to the National - the best place in London for anyone who adores art but doesn't have £100mil to buy their own collection  - amazing collection of works 
"Written May 20, 2019",Impressionists and Vermeer,We only saw a small fraction of the exhibits but there are 2 Vermeer and several impressionists which we enjoyed.
"Written May 20, 2019",Bidda,"I love The Impressionists, The National Gallery advertised for Sorolla (Spanish Master of Light), never heard of him!  A Spanish Impressionist Painter, fantastic exhibit.  If you love art, don’t miss it!  Open daily, a small charge of approx 15 pounds entry fee. Check dates because the exhibit ends in the summer!  At the same time, there are many other paintings at the National Gallery!  I spent three and a half hours.  The Gallery overlooks Tralfagar Square.  Suggest lunch at the next door building, The Portrait Gallery, thelovely restaurant is the Portrait Restaurant, great food, wine, service and amazing view!"
"Written May 20, 2019",Enjoyable time ,"Had good time there, although was half term but the queue was not bad, took us something like 10min rather than usually 20 at lest. A nice day trip destination!"
"Written May 19, 2019",Definitely worth visiting,You can easily spend five hours here (we lasted a bit more than four and didn't quite see it all).  The audio guide is worth getting.  There are lots of helpful docents.
"Written May 19, 2019",well laid out; treasures galore; enough space for visitors,"This is a must-see in London.  Admission is complimentary but I would encourage a donation.  Staff are generally helpful but not as knowledgeable about the basics (navigation, etc) as I have experienced elsewhere (i.e., The States) "
"Written May 19, 2019",Art culture,The gallery is free to visit and has some amazing art within it’s walls. It’s a great place to visit on a rainy day but really any day is a good day to appreciate fine art. 
"Written April 23, 2019",Fabulous! ,"We took the children as we felt they should have a fleeting visit, we were there longer than expected!I asked a staff member for advice about the best place to take the children (4 and 7),he was very helpful. A great experience! "
"Written April 20, 2019",Brilliant Exhibition,"The joys of the permanent collection are well documented, so I will focus on the recent ""paid for"" exhibition: Sorolla: Master of Light. Simply outstanding. The gallery's recent use of lesser known impressionists (I recall the Australian Impressionist show with delight) has been a revelation. This exhibition featured the whole range of this comparatively obscure Spaniard's works, with excellent labelling and an equally excellent film presentation."
"Written April 17, 2019",Absolutely extraordinary ,What else needs to be said? Incredible collection and The Turner Wing is an absolute must if you pay visit.
"Written April 15, 2019",Pre Renaissance and Renaissance galleries are fantastic,Being the national gallery any serious visitor has to visit it over a few days... as any time can be spent looking at these masterpieces from the 15th or 16th century. They are really well sorted and still impressed by the quality of the paintings there. 
"Written April 14, 2019",Lunch break visit,"Most lunch times I will grab a seat within the Gallery and take in the details on a different painting each day. No phone, no headset. This place never gets boring!"
"Written April 13, 2019",Renaissance treat,Superb collection in content and display. central location and reasonably priced refreshments for all.
"Written April 13, 2019",Imaginative and delicious lunch,"Beautifully designed, healthy menu. Great for vegetarians, vegan and gluten free eaters. Delicate flavours, perfectly balanced use of herbs. Good service. Nice location. Recommended."

"Written April 13, 2019",A stroll through the centuries,From Giotto to Van Gogh and beyond: Each century is represented by beautifully curated paintings to delight art lovers from the world over. The temporary exhibitions are world class.
"Written April 8, 2019","If you only have time for one museum in London, go here","The best thing about the National Gallery is that it's free to enter. You can pay a few extra pounds to get an audio guide but it comes free with the London Pass. I'd recommend getting an audio guide.Since this is a huge space full of art, make a list of the pieces you want to see so you can pretty much plan out your visit. They have Van Goghs, Klimts, and other pieces that art enthusiasts would love."
"Written May 11, 2019",what a privilege to be able to view stunning artworks,always a pleasure to walk around its beautiful rooms and view the stunning paintings of its permanent and impressive collection...
"Written May 9, 2019",Tourist,"Great way to spend to spend an afternoon in London. Great painting s from all the masters. You don't have to be an art enthusiast to be impressed. You can just wander the various galleries get lost in the scenes of the past. What impressed me was the Turner room. But each will have their own likes , something for everyone. "
"Written May 8, 2019",Amazing art gallery with incredible collection,"We visited this gallery to see the Sorella exhibition. Not only was that exhibition extraordinarily good but when we visited the other floors we found an enormous collection of pre-modernist art works including  Constable,  Renoir, Monet and Van Gough. Well worth a visit."
"Written May 7, 2019",Nice Gallery,This is the first time I visited such a big and nice gallery for appreciating paintings and drawings. Surprised it is free of charge for entry.We had a good time overall.  Nice location and environment.  Must visit if you are in London.

"Written May 23, 2019",Amazing Paintings-trip to the past,We visited the National Gallery morning hours but we didn't avoid the queues.There are 2300 pictures from Renaissance to impressionist from the most famous European painters.We have never seen such a big collection before.The entrance to Gallery is free except major temporary exhibitions.We needed many hours there.So I would recommend to everyone to wear comfortable shoes and visit it.Amazing experience!!!
"Written May 23, 2019",It is a MUST!!,What can I say about this wonder? Art lovers will feel themselves in heaven and those who are simple admirers of architecture will be able to enjoy a cultural walk through the different periods of painting and sculpture made by the greatest artists in the world. And access is totally free! What more could you ask for?
"Written May 23, 2019",Too much to see and so little time,"Entrance to the Gallery is free.  Most rooms have staff available that can answer visitors questions.  This time we decided to spend our time viewing just the Impressionists.  Other times we would go from room to room and eventually get ‘overloaded’ with the quality and quantity of art works.  The galleries have a very good representation of the Impressionist movement including works by Monet, Renoir, Degas and Cezanne.  I think next time a tour by one of the Gallery guides would be the best way to start the viewing of the gallery."
"Written May 23, 2019",So many great works of art and its Free,"We visited the museum around 9:30am on a Wednesday. It was not crowded but it was also while school was in session. It can be a little confusing the way the museum is laid out, going from room to room but there was always someone there to ask and direct us to certain artists. We looked at the map on line first and made a list of who we wanted to see. We spent about 2 hours there because we had a plan. It is a must see!"
"Written May 22, 2019",Super..b experience!,"It was such a great experience.I went there with my family;mom,dad,brother n my self.All of us enjoy a lot n had a good knowledge about the paintings which was in the gallery.There were paintings belongs to several time periods.Nice place to watch n good place for  children to improve there knowledge."
"Written May 22, 2019",Gallery and exhibition staff great - restaurant poor value and service.,"The staff generally at the National are friendly and efficient and add to the enjoyment of my regular visits. However, the cafe/restaurant does not measure up. The food on offer is not good value for money, nor is it particularly good. Two friends and I planned to have tea and cakes recently. However, the cakes did not look good and they were overpriced, so we settled for the tea."
"Written May 22, 2019",Vacation,Thoroughly enjoyed browsing the National Gallery and recommend anyone visiting London to check it out.
"Written May 22, 2019",Wonderful Art Museum!,If you love art it is a must for you. The museum entrance is free. Donations are encouraged. Maps are 2 pounds and worth getting as the museum is quite large. Plan your visit ahead so you can see your favorite artists and maximize your time.

Here I was around 2 hours walking to room to room...I like more British museum because there’s not only paintings, much stuff and interesting items. Like in Russia, eremitaasi.

"Written May 6, 2019",Great  at  Trafalgar Square,The place is amazing -  Trafalgar Square. I suggest to get here waking from Picadilli Circus.The Gallery is free unless you want to donate. Very interesting museums for those who likes paintings and art.
"Written May 5, 2019",Don't miss this free museum,"Go early, take a break for coffee/sandwiches in the darling cafe. This museum has the most wonderful collection of Impressionist art I have seen in a long time. Beautiful building."
"Written May 5, 2019",Sorolla exhibition blows us away,"The Redhead loves a bank holiday weekend outing. She chose to go to this exhibition if an almost unknown (outside Spain) impressionist. The exhibition and Sorolla's work are simply amazing. Master of Light, certainly, but also of composition (cropping, diagonals) and most unusually empathy. His paintings of darker days in late C19th Spain (a raisin packing workshop, a woman who had murdered her baby) demonstrated that a painter who was later to be commissioned for society portraits and a whole wall in an American museum started with work of great humanity. Poignant, beautiful, skilled and utterly mind blowing."
"Written May 5, 2019",Amazing time in national gallery,I went to the National Gallery in May 2019 and when I was there there was a  Leonardo da VinciPainting on show there and I was amazed just to see that one photo there is no admission fee to enter the medium or they ask if you would like to make a donation to support the museum it would be very much appreciated but you can easily spend up to 4-5hours looking at art work in this place
"Written May 4, 2019",Not to be missed.....,"Overlooking Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery holds the nation's main art masterpieces. Given entry is free and there is no excuse not to go inside even for a quick look at masterpieces from the likes of Da Vinci, Botticelli, Van Gough, Constable, and Stubbs. A must see gallery !"
"Written April 28, 2019",Sorolla Exhibition,"A brilliant exhibition of Sorolla's paintings, acclaimed master of light by Monet no less. Well worth a look at one of Spain's best artist's known for his portrayals of local and beach life. Excellent."
"Written April 28, 2019",Lovey escape from the busy crowds,"We wandered in here to get out of the sun for a wee while, I loved walking around this place and looking at all of the amazing paintings.The building is impressive inside and not overcrowded like some of the tourist places. There was always a quiet space to take in the paintings and relax.I would definitely visit here again."
"Written April 26, 2019",The Sorolla exhibition,Went specifically to the Sorolla exhibition. Must declare that I'm a big fan of his work. The exhibits were the best and most I've seen so far. I have seen some of his work in Madrid and visited his studio. I thought the ticket price was more than worth it for the large number of works on display. He is a relatively unknown outside of Spain but deserves to have a wider audience.
"Written April 26, 2019",Good impromptu visit.,"Didn’t plan to drop in but decided to as we walked thru Trafalgar Sq. Kids loved to see some original master pieces, enjoyed the quiet and the fancy (if expensive) coffee shop. Take your kids, you might be surprised!"
"Written April 24, 2019",Tudors and Stuarts,Went along with my daughter before going to the theatre. Wanted to seethe Tudor and Stuart’s galleries. Really great paintings and interesting notations alongside the paintings. Loved the miniatures....Could have spent all afternoon in there.
"Written February 17, 2019",Must sees,"It was my very first time seeing ""An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump"" by Joseph Wright of Derby, which captured perfectly the emotions felt by the children witnessing the slow death of a caged bird. This, along with the illuminated shadows just in the right places (remarkable!), makes this a masterful creation. It's not easy to walk away from it."
"Written February 16, 2019",Worth a Visit,"Well worth calling in if you are in the Trafalgar Square area. It's free but you should make a voluntary contribution at the various collection points. A lot of traditional paintings from artists such as Van Gogh, Botocelli, Di Vinci, Turner, Gainsborough etc."

"Written March 3, 2019",School Half Term Holiday day out,"Visited this London Gallery for the first time with my 12 year ild nephew and five year old son. Fantastic news, entrance was free. No long ques to get in either. Inside there was ample room for viewing and allowed fo chat . Conveniently, there was a kids interactive display. This was enjoyed by the five year old. The twelve year old enjoyed the narrative behind some of the paintings. A very enjoyable day."
"Written March 2, 2019",Great few hours ,Really impressed with the building and amazing artwork.Cannot believe that entry is free.Staff very helpful and well informed.
"Written March 1, 2019",#arttime,"Had a nice look round this gallery, went about 4.00 in the afternoon so it was very busy but entry and security was efficient and quick. Vast array of paintings, Monet and Van Gogh were personal highlights. The descriptions beside the paintings are interesting and simple enough for a cultural beginner. Gift shop was very reasonably priced and staff were friendly. "
"Written February 24, 2019",Always wonderful,"I've been there before and loved it, but this was a first visit for my friend, who loves Turner. She was delighted to find a number   of his pictures among the gallery's enormous collection of wonderful pictures. We also liked a nearby room with an exhibit of some of the gallery's newest exhibits and Holbein's painting of ""The Ambassadors."".And we had rest, relaxation, and some nice nibbles in the restaurant in the Sainsbury wing of the gallery. Quite quiet and peaceful the afternoon we were there.Don't miss the gallery's main shop on the ground floor of the Sainsbury wing. My friend is delighted with  her scarf in the green, violet, and white colors of the suffrage movement."
"Written February 19, 2019",Amazing art gallery and free,"The British do so much so brilliantly! Having been to many other art galleries worldwide, they don't compare. Such a range of magnificent pieces, so well displayed, with each labelled with a description. There are benches everywhere for you to sit and enjoy the art. They have money, Van Gogh, constable, turner and so much more. Being free to enter is amazing although they ask for donations of course. Lots of toilets, cafes and shops. A real treat, especially good on a rainy day! "
"Written February 19, 2019",Fantastic collection - you'll need extra time to see the very popular  impressionisticpaintings,there are quite a few areas in the Gallery that allow for a nice flow of people so you never feel trapped in a room. the impressionistic does get a bit full but there was always movement to allow everyone time to enjoy the collection
"Written February 17, 2019",a great happenstance,"I didn't set out to go here but found it after I arrived near my hotel.  Wonderful collection and interesting.  Also, saw Monet, Picasso, Van Gough pieces.  and free though donations appreciated."
"Written December 11, 2018",National Portrait galleey,"A collection of stupendous number of portraits that will amaze you.The only trouble is that it is a big place and it is tiring, but well worth it."

"Written December 11, 2018",Must see art museum,Great temporary exhibitions as well as permanent displays. Good audio guide which will provide information on a large number of paintings throughout the museum.
"Written December 10, 2018",Ideal for people who love painting,"If someone visits London and likes painting, it is a place they must have in choices to visit. It has a large collection of paintings of many famous paintings, including Picasso, Van Gong and others."
"Written November 26, 2018",Always wanted to visit - not disappointed,"We've been flying through London for 30 years and never done the tourist thing, so decided that it was time to make up for it and the National Gallery was on the list. So worth it but make sure you set aside a few hours to make the most of it."
"Written November 20, 2018",Great ,We were here 2 times in 2 days because it’s such a great place. Especially at a rainy day but also it’s a good day it’s a absolutely recommendation. 
"Written November 18, 2018",Awe-inspiring,"The ever-changing displays can be awe-inspiring - mostly free but check first.  Great location, in the hear of everything, but I'd be happier if it stayed open even late."
"Written November 18, 2018",Great visit!,Very interesting! Filled with wonderful portraits from every era and all different styles.  I loved reading the paragraphs beside each portrait.  They were interesting and brought the people and artists to life.  I recommend popping in for an hour or two.  
"Written November 18, 2018",Great Art,"So inspiring to look at the old masters. This time I spent a lot of time looking at paintings created in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. Rewarding."
"Written November 13, 2018",Major National art collection.,"The most comprehensive art collection in the capital. And costs nothing to visit, except for special exhibitions. My father took me as a ten year old and I have come back whilst visiting London ever since. This imbued me with a lifelong desire for art so don't think children might be turned off by the idea.As with all great collections it can overwhelm...so keep it simple and selective in your choice of viewing to avoid ""museum fatigue ."" Don't forget the National Portrait Gallery next door...a real gem."

"Written March 31, 2019",For Painting lovers,"If you don’t know anything about painting and art, you may want to skip this. Typical day is busy with students. Enjoy painting from Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Raphael, Monet and Van Gough. One of the best gallery I’ve seen so far. "
"Written March 31, 2019",Best free London thing to do inside,"It's a great museum seemingly focused on impressionist and earlier eras. Very good painting notes (and lots of seating!) make this a pleasure to browse. Since the collections tend to focus on variety vs. depth, it's particularly good for the easily-distracted or bored. And you can do this in a half-day, so it's great to add to Covent Garden, Parliament, and other nearby attractions.If you can (before late May 2019), I highly recommend the Boilly exhibit of Parisian scenes. It's one of the best exhibits I've seen for this era and exceptionally well-annotated to provide new discoveries."
"Written March 30, 2019",Gorgeous art and cool builidng,It was fun to walk around the National Gallery. The collection is excellent although Van Gogh's Sunflowers are on loan to the Tate. That was disappointing to miss that but collection was beautiful and well worth the time. Considering it's free-you can't beat the price. 
"Written March 25, 2019",Impressed with Impressionism,"I took an Uber (very convenient from The Tower of London) to Trafalgar Square, walked over to the National Gallery in 2 min. Got straight in at 4:30pm, free and no line. Went straight to the paintings I wanted to see (research online because some of them were on loan somewhere else) and I was done by 5:50 - closes at 6pm. Great and Fun because we made it like a scavenger/painting hunt! Highly recommended!"
"Written March 20, 2019",Saturday & Art,"Beautiful building, quick and safe access. Well-indicated floor plan of various artists and paintings"
"Written March 19, 2019",Superb!,"Absolutely magnificent collection, great access to great many masterpieces. Located in Trafalgar square, it is very easily accessed; one can spend an entire magnificent day there and still not see the entire museum. Well worth it!"
"Written March 17, 2019",Inspiring!,"If you have a spare afternoon in London, you must pay a visit to the beautiful National Gallery. In here you can find all the famous paintings from Van Gogh, Da Vinci to Rembrandt, Monet. With its location, you can combine this with a visit to Trafalgar Square"
"Written January 6, 2019",Go in the morning and stay until your eyes glaze over....,"It's like eating - no matter how good the food, I can only consume so much. The National Gallery has more incredible art than you will be able to digest in one visit, so just view your fill and vow to come back another day."
"Written January 6, 2019",You won’t regret a visit to this jewel,"Entry is free to this national treasure house. There is a wonderful collection of the best of European art throughout the centuries. Check at the reception desk for free guided tours which are available throughout the day. Special exhibitions, for which there is a charge, change regularly. The cafes serve acceptable food."
"Written January 6, 2019",Surprising,I had pre conceptions about this place.  Expected it to be full of oils of lord and lady so and so - and there are plenty of them.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the contemporary content - worth a visit.
"Written January 6, 2019",If there is one place to visit in London it is this,Every time I visit London I go to the National Gallery- sometimes several times. It has a great collection of paintings - mostly non- British and non contemporary. The British paintings are at Tate Britain and the contemporary paintings in Tate Modern. All three are great but the National Gallery has the biggest and the widest collection of all. It is overwhelming and for the first visit it is best to take a free guided tour and choose either to spend time in one hall or tow. Alternately buy a book at the great bookshop downstairs and just look at the 50 most famous paintings. DOnt spend more than two hours there! It is free and so go many times for a short while rather than spend a day.
"Written January 3, 2019",As good as it gets,"If looking a painting across the ages this is as good as it gets.  One of the worlds great collections, beautifully displayed.  Only issue was the Lanseer exhibition when we were there.  Very limited few paintings and sketches. "
"Written December 31, 2018",Art Lovers Heaven ,A must see where one is simply overwhelmed by great art.  Have a plan and know which pieces you want to see.  The layout is hard to follow in places but overall is manageable.  
"Written December 27, 2018",Awesome!,"Visiting the National Gallery was a dream come true. We had a ""highlight tour"" on Monday morning (december 10th) with Ed and he was terrific. The museum is really very well organized even if it's free! "
"Written December 16, 2018","Van Gogh, Monet, need I say more?",There was no lineup to gain entry - we were amazed. The National Gallery houses some of the greatest masterpieces in the entire world.
"Written December 13, 2018",Beautiful!,"This is possibly one of London’s most beautiful galleries! It had early works of Micheal Angelo on display as well as many others! The layout and division of art work is very pleasing as you walk through different eras and see the painting change in different centuries. It has a beautiful restaurant/café to sit and relax before you charge yourself to be on the move again, but the café can get busy sometimes.Also it’s free entry! While it’s free, I would strongly recommend donating at entrance or exit as it’s really worth the visit!"
"Written December 12, 2018",Amazing Art,No reason not to visit - as there is no cost to you and the works are spectacular.  Thank you LONDON for sharing these beautiful pieces with the world!

"Written September 5, 2018",Amazing Art,Was my first time in an art/portrait gallery and it was awesome! The place is quiet and conducive to learning and appreciating art! Would definitely recommend this.
"Written September 2, 2018",Great place!,"So many wonderful paintibgs and quite easy to get around. I am past the age of going to very big museums such as Louvre or Prado or National Gallery, but enjoyed this time. It is also nice that it is in the very centre so you can stop when tured and come back next time bus passes through Trafalgar square."

"Written August 27, 2018",Always a good visit!,"The National Gallery is a favorite of mine to visit in London as its entrance is free but at the same time, the exhibits are always a pleasure to see. It does tend to get crowded at times but i love that they have seating so when you’re tired, you can people-watch in peace. The staff is very helpful and I believe knowledgeable enough about the pieces on display. The special exhibitions are always interesting, but my favorite is their Impressionist exhibit. The museum is large enough but not so large as to overwhelm.The gift shops are nice as well if a bit pricey. Good quality items on sale like books, umbrealls etc.It’s also next to the National Portrait Gallery which is an interesting visit.  The location is so central that you’ll find a good restaurant, shop or theater in a few minutes."
"Written August 27, 2018",always a joy. ,Have just got membership and am very happy with it. Worth every penny. lots of interesting talks too 
"Written October 5, 2018","One of my favorite places, and it's free!","You can spend hours and hours here looking at great masterpieces, but my favorites are the Impressionists from the later 1800s, such as Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, and Degas.Right outside, there's Trafalgar Square and buzzing humanity to entertain you!"
"Written October 4, 2018",Incredible visit,"We lined up about 45 minutes before opening - were among the first few in the front of the line to brave the rain that morning. It was well well worth it. I recommend getting in line well before opening. Even though there were many people visiting that day it did not feel overcrowded. Skip the restaurant - the service is very slow and the coffee was just ok - and the hot chocolate was not the best. But alas, we were not there for the food or drink anyhow."
"Written October 4, 2018",Accessible Public Art,The gift of Art that keeps on giving. Curated in a manner that always amazes and ensures you want to come back again. 
"Written October 3, 2018",Great Saturday at the National Gallery,A great way to spend a Saturday. The National Gallery offers art to please most art lovers. And entry is free.
"Written October 3, 2018",We had an outstanding docent tour,"We went on a docent tour led by Helen.  I have been on many docent tours over the years, and she is one of the best.  Besides being very knowledgeable, and easily able to shift to another work of art when one is too crowded by other groups, she was amusing, entertaining and engaging.The museum is outstanding, but it's difficult (for me) to know where to start on where to focus without a tour."
"Written October 3, 2018",Great art,We visited the National gallery at Trafalgar.The Monet/Manet and many more French exhibits were fabulous.The vast impressive venue where you do not feel too crowded.The paintings were fabulous to watch

"Written September 30, 2018",Culturally relevant for any,"A building that is striking to look at, overlooking beautiful Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery surprised me a lot. I am not one that is heavily into the arts. In fact, most art is lost on me. Yet in visiting the National Gallery I was utterly captivated by the incredible works of art and the stunning interior architecture. Magnificent to behold, I recommend this to anyone... Even if you don't love art. "
"Written September 24, 2018",Dropped in for coffee and cake ,Compared to busy Trafalgar Square the gallery is a little bit of calm . We dropped in at 4 o’clock and had coffee and cake (with sandwiches ) . It was £20 ish for two which felt a little expensive but then look where we where. It’s a big eating space with benches and long tables . I can imagine it is very loud and busy at lunch time -but it suited us a 4 pm . 
"Written September 20, 2018",World class gallery with broad range of classic art and masterpieces,We visited the Gallery on our last afternoon in London. Bad mistake! We should have visited it earlier and come back several times. The Gallery has a range of art to suit all tastes. It’s humbling to see such genius on show and wish you had a thimbleful of what they have. The thing that impressed us was the hand held audio visual devices for which allows you take your time and look at pieces that interest. I can’t begin to imagine the amount of work and research that has gone into describing each individual piece of art.
"Written September 20, 2018",Great place but the special exhibitions are a bit pricey,"Great place, free of charge and in amazing location. Has a wide variety of impressionist paintings that impressed me. But the special exhibitions are a bit pricey"
"Written September 19, 2018",Get lost in this labyrinth and forget about the time!,A marvel that's what I think it is. Every time I go to London I must pop in the National Gallery and every time I end up leaving at closing time. The collection of Italian painters is very extensive. If you are interested in a few paintings specifically I would recommend buying the map of the museum as it is really easy to get lost in it! If you are not roaming you could navigate through the museum as well with the help of their website and find the paintings you are looking for quicker. Really a must-visit when in London!
"Written September 17, 2018",Must see,Always visit the National Gallery when in London.  The world’s greatest paintings.  You can find guides on the site of the Gallery and a list  of must see paintings online.  Admission is free. 
"Written September 17, 2018",Always worth a visit ,We spent a couple of hours in this museum to introduce our 20 year old daughter to some of the best art you can find. It was well spent time. 
"Written September 15, 2018",Fabulous collection ,"This is overwhelming. My best advice is to see one section at a time! I went to “learn and Draw”, where a few lovely artists explained the practice of landscape painting, and taught technique of doing a quick sketch while we were there: nice thing to bring back from a trip, although I don’t believe mine should be displayed!!Lovely building, and the newer addition works. "
"Written September 14, 2018",Generous free offer from the UK,"So many famous works from so many famous artists are right there, for free of charge! I cannot thank enough for this sort of generosity of this country!!I personally enjoyed Monet's and van Gogh's pieces very much. It wasn't too crazily crowded either. The museum is right next to the Trafalgar Square and lively Covent Garden market. It's absolutely one of the must-go places if you have an opportunity!"
"Written September 13, 2018",A must see and free,"Not often do you find a place with such history and it is simply the cost of a voluntary donation. There are Rembrandt, DaVinci, and Van Gogh and much much more. "

"Written November 11, 2018",Amazing,"An excellent visit.  Entrance is by donation which seems quite voluntary - pay on the way out if you want to assess the value first.   Do your homework before arriving, by artist, most famous works etc  - it is not really possible to see everything in one day.  "

We really recommend it!"
"Written November 8, 2018",A Beautiful Museum Filled with Exquisite Art  - mid 13th century through 1900,"In London for a short visit, my husband and I visited The National Gallery.  The building and architectural touches of the gallery are in themselves beautiful; the collection of art is priceless.  During our visit and until January 20, 2019, the museum features among other special exhibitions The Courtauld Impressionists From Manet to Cezanne.  This exhibition shown in 40 masterpieces on loan from The Courtauld Gallery which is also located in London overwhelms with beauty.  If you are a fan of impressionistic art, this exhibition is worth a trip to London as is the National Gallery itself.  Besides the art, there is a wonderful gift shop and a tasty  cafeteria type restaurant."

Even the children weren’t bored for a minute
"Written November 6, 2018","First class museum, and free!","I love the London National Gallery and visit it every time in London. I don’t get tired of seeing Van Gogh’s Sunflowers over and over. The main collection is varied. There are 2 buildings. You can’t miss it in Trafalgar Square. Don’t forget to go into the gift shop. I love my Sunflowers mug and tea towel. Sure you can get most things on line, but the memory of getting it at the Gallery makes it so much more enjoyable. Depending on your endurance, go a few times for a few hours each time."
"Written November 6, 2018",World class,"Most museums are designed and managed with a focus on the convenience of their staff and the vision of the curators and directors.The Gallery is all about the visitor. The light is just so that the viewing pleasure is maximised. Ridiculously confortable seating invites those who wish to rest, or to pause in awe before tgeur favourite masterpieces... or to nap. The other places tend to have obnoxious staffers gawking at a standing crowd of Hoi Polloi. The staff here is discreet, smiling, knowledgeable and helpful. Once I could not remember Mantegna's name and I just asked one of tge doormen where I could find a small drawing of a tomb in trompe l'oeil by a guy with an Italian name. Try that at the Louvre or the Uffizi... this guy never blin ked, ""Woukd that be Samson and Delilah by Mantegna? Room ..., sir, enjoy your visit"".The collection is wonderful. Arguably, together with the twin gallery, the world's finest painting collection. But the setting tops even the collection and the staff is out of this world.A place to spend many happy hours. Plus, you pay or not, admission is free, so even if you are broke or living hand to mouth this is a whale of a program for lovers of art and refinement."
"Written October 15, 2018",Evening Visit,"We went to the museum on Friday night when it is open late.  To be honest the place was not lighted very well for an evening visit,  We had to use our lights on our phones to read the displays and it was very dark in the large rooms.  Seeing the Rosetta Stone was a highlight and the Greek rooms were great, what we could see of them.  The place is huge, so if you have limited time you really need to cherry pick things to see,"
"Written October 15, 2018",Beautiful Museum,The collection at this museum is wonderful.  Just wish the Caravaggio room hadn't been closed during our visit.  That was the only letdown.  
"Written October 14, 2018",Beautiful collection of paintings covering the history of painting from more or 14th -19th century.,"I have been at the national gallery many times and always find it inspiring and discover new things. It has a nice collection on impressionists and also of Dutch Masters. I also love the collections of Iconic paintings. Because of it's central location you can also walk in and out just for 30 min or so. In the basement there are often themed expositions that go deeper into specific subjects. All in all, a must see for London. "
"Written October 14, 2018",Wonderful Impressionist Paintings,"My favourites - Monet, Van Gogh, de Vinci, and of course Rembrandt.  Almost didn't make it here during our trip, but so glad we did.  The grounds are beautiful and great for socializing in beautiful weather."

"Written October 7, 2018",Unfathomably amazing,"Free admission, rooms upon rooms upon rooms of gorgeous art from various artists (including some very well known ones). I usually don’t love art museums, but this one left me speechless."
"Written October 26, 2018",Art for all.,"Having not visited for a few years I was really looking forward to seeing everything on offer. If you are time poor you cannot appreciate all that's here.Lots of positives, nice shop, coffee shop, toilets. Special exhibitions at an extra cost.Negatives are the huge money boxes and in your face collectors as you enter the building suggesting £5 donations. Museums and Galleries should be free for all to enjoy. Not everyone can afford £5 every time. As a visitor I should not feel under pressure to pop a note, suggested or otherwise into the mansize money box. I feel I contribute through taxes, buying books/ gifts, having a coffee and returning to appreciate the works displayed.Expect to walk, seats are nicely placed to rest and take in the room. Lifts are available for those in need of assistance.  It's always busy.I would suggest you allow time to visit, at least a couple of hours. Then if you feel up to it pop in the Gallery next door.We need to support our museums and Galleries but, not with the in your face handover your money approach. A fiver in the box is less money to spend elsewhere in the Gallery. The pleasure of buying a book, bag or gift is taken away if you have handed money over under pressure/ encouragement of staff. Need to rethink this one!"

There is ample seating in most rooms, so when the hard floor wins the battle with your gel insoles, you can rest up and enjoy.  Just don't expect the free wifi reception to be very good.Lots of Dutch masters, some Turner will put you in the mood for contemplative cocktail somewhere."
"Written November 6, 2018",Great place to visit,Me and my wife decided to treat ourselves and go to the stunning national gallery.After all it was our anniversary and we love Renaissance painters and landscape painters too. Easy to locate favourite Artists and if you get stuck just ask and you will be guided in the right direction by the helpful staff. Restaurants nearby and theatreland just next door so you will be spoilt for choice in this part of London.
"Written August 6, 2018",Amazing exhibition of Monet artwork,"It was the absolutely brilliant exhibition. More, Monet works were presented from the different angle - through the buildings he painted. We enjoyed listening to an audio guiding us through the Monet’s paintings. We had a fabulous time at National Gallery. "
"Written August 4, 2018",Fantastic day trip,What a gem of a place to visit. I went with the family and had a fantastic time. Truly impressive artwork. Absolutely loved it and will be returning soon
"Written August 2, 2018",Incredible and FREE!,"I could spend days here!  It was so busy though, go right before closing to avoid the crowds. We visited with our adult children in peak season (we expected it to be busy), and this one of a very few attractions that were free to visit.  Thank you National Gallery!"
"Written August 2, 2018",A true delight in the center of London,I would wholeheartedly recommend a visit to anybody touring London.  They have a tremendous collection and I particularly enjoyed the Monet exposition.
"Written August 2, 2018",Always Fantastic,The national gallery is always Fantastic. I was with my friend for a school trip and I think that won't never be a museum as this. There are a lot of pictures by different artists came from different periods. 
"Written July 30, 2018",Its stunning interior reflects its beautiful art.,Very impressive collection of Impressionist art. I visited at the height of summer travel season and needed to dodge huge groups of school children and their teachers!
"Written July 30, 2018",wonderful every time,great collection of paintings in central location and with good views from central porch across Trafalgar Square and down Whitehall - we always visit when in London
"Written July 27, 2018",Awesome,An awesome building full of beautiful art. Centrally located and easy access. Fascinating and enthralling throughout ..... a must see in anyone’s visit to London. Thoroughly recommended.
"Written July 26, 2018",Go once,"One of those places that you just have to visit once. Wonderful paintings, a little gift shop, cafe and lots of places to sit if you get tired roaming arnd. "
"Written July 24, 2018",Great impressionist paintings,The was a Courtald exhibition on when we went and it had some fantastic impressionist paintings. It's almost impossible to see the whole gallery in one go. Highly recommended. 
"Written November 6, 2018",Reminder,I haven't made good use of the permanent exhibition for years. I was shocked to see so many great paintings from masters from all over the world! 
"Written November 5, 2018",loving van gogh,"you can find a lot of pictures there with a lot of history, my favourite is sunflowers by vincent van gogh"
"Written November 3, 2018",A treasure trove,"We were there for the (excellent) Courtauld Impressionist exhibition, but afterwards we looked through a few more galleries. There are famous paintings everywhere and you need a lot more time than we had to do it justice. The building itself is very handsome and the galleries feel spacious, although in the middle of a weekday it was still very busy."
"Written November 1, 2018",Very pleasent,"A lots of amazing paintingWe were a family with children aged 6 and 10 , and it was very interesting for everyone .. very recommended "
"Written November 1, 2018",Gallery visit,Love The National  Gallery. Good way to kill a couple of hours strolling around the gallery. I always find the exhibits interesting.
"Written October 30, 2018",Fantastic collection and free,I only had an hour to tour the gallery but was impressed by the number of great works on display. This would be a place I would return. 
"Written October 29, 2018",Amazing Art,There are endless rooms full of pieces from classical artists like Van Gogh and Monet.  This museum is free so it's a bargain!
"Written October 28, 2018",The best thing in London,One of the greatest galleries in Europe. A must-see in London. Allow yourself 3 hours minimum for the whole collection. This time it had an added value for us with the temporary impressionism collection. Treat for the eyes.
"Written August 23, 2018","worth returning, free of charge,","Some good stuff there like a few Van Gogh's and copy of (my fave) Caravaggio's boy bitten by a lizard. Like to pop in whenever I'm in London. Free of charge, photos allowed. A must if you in London. Probably 2 hours for average art-lover, and God knows how long for art-passionate. "
"Written August 23, 2018","OK for a brief visit, but pales in comparison to Florence and the Medici","Very easy to get to this location by tube or hop on hop off bus and in fact the square with its sculptures and columns is an impressive site and worth the trip on its own. Entry is free, but the interior collection of art works was a little underwhelming considering the options on offer in other parts of London. Worthy of a visit for the art critic or historian, but otherwise, save your money and travel to Florence."
"Written August 20, 2018",World-class painting gallery,"It is one of the most famous and most relevant galleries in the world. Be prepared for a few hours spent inside, if you want to see art from all periods displayed in the National Gallery. Not to be missed when in London!"
"Written August 16, 2018","So much to see, so little time!","We passed five hours here, enjoying the art and the commentaries provided on the audio tour. The range of art is incredible and the buildings are structurally beautiful. The naming of some of the wings (eg Sainsbury's) was a surprise, but needs must, I guess. It goes to show how it is a real National Gallery."
"Written August 14, 2018",Lots of Art in one stop,This gallery is free to the public.  There is so much to see!  You can choose to hit the highlights or spend half a day wandering and admiring.  
"Written August 13, 2018",Worth a visit,A superb collection of paintings. Try to go early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid massive crowds for the best viewing.
"Written August 6, 2018",Perfect for families ,this place it is better for family with kinds. There are a lot of entertainment for kinds. There is shop with souvenirs and games. Free entry .
"Written August 6, 2018",Splendid choice of greatest art works,"Appeared to be smaller than I expected with less of famous work than I thought. It was a good visit, I didn’t get too tired of art, but just enjoyed what was represented. Reasonable quantity and very beautiful building."
"Written August 6, 2018",Inspiring!,Beyond words to be in just scant feet away from some of the world's most renown paintings. Especially loved the medieval religious works.
"Written August 6, 2018",Fill out the missing pieces of your other global travels,"A lost Buddha head. A sarcophagus. The gates of an old Babilonian or Assyrian town. If you've ever been to Southeast Asia, Egypt, Iraq/Syria, and a number of other historical places around the world, you should come to the British Museum to fill in the gaps of missing and displaced objects that are now sitting in their vast collection. I would redesign the doors to the galleries to be much larger, there's a serious funnel going on when you're trying to reach the Rosetta Stone or the Easter Island statue, for instance. Go on a weekday and enter from the Montague Place entrance."
"Written July 21, 2018",Art and emotions,"An incredible catalogue of masterpieces from 13th to 20th century. It’s probably too much to visit in one day, we’ll be back again next trip to a London.It is recommended to get the audio guide (10 £ family package for 4) that will give detailed info on each painting. Photos are allowed, with no flash and no selfie stick. Most crowded area was the impressionists and Van Gogh rooms. "
"Written July 20, 2018","Brilliant, free, not to be missed","Make sure you go into the Turner, Constable, Gainsborough room. Three of England's great artists in one fabulous room. What a glorious place. And it's free. Amazing. Well, done London, you show the world how it should be done."
"Written July 18, 2018",Covent Garden ,Just walking past this restaurant popped in for oysters and a glass of bubbly. Excellent staff and good value. Highly recommended by my wife and son both fans of oysters. Happy hour 3 to 5pm great value. 
"Written July 18, 2018",Mini break,Have not been in for a long time and was so glad I visited. The treasures to look at... and available to take snaps of.. really made the trip worthwhile. Stunning... 
"Written July 17, 2018",Excellent collection,This is a less popular museum compare to the British Museum.  So go here if you are trying to avoid the crowd like I did.  It was a no stress and delightful visit.  The collection is extensive enough to take up at least half a day.  The neighborhood is very lively with a lot of bars and cafe.
"Written July 11, 2018",Well worth a trip,"good cultural explosion, not overly crowded, decently priced and a lot of variety. Would definitely recommend for a couple's afternoon trip."
"Written July 10, 2018",A gem in the heart of London,"The National Gallery is a treasure trove in the heart of London . Just behind Trafalgar Square, lies this splendid Museum of Arts , boasting some of the precious paintings that you could think of. They have the great names , thru the ages . Van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne, Rembrandt , Pablo Picasso. It might take you hours to explore, depending on your interest. To top it all, like all Museums in UK, the entry is free. "
"Written July 9, 2018","Enormous museum, lots of painting",A great museum that needs a bit of time. Be wary that its easy to get lost inside of it because all rooms are interconnected.
"Written July 8, 2018",Beyond the Obvious,"This gallery has as many famous paintings as any in the world. More interesting in some ways are some of the quieter corners of this enormous space. For uncrowded contemplation and better lighting there is the lower gallery, which is not open all the time. The early Renaissance works are also displayed in a less Victorian fashion that encourages genuine appreciation rather than box ticking of great old masters. A constant rotation of great exhibitions is another asset, and some of them are even free."
"Written July 6, 2018",Amazing Collection,"This is a great collection right on Trafalgar Square.  Definitely worth your attention, if you have even a passing interest in art.  Grab a map ahead of time, though, this is a huge building.  I also had a nice break with the cream tea in the cafe."
"Written June 13, 2018",Interesting,Interesting to have a look around- wide variety of art work... queues were non existant when we went... some of the more popular paintings were crowded- but not an issue. 
"Written June 12, 2018",Beautiful Artwork,Some of the best art is housed in this museum! I visited this museum and it took me almost 2 hours to view half of the museum. I would definitely recommend at least a good 4 hours to tour the museum.
"Written June 12, 2018",Beautiful spaces with amazing art,"I'm not a huge museum-goer, but the National Gallery has so many wonderful pieces of art, and a great gift shop."
"Written June 12, 2018","Pictures of my favorite artists, Monet, Degas, Goya, Picasso",We went on a Thursday.  It was a sunny day and the museum was crowded with school groups and tour groups.  It was difficult to look at some of the art due to the crowds.  The pieces I got to look at were lovely.
"Written June 11, 2018",Must See,"Beautiful building,  art that  defies description. Admission by donation. It’s one of the highlights of my week long visit to London. "
"Written June 9, 2018",Don’t miss the Monet Exhibition ,"It’s titled ‘Monet & Architecture’ but actually this exhibition which runs until the end of July 2018 features more than 70 stunning paintings covering a huge variety of subjects. Yes there are buildings and bridges, but also Monet’s characteristic water lilies, rivers, sea-fronts and landscapes - full of light and air - quite simply beautiful, and not to be missed."
"Written June 2, 2018",Awful cafe experience,"Poor customer service, the staff standing in the way of food and talking to each other not serving while you stood waiting. Food was bland and unpleasant, which after the process and the wait was kick in the teeth."
"Written June 1, 2018",A must see,"We visited this museum and the exhibits were so wonderful, I especially loved Van Goghs paintings of the crabs"
"Written May 31, 2018",You must go!,To stand in front of some of the most famous and beautiful paintings ever created is a thrill I will not soon forget. Magnificent building.  The gift shop has some wonderful prints of some of the more iconic paintings and a very good price.
"Written May 28, 2018",Always inspiring,"To be face to canvas with art work done by names of historical significance is awe inspiring. Having never been an art lover, I've become a National Gallery addict. The shop and display next door is also a worthwhile venture. The newly renovated cafe downstairs no longer serves scones but has a nice atmosphere. Food was good and after a half day of walking a welcome break. I tried the ""Fish Pie""... tasty. Something here has drawn me back 7 times."
"Written July 6, 2018",OMG...all that art!,"So far this was the best art museum i have been in. It is enormous, exciting and free. I stayed the entire day but only saw the highlights and then some. There is more that warrants another trip. Of course, this excitement does not apply if you in the words of my friend ""art, i just don't get it.""."
"Written June 30, 2018",Home of one of the 4 most important paintings in the world,"The highlight of the museum for us was seeing the Van Eyck portrait of Giovanni Amolfini and his wife. This painting has a story behind it that is too long for this space. The museum was well laid out and like most museums in London is free, but asks for a modest donation.  Many other important pieces here as well, but seeing the Van Eyck was a real treat."
"Written June 30, 2018",A Gallery ,"I have been to London quite a few times but never into the National Gallery, it was great to wander around and view all the various eras and genres of art work on display. From Constable to Monet, there is art for everyone to admire, what’s more it is free to enter. If you have an hour free I’d recommend popping in and exploring the gallery."
"Written June 28, 2018",Wonderful art--a must see for art lovers.,"We could have spent a whole day here, although we only had about 3 hours total.  I would have rated a 5 for the art, but the audioguide was confusing, and, we had a very rude waiter at the restaurant in the gallery."
"Written June 26, 2018",Fantastic Gallery,"You can literally spend days in the National Gallery.  With a collection of European paintings from the Middle Ages to 1900, it would be a challenge to see every painting in one day.  If you visit, you might want to choose an era - Middle Ages, Renaissance, Impressionism and concentrate on that one area.  There is an audio guide that you can use that provides an excellent narration of the major works of art in each gallery. This is possibly one of the largest collections of European art in the world and should not be missed!"
"Written June 25, 2018",Fabulous - Be Sure to Make Time to Roam at Leisure!,"Even if you don’t know much about the history of art or much about painting, this Gallery is a must! The experience of simply seeing the artworks from centuries ago adds a special sense of belonging to the human race and being human to your own life! You leave with memories, thoughts and admiration for the work, gifts, talents and dedication of others!The spaces are pleasantly arranged and you can sit to rest, admire the works or just take it all in - it is an experience in itself to see how art lovers come in droves and even more visitors to London just file through for the experience!It’s great for both young and old, with basic informative simple information about each work and from time to time there are art lessons with places available on a first-come-first-served basis!Unmissable, in my humble opinion...and a bonus for kids to be taken as youngsters for the broadening of their horizons..."
"Written June 25, 2018",Great Arts for free,"Admission  to the National Gallery is free and donation is most welcome to keep the museum open. I enjoy visiting this art museum for its wonderful collection of Impressionist paintings the like of Picasso, Cezanne, Monet, Degas and many others. The museum also houses a vast collections of Byzantine, Renaissance and classical paintings by masters:  Holbein, Canellito, Gainsborough, Turner, and many others. I enjoy the peaceful and spacious exhibition rooms where I can sit and take time to enjoy the paintings and an afternoon tea at the cafe. National Gallery is a remarkable place to relax and enjoy work great artists. It is a must visit Gallery in London not only for its collections of great arts. It’s a good starting pointing to explore London.  Outside the Gallery is the Trafalgar Square, It’s a walking distance to the Buckingham Palace, Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, London Eye.  The famous Regent Street and Oxford Street. "
"Written June 25, 2018",A London must see,"As a Londoner I often go to the National Gallery.  Free class art, what more could you want.  On this day I went see Chris Offili's tapestry triptych ""I know why the Caged Bird sings"" which was on for a limited period.But this is not a review of that.  More some pointers on visiting the gallery.  My first suggestion would be to enter through one of the side doors; that way you can miss the queues.  Secondly, don't just look at the portraits.  Look up to the ceiling and down onto floors.  Why? Well just one example is the staircase and landing at the main entrance; rather than me tell you what's there why not have a look.  It's worth it and most people just walk over it without realising it's there.Also try to avoid going as part of a guided tour with a set amount of time.  Some days I am in and out within 20 minutes.  Other days I can be there for hours.  One day I followed the sight lines created by the curator and it changed the way I looked at those portraits.Everyone can have a different experience the museum.  But whatever the experience, it's worth a visit"

"Written January 6, 2018",Wonderful and overwhelming,"As with all large city museums, this is a bit overwhelming.  Have some caffeine before you go.  There are several paintings by cubists that are lesser known and worth seeing.  "
"Written January 4, 2018",Always love coming here and never get to see everything,A fantastic place that you can lose yourself in.  Never enough time in a day to see it all.  Create location in Trafalgar Square so easy transport from all around London.There is no charge though it is definitely worth a donation if you can manage it.
"Written December 30, 2017",Great collection of pictures,"The National Gallery is one of the best museums of London. There is no entrance fees, therefore you pay only with your time to see a great value collection of art pictures. There are about 50 rooms to visit, full of pictures made by great artists: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Van Gogh, Rembrandt only to name a few. I highly recommend a visit of at least 2-3 hours."
"Written December 26, 2017",Unexpectedly unfair stuff ,"We went to visit this amazing museum on the 22nd December, as a group we entered the side doors full of rucksacks, coats, gloves and scarves and immediately went to the cloakroom. There were two women who told us they did not accept items from groups because they had little space. We were quite disappointed, but we moved on with our visit. After four hour, going out from the main front door, we found out there was an huge cloakroom where we could put our belongings. It’s been an awful experience."
"Written December 24, 2017",Always a pleasure to visit,It never disappoints. Always a treat to visit and see such tremendous pieces of art on exhibition.Really enjoyed the large galleries displaying stunning works of art.It was quite busy in the mid-afternoon so usually try to visit during the morning.

"Written December 5, 2017",The Immortal Leonardo Da Vinci,"National Gallery in London is one of the most beautiful treasures of the mankind where you can see remarkable paintings from the Early Renaissance to the French Impressionists.  Whenever I go to London, I always take several hours to re-visit it or  at least to see again two of Leonardo's Masterpieces, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that after many years, The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist.was moved to a better place in the Gallery where the value of this fantastic drawing is so well highlighted .  If you go there, take a close look at the face of The Virgin.  You have never seen anything like that, the Beauty and the Joy of the Virgin, while looking with motherly love at  the baby Christ and baby John the Baptist.Do not be concerned about costs because THERE IS NO ENTRANCE FEE"
"Written November 15, 2017",Awesome!,"It's one of the best art galleries in the world in my opinion. The works range from early medieval up to the turn of the 20th century. Some real stand out pieces here from all the major artists. It is very large, with lots of rooms, but the paintings are well spaced out. It's got a good cloakroom £1.50 per item, plus a nice restaurant to have a snack or cuppa. They also do free 1 hour tours which I did today - lots of good info about the building and some of the key paintings. Lovely large art book shop too. Oh yes, it's free entry too. 600 years of great art for free!"
"Written November 14, 2017",George Stubbs Visit,"Reception told me where George Stubbs ""Whistle Jacket"" was, and I was off. Husband couldn't keep up with me. I was determined to see that painting before all others. It's positioning in the gallery on the 3rd floor, allowed me to see it from afar, and I couldn't move fast enough. I traveled thousands of miles and decades of my life to finally see Whistle Jacket in person. As I was only 2 half glass doors away, I broke into sobs - I'm sure the security folks thought me strange, but I was here. Finally! That painting was mine to admire for as long as I wanted....For FREE!From this George Stubbs fan who came to this museum for only 1 painting - It is a must see, even if you aren't an art fan. Just saying to your grandchildren you saw ""Sunflowers"" in person is a epic.Please enjoy all this museum has to offer. Even my husband was moved by a painting or two, and I never thought that would happen. "

"Written May 23, 2018",MOST WONDERFUL DISPLAY OF ART,The magnificent display from the works of so many masters was a joy to behold..Turners works were magnificent as was Gainsborough...visitors to London should have it on their MUST SEE list.
"Written May 21, 2018",Free! - and great,"Located directly at Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery is perfect even for the not-so-artsy spirit, because it’s free to visit and you can check out only a coupleof paintings and spend 10 minutes there, or hang out the whole day surrounded by some of the world’s most famous artists. Right now (May 2018) they have one copy of van Gogh’s Sunflowers there (2nd floor, room 43), which by itself is worth the visit. It is surrounded by other impressionists that deserve equal attention, though, so it makes for a very rewarding visit. "
"Written May 21, 2018",Artistic Majesty,Three centuries of Royal and aristocratic collecting are on display at this magnificent and free museum. I always make a beeline for the 17th century Dutch collection but no matter your preferences there is something for every taste.
"Written May 19, 2018","Amazing art, rude security guard",It is an absolute privilege to be able to see art of this exquisite calibre absolutely free. An absolute jewel in London’s crown. My visit was spoiled however by the untrained bullying security guard who was extremely rude and unhelpful when I had unwittingly walked up the wrong steps to the exit rather than the entrance. All he had to say was that there was a bag check and politely pointed me in the right direction. Instead he gave me a Rules is rules spiel reminiscent of a prison warden. Come on National Gallery - have you not heard of customer service training?
"Written May 13, 2018",Recent Monet exhibition,"Just marvellous from start to finish  -  obviously it would be ideal to have had a private viewing but back in the real world, this was pretty special."

"Written April 29, 2018",Democratic treasure,"In a city where you must pay for everything, the National Gallery (or other wonderful museums such as British M and so on) represent one of the rare places where the treasure of beauty and culture is open, easy and free for everyone.The real and pure luxe.And it is one of the places where the contradictions of modern mass tourism emerge: here you see exquisite paintings visited by huge amounts of people  who often are not interested in art and walk around looking for famous images to take in a selfie. Still, a wonderful collection and a privilege to experience."
"Written April 24, 2018",It's Free!,"It's free and in the center of London life. No real masterpieces, but it's free. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon in London."
"Written April 23, 2018",So Much to See and So Little Time,This is an excellent art museum to visit for an hour or several hours.  It is amazing a level of top notch art that is one display and entry if free.  It is definitely worth a visit while in London
"Written April 23, 2018",Monet and Architecture,"Visited to attend this exhibition. My son is an art A level student and it feels a bit steep shelling out £20 for him. However, I cannot deny the quality of the exhibition, with nearly 75 Monet paintings, some very rarely seen in public. A number of the paintings are early works and quite a contrast to his epic series from Giverny. The paintings of Antibes are stunning, full of Mediterranean colour and light. It was extremely crowded which was very irritating considering the cost, so try and avoid peak times.The main galleries represent astonishing value, being free of charge and offering masterpieces at every turn.If you fancy trying some of Britain's stalest cakes, eat in the cafe."
"Written April 23, 2018",Nice attraction!,"It's was good, you have a LOT of hallways with all kinds of great art hanging on the walls! We've been there for two hours and still haven't seen all. If it's really your thing you need even five hours there. Great gallery! "

"Written April 22, 2018",Beautiful!,This museum houses some of the most incredible works of art in the world. The building itself is a work of art in gorgeous architecture and design. Unfortunately I only had a few hours here. You can easily spend an entire day here and still not see everything. If you are an art lover this is a must see. And like all London Museums it's free.
"Written April 17, 2018",Always take time to go,This is a must if you have a spare hour. Some very impressive and famous works of art here and it is a personal favourite of mine.
"Written April 16, 2018",Monet & Architecture,I went to see this exhibition on Saturday morning. I had booked the tickets online. It was all very well organised. I thorougly enjoyed Monets exhibition. I learned so much about Monet as a person as apposed to his works. I found it very informative. It was very busy but i only realised while there that it had only opened since the Monday. If I were living in London I think I would go during the week. It was hard to see the pieces properly. Everyone was walking in front of everyone. At one point I seemed to be following a man with his young child whom he had in his arms so it was difficult to see the paintings. I just went a different route but I did go through it quicker than i would have liked because of the crowds. It would be great if they had some system of ways to walk around and if people wanted to stay longer on one piece there would be room to go around them. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. So glad I got to see some of Monets pieces.
"Written April 2, 2018",A delight,"Went in again to enjoy the collections that are on display in this wonderful place last Sunday (Easter Sunday). The place is so massive that you can spend a full day in there just looking at works from all those talented artists and soak in their works. And the best thing is it’s for free!!! Was very crowded especially when you get into the display of famous artists like Van Gogh, Gaugin, Renoir to name a few. It sure is a place worth a visit!! "
"Written February 21, 2018",Awesome exhibits,This is a wonderful museum to spend an hour or so in while soaking up some English culture. Amazing that museums like this are free. Very educational and pleasing.
"Written February 17, 2018",A Must See in London,"We only had six hours in London and didn't have a plan for the day we were just going to see were we ended up. The rain was pouring down and we were freezing as we found our way to Trafalgar Square, so we decided to pop in here to get out of the cold. Its free to enter, but donations are welcome. There are guided tours if you have the time, unfortunately for our party we only spent an hour here, but we will definitely be back. Its great to see budding artists sitting copying the masterpieces. With limited time we decided there was one painting we had to see before we left, Van Gogh's Sunflowers. It was easy to find as there was a big crowd gathered around it. All in all too short a visit."
"Written February 15, 2018",First Visit to the National Gallery,"My husband and I visited the National Gallery for the first time a few days ago. It is free but you are encouraged to make a donation. We both really enjoyed it. It was certainly busy, but not so much that you couldn’t stand and appreciate the amazing artwork on display. We particularly loved seeing work by Degas, Monet, Van Gogh and Cezanne to name a few. We spend around 90 minutes at the Gallery, but we would recommend to stay longer if you can . "
"Written February 12, 2018",Free entry to incredible art!,"The best thing about the National Gallery is the art. The range and the artists on display are quite incredible. The second best thing is that it is FREE! On easy-to-access Trafalgar square, this museum is one of my favourites in London. I particularly love the Impressionists, but their collection of paintings by Turner, Da Vinci and a slew of other famous, and less famous artists are well worth the visit.There is a great coffee shop downstairs where you can relax during, before or after your visit."
"Written February 2, 2018",Girlie 50th Birthday Celebrations!,Lovely to walk around and while away the hours. As a non artist I found it very interesting and even if you are not into art you have to admire the work there. Well worth a visit.
"Written January 28, 2018",Interesting but somewhat dull ,"The gallery itself is very well kept and thoroughly cleaned. There are a large number of paintings here, though I think that they can only be appreciated by true art buffs. As a possible improvement, I think it could be better if the staff in each of the rooms actively interacted with the public - such as by providing information about the paintings. Other galleries I have been to have been far more interactive and interesting. "
"Written January 22, 2018",Spectacular,I am obsessed with art and especially with paintings and this museum is one of my favorite place in the world!!!
"Written January 17, 2018",Joseph Wright of Derby,"Please. If you love art look for Joseph Wright of Derby - Experiment With a bird in an Air Pump. Arguably the best painting in the World. Here the Age of Science meets the age of invention and mystery. The moon is the only source of light, and for the first time we have subjects not looking out from the picture but with their head in their hands. I don’t need to overstate the scientist- he is outstandingly painted. "
"Written January 10, 2018",Art work was amazing - Must do!,"It's FREE and the collection of art work is amazing.  My 11 year old daughter was mesmerized by the 14th century paintings of goddesses and gods. She loves the little description of each painting.  We only had time for 1.5 hours there, but we could have stayed a good 3 houurs."
"Written January 8, 2018",disappointing and overpriced afternoon tea,"£32 a head for 4 of us and we were offered a very poor selection of 'sandwiches'. One finger each only of cheese and another of cucumber. The two remaining ones were not even sandwiches but croutons (one each!), one with humous (evidently this was the substitute for the smoked salmon of which they had run out but didn't inform us) and the other had a small spoon of piccalilli and the thinnest transparent 1cm wide strip of ham. When I asked for ones with no piccalilli I was given a small dish with strips of ham - self assembly? No bread? TOTAL waste of my families money and I shall be taking this further."
"Written April 1, 2018",Incredible art gallery,London has some of the best free art galleries and museums.  They ask for a donation of £5 but it is not  mandatory.  The art works on display here are some of the best in the world.  Be sure to visit - must do.
"Written March 28, 2018",Tim and Tom's tour,We had an hour to spare and spent this time looking at selected art works. It would be possible to spend at least half a day here...so many famous artworks and artists on display and beautifully and peacefully laid out. A wonderful experience

"Written March 24, 2018",Very impressive collection,"Very impressive collection of amazing paintings- but so huge that you need a minimum of 3-4 hours to do full justice to it! The staff were largely helpful and cooperative. While the entry is free, you are expected to donate £10"

"Written March 13, 2018",Incredible,Unbelievable collection.....spent 4 hours messmerized.....All the great impressionists were there.   Probably my favorite stop in all of London.
"Written March 11, 2018",The national gallery,An excellent collection of impressionist and post impressionist art as well as international art that is done by the masters of their kind. An excellent collection which failed to disappoint. Expect to spend a full day here and don't hesitate because it is well worth it.
"Written March 7, 2018",Heaven for art lovers,"Sitting at the top end of the Trafalgar Square, National Gallery is a grand, elegant and massive art gallery. National Gallery was formed in 1824 and it started when the British Government bought 38 paintings from an insurance broker. Today it houses of 2,300 paintings dated from 13th century to 20th century. Two third of the collections are from private donations. I came here on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't very busy. I had made a list of paintings which I wanted to see and with the help of an audio guide (£5), it made my visit absolutely rewarding. My most favourite artist is Canaletto due to my love of Venice, but National Gallery also displays many famous artists' paintings such as from John Constable, Joseph Turner, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Claude, Rembrandt, Michelangeio, Titian and Leonardo da Vinci...etc. All paintings are displayed on one floor but it was spread over 60 rooms and it is huge. I spent 4 hours at the gallery and still didn't feel enough. National Gallery houses one of the best collections of paintings in the world and it is free. This is a MUST visit gallery if you fancy art and paintings. Highly recommended!Tips: i) The information leaflet that comes with the audio is awful. Its map is unclear and the whole thing is in black and white. Spend £2 & get a proper map if you can afford it.ii) Avoid the National Cafe inside the gallery. It's a tourist trap and is overpriced, even its signature dish (i.e. cakes/ scones) is well below average. There are many good cafes at Leicester Square and Covent Garden so don't waste your money here.iii) There are few electric sockets at the Central Hall (level 2) which can be used to recharge your mobile's battery."

"Written October 7, 2017",Never fails to delight and inspire,I kind of feel sorry for visitors from abroad who may only be able to spend a short time in this world-class gallery. Those of us lucky enough to visit regularly can always find something to look at in detail which we have only glanced at previously because of the wealth of the collections. My tip would be to look online before a visit and make a list of priorities. I also printed off a map in advance as the room numbers can be quite confusing. Fabulous gift shop though some items a bit overpriced. If you have never visited make time to do so - I've never heard anyone say they were disappointed!

That's why we love London!"
"Written September 20, 2017",Amazing if you're an art and history fan!,"Been here 3 times and I love it. I do recommend paying for a virtual tour guide (headset) though as this place is HUGE. It's very easy to miss rooms filled with beautiful paintings.Makes for a lovely date, day with friends and brilliant for educational visits. Be aware, it's central London AND it's free, so it's (sadly) very busy! If you're going with a large group, call and ask when would be best to go. Also, you ideally need to leave yourself about 3 hours as there is a lot to see, so if you like to read the artists notes, you'll need to leave yourself plenty of leisurely time to do so. "
"Written September 14, 2017",World class collection,This collection is magnificent. Absolutely worth a visit. Plan ahead in order to make the most use of your time.
"Written September 13, 2017",Infomrative experience.,Thoroughly enjoyed a break from the bustle to enjoy a lovely informative time walking around the gallery. Lots of little gifts on offer. Spacious and welcoming.
"Written September 13, 2017",Must visit when you are in London,"Always something new to enjoy and discover in this majestic art collection. Covers all periods of European Art, just focus on the painters you like and enjoy! "
"Written September 10, 2017",One of the best museom,"One of the best museum in the world.Well organized, full of masterworks.We went to top up Turner from Tate, and it has been a very pleasant, entertaining afternoon.As usual with London museums, great service, great atmosphere and great bookshops, including the possibility to have an high res print of any painting you liked."
"Written September 9, 2017",Interesting and informative tour,"This tour last just an hour and covers a limited number of paintings. This was ideal for someone like me who likes art but knows very little about art and the history of art.By concentrating on 4 or 5 paintings you get to learn a lot about the paintings and the style of painting at the time they were painted. The relatively short tour combined with an excellent guide meant that even if you have just a limited interest in art you are not going to get bored, which is inclined to happen if you try to cram too much into a visit to a gallery or museumThe one suggestion I would have would be for the guide to give a little more information about what else there is to see in the gallery. This could be done when walking between the paintings that we visited and would give people a better idea if there was something in particular that they would like to go back to look at after the tour."
"Written September 7, 2017",One of the world´s great art museums,"From medieval art to Picasso - you will find a rich supply of pieces of art, many of which are so important that they are reproduced in text books on the history of art. My personal approach is to buy a guidebook and read before entering since such books focus on the gems of the collection, which I then hopefully recognize. Mostly I return another day for a ""consolidating"" visit. In this museum, a third and even fourth day is not vasted."
"Written November 6, 2017",Very artistic place,"It is a lovely and a place full of art. If you have a spare day I would recommend going there to fill yourself with a magic of art. It is quite a large museum, would probably take you around 3 hours if quick look through each painting :) I've been there few times already and I would go again :)"
"Written November 4, 2017",Must see,"The free entry in London Museums is a great idea to give everyone the opportunity to see and appreciate art. It's not common in other places, so I think that leave an offer it's the correct response. The collection is stunning, Monet, Van Gogh ( one of his famous Sunflowers ) Renoir, Seurat, Turner, Rubens, Raffaello, Tiziano, Leonardo (La Vergine delle Rocce) Michelangelo, Guercino... count at least 3 hours to visit the most important master pieces. The buildings is also interesting ti see, if you go to London you have to stop here."
"Written November 1, 2017",Big group - a few youngsters and adults,"Was a great time but A LOT of walking. Was exhausted after but the teenagers all enjoyed themselves. A lot to see, something for all ages.I would say a 'must see' for tourists and Londoners alike."
"Written October 26, 2017",Awesome Experience That Was Not Expecting,We are not Art experts nor do we usually go out of our way to visit Art Museums anywhere. We were wandering the area and noticed it was still open (Friday night I believe). So we stumbled on in and then didn't want to leave. Very impressive displays and paintings by renowned artists. Awesome building and free to get in. Now that I have seen it I will make a point to visit more Art Museums while I continue to travel the globe. It is worth the time to drop in and enjoy this fine Gallery. 
"Written October 13, 2017",Fabulous place !,"We have visited the National Gallery many times but there is so much to see that every visit is like the first time and new.This gallery has a fabulous selection of works from the greatest artists who have ever lived . If you love art a visit is a must.This visit was to see a specific exhibition ... Van Eyck and the Pre Raphaelites which was a wonderful exhibition bringing home to me some of the ideas that helped form the apes Raphaelite movement .This gallery is a place to wander, browse and marvel.What is more, it is free."
"Written October 10, 2017",A chance to see some national treasures for free!!,"We only spent hour or so in the National gallery before heading off for a West End show. I've often visited in the past, but had forgotten just how many famous paintings are on display, including works by Monet, Renoir, Constable, Van Gogh and Stubbs. Bearing in mind that there is no compulsory charge, this is a great way to pass some quality time in London."
"Written October 7, 2017",Loved the impressionist section!,"There is much to see at the National Gallery, but I particularly enjoyed the impressionist paintings they had. There is something special about seeing a familiar painting in person and being able to view it up close. There were many artists and paintings that I recognized. I also enjoyed the architecture of the building itself. It's worth stopping by. One additional note is that most of the museums in London are free. When I entered this one, the employees stated that the museum is free, but they request a donation. They suggest £5. They have a large container to place your donation."

"Written July 27, 2017",Chris Ofili's Tapestries,"Grayson Perry's doing them, an now another male artist tackles large scale tapestry.The story is well told, with a special installation of preparatory drawings and the finished piece in a muralled room. The work is technically challenging, pushing the craft to another level managing to imitate watercolor with wool.Of course other treasures in the gallery include: impressionist 'greatest hits', Flemish, Dutch and Southern European masters, including a current comparative exhibition of Rembrandt and contemporaries, and of course early Renaissance work. One of the most interesting galleries is the ""gallery A"" in the basement at Orange Street entrance end. It's a hotch-potch of periods of work deemed second rate! (Academy & 'school of...) You can get up a little closer and they are hung closer and in a much more comparative manner."

"Written July 11, 2017",Varied collection of top artists,"The National Gallery has an impressive art collection from the 12th to the early 20th Century, well presented in lovely rooms and with clear explanations.  There is a room (quite large) dedicated to the English painters, Constable, Gainsborough, Turner, Reynolds, Stubbs.  The french impressionists are well represented, with Cezanne, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Seurat, Degas and Renoir among others.  There was a special exhibition of Rembrandt and Rubens.  Lots of others, too many to mention.  An art lovers feast. "

"Written June 25, 2017",You must do the free tour at the National Gallery,"I go the audio tour which was great. But the highlight was the free guided tour - amazing!! I don't know my guide's name but I thought he was fabulous - he was not pretentious at all and was such a great interactive speaker. He chose three works of art and spent @ 20 minutes on each one with fascinating stories -- it was one of the best parts of my trip - I just loved it. I believe the tour leaves twice a day from one of the lobbies - one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. Please do make time for it and you won't regret it. "
"Written November 26, 2016",More Caravaggio please,"I visited the current exhibtion centring on the work and influence of Caravaggio. The exhibition was well laid out and well presented. However, it would have been strengthened by more works by Caravaggio himself. The two key exhibits, beautifully set out side-by-side already belong to the National Gallery. I am London-based, but I wonder if someone travelling to the city specifically for this event would have felt it was rather slight, or light on major works. It compares poorly with some of the great exhibitions such as the Leonardo da Vinci  and the Rembrandt which the Gallery has achieved in recent times"
"Written November 25, 2016","Great art, centrally locsted",The national gallery is at a prime location of the Trafalgar Square.

It does get very very busy and somewhat uncomfortably crowded at times - but that's a given for a free London attraction such as this. They have a great variety of art to suit all tastes. "
"Written April 29, 2017",Beautiful place with lots of history right at Trafalgar,"We have been to London numerous times but this is the first time here. We paid and went into the Michelangelo & Sebastiano Exhibition. Beautiful. Not only did they have the paintings, they had letters written by the masters and the pre-sketches (studies) of some of the paintings. Very interesting to see the before and after as it were. The rest of the gallery was free and well worth the time spent. Two things I loved. Seeing the progression of painting styles through the ages, and actually being able to see in front of me, things I grew up knowing about from books, tv, etc was moving. "
"Written April 12, 2017","a must go in winter, when it is coolish outside,wonderful history","having seen most of the major museums in the world, i must be honest, that those in london are slightly palladian, not s strict as in st petersburg where the old russian women sneer at you when ever u go near a pic so unlike the dutch musuems"
"Written April 2, 2017",Stunning,"This was my 3rd time in here and i still find it amazing, we've been to lots of the major art galleries around Europe and this is still the best, from Constable to Canaletto, Van Gogh to Titian you could spend hours in here and its free."
"Written March 29, 2017",Overlooked by me for years,When I was young and even when working in Soho for 28 years I did not appreciate what treasures were on my doorstep and this one of them. I have now made made many visits and spent hours here now I am retired. If you have never been and like me you are learning about art you are in for a treat.
"Written August 28, 2017",Big gallery - leave plenty of time!,"As an art student who has never been here, I thought it was time to pay a visit. It's free entry! I was astonished by this, but pleasantly surprised - donations are welcome; I'd rather purchase a guide book.This place is huge, and takes plenty of time to look around, so make sure you leave lots of time to visit. Also, don't just visit because it's raining, we went on a sunny day and the building allows natural light to flood in, allowing you to view the paintings in their natural colours.I found the best way to explore this gallery was in room order, starting at room 1. Wander in, have a look around, and pick the painting that catches your attention - there'll be one in every room. That's how I like to view paintings. There are so many amazing canvases, that there is almost an embarrassment of riches, so seek out what you like!Highlights for me; Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers' are as impressive as you think, Holbein's 'The Ambassadors' is impressive in it's scale and execution; Turner's 'The Fighting Temeraire' looks better in real life than any photograph can ever show. Vigee Le Brun 'Self Portrait in a Straw Hat' is a fantastic painting - particularly worthy of note as a painting by a woman in a gallery dominated by men.The women's loo's, I am advised, weren't fantastic - my wife was an unwilling participant in a game of 'find the toilet paper' Hence, I've docked a mark on my review. However, our tea and coffee from the espresso bar were nice, and the two shops (they want your money!) were well stocked, and not just with tat. Staff were friendly and helpful. This isn't a place to visit to fill some time, you must put this on your list of places to visit. Oh; it's an art gallery, with paintings displayed for viewing; it's not a place with interactive exhibitions for bored kids who haven't learned how to appreciate paintings, so bear this in mind. And to top it all, it faces Trafalgar Square. What's not to like?"
"Written August 24, 2017","Wonderful, FREE art gallery","The National Gallery is immediately to the north of Trafalgar Square, and is open to everyone without charge.  That said, a 5 pound donation / person is requested.   Still a huge bargain, as this is a world-class art gallery with works across a wide range of styles and periods.   Allow at least 2 hours (preferably 3) to enjoy this wonderful institution."
"Written August 22, 2017","Soul,friendship and presents.","As you enter one of the greatest art collections of the world,you gasp. You gasp not just at the top notch quality of so much to be studied in a lifetime there but to be absorbed with  pleasure in a day of what catches your eye and leads you astray. To be in a building where,if you are Italian or Dutch you can feel thrillingly robbed by pillaging of all the great painting that might  have been at home. You will be shocked and overwhelmed by this legendary parade at the heart of London.        The there is the wrapping and all ther rest: The cafes ,the best restaurant off Trafalgar Square and the best present in town to be bought as classy but  modest,from  informal trips to what to buy at Christmas.There is the catching up on art history,the special once in a life time events and  where to meet your favouritre people without breaking the bank."

And even from right outside its doors you have a beautiful view. And should you lose your way this is no catastrophe but a chance to make new discoveries. And in less than no time the friendly warders will put you on the right path again. I have only one grumble: the silly picture takers. There you are, lost in the contemplation of one of your favourites, and snap! snip! one of those barbarians enters the room, draws his/her ""smart"" phone, and snap! snip! kills the picture, and  snap! snip! the picture legend, and then hurries off to his or her next victim.

"Written August 11, 2016",Wonderful paintings,"Very worth visiting for everyone how likes paintings and is interested in arts. You can spend hours on end there, walking through the Gallery and admiring all the gorgeous paintings. Making Pictures of them is allowd, without flash. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Good for a rainy day."
"Written July 28, 2016",Paintings ,"If you are into paintings, this is a place for you. And if you aren't, it's still worth it to check it out. If you are interested in studying various paintings, make sure to take part in the tours offered by museum. "
"Written July 27, 2016",One of London's Gems,"One of the best collections of art, from across the ages, and all for free. Each room is so rich in its treasures that you could probably spend an entire week going around it and still not take in every room and every piece in the collection. I don't think that there is any gallery in the world that can match the quality and diversity of the collection for free. The National Gallery is surely one of the places that helps to make London such a popular destination for tourists."
"Written July 26, 2016",David Hockney Exhibition,"This is a simple and short review. If you are in London don't miss this exhibition.  These are not portraits. These are David Hockney portraits and they are riveting. You find yourself viewing the 82 portraits and then viewing them again, spending time on each one of them as if they just won't release you. Don't miss it and remember to pre-order tickets on-line because they are fully booked."
"Written July 25, 2016",Perfect spot on a rainy day or any day,Fantastic gallery of impressive paintings! Take advantage of the free tours offered and take a deeper look into different paintings and what the artist was trying to convey. 
"Written July 20, 2016",Get In There and Spot Your Drinks Coaster,"The thing with everyday life, is, you are surrounded by the great arts. You are getting Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Turner, Da Vinci and Matisse, all day, every day.So: for the majority of people who think 'culture and arts' are for the posh and the brainy - you're wrong. Wherever you are right now, reading this, there is probably a picture or tune, very nearby, which is a classic.Many of your favourite TV ads use classical music. Bach's Air on a G string and Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata are daily fodder.It is likely that you have some Van Gogh flowers or corn fields or Constable's hay wain on your coasters. There's bound to be a Gainsborough horse or two on the pub wall.My point is that you should go along to the National Gallery and take a look at these great pictures for yourself. You'll find it fascinating, seeing all of these familiar pics in real life.A lot of people think you have to go to The Louvre to see the greatest art on the planet. Wrong. The National has more greats that any other national collection. How come?Because when we had an empire, we went gaily around, from country to country, continent to continent and acquired all of the good stuff.The National Gallery, right there on Trafalgar Square is also one of the most familiar buildings on telly. Everyone recognises it, even if they're not sure what it is. If you're in the West End, nip down the road, south, from Leicester Square and you're there in a jiffy.If you're around central London for any reason or even the shortest time, please do go in. It's free.There's no pressure. And . . . you already know a lot of the fine works.The layout is great. It starts with the old stuff and gets more modern as you walk along.Having persuaded you to pop in, if you're not madly arty, then follow the main collection through to the right, all the way to the end.Here are the 18th - 20th century paintings. A lot of which you already know and love.Now as you wander back, you are going back in time. You can skip whole centuries if you like.I like the really old stuff. Pretty gruesome some of it with torture and murder all over the place.Now as you go about, you'll be able to say ""I saw that in the National Gallery"". I saw that in the National Gallery, too"".And on so many TV news items - ""There's the National Gallery. I've been in there. It's great""."
"Written July 16, 2016",Outstanding Museum,"I spent about 1.5 hours walking through the National Gallery. I was surprised that it isn't a larger museum, but this actually made the visit feel more leisurely. I walked through almost the entire place. The Turner paintings and the Van Gogh works were incredible. The work is beautifully presented in many smaller sized galleries and the map clearly shows how to navigate. The book shop had some wonderful books and a spot to sit down. The building itself is lovely and showcases an amazing collection of art. "
"Written July 16, 2016",Beautiful building housing some of the classics,"Even if you're not interested in art you can't deny that the National Gallery is a phenomenal building (it's worth visiting for this alone!). When I visited a number of the galleries were under renovation which was a little disappointing however there were still so many wonderful paintings (mainly) to take in, including works by Van Gogh, Monet and Manet. It's definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of traditional painters."
"Written July 13, 2016",Incredible!,My family and I walked around this part of the city in the rain before visiting the National Gallery.  We spent about two hours and could have spent the whole day.  We got the audio guides.  I would get them if you plan to visit a long time.  We were there for a short time and it is impossible to absorb everything.  I had a great couple if hours just looking.  My children liked it too even though they know little about art. We are planning on going back during this trip as admission is free and there was so much to see.
"Written July 7, 2016",Wonderful place to wander!,The National Gallery is amazing!  It is free admission and I highly recommend the audio headsets 3£....you can spend as little or as much time as you care to in this beautiful Art Gallery.  I was there on July 4th and was fortunate to hear a High School Band from the USA playing Our Patriotic Songs!  Magical!
"Written June 21, 2017",A real treasure house,"Apart from wonderful galleries full of masterpieces and splendid exhibitions it has mosaics by Boris Anrep on the main staircase, from 1923 to the 1950s this remarkable Russian artist had many commissions for private houses and Westminster Cathedral. Do look him up, you will be enchanted by his wit and skill."
"Written June 20, 2017",Wonderful,"More than 1500 works 2 floors, Caravaggio Michelangelo and many more .. free entry ..not to be missed"
"Written June 18, 2017",You need a full day or more!,"Lots of great art, but it's a huge building with many many galleries. If you really want to appreciate all it has to offer, you have to set aside a full day (or more). I would recommend getting the audio tour as one can easily get lost in the myriad galleries."
"Written June 14, 2017",must visit,"huge colection, beautiful decorated, great service-guided tour, central location and free of charge..."
"Written June 14, 2017",Very rich collection with free admission,"Worth spending at least an hour, very famous paintings along with amazing weaving work simply left us stunned."
"Written May 31, 2017",Love it for great collection,"The widest collection of paintings and sculpture of 17th and 18th century, opposite Trafalgar Square. I f you are an art lover, this place is not to be missed."
"Written May 20, 2017",National Gallery,"Worth going to see with magnificent architecture within tne building, magnificent columns. Central in location, definately worth a visit"
"Written May 16, 2017",A national treasure to be sure,"Yet another free attraction in Central London.  Climbing stairs up from Trafalgar Square leads you into a cultural palace and as with the Portrait Gallery around the corner, you do not need to be especially knowledgeable about either artists or their work to really enjoy a bit to this world class Gallery.  Highly recommended."
"Written May 11, 2017",A wonderful day out,"We went to see the Michelangelo and Sebastiano exhibits and ended staying for most of the day enjoying the magnificent paintings.It just has to be seen to be completely understood. This is a great way to spend a leisurely day in the middle of a vacation; its indoors, easy walking, and there are wonderful cafes to enjoy as well."
"Written May 10, 2017",National Gallery - National Treasure,"Amazing gallery, huge, slightly overwhelming. Astonishing collection. Don't come if you are in a rush; you could really spend a whole day in here."
"Written October 18, 2016",Great and amazing if you like art.,"Got to see great works of art from different timeperiods. From renaiscance work of arts to Monet, Degas and Van Goh"
"Written October 18, 2016",visit to gallery,We took a tour at 11.30 yesterday and the gentleman who conducted the tour was very knowledgeable. Definitely go back 
"Written October 16, 2016",Rainy day?  No problem!,"What a beautiful gallery.  The rooms are well lit and spacious so the art is given room to glow.  There were many people there but we really didn't have to wait more than a few seconds to see anything.  Many of the rooms had comfortable seating, to encourage contemplation of the works within but also to enable visitors to sit quietly and rest.  We only had an afternoon and barely scratched the surface of all there was to see, but to able to be that close to paintings by Rembrandt, Klimt, Van Gogh, Renoir, etc. was humbling and inspiring.  ALSO the descriptions that accompanied each painting were informative and fun to read. Finally, there were many fun souvenir options in the gift store to take back home.  So count on spending a bit of time there!"
"Written October 12, 2016",Interesting ,Enjoy our quick visit which we tagged onto our lunch in the Portrait restaurant which we really enjoyed.It's a well laid out gallery with some interesting pieces. 
"Written October 6, 2016",See pictures worth millions,This is a great museum.  You can see artworks that you have only seen in books and really understand why they are worth so much.  Great displays and easy to view the art.
"Written September 29, 2016",Great impressionist works,"Fantastic museum, and free to boot! Some great pieces by all the favorites,  Monet, Pissarro, Rousseau, Klimpt and even a fantastic Arthur Streeton.  Why spend money reliving the horrors of war (OK, the Churchill War Rooms were cool), when you can enjoy the brushstrokes of masters for free!"
"Written September 28, 2016",Heaps of paintings ,We were amazed by the large number and variety and quality of paintings many of them being up to 500 years old. Free admission. Could have easily spent a lot more time there. Highly recommend 
"Written September 27, 2016",Paintings equal to the British Museum's paintings.,"Outstanding oil painting selection at National Gallery. Saw 2 da Vinci's, 4 Michaelangelos, at least 3 Tiepolos, several Peter P. Rubens, 2 stellar Van Gophs, and a Donatello painting that did not appeal to me. Centrally located next to Trafalgar Square, Portrait Art Museum and Canadian Consulate(?) building."
"Written September 25, 2016",Well worth a visit!,Marvelous gallery with an excellent collection by the masters. Don't miss the Van Eyck or Rembrandt's self-portrait. An enjoyable experience that is amazingly-for this American-free!
"Written September 24, 2016",Great visit,"Visited the National Gallery with the Mother. The art was, as expected, phenomenal, arranged across 40+ rooms in four eras. Plenty of opportunities to sit down if your legs get tired."
"Written February 18, 2017",Australia Impressionists,"The only bad bit was that is very poorly signed once you get inside. Once we had found the Exhibition of Australian Impressionists. We found it was a really excellent exhibition of beautiful art from 4 impressionists Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Charles Conder, and John Russell. It is a really worthwhile trip to make. I really loved Arthur Streeton's work."
"Written January 31, 2017",Do Not Miss It,"A great, great museum with an outstanding collection of paintings. Very helpful staff. Good at giving directions to confused tourists."
"Written January 30, 2017",You have to go! PLEASE leave a decent DONATION GBP5 minimum,"I am a museum guy and this is one of my global favorites.  It`s a bit easy to get lost, suggest you get the commentary.  MY favorite is maybe The Ambassadors, but I have been going for 30 years and many of them are now old friends.  The cafe place also does pretty good revitalising tea and cakes when you are pictured out."
"Written January 20, 2017",Art and architecture lovers heaven,Allow time and comfortable shoes to enjoy this historic museum. Take time before or after in Trafalgar Square and enjoy the outdoor entertainment 
"Written January 16, 2017",Fabulous Art Collection!!!,"When visiting London, the National Gallery is a must! I have been there for a couple of times, but this was the fist occasion I rented the Audio Guide (only 4 Pounds), which I highly recommend as one can walk at its own pace listening to great detailed information that otherwise will go unnoticed. Don't miss it!"
"Written January 12, 2017",Wander from One to the Other,"My prime reason for visiting was the Caravaggio exhibition. When I got out from that, I thought to myself I'd just have a quick run around upstairs: that quick run around was four hours in itself. I hadn't been there since a child, so being on my own in my thirties made a big difference.It's fantastic!"
"Written January 2, 2017",The clue is in the title 'Beyond' Caravaggio!!!,"I usually very much enjoy National Gallery exhibitions - we are members and visit often. However the current Caravaggio exhibition is a disgrace in my view. You cannot market such an exhibition with only 6 pictures by the named artist!! It's not that the others are not good, they are, especially the Riberas but it's really shocking that so much is made of the influence of Caravaggio with so few examples. Come on NG, you're taking the pxxx!!Spend your money instead in the small 'jewel ' of the exhibition that is the Australian Impressionists - an eye opening feast for the eyes!!"
"Written December 29, 2016",great way to pass the time,"We did a tour of the gallery , great works of European art. The range was beautiful and well presented, well documented. More in depth with an audio tour. The symbolism in the artwork is astounding."
"Written December 26, 2016",Excellent Museum With Some of the Most Famous Paintings in the World,"This is an excellent art museum in the heart of London. It's a great spot if you don't have a ton of time in London because you can also check off Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery. I adored the National Gallery. Amazingly it's free to get in! You don't see that much these days. It can be crowded so be prepared for the crowds (or go early).There are a LOT of important paintings including Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers,"" and works by Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Holbein, J. M. W. Turner, and many many more. I highly recommend it."
"Written December 17, 2016",Beautiful Place,"Amazing place that I've been visited! I loved the structure of the building and the amazing view, I'll visit that place again for sure. Next year I'm planning to visit that place again. Love Love Love "
"Written September 24, 2016",Enjoyable but repetitive ,I enjoyed the gallery and looking through different time periods of art but it can get repetitive with very old paintings having the same theme. But I liked the collection of 18th century onwards with a more variety of painting themes and images.
"Written September 23, 2016",Perfect if you love paintings,"The place is huge, it was my first time here, and I loved it. Thankfully there are seats pretty much in every room, and it's free, which is a plus."
"Written September 21, 2016",Galleries,Another must when in London. A map of the rooms to visit is a must as there are so many rooms to visit. The paintings on show are exellent.
"Written September 18, 2016",Great to pop in and recharge your batteries.,I like to pop in when I'm nearby for an hour just to get away from the crowds and noise. Spectacular collection of paintings. Great for the soul!
"Written September 18, 2016",A pleasure,"spend a few enjoyable hours just wandering around, no entry fee but they do ask for a donation, worth giving. "
"Written August 31, 2016",What is there to say?,"If you love art, the National Gallery is a must. It has one of the greatest collections of art in the world, I could, and have, spent days in this museum. Two tips that visitors often miss: Holbein's painting, ""The Ambassadors,"" which is in Room 4, is hung in such a way that it is possible to see the elongated skull very easily, but oddly very few people bother to look. You have to go to the right side of the paining and look down to the far bottom corner of the painting while standing in the alcove. The skull will be plain as day.Also be sure to find the small room (Room 66) where Leonardo's sketch of The Virgin and Child with St. Anne is displayed. There is rarely anyone else in this room, and being there alone in there, in the quiet presence of this gorgeous piece, is magical. I think it is overlooked because it is referred to as ""The Burlington House Cartoon"" in the guides. While the terminology is technically correct, most people have quite another idea of what a cartoon is. "
"Written August 25, 2016",Painters Paintings,"This interesting exhibit is closing soon, so hustle to see it.  The title may confuse, but it is an exhibit of the painting that famous painters thought enough of to purchase for their own collections, and hang in their homes and offices.  Unsurprisingly, they mostly chose work, similar to their own.  I was a little disappointed that Claude Monet was not included as he was a fan of Japanese painting."
"Written August 23, 2016",Excellent,"the museum is wonderful, the only problem is that you can not see a picture would silently because of some tourists who speak loudly. There are many works and the building itself to be admired."
"Written August 18, 2016",Brilliant and FREE !,"Best museum to visit for me at this houses Joseph Wright of Derby's Experiment with a bird and an air pump. Genius use of light, perspective and symbolism.  Usually go for a viewing every few months as it's so special to me.  Next door, round the corner is the National Portrait gallery, and you would be foolish to miss this equally superb exhibition space. Top Marks A*"
"Written August 11, 2016",Very attractive building,Very attractive building with a square nearby heard a good singer busking for change.  Lots of foot traffic
"Written July 7, 2016",Solid collection in beautiful rooms,"If you have time for London museums after V & A and the British Museum, this should be next in line.  A few fine Turners, Van Goghs that are familiar (sunflowers) and unfamiliar, in grand  halls and elegant rooms."
"Written July 5, 2016","If you're an art fan, take your time for the visit","For an art museum to give you full satisfactory, you need to be a fan and you need to have time. A museum full of paintings from different eras and very different artists who each have their story to tell, requires peace, calming music from certain ages, a professional guide and will to focus. For me it was more like running through this huge museum with millions of people screaming and shouting, being lost and not really into it, if you know what i mean. So go early, if you're a fan, take a guided tour, though the visit itself is free. It's a lovely museum, the atmosphere simply needs to be created."
"Written June 27, 2016",Never gets old,I will never tire of visiting here. I go every year when I can. There are some real treasures. Going with a free guide is something that will add to the experience.
"Written June 27, 2016",Wonderful gallery,The National Gallery is light and airy which makes it far more pleasant to wonder around than some other galleries. I regularly take groups of Primary school children there and would highly recommend their guided tours. Three paintings are chosen to focus on and the guides are both very knowledgeable and child centred. A great first introduction to art appreciation.
"Written June 15, 2016",a Must in London,"You cannot miss one visit at least to this fantastic Gallery. The Museum overlooking Trafalgar Square, houses an incredible collection of gorgeous paintings and astonishing works of art (mostly of Italian origin!) dating back from the 13th to the 19th century all of them perfectly kept and wonderfully displayed in the wide halls of an eighteenth century building. All of that FREE OF CHARGE. One more tip: once there, don' forget to drop in the delicious Cafè downstairs... "
"Written June 10, 2016",Excellent Museum,"It's gigantic,  and filled with so many notable works of art that it can be overwhelming. If you have the luxury of time, I suggest you do it in segments.  If not, just go for it. The cafe is a must-see for its lavish rooms, but beware. It's difficult to find a seat. The people working there are multi-national, and most are quite helpful and knowledgeable. Our family did the National Portrait Gallery,  lunch and a concert at St. Martin in the Fields, and the National Gallery, as well as hanging out in Trafalgar Square, all in one long day (Friday, when the gallery is open late.) It's a long day, but your mind will be full and your eyes tired at the end of it. "
"Written June 5, 2016",A 'must see' for any art lover.,My title explains it all.  I visit art museums often.  There is so much to enjoy here that I feel unqualified to comment.  Take some time to wander through slowly and drink it in.
"Written June 5, 2016",Free but confusing,"Like most London museums and art galleries, the National Gallery is free, which is quite a bonus. However, I found its layout extraordinarily confusing, with a jumble of rooms with multiple interconnections and no obvious route to follow. The maps were of limited assistance. They could learn a lot from other major galleries in how to assist visitors to view what is an extensive collection - probably too extensive in terms of overall quality."
"Written May 28, 2016",Beautiful setting,"While I am not an art connoisseur, I did enjoy this stop.  Thought it was cool that it was right in the heart of Trafalgar Square, but did find it somewhat confusing inside the building.  The art was amazing and thought it was great that it was free to the public."
"Written May 27, 2016",Wonderful and free,Entrance is free and the place is always busy. I like the gift shops. The exhibitions are also very nice (I came specifically to see the George Shaw exhibition). Overall I'd recommend to anyone who loves art.
"Written April 18, 2016",a must-see,"I stopped in here on impulse, not having included it in my list of ""priority sightseeing,"" and even as a very casual art fan I was floored. the place is beautiful and has some incredible pieces, many of which you'll recognize from your history textbooks. (it was cool for me to see familiar names like rembrandt, caravaggio, monet -- art is not something I know a lot about, so the subtleties and nuances of what defines 'good art' or museum-worthy art is often lost on me. but even i can appreciate certain artists and pieces that I know made a big impact on art history).it's overwhelming, though. I wandered around for over two hours and I don't think I saw half of what there is to see. if there are specific things you want to see, the official website has a map/guide that you can look at to figure out which area of the museum to check out first, depending on what period of history you're most interested in. this was a great way to spend an afternoon and i'd highly recommend the experience to anyone."
"Written April 17, 2016",My favourite museum in London,"This is a superb museum. I always go here when I'm in London - my favourite painting ""The Arnolfini wedding"" by Jan van Eyck has a special place in my heart. Another absolute gem is the series of painings called ""Mariage à-la-mode"" by William Hogarth."
"Written April 5, 2016",Fantastic,"More than 1300 paintings and for free! Great, great, great.I recommend the audio guide. I've used the guide for the most important 80 paintings and spent there about 3.5 hours. My 10 years old kid loved also.A must to see!"
"Written March 31, 2016",Worth visiting!,We went on Good Friday. We really enjoyed it! The place is huge so bare this in mind when visiting. We were quite tired after spending time looking and reading about each picture then realised how huge the place was. Was a really fun day out free too. Well worth visiting!
"Written March 31, 2016",One can enjoy some lovely time here.,It is located centrally and one can acccess easily by underground or any other means of public transport. 
"Written March 31, 2016",Not the NATIONAL Gallery for nothing!,"I never cease to be amazed, nay impressed, by the sheer variety and volume of exhibits in this world-class museum, perhaps best known for, but not limited to, its paintings. There is no excuse not to pop in, at least; after all, its location on Trafalgar Square could not be more central - and its permanent location can be viewed free of charge!"
"Written March 29, 2016",Far more then you can see in just one visit.,"Beautiful gallery, easy to find (right in Trafalgar Square. We went to see the a few specific paintings and found out when we were there that there is a Van Gough exhibit right next door at the Delacroix Gallery."
"Written March 20, 2016",Beautiful gallery.,This was my third visit and I think it will always be on my list when I come to London. It's such a wonderful place to wander around and has some truly spectacular paintings. 
"Written March 9, 2016",Breathtaking Collection,Even if you are an all out philistine you cannot fail to be impressed by this collection. Just about every famous painting I've ever heard of. The only downside is its popularity. In my opinion they should charge a small fee to dissuade the hordes that attend to meet or just get out of the rain. This would cut the overcrowding and allow people to take their time and really appreciate these stunning pieces. Visit near the end of the day when crowds are thinner around the more famous pieces and map your route. We must have have walked backwards and forwards countless times trying to track down the greats!
"Written March 1, 2016",Great free tours for the uneducated,"Being not very knowledgeable about art, the free tour was a delight to see and helped understand a bit more about art, galleries and history in general. Hope I had more time, dont miss it even an hour is worth it."
"Written February 17, 2016",Take your time!,"There is so much to enjoy in the National Gallery, and, apart from special exhibitions, it is all free!  Aim just to cover one wing in a morning or afternoon and take your time looking at the wonderful paintings, I took part in a one-hour ""Talk and Draw"" session and it was great!"
"Written February 9, 2016",Wish we had longer,We went to the National Gallery on our last day in London before catching our flight home.We only managed to spend a short time there and could have easily stayed several hours more. The architecture and pictures were absolutely stunning.It was wonderful to see school children being given a tour and reassuring that schools in London have access to such amazing history on their doorstep.I can't wait to go back and take my kids this time.
"Written January 26, 2016","Terrific, and FREE!",Beautiful collection featuring some very well known Van Goghs including the sunflowers. Its also a magnificent building inside. Great place to escape the rain for an hour or so. The fact that its free and you don't have to line up to get in makes it a real breath of fresh air when compared with other galleries like the Louvre or the Uffizi etc. 
"Written January 21, 2016",Step into  Canvasses,Let  your mind roam and your eyes delight . Either walk at a quick pace fluttering through the painting and landing like a bee contemplating the masterpieces that really move you as I do or meander through observing constantly . Whatever or however you do it marvelled you will be . For the visiting exhibitions against all my dreamy reasoning I use their earphones and listen to the wonderfully word illustrated explanations as fascination invades my mind conjuring up the artistes eye translated through his strokes .  Not to be missed ;)
"Written January 20, 2016",A Must see!,"World's best paintings from famous artists, many of whom changed the direction of art.Beautifully and logically presented to the viewer so the visitor does not have to be an expert or very knowledgable to appreciate the paintings exhibited. Wonderful gallery which fully deserves its reputation on the world stage.Good food at the cafe - highly recommend the Cottage  Pie."
"Written January 16, 2016",A lot of things to see,"It is HU-GE.Personally i've found interesting how they grouped up the XII-XIV centuries, in terms of items: it helped me a lot in explaining to my girlfriend how the way of painting evolved through decades.The only big disappointment, that day, was not being able to see Cezanne's Les Grandes Baigneuses because that room was closed (and i the reason wasn't even shown). Spent 2 nice hours there. There aren't so many places to eat, but there are a lot of guides for many languages that'll help you in your journey there."
"Written January 10, 2016",Goya - Excellent; Venue - could have been larger,"The NGA has amassed an incredible collection of Goya's work from around the world. The accompanying guidebook is a very helpful supplement when looking at the art work, and the audio guide offered lots of additional insights about specific works, including fashion, hair, accessories and the people in the portraits. There are just so many paintings in a few rooms that one can understand why some people feel the crowds were larger than the rooms accommodated. We went 2 days before the exhibition closed, and the rooms while full of people, weren't overly crowded and with patience, we were able to move close to the pieces we wanted to and have a really good look. The cloakroom facilities were very welcomed on a cold wet London day.Very much enjoyed this exhibition and look forward to more now I am a member of NGA (courtesy of a Christmas membership gift)"
"Written January 9, 2016",Great museum!!,The National Gallery is one of the thing you can't miss in a London trip! You can find great artists..Van Gogh in particular..or Goya for a very short time!
"Written January 8, 2016",Great collection,"a must see for art fans. A unique collection of paintings from different styles, eras and regions. Highly recommended."
"Written January 7, 2016",Mind boggling collection,We spent one day at the national gallery in London which is simply not enough. The art collection here is simply mind boggling and I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent here. Hope to go back some day.
"Written January 3, 2016",Gorgeous place. Just go and see it the soonest you can.,"A beautiful place. This is something breathtaking, even when you don't like art. Hundreds of years shown in amazing pictures! (A big plus is that they are placed in one building!)"
"Written January 1, 2016","An excellent attraction, though galleries could be easier to find","All pieces are well presented, the gallery is free, and amenities are good. If you are looking for a specific piece, research ahead of time in which room it is located."
"Written January 1, 2016",Incredible Collection,The special Goya exhibit is great as is the permanent collection.  Great impressionist collection as well as historic British paintings.
"Written December 26, 2015",We return again and again,"This is another of the free museums in London, which makes it possible to return several times during your London visit to concentrate on one portion of the gallery each time then return to visit another section.  This way you do not have to cram everything in at one time.  Their early Italian art collection (one of my favorites) is outstanding.  They have very nice gift shops and a good cafeteria as well.  It is located right at Trafalgar Square."
"Written December 23, 2015",See Degas exhibit before it ends,"The gallery is great in general, of course, but we went to see the Degas portrait exhibit. This is worth seeing if only to have an example of a painter who did NOT alter his portraits to make the subjects look better. You get the feeling that what you see is what he saw, not what the subjects hoped he'd paint. "
"Written December 22, 2015",Beeline to the National Gallery.,"The National Gallery of London is, in my opinion, one of the best fine art museums in the world, and, believe me, I have seen most of them.  Its greatest attraction is that it is wide ranging in the variety of periods of art that are represented, the quality of the art presented, and the fact that it is not overwhelming like the Hermitage, the Louvre or the Metropolitan. I can easily be done in a day with time to spare. The associated themed exhibitions are extremely well presented and always a further magnet to visit. I sincerely believe that a visit to London would not be complete without a day at the National Gallery."
"Written December 19, 2015",GOYA - The Portraits,"There is only one word to describe the exhibition of the Goya's portraits: Superlative! It is a jewel of an exhibition. We went around it three times, with a renewed sense of wonder at the ability of Goya to bring his subjects to life. The National Gallery is a tremendous place: it has a wealth of art requiring more than one day (a week?) for full appreciation, but even a short visit such as ours can transport the visitor into another world, where beauty reigns supreme."
"Written December 18, 2015",One of the world's greatest museums,"We had not been to London for eleven years, and although I was looking forward to a return visit to the National Gallery, I had forgotten how  extraordinary its collection  is. It's one of those museums that resists a hit-and-run visit and insists that you give it the time it deserves. I was there three times in ten days (my wife balked at the third visit) and felt I could easily spend just as much time again. Like the National Gallery in Washington and many other great London museums, it doesn't charge admission  (except for special exhibitions). An amazing gift to the public."
"Written December 16, 2015",Travelled from Australia to see the Goya Exhibition ,"This exhibition is coming to a close but if you can, do see it. I travelled from Australia to do so, and wasn't disappointed. I booked my tickets on line, and got there first thing. The self guided Audio tour was instructive without being patronising. The paintings themselves are stupendous and many only seen for the first time. I also went for a walk through some of the other galleries to see some ""old friends"" and this part of the Gallery, which is free, is well worth making part of your London experience. You won't be disappointed. "
"Written December 13, 2015","Goya: The Portraits, extraordinary people seen through Goya's eyes","Goya The Portraits: must-see National Gallery exhibition. For the first time, the Portraits exhibition tells the story of Goya’s career as a portrait painter. The exhibition explores a selection of the extraordinary people whose images reveal Goya’s technical, stylistic, and psychological development. From Goya’s first portrait masterpiece, showing the Infante Don Luis de Borbón family (the young brother of King Charles III of Spain) to more intimate depictions of family and friends. Don't miss this unique exhibition."
"Written October 25, 2015",Awesome Collections,"I didn't know I liked Van Gogh before I got here!  This art gallery is a great stop for folks who are interested in impressionist paintings and houses work from some pretty famous artists.  There is also an impressive collection of work from the 15th and 16th centuries.  We could have spent many more hours in this gallery than we actually did.  The staff were friendly and the bathrooms clean.  Really, for a free attraction, I can't complain."
"Written October 25, 2015","Great collection, well showcased","Wonderful collection spanning many centuries. Laid out beautifully to guide the visitor through the ages. Great to have a free format audio tour giving additional information on personally selected items, rather than having to listen to a pre-progammed story. "
"Written October 22, 2015",Worth seeing Goya exhibition.,"Excellent Goya exhibition with paid admission, the rest of the gallery is free. Spent a very pleasant 3 hours wandering around the exhibitions, and had a lovely lunch in the cafe in the Getty wing. Highly recommend."
"Written October 21, 2015",Goyatastic,Visited the national gallery in order to view the Goya exhibition. I was pleasantly surprised to find no question. I was able to closely study all the paintings at my own pace without feeling pressured to move on. 
"Written October 19, 2015","National Gallery, London",I really enjoyed my visit to the National Gallery.  It is a beautiful building.  I wanted to show my daughter Van Gogh's Sunflowers which did not disappoint.  Only thing I would say is that it wasn't the easiest gallery to navigate.  I had wanted to see Vermeer and I had walked past it without noticing!  It would be nice if there was some kind of sign post indicating which artists were in which rooms - there may have been but I just missed it!
"Written October 15, 2015",Show me the Monet!,"Has a wonderful selection of paintings from all eras. We were more interested in the Impressionists, of which we saw Van Gogh, Renoir, Pissaro, Manet, Monet, and Degas. They have the Van Gogh's famous sunflower painting, and Monet's Lily Pond. The National Gallery building itself is amazing! Don't forget to look both UP and DOWN!Would recommend going if you have a free afternoon. Choose what you want to see and go to see that. Allocate about 1 and a half hours for that. The Gallery café is nice (so we were told), and also the Gallery shop has some neat little things - not everything is terribly expensive.Admission IS free, however they do ask for a £5 (not verbally). Don't feel pressured to pay it if you don't feel like it, but £5 is a small amount to pay to see these amazing paintings :)"
"Written October 15, 2015",Fantastic Gallery,All you need to see and more. The museum is free so you can come and go without spending several hours at one time.
"Written October 15, 2015",Must-see but prepare the crowds,"It's worth a visit.  Free admission and voluntary donation. Located at Trafalgar Square.  Easy accessible by underground and bus. Houses an amazing collection of the paintings.  Great exhibits but extremely crowded and noisy. I could not possibly have seen all the paintings and was so bothered by noise. I wish I could enjoy the arts with less crowds, creating better experience.  Maybe next time."
"Written October 14, 2015","Goya, the man and his paintings","Before the exhibition, I did not know very much about Goya and his pictures, usually French and Italian paintings/artists were what interested me but Goya's works were wonderful. The guide book given is very helpful but do not miss out on having the audio guide.  Not only was there information regarding the pictures, life and times Goya lived through but further information on the costumes and fashions of the period. The exhibition was organised wonderfully, and I won't forget those pictures. A great collection of pictures and now I feel that I ""know"" Goya."
"Written October 9, 2015",An amazing collection,"Na incredible collection, no doubt. I don´t really enjoy medieval paintings and their catholic themes, but even putting all that aside there´s still a marvelous collection of art. Don´t miss some of the most famous Van Gogh paintings display here."
"Written December 11, 2015",From old Masters to Modernist painters,"The Gallery has a mind-blowing of art such as works by Botticelli and Bronzino, Caravaggio and Cezanne, Degas and Delaroche,  Rembrandt and Rubins, Gougan and Gaudi, Hogarth and Holbein, Michelangelo to Monet, Stubbs and Seurat, Titan to Turner, Velazquez and Vermeer. Entrance is free though it is beneficial to support the gallery by leaving a small donation. The gallery is expansive and its a good idea to be selective if  you are limited in time, so get on line and plan what works you want to see. Its also a great place just to wander and see what you come across that tickles your fancy. The Gallery also has an expansive bookshop.  "
"Written December 6, 2015",Amazing,"Stuck for something to do on a rainy afternoon in London? Visit the National Gallery.Free to enter, full of beautiful art, spacious, a place to leave your luggage, it's awesome! Even if you're not an art lover there is loads of fascinating stuff to see. You can pop in for one hour or six. Get the head phones for £4 and learn about different pictures, then go and have a drink or mooch round the shops, smug in your cultural immersion!"
"Written December 6, 2015",Cultural Tourism ,"I love to visit here, there are amazing Art from different artists which take us to analyze each particular painting as a far away magic trip.Among the many wonderful works on display, the following tables are:""The Virgin of the Rocks"" by Leonardo da Vinci; ""The Entombment"" by Michelangelo; ""Venus and Mars"" by Botticelli; ""The Supper at Emmaus"" by Caravaggio, ""Self Portrait at the Age of 34"" by Rembrandt; ""The Young woman standing the Virgin"" by Vermeer; ""Sunflowers"" Van Gogh; ""The toilet of Venus"" by Velázquez; ""Bathers"" by Paul Cezanne, and ""Bathers at La Grenouillère"" Monet.Be sure to also know some works of British artists, such as ""The Fighting Temeraire"" of JMW Turner; ""The Hay Wain"" John Constable, and the beautiful horse ""The Whistlejacket"" George Stubbs.Contrary to what most people think, the collection of the National Gallery never belonged to the British royal family, was acquired in its entirety with resources of the British people, isn't that amazing?"
"Written December 2, 2015",So many things to see,"I've been back several times, and there's always so much to take in. I love seeing my favorite painters' works in person. "
"Written November 23, 2015",Audio guide a must ,It was free to visit. So as a tourist it was good to spend some time and soak up some culture. But if you are not all that interested in arts in general it gets boring. So an audio guide ($4) is a must.
"Written November 21, 2015",Almost overwhelming,"As expected, Britain's National Gallery is a treasure trove of great paintings in a spectacular building.  A not to be missed attraction,"
"Written November 21, 2015",This is a great window to history!,"I went to this museum on a Saturday. Since entrance is free except for selected exhibits, it is always full of tourists. I would say that one who comes to London should not pass up the opportunity to visit this museum. This is a window to past life in England. The gargantuan portrait of Charles I riding on a horse will simply leave you amazed at how it was get done. It occupies one wall of a section of the gallery, from ceiling to floor. How great the artist was! There are also sections of the gallery that house the artworks of famous painters such as Canaletto, Goya, Turner, Constable, Ingres, Degas, Cezanne, Monet and above all, Van Gogh! Do not ever miss the ""Long Grass with Butterflies"" of Van Gogh as well as ""The Wheatfield and Cypresses""! Simply appealing. The other artist not to miss is Goya! I was lucky to see the Portrait of Dona Isabel de Porcel. Oh, how lovely and beautiful was she! The rest are simply stunning... If one loves history, this is the best place to learn about the past through paintings!"
"Written November 21, 2015",Goya exhibit was fantastic and the museum was extremely well maintained,"I spent a few hours here in the morning and the museum was busy, but not crowded. The Goya portrait exhibit that was running was so well curated - the audio guide was thorough, but not overwhelming. The collection was extremely unique and different from all Goya exhibits I'd seen in the past. The rest of the museum has a great variety of art ranging from renaissance to impressionist. The facility itself was also gorgeous. I loved wandering through the halls and admiring both the artwork and the rooms themselves. Highly recommend for anyone who appreciates art or museums in general! Its also in a fantastic location - right in Trafalgar Square. Great photo op on the front steps as well. Admission is free with a recommended donation - I gladly gave more than the recommended amount."
"Written November 20, 2015",Outstanding,Just wonderful. Such incredible artwork and history in such a wonderful location and for free. You need at least a full day - you can't see it all in a rush.

"Written August 15, 2015",Don't miss The National Gallery,"Unfortunately some of the Gallery was closed the day we visited, but what we were able to view made the trip there just wonderful.  The artwork is spectacular as well as the setting.  Definitely worth a visit."
"Written August 12, 2015","If art history is an interest (or not), be sure to stop here","Our family of five consists of members who like art history and members who don't.  What made this place good for a whole family to visit (besides the fact that it's FREE) was the quickl access to various  period ""rooms""  of art, so you could focus on what you wanted to see without having to tour the whole place. There was also seating in all the areas we visited, so those who weren't as into the art had a place to sit and relax.  I loved the Impressionist period rooms, plus the Caravaggio art they had was a favorite.  Outside the National Gallery, there was a lot of sidewalk art, which was worth a visit just by itself, and which impressed everyone in our group.  When you visit, be sure to get a map at the Gallery entrance to guide your route!"
"Written August 11, 2015",Get up!,"I'm a little bias on this review because I appreciate art and I love architecture.First, the setting for this gallery is phenomenal. ..location, location, location!  The building is beautiful from the outside and sits prominently above the square. The activity in front of the building is an exhibition all to itself. The scale of views is what confirms the fact that London is a global city. Subsequently, the interior of the gallery is well laid out and easy to access. I assumed it would be more crowded since it had free admission but the amount of people was easy to disregard as you had plenty of moments to enjoy the art without feeling like you were in someone's way. The only exception possibly being around the Van Goughs. The interior rooms were elegant and served as wonderful and well lit backdrops to the art at hand. Second, The art was diverse and wonderful. Many great pieces by many great artists. Each period being well represented by the famous and not so famous, which gave a real substantive quality to the museum. Many photo and sketching opportunities are available.So, why the 4 out of 5 rating?  Because I felt that the modem arts were a little under represented,  but that was understandable after walking by some of the nearby auction houses  (ie the ""modestly"" priced Picasso which recently broke record)SoEnough reading, get up and go!

"Written August 10, 2015",Best art gallery in London,"The gallery is huge and people who know something about art will definetely love it. I guess there are thousands of art pieces.

"Written August 1, 2015",Good experience at a world class art museum,World class art museum has what you expect. Vast galleries of masterful art. We ducked in and out of different rooms and let our eyes be drawn to particular pieces from various eras. We thoroughly enjoyed the layout and ease we could browse even though it was pouring rain outside meaning many tourists were seeking indoor activities for the day. 
"Written August 1, 2015",Lovely,"First you stop outside at Trafalgar Square, let the kids climb or look at the giant lions, then walk up the steps to the National Gallery.  It's free and filled with amazing art. Donations are welcome. A one pound donation gets you a map of the place in your language showing where to find a few of the famous artists and their paintings. The art is  separated by time period. I'm not that great at reading maps but even I could figure out where to go to find the art pieces I wanted to see - Van Gogh, Monet, Reuben, Rembrandt. The gallery wasn't over crowded and you could actually stand and just stare at your favorite pieces. Amazingly they even let you take pictures of the art. We had a great time. Even the 13 year old found a time period of art that she loved."

"Written November 14, 2015",Do not miss the National Gallery,"With a collection of more than 2300 paintings ranging from the Early Renaissance to the Impressionists, the National Gallery of England is one of the finest art collections in the world.  Three entrances are on Trafalgar Square:  the Sainsbury Wing on the left facing the museum opened in 1991 and in galleries 51-66 houses the earliest works from 1250-1500 in the collection;  the Main entrance up the stairs of the neo-classical building designed by Wm. Wilkins from 1834-8 and the Sir Paul Getty accessible entrance on the sidewalk level. In August during a one day tube strike several of my most favorite galleries were closed so a second trip afforded the opportunity to visit my favorites in Gallery 34, Turner, Constable, Stubbs, Reynolds and Gainsborough.  Do purchase a map and/or rent an audio guide so you can explore the highlights of the collection.  Works by Leonardo, Botticello, Holbein (The Ambassadors), Vermeer, Van Dyke, Caravaggio, Canaletto, Claude, Monet, Van Gogh wait to be explored.  Lectures and tours are also offered.  The galleries areOpen daily from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm with late opening until 9:00pm on Wednesday."

When I found each or stumbled upon them, it literally took my breath away.  You HAVE to get here!"
"Written November 7, 2015",Goya: The Portraits - Breathtakingly Beautiful Exhibition,"Visiting the National Gallery is always a wonderful experience. The current special exhibition of Goya's portraits - running until 10th January 2016 - in the Sainsbury Wing is one of sublime beauty. No matter how good reproductions of paintings may be in books, magazines and online, they cannot match the originals and it is awe-inspiring to stand in front of works like The Duchess of Alba and savour their power and the sheer genius that produced them. The National Gallery has organised and staged the collection with great efficiency and sensitivity. Visitors are allocated a time slot so as to ensure the gallery space does not become too crowded and uncomfortable. The lighting is kept low to protect the paintings but it also greatly adds to the atmosphere. This is a brilliant exhibition. Go see it."
"Written November 4, 2015",Enrapturing,"This is a magical beautiful place. On your first visit you'll be overwelmed: too much to see, too much to take in. I strongly recommend the (free!) guided visit.  My advice is, once you have visited it once, if you have 20 spare minutes and you're around Trafalgar Square, just go in and sit in front of a painting, it's a magical experience. "

The collection is remarkable - some of the paintings I recall are Leonardo's Virgin of the Rock, Van Gogh's Sunflowers and some iconic ones of Constable and Turner. One could easily spend a full day admiring the art. We also had one of the best cups of Darjeeling tea in the dining room."

Since my first visit, I have returned probably half a dozen times and still feel that I haven't seen everything. The building is beautiful and the artwork is displayed in the best possible way. It's hard to believe that the National Gallery doesn't charge an entrance fee, so with the rising ticket costs for attractions in London, there is absolutely no excuse for missing this one!"
"Written September 24, 2015",Helpful Staff,"We visited the museum on a busy Sunday mainly to see the works of the Impressionists.  As we were leaving, one of the museum workers asked if we enjoyed our visit and did we see ""The Cartoon.""  Because we had not, he pointed out on the map where to view this Leonardo da Vinci art work as well as two other galleries nearby with equally impressive and historical works. Our visit was enriched due to this staff member."

"Written September 3, 2015",Visit to National Gallery - Strike Action,"Please be aware that there is strike action being performed by staff and therefore at least 40% of the exhibits are not available for the public to see. I am 'lucky' in as much as I am 'local' saw many tourists come from far and wide to see their favourite artist. They wander around trying to find the rooms they want to visit only to be told they are closed. At the very least there should be a sign outside the entrance to publicise this as most tourists (and ourselves) enter, give a donation and then find that they can't see what they want. One lady I witnessed came from Japan just to see the Turners and was just told by the steward, sorry it is shut. The poor lady and her husband were very upset as they had travelled specifically to see something they would never see again in their lifetime and for the Japanese to show emotion, it must have ruined their day.If there is a strike on, at least have the good heart to tell visitors BEFORE they come through the door because by the time they have entered, all they are worrying about is if the need a ticket,getting a map, where is the toilets etc and NO-ONE will read the small notices that say 'due to staff shortage, some rooms will be closed'.  Some give their hard earned money as a donation in the hope of seeing their favourite painting without realising that there was a complete wing that was inaccessible. I understand that this has been going on for a while now, plenty of time to get the public informed and you could use it as a sympathy vote for your cause rather than getting people upset from lack of knowledge! Very disappointed and the staff were not that sympathetic either - you are not just a money making machine, you are a national museum and have a duty to your customers - please remember that. My planned day went out the window as I had to think of something to do for three hours which was going to be spent on the rest of the day at the Gallery. Not happy!"
"Written August 30, 2015",Art Treasures,"We visited on a busy afternoon in August, and unfortunately due to industrial action by some staff some sections of the Gallery were closed. Despite this we were still able to view some real masterpieces.Security was high with bags being searched on admission but we were not offered a map or Guide Book which would of aided our visit. Although there is no admission charge there are collection boxes which suggest a £5.00 donation.There are plenty of seats in the rooms, and it was nice to see students sketching and making notes. You can take photographs without flash. I particular enjoyed the Monet and Van Gogh paintings. I also enjoyed looking at the work of school students of all ages which were displayed downstairs. Celebrating creativity of children and students is vital in a time when creative subjects are being marginalized in schools.A real national treasure which needs to be preserved and  everyone should have the opportunity to visit."
"Written August 30, 2015",Plan your visit,"This is one of the most wonderful art collections in the world. It's free. Take your time or pop in for half a hour. Do not attempt to browse it all. I despair to see the tourists with glazed eyes drifting from room to room. Get a headset and see their selected Greats. Personally I love the pre 1500s in the Sailsbury wing. Some well hung vista as you enter a space. Just sit and stare at the Virgin of the Rocks or go into the dark little room with Leonardos fabulous smoky cartoon; a spiritual experience.Friday night lates are best and less busy. The restaurants and cafes are worth seeking out too. Check out the website, or use it as you go round or to plan your trip. Extensive art bookshop is addictive"

This is a magnificent collection - wonderfully laid out - easy to navigate and follow and its free.  Get yourself an audio guide and map for a few pounds and just follow it and enjoy the whole experience - this is my all time favourite spot in London.
"Written July 23, 2015",Number #1 Art Gallery,"This gallery surely ranks in the top 5 worldwide.  Just name an old master, and you are sure to find one of his works here.  Get a gallery map and choose the genre you most prefer.  Easy to get lost, though, but there is someone to ask for help in each room.  A very beautiful museum...."
"Written July 22, 2015",World class,"The museum has many major masterpieces, including the da Vinci, Virgin of the Rocks (another Virgin is in the Louvre) and that painting alone is worth the visit... there are only about 14 da Vinci's in the world. You can spend hours here so a bit of a plan is a good idea. Make certain you the see the Van Gogh, the several Titians and Raphaels. And don't bypass the Caravaggio and the Vermeers. Great collection. And, like all national museums in London, there is no entrance fee."
"Written July 22, 2015",My most favorite quiet time in the world.,"The masterpieces here keep you enthralled, curious and at the same time transport you to their era with just a glance. Unbelievable and mesmerizing. Peaceful yet disturbing. Just the place for an afternoon of enrichment."
"Written July 18, 2015",soooo much to see!!!,"To do this justice it would need several visits..  Staff were very helpful in all instances.  Excellent shop attached,  selling things that I did not see in some of the other places."
"Written July 14, 2015",Van Gogh Sunflower..,I think National Gallery is another great museum to visit. Here I am hunting the famous Van Gogh Sunflower painting. Lots and lots of painting to see here..but I limits my time to 2 hours only. After wandering inside the museum take a break just outside the National Museum where the Nelson Column is standing besides the fountain at the Trafalgar Square. Yes the excitement is double here..The truth is I love hanging out here watching people all over the world come and go.. I take my brunch here before continue to The Parliment to see the Big Ben. Another exciting free attraction in London which made my day without spending more pound except for little souvenir from the gallery shop. The reason why we don't need waste money on buying the London Pass.
"Written July 12, 2015",Take the Tour first!,"A must see for all visitors to London. Even for those who think they mightn't appreciate art. All the famous paintings are here and it is thoroughly enjoyable. How to start? I recommend taking one of the introductory tours first. It gives you an immediate feel and the guides are brilliant and quite relaxed and down to earth. Monet, Manet, Renoir, Van Gogh, all here. Just a brilliant experience - and it's free!"
"Written May 27, 2016",Incredible,"The selection of paintings in this gallery is absolutely fantastic. You cannot miss this gallery, especially when the entrance is free to the public.If you are a lover of art especially paintings from the Renaissance movement then this is the place for you."
"Written May 27, 2016","If you are into art galleries, this is awesome.","We breezed through the gallery rather quickly.We honestly aren't into standing, staring at art, but we did enjoy seeing the paintings divided into time periods.It was pretty obvious how the styles stayed the same through different periods."
"Written May 26, 2016","If you can, ALWAYS visit this room","Sometimes you don't go into the National Gallery because you think ""I don't have the time to see it all"". My recommendation, instead, is for you to do what I always do: Go In, visit ONE room each time, look at it properly! Ideally, you can do this for just one painting!! If you want to see my favourite room, turn right at the top of the stairs and go to the end room, you'll find what is in my picture here (Stubbs) but you can also admire, on your way, Canaletto and Bellotto and Turner...."
"Written May 26, 2016",Wonderful collectoin...something for everybody's taste.,Very nice and quite extensive collection. This was out first visit and we were impressed by the scope of the collection and periods represented. We went for the Delacroix installation but also spent a few hours in the permanent collection and dining spaces. The Delacroix collection was breathtaking.
"Written May 25, 2016",Paintings of the highest order in abundance.,"A museum that will satisfy any art lover and more!  Beautifully laid out, with display halls that are architectural masterpieces in themselves.   I was moved to tears when I encountered a famous Van Eyck painting  I had studied while in college, nearly a half century ago- The Arnolfini Wedding.   It had many other admirers crowding around the little canvas.     Once again, admission is free, so you can't go wrong!   A must see."
"Written May 25, 2016","One of the world's most important collections, great temporary exhibitions.","I rarely fail to visit when in London, outstanding temporary exhibitions, some of the world's most imporatnt art works."
"Written May 24, 2016",The Delacroix Exhibition,"I've been to the National Gallery many times and it's always a pleasure, with superb exhibitions of masters like Rembrandt, Goya and Delacroix.  One thing that lets the gallery down a bit is the catering, which is over priced and of mediocre quality. For this reason it gets only four stars."
"Written May 19, 2016",Get an online guide or tour guide (free) or audio tour (cheap) to make sense of it,"Unless you are an art major, this place is so vast that it's better to bite a small piece off. there are free tour guides which last an hour but you are part of a crowd, audio guides for a few pounds but not as ""inspirational"" or even outrageously expensive personal guides. If you just want to zoom through to recognize iconic artists and prices that works too, but you'll miss the intellectual and technical mastery that makes these carefully chosen pieces so special. What you'll learn here can be applied to the artists other great pieces you'll find in Paris, Zurich, New York, Chicago etc...consider this more as an intense two hour learning of why Europe evolved, where it found and lost its way, why humans are insanely complicated and have vision average mortals can only gawk at. Don't let the crowds bother you, the selfies are everywhere now and not worth getting wound up about. Be in the presence of greatness, prepare the day before by getting that online app or rent the audio tour. Your head won't fit into its old hat sizes afterwards, and you'll be a more generous, wise and observational person afterwards."
"Written April 25, 2016",Went for a walk back in history,"Each room in this castle of art contains some of the most famous works of each historical period.  Entrance was free at the time that my whole family entered, all 5 of us.  While you are there refresh yourself at a tea table with some cakes and scones.  Bon."
"Written April 24, 2016",Samples the masters,"Although this museum is not nearly as famous as the Prado or the Louvre, it is no slouch.  There are amazing representations of all the masters here and great temporary exhibits as well.  Leave plenty of time as there is so much to see.  "
"Written June 26, 2015",A very nice and well rounded collection,"The National Gallery is very nice museum with a solid well rounded collection. The pieces they have are significant and are excellent examples of their period. If you don;t know much about art I would get a guide or read up. The museum is not over whelming and you can easily get it down in a few hours depending on your pace. This art museum was my favorite however, I did not give it 5 stars because many of the galleries were closed due to a strike so we were unable to see some really important pieces. "
"Written June 26, 2015",Amazing Collections...go and take your time,"So much to see and all in one place. The National Gallery is well organized and holds so many people, you do not feel too crowded even if there on a weekend. I avoided the lines for the restrooms,  however, that was not a place you wanted to be. "
"Written June 24, 2015",Always worth a visit!,"I go to London every few years and always set aside time to walk through the National. If you enjoy art or history, it is a must see.  "
"Written June 18, 2015",Do Not Miss,Even if you really do not like art this is an attraction that you should not miss.  The location is great and easily accessible and probably fits right in with your other sightseeing stops. I usually spend an hour or two there and that is quite enough unless you are really into art.  Best thing about it in pricey London is that it is free.
"Written June 17, 2015",Outstanding collection of Art,"The whole exhibit is amazing.  I especially enjoyed the pictures painted by Van Gogh, Renoir, and Cezanne.  Even the gift shop has a very good collection of items for sale.  I especially enjoyed the books for children that I purchased for my nieces three little girls."
"Written June 17, 2015","A great collection, and it's free","This art museum has a great collection of art over several periods. As is usual with old buildings that house major works of art, the building itself is beautiful. The admission price can hardly be beaten, just a voluntary donation at the door.  Well worth the time."
"Written June 14, 2015",Breath Taking and Awe Inspiring,"This gallery was totally amazing. I seriously doubt that you could see the whole thing and take time to appreciate the various pieces of art in only one day. Coming back a second or even third day would be no problem as there is no admission fee...it's free to the public.The art work was sorted by type and date which made choosing which of the vast halls you wanted to see an easy task. We were amazed at how many priceless pieces were there for anyone to see up close. While we did not avail ourselves of their services, docents were everywhere and ready to answer questions about the various pieces of art.Please do not miss this wonderful gift to humanity."
"Written June 12, 2015",For art lovers,"Here you can find Renoirs, Vermeer, Titian, Cézanne, Monet, Rubens, Van Gogh, Michelangelo, Raphael, Vélazquez, Da Vinci and Boticelli, among thousands of others, and it's free! By Trafalagar sq. in Central London."
"Written June 12, 2015",A True Treasure,This museum has so many of the Western world's most famous artists and their works that a few hours should be spent here to appreciate them.
"Written June 11, 2015",Masters of Art,Amazing collection of art from about the 12th century to 20th century. Monet exhibit was going at the time. If you love art it's a must.
"Written April 26, 2015",Of course you do have to visit the National Gallery!,"The official cite for the National Gallery list 10 reasons to visit and I agree with all of them and would have no problem adding a bunch of reasons of my own. I would never tire of visiting the exhibits. Just amazing! A one day visit is simply not enough and you have to pick and choose which sections you want to see or you will get very tired. Before going to the Gallery, especially if you don’t have the luxury of multiple visits, research the gallery exhibits and they have lots of advice on what might interest you based on your love of art."
"Written April 25, 2015",superb,"best museum I've visited. Free of charge. Beautiful paintings. Excellent store. interesting layout , although critics say it was built inefficiently. Still nice to look and see what the fuss about the architecture was about."
"Written April 25, 2015",Something for everyone.,"From icons to the impressionists.  A wonderful collection.  Beautifully curated and cared for.  An classic old building and a new extension that, despite initial protestations, actually does work.  Somewhere to sample bit by bit if you have the opportunity.  And free, as are so many of London's galleries and museums.  Long may it last."
"Written April 25, 2015",Inventing Impressionism,"This may be the best exhibition ever at the National Gallery. It's beautifully curated and each room tells a part of the story.Even if you aren't a great fan of Impressionism, this is a must-see for all who love art."
"Written April 24, 2015",Majestic,"Starting from the building, this gallery is amazing! Dreamy destination for art lovers and not. I recommend it 100%."
"Written April 23, 2015",Premier London Art Museum,"I really love that it's free admission - art should be available to all.  A really broad collection of European masters from all over the continent. Located in Trafalgar Square it's easy to get to. On a sunny day, lots of people hang out on the steps, great people watching."
"Written April 22, 2015",FANTASTIC,"- One of the best collections of art in the World. Paintings from 1300 to 1900 are all there.  It is very difficult to see the entire collection in one or two visits. (may be the high-lights can be seen/ the brochure has the highlights with room numbers ).The interiors of the gallery itself is a place to see and enjoy. -One single place to see many Masters, Countries , impressionists et al. If you like art/paintings, you will be stunned to see the collection and this gallery  should never be missed at all ,if you are in London.. (I have seen a number of paintings many times.) - Entrance fee to this glorious  collection is FREE too.!! .  - Pl hire a audio guide; It will be very useful to enjoy the paintings. (a few times I have viewed paintings without the audio guide, I feel lost)  Let me share something. I have been visiting this Gallery from 1987!!  (until now, about 50 times plus, all more than 4 hrs ) latest visit being April 2015. (will be visiting again a few times in July and August '15.)"
"Written April 20, 2015",Inventing Impressionism--Go!,"The National Gallery is stupendous, even without seeing this special exhibition.  But as long as you're there, do see this show.  We are off to Paris next, and as we viewed this show we realized that some of the paintings we would have looked for at the D'Orsay and Louvre are HERE.  The paintings gathered together in one spot represent the finest art of the Impressionists.  The curators produced a booklet that comes with the price of admission that allows guests to browse through the galleries at an unhurried pace, reading about each painting without having to peer at wall plaques (which often blocks the view of others).  The colors, the textures, the vibrancy, the inspiration--it all comes through beautifully.  Despite the timed entry, the rooms are crowded,  Don't feel you need to see the paintings in order--just watch for openings at each painting and move in that direction.  You will be rewarded with a good look at some of the best art in the world. "
"Written April 20, 2015",Van Gogh and Monet!,"Spectacular Van Gogh's Sunflowers, Monet's Waterlillies, Seurat's Bathers. There were quite a few rooms closed. It was strange. But still worth the visit!"
"Written April 19, 2015","Fabulous art, for free!","This museum is amazing.  Not only is it full lf fabulous art, but it is free to enter.  It is very well organized by centuries, which is helpful due to the vast spaciousness and amount of rooms of art that they contain.  Be sure to grab a map/guide upon entering.  Since it is free, it can be very crowded, especially with tour groups and school trips."
"Written July 10, 2015",Lots of Goodies,"Plenty to keep you busy for a few days!!!  We did the audio tour, and it was very helpful.  Also, you can jump all around, rather than having to go in order.   Wear comfy shoes, as there is LOTS of walking!"
"Written July 10, 2015",Wonderful: world class art museum,This is a large and crowded museum but well worth it. The exhibits are thoughtfully arranged by date shown on the gallery floor entrances. Since these are signature masterpieces of art history you can use this to go directly to your art period of interest. Just stunning. Very crowded when we went but the people were polite and there is seating in some galleries. If you are looking for a particular painting the front desk staff is very helpful.
"Written July 7, 2015",Plan on lots of trips!,"Each time I go to the National Gallery, I see new and exciting things.  It's one of my favorite things to do in London if the weather turns nasty.  You can stay for hours and not get bored!  It is always exciting to see a painting that you have read about.  I usually print out one of the ""trails"" before I leave (found on their website), so that I can focus on things I love.  My favorite has been the Dutch Masters trail.  Go for a few hours and come back often - it's free!"
"Written July 7, 2015",so much to see!,Leave plenty of time to see as much as you can.  Go online and map out the gallery so you dont get lost
"Written July 4, 2015",Walk through pleasantly,"I was actually surprise by the amount of things on display, by the helpfulness and friendliness of staff members and by the clear and visible directions inside the building, great space, worth a visit over a few days"
"Written July 4, 2015",Certainly must see attraction ,"We visited with our 2 sons (7 and 10) and they enjoyed as well , as much as you can expect from 3 boys this age to enjoy museum.We took guided audio tour and it was worth it.The collection is amazing!We spent about 3 hours, obviously you can enjoy full day, but for kids 2-3 hours should be sufficient."
"Written July 3, 2015",Breathtaking works,"I had no idea they had some of the greatest pieces from all eras! This may be much smaller than the Louvre in size and scale and number of pieces, but this place has an exquisite collection. Personally I felt Louvre has more of French art but here it is more varied. And no entry fee. You can go there every day and spend a few hours. In fact if you love art, then you may need weeks together. Here you can view Van Gogh's 'Sunflowers', 'The toilet of Venus'- an amazing work by Velazquez, a remarkable number of self portraits by Rembrandt , Caravaggio's stunning work ""The supper at Emmaus""  and my personal favorite 'Madonna of the cat', a 500 year old Italian work.  I found this place not that much crowded and it was very calming to be amongst these masterpieces for a few hours. "
"Written July 3, 2015",Great place to visit,"Great place to visit, located in Trafalgar Square, free entry,  do not miss the Leonardo Da Vinci drawings. "
"Written July 2, 2015",Good experience for Children,Free admission. Going here is a must. Very nice exposition of pictures. We saw Giotto and Leonardo and Antonello da Messina...
"Written June 27, 2015",Always a great museum,"I love this museum. If you only have a short time in London,  this is one of the most visit museums.  In one place you can see paintings from the Renaissance through more modern times. It is not so large as to wear you out, but not so small you feel you wasted your time."
"Written March 23, 2015",Should be #1 on your list,"The National Gallery is located on Trafalgar Square.  Admission is free which is absolutely wonderful.  Also, photography with no flash is allowed except in the special exhibits.  The paintings start back in 1260.Don't miss Botticello's Venus and Mars, van Gogh's Sunflowers, all the Turners, some of Michelango's paintings Raphael's Pope Julius II, Velazquez The Rokeby Venus, the Ruben paintings, all the Impressionists and well the list would be too long.  A person who loves art could spend a day here."
"Written March 22, 2015",Very Interesting,I really like the layout of the building. It was somewhat like an exciting maze. This is a definite go-to place if you are in the Trafalgar Square area. 
"Written March 21, 2015",I keep coming back ...,"Even after many years of visiting the National Gallery, I still make a point to stop in every time I`m in London.  A beautiful building that houses incredible paintings that sits on Trafagar Square.  Yes, the crowds can be maddening at times but I`ve found that the trick is to slow down.  Give yourself enough time to see the pieces or periods or styles that interest you the most.  Sit for a bit and let those who are busy capturing the moment take their pics and move on.  Oddly enough, it is an ideal place to decompress in the midst of hoards of people passing by the magnificent displays.  Enjoy!"
"Written March 20, 2015",Amazing London,"A beautiful museum with many beautiful works makes the British National Gallery a great visit for both local and tourist alike. I had about an hour and a half to squeeze in a visit to the museum so I definitely had to plan what works of art I wanted to see. They had a few Caravaggio so I made a dash to see those (wonderful as always) and then I made my way over to the Rembrandt and then the Monet section. All stunning and very worthy of anybody's time. The museum itself was gorgeous and the staff there were very helpful and also very knowledgeable.Other big pros about the National Gallery: it is free, it is accessible by just about any form of public transport, and it is in a great location of London--close to many other attractions (such as Buckingham palace)."
"Written March 20, 2015",not to be missed,"Very friendly staff, beautifull collections of paintings. By chance, we  witness the explanation given by a guide to a group of very young children. Ir was wonderful. Everyone who was in the room stopped to listen to the explanation of the guide. Kids were thrilled."

"Written March 18, 2015",Beauty and quiet !,"Most beautiful collections ever in great surroundings, enjoying peace and quiet in the middle of noisy London! Also great for a cup of coffee enjoying some more views in the confort of an armchair in a nice coffee shop which provides good rest before resuming your tour of the Gallery. Fantastic atmosphere ! Loved my visit ! "
"Written March 17, 2015",Most of the rooms were closed due to industrial action,"Hardly any of the rooms were open we never saw any of the great masterpieces and we were only informed of this once we had entered! It wasn't mentioned on the web site, very disappointed."
"Written March 15, 2015",Not to be missed!,"We downloaded a list of 30 ""must see"" items in advance and had the information desk help us plot our course. With 4 kids, teens and 9, it was a great scavenger hunt style visit that kept us running and enjoying the museum for almost two hours. The ones who had to be coaxed in ended up slowing down to see extra items that interested them along the way. "
"Written March 14, 2015",A must visit,"We went to National Gallery again today because my daughter loves art. It was amazing as always. However, we didn't expect some rooms were closed due to the industrial strike. In the future we would better check the news via their Twitter or Facebook before we go. "
"Written April 2, 2015",The Gallery itself is a work of art,"If you like paintings, you can't miss the National Gallery. They do have a few lesser works by the big names, so if you've been to the Met (NYC) or the Musee D'Orsay recently, you might notice it. But it's an amazing place and the halls and ceilings are worth the price of admission. But of course, there is no price - it's free, just like the British Museum. I was there at 10:15 on a Monday morning and it was relatively quiet. Staff are mostly helpful and knowledgeable. If you're new to London, you're going to go to Trafalgar square anyway, right? Pop your head into the National Gallery and see Van Gogh's Sunflowers at the very least."
"Written April 1, 2015",A must see!,"A beautiful museum filled with notably famous pieces of artwork. Free admission but they suggest you make a small donation, 5£ I think. The museum sits in Trafalgar Sq which in itself is something not to miss. "
"Written April 1, 2015",Great gallery and its free!,"the gallery is in the centre of the city, there is a lovely, fun atmosphere out the front with buskers and other entertainment and the building is beautiful. The paintings are arranged in time and there is a wonderful variety. We loved this gallery. If you need to buy souvenirs and or presents the shop attached has a great choice of quality items that are very reasonably priced. You can take photos in the gallery. Definitely put on the must do list and then you could also catch a lovely red bus somewhere as well."
"Written March 30, 2015",Fabulous building  with masterpieces galore.,Looked forward to visiting but was disappointed by closures due to industrial action by staff of the main galleries that we went to see.
"Written March 30, 2015",A wonderful gallery,"Even if you are not particularly interested in art, wandering around this gallery is a pleasant experience; you see paintings and photos that you have seen before; hey - there's that painting of Henry VIII; works are organised chronologically; oldest at the top last time I visited; and there is a lovely restaurant at the top with fantastic views - get there a tad before lunch and beat the crowd; every time I go to London, I like to visit this gallery; thank you too all those who work there and make it such a great place."
"Written March 29, 2015",Not to be missed!,"One of the most impressive museums I have ever been to. I love the National Gallery in Washington D.C, but this was even more impressive. Other than the Musee D ORsay in Paris, this is the best collection I have visited....and it is Free. Wow! Spend a few hours here, then enjoy a lovely walk to Parliment or Buckingham Palace, or explore Trafalgar Square....beautiful area to walk and enjoy the city. Amazing collection. Enjoy!"

"Written March 26, 2015",Glorious and Free,"A great collection from most eras, including a giant Monet water lilly painting, as well as Van Gogh sunflowers.  You can spend an entire day here.  Treat yourself to a delicious lunch at the upscale Portrait restaurant-the view and the food are great."
"Written March 26, 2015",Enjoyable,"The national gallery is conveniently located at Trafalgar Square. It is easily reached by tube and there are many restaurants to eat near here. We did not do the guide, but if we had more time, we would have. I think that the collection is impressive and the museum itself is well mapped out. We did not have tickets in advance and did not have to wait long in line - we went during the week in the morning."
"Written March 25, 2015",Inventing Impressionism is Excellent,"The National Gallery has a superb record on exhibits and this is no exception. The story of Durand-Ruel -- in Paris, London and New York-- is fascinating and made more so by the audio/guidebook and the magnificent grouping of paintings brought together for this exhibit, from a wide variety of museums as well as private collections.  Even with reserved tickets required, it is crowded. I found having the audio helped."
"Written April 18, 2015",Amazing,"A must-see place. Impressive art collection. If you like art, reserve at least 3 hours to see the museum, and some good minutes to sit somewhere at Trafalgar Square enjoyng the London living."

The collections are so rich and every important artist and time period is covered by a number of fine works, I need to go back."
"Written April 8, 2015","“NG Never stops surprising us"" Thank you.","I try do between 5 and 6 museums when in London and in March I was lucky to see the “Inventing Impressionism” covering the amazing world of Monsieur Durand-Ruel who was quoted as ‘The man who sold a thousand Monet’s’ and created the ‘Modern Art-market as we know it to day. Many pictures were rare as came from afar or in private hands. It is incredible to think that this one person actually created the market place for Impressionist Paintings as we know it to day, and without his support as a Gallery owner selling these incredible paintings from 1870’s to his death in 1922 (his son carried on in their NY gallery until the 50’s) History has it that M. Durand-Ruel’s business nearly failed several times but his gut feeling that the painters he re-presented (Manet - Degas - Renoir - Monet - Pissarro and Sisley) was ‘the future’ And was he Right!!. Thrilling exhibition, one not to miss"
"Written April 8, 2015",Wonderful Impressionism exhibition,"The National Gallery is terrific.  Yes, it's busy.  And free!  'Inventing Impressionism' is a current special exhibition (which you do have to pay for) and for me it was breathtaking.  Fascinating story about the art dealer who 'made' the Impressionists by buying their pictures before anyone else saw their value. Five or more Renoirs in the first room!  Worth joining the Art Fund before you go because you get in to the special exhibitions for half price, and get free or reduced entry to lots of other art galleries and museums in London and the rest of the UK."
"Written April 7, 2015",Wonderful art and all for free!,Being quite local to London (but not a Londoner) I always pop in to the National if I have any spare time in the City. Its great to see a different part on each visit. We are so lucky that we have places like this for free here in the UK.
"Written April 3, 2015",extraordinary,"One of the best museums in the world! Shame they are privatising their security services and not honouring the people who have worked there for decades, some of them, but apart from that, a brilliant place. "
"Written May 22, 2015",An All Day Affair!,"I base a lot of travel decisions on where I can find spectacular art. You go to New York for MOMA. You go to Florence for The Uffizi. You go to London for The National Gallery.My husband and I recently spent a week in London, and spent the better part of a day in the National Gallery. We got there shortly after they opened, picked up a guide (it’s only £1), then set off into the galleries. You’ll definitely need the guide. This is a huge museum and it’s easy to get lost. We saw an enormous amount of art that even those with a casual interest would recognize. Leonardo, Raphael, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Titian, Caravaggio, Rubens, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Turner, Constable, Cezanne, Monet, Van Gogh … and so much more.The real thrill was to see these works on a wall (not in a book) and get a true sense of the scale of these masterpieces. We took our time wandering through, broke for lunch at the National Dining Room, finished up the rest of the galleries, had a caffeine injection at the Espresso Bar, did some shopping for souvenirs, and finally left around 4:00! It was an all-day affair!And I loved it and wouldn’t trade that day for anything in the world.If you are an art-lover, you need to visit."
"Written May 22, 2015",The attendants could develop their people skills more!,"I visited with a friend who is a collections manager for the National Trust in a house that houses a considerable art collection from a former chairman of the National Gallery (I am a volunteer at that house too). Whilst observing a painting that was glazed, I pointed at a feature and the attendant came up behind me and shouted ""Don't point you may touch the painting"". He could have made me jump and therefore accidently touched it (we weren't that close thankfully). She commented that if I, as a volunteer, had spoken to a visitor like that, she would have remonstrated with me. How about, ""Isn't it a lovely painting, but careful Madam, you don't want to set off all the bells and whistles""? Its not what you say but how you say it!"
"Written May 21, 2015",Must visit it if you go to London,"Free entry, a donation suggested, and very well deserved.  One of the best painting museums of the world."
"Written May 20, 2015",Great Gallery,"Had a great time visiting here! It took me about two hours to walk through the whole exhibition and it was lovely. Still amazes me that  you can enter this place without buying an entrance ticket, it was totally worth it! "
"Written May 20, 2015",Amazing,If you want to see some of the most famous painting in the art history just go there. For those interested in art also the non famous one are pretty amazing. Plus it's free. It's crowded but who can blame it?
"Written May 20, 2015",My favourite place,"I visited this museum during my one day trip to London and I wasn't disappointed. I spent all my time in the Impressionist gallery. I found there all the artists I admire and I felt so happy that I had the opportunity to see their work. The entrance is free, but you can make donations. The gift shop is very nice, I bought a kit for planting sunflowers and they grow beautifully being the perfect reminder of a perfect visit."

"Written March 12, 2015","Great Museum, Important Pieces","Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Raphael, and a ton of Dutch Masters - they are all here. The art here is important to see, as Sunflowers, Venus and Mars and many other paintings are in the museum. The collection is made up almost exclusively of paintings, but they do not disappoint. A must-see in London. "

Coming from the United States it is an incredible treat to be able to see Pieces of art from the most famous and historic artists who ever lived.  Right before your eyes!  You name them, they are represented.  In the US we get see paintings from famous painters when they are on tour.  Here, this their home!  I was speechless and in awe."
"Written June 5, 2015","Beautiful Architecture, Wonderful Collection","Although I enjoyed the classical paintings for me the architecture of the building was maybe the thing that I loved the most about the National Gallery. Oh, but then I came across the Monet's work and Van Gogh's Sunflowers. It was truly thrilling to view these paintings. The gift shop at the National Gallery is, in my opinion, the most beautiful in London. It is a treasure trove of beautiful gifts from a beautiful place! Don't miss the National Gallery!"
"Written June 5, 2015",Amazing collection,"This is an amazing destination for lovers of art.  However, like all such galleries, there is too much to appreciate all at once, and visitors find themselves aimlessly wandering from gallery to gallery getting more and more tired!  A Gallery guide for £1 is a good investment.  Even better is to attend with some goal in mind: some painter, or time period to investigate, and then to concentrate on that.  Most of the rooms have seating where you can sit and contemplate your favourite work (and rest your weary bones!)"
"Written June 4, 2015",great paintings,A lot to see with so many paintings but some of the painting was moved to the basement so you need the guide
"Written June 1, 2015",Jaw dropped,"How can the English make it free while lots of museum out there in the Europe mainland charge us a fine-dining meal to see some trash they stored? A day in National Gallery is breathtaking, riding you through the history and it can make you feel like the most cultured boy in the world. "

"Written February 27, 2015",Marvellous place,Great place to have a short visit - or spend the whole day. Great paintings in many rooms. Take the Sackler room 34 - and sit down like Bond did;)
"Written February 24, 2015",Escape the rain or cold and see great paintings,There are so many well-known paintings here that you are bound to recognise something. I used to work nearby and had many favourites that I would visit during my lunch hours. The attendants are very knowledgeable and most would probably appreciate a little chat to pass the time.Be aware that toilet queues can be very long on busy days (better to pop into a nearby pub).
"Written February 22, 2015",Cold coffee,"My wife and I used the cafeteria in the National Gallery and after waiting for some time, two cold cups of coffee arrived. We informed the server and she took them away and brought back what we thought were two fresh cups about three minutes later which were only marginally warmer than the first two. When we added milk (which had been passed over from the next table that had just been vacated) the coffee was then colder than the first two cups. The bill had a 12.5% service charge added to it and a note in small print that it was a voluntary payment. We chose not to pay it but as a sizable number of their visitors are overseas tourists, they probably coughed up. My advice would be to bring your own refreshments if visiting the National Gallery."
"Written May 26, 2015",Staff strike,Mostly closed but plenty of staff to run shops cafe and restaurants. Possibly they should work out what their Core business is.
"Written May 9, 2015",90% of the museum was closed with no warning !,"i came to london with this as my number one thing to do (of 2 things) and i was very excited to see great works of art up close and in person - i went in and all seemed pretty normal till i went through a few rooms and so many doors were closed off, i saw a couple rooms and then i found out that most of the museum is closed for the next week or so - i had checked the website and am on the mailing list and no notice was given, there were signs here and there saying rooms would be closed but no indication that most of the museum was unavailable - it especially bugged me as i tossed in my donation note and frankly wanted my money back - the few rooms that were open were good but most of it was gilded religious artwork which was all pretty similiar - i was so looking forward to the art and so incredibly disappointed as this is likely my only trip to england in my life and my only chance to see such beautiful art that it literally brings me to tears that i missed it"

"Written May 6, 2015",Great paintings,Was mesmerised by the art in the national gallery. Each room was more magnificent than the other. It is so large and so wonderful that you lose track of time. Half a day at the gallery is just not enough. One can go on and on
"Written May 1, 2015",Wonderful wonderful collection of art.,"The historical range of art at this gallery is very good, from Baroque to Impressionism. There are some excellent Baroque pieces, well preserved and lovingly cared for. There's even a cartoon by Leonardo Da Vinci , of Mary and St Anne with Jesus and John the Baptist as babies. When you've wandered around being amazed by the Baroque ( etc) section, relax in the great cafe with a cup of tea and a cake ( or coffee and sandwiches) . When you've refreshed yourself you can go to the Impressionist section and feast your eyes on Monet's Waterlillies. A brilliant, free, day out ( donate if you can, to keep this gallery operating)."

Every time I go to London I stop by to see so many of my old favorite ""friends""--the Monets, ""Sunflowers,"" the Constables, the Sargents, the Renaissance (Giotto!), and ever so much more. Over the years, we've become ""best friends."" What a museum. It's free--but feel free to donate generously.  The museum attendants, too, all seem so knowledgeable."
"Written April 30, 2015",Spend an Hour or a Day,"If you want to stand and look and study great works of art, then this is a great place to visit. If you want to stroll and peruse great works of art, then this is a great place to visit. The layout is easy to follow so you can find specific artists if you wish. No compulsory entry charge and handily located at Trafalgar Square, it is rated number 1 for a reason!"
"Written April 30, 2015",I Can't Stop Going - Its Amazing,"I moved to London 8 months ago and I have been to the National Gallery more than any other museum in London.  Sure there are lots of others that are great (British Museum and the Museum of London to name two) but the National is my home away from home.  The Late Rembrandt exhibit was exceptional (my partner went twice) and Inventing Impressionism was my absolute favorite. So rarely does anyone even acknowledge that there is a ""business"" part of the art world and that artists need to be supported somehow - whether or not their style or manner of expression is popular.  Inventing Impressionism showed in dramatic fashion the importance of the gallery owner and collectors who helped create a legacy that we all enjoy today.  All of that said, no matter what the current exhibit is at the National Gallery - go - just go.  You will not regret it."
"Written April 26, 2015",Brilliant,"Not to be missed if you like arts. Very, very rich collection, free entrance for all and large rooms, this is a world class museum."
"Written April 26, 2015",Great for art lovers,"Visited the gallery with my daughter to see the inventing Impressionism exhibition.  It's a very interesting exhibition highlighting the advent of Impressionism.  Some of the art I loved, some I hated - all a matter of taste, but very good overall.  My daughter loved it as she has a passion for Impressionism."
"Written December 14, 2014",Rembrandt late works exhibition at the National Gallery,"The works themselves are wonderful - if you can see them, that is. They need to sort out their streaming - too many people, far too many of whom don't seem to understand gallery etiquette. It is more than annoying when a party of yakking women park themselves right in front of you! Some of the lighting I found weird as well: somehow I wasn't expecting to see reflection off the canvases. Those gripes over it's a must see. Masterly, vibrant, almost impressionist brush work - truly amazing."
"Written December 8, 2014",Amazing,Took a long overdue visit to the National Gallery and was overwhelmed by the amazing collection. Well worth a visit and don't forget to contribute the recommended £4. Worth every penny to help keep the Gallery going. 
"Written December 4, 2014",AWESOME,I absolutely love this historical wonder!!! I had never been to London before and this is one place that I am so glad I made room for on our trip :)
"Written December 2, 2014",Disappointing visit to the Rembrandt exhibition,"We had booked many weeks before and had travelled down to London especially to see the ""Later Works of Rembrandt"" exhibition. We had timed tickets (as everybody had to have) and arrived on time.Regrettably, whilst the concept of having timed entry is good, the management of the visitors was poor. It was seriously overcrowded. Many of the etchings and drawings are very small and you need to be close to them to appreciate them. This was impossible because people listening to the audio tour just stood immobile in front of the pictures making it almost impossible to see them. It was easier to see some of the larger oil paintings, over the heads of the crowds but we were bitterly disappointed by the experience and left before we had really had a chance to benefit from the exhibition.We understand that the Gallery needs to maximise its revenue and sell as many tickets as possible but it also has to realise that it owes its customers  to provide value for money. The Gallery needs to plan its crowd management better. And, as for those poor souls pushing wheelchairs and being pushed in wheelchairs it must have been a nightmare. "
"Written December 2, 2014",Late Rembrandts poorly exhibited,"Subject matter can't fail to attract interest, but the great paintings are let down by bad lighting.  Lesser galleries have managed better.   Inexcusable !"
"Written November 28, 2014",Only wish we had more time,"This is a wonderful museum.  If you are short on time like we were you can ask for the highlights tour.  The headset is free with the London Pass.  Otherwise, it's worth paying for.  I think it was only 3 pounds!"
"Written November 28, 2014",Avoid exhibitions - they oversell tickets & pack you in,"The National Gallery is one of the most astounding collections in the world and to spend an hour or two here wandering around the galleries is a memorable thing indeed (I live in London and so have done this often). However, I was prompted to write a review based on the most unpleasant experience I had at their Rembrandt show. Although timed tickets there was a huge queue to get in, they sell far too many tickets and going around the show becomes unpleasant. I know these shows are about making money but surely they have to strike a balance and have some intent on giving guests a good experience. One of our foremost art commentators, Richard Brooks in the Sunday Times, said exactly this in a recent article in the ST. Shame on the National for taking our £16 and giving us an unpleasant experience."
"Written November 25, 2014","Interesting place, takes lots of time","Art in all form, free entrance, lots of tourists. I was there for a few hours, and I didn't manage to see but a small part of it."
"Written November 16, 2014",The Rembrandt show at London's National Gallery,"This is one of those very rare exhibitions that are truly ""once in a lifetime"" events. This large, comprehensive show of Rembrandt's late work in various media is superb, but the crowds are so heavy that you should (a) purchase tickets in advance and (b) arrange to come at 10am when the gallery opens. The show is wonderfully done, and  have only given 4 stars because the crowds make you work to see the pictures, It's worth the struggle."
"Written November 9, 2014",Great museum!,It was so neat to be able to go here (for free!) and see so many famous and historical paintings all in one place! They are all artfully displayed and have a short description of each piece. Seeing the Royal Family's portraits was a neat experience too!
"Written July 11, 2014",The tresure must see,"Please give a 2-hour budget in your visit plan at least, to see the so-called top-30 amasing materpieces: including Titian, Botticelli, Da Vinci,...etc."
"Written June 30, 2014",national gallery london,I hate to say that we ran out of time watching the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace and were very limited to our time at the national gallery.  It is definitely something that I would go back to do.  What little we saw was amazing and did not realize how large and how much time it would take to get even a glimpse of what all they had to see.  Luckily my daughter had been living in England for a little while and had recently visited so she knew what to show us for a quick visit.
"Written June 29, 2014",Perfect place for a rainy day.,Free to get in but there are donation boxes in the entrance. We visited as the weather looked dodgy. Wow! Endless priceless works of art on display in a beautiful building. Well worth a look if you're in the area.

"Written April 10, 2014",HIGH FLYING ADORED - VERONESE,"Three cheers for Nicholas Panny and Xavier F. Solomon for mounting this life-enhancing exhibition. The accompanying catalogue is flawless and beautifully written.Artistic genius, so often cited, so rarely found, as a stand-alone attribute, is probably of little use. For genius to flourish, to fulfil its destiny and bear exceptional fruit, it needs to co-exist and be touched by a unique mental strength, outstanding external influences and the fortuitous circumstance of time and place.As right and rewarding as it is to triangulate Veronese with Titian and Tintoretto, the sparks that did ignite his genius are to be found earlier in his development, mainly from his hometown.Verona, in the early sixteenth century, as for centuries before, was economically prosperous, culturally forward and even boasted a substantial quantity of Roman ruins; arches, columns and theatres. It is therefore not surprising that the programme of building undertaken at this time should look back to the monumental, elegant and assured style of Classical Rome as the ideal manifestation of Verona’s power and sophistication.The architect charged with overseeing a great deal of the building work was a local man, Michele Sanmicheli. It was Sanmicheli, along with resident artist Antonio Badile, who by dint of familial and professional connections, made young Paulo Caliari, as the stone-cutters son was named, their protégé, encouraging and guiding him in his studies of art and, importantly, architecture, by introducing him to the best practitioners. From Giovanni Caroto, he would have learnt the art of fresco painting; from Parmigianino, the refined depiction of passion; from Corregio, delicate modelling of features; from Lelio Orsi, the power of chiaroscuro in drawing; and from Durer, the sharp delineation of outline, so useful in painting drapery. Add all these influences to a remarkable visual imagination and there explodes on to the scene one of the most audacious audition pieces in art-history.The Conversion Of Mary Magdalene [ 1547 room 1]] is an interpretation of Aretino’s 1534 text, La Humanite di Christe. Veronese paints Mary and her sister Martha as they meet Jesus in a temple. Mary is deeply ashamed of her expensive and ostentatious clothes and begins to remove her jewellery. Though it is possible to detect many of those elements that would reoccur in Veronese’s later work, including the architectural background and half concealed figures, it is the exceptional use of colour, not so much in its range, but rather in the placement and subtle modulation that makes this work so original.It caught the eye of discerning wealthy patrons and over the next ten years Veronese developed and honed his style in a series of commissions including The Temptation Of Anthony Abbot [ 1552 ] for Mantua cathedral, which shows, in the muscularity of his central figure, a direct line of influence, through Giulio Romano, to Michelangelo.Naturally enough, he painted his patrons, borrowing the full length format used so well by Moroni, but one can guess that the single-sitter format didn’t appeal to Veronese’s innate sense of theatre, so he began incorporating entire families within a biblical narrative. In The Supper At Emmaus [ room 2], parents, children, relatives, servants and pets seem to exist quite happily as Jesus is recognised by the two disciples. Nowadays, such a depiction wouldn’t meet with our sense of decorum and appear as bad taste, but as a new genre of portrait painting in the sixteenth century it proved popular. Room 2 also contains the magnificent Martydom Of St. George and the Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine.In the words of Veronese’s biographer, Ridolfi, ‘ plants moved to a different soil often improve in grace and beauty’ By the mid 1550’s he had settled in Venice and he soared. Here he would have seen the vast horizontal pictures, known on account of the structure over which the canvas was stretched, as Telieri pictures which, in the hands of Vittore Carpaccio were magnificent and festive, full of sumptious colour, incident and noise. Whereas Carpaccio painted his crowds under the Venetian sky, Veronese brought them in, and placing his figures in architectural settings, created his great ‘Feasts’; The Feast in the house of Simon, The Feast in the house of Levi, The Feast of St Gregory and the Marriage Feast at Cana. These enormous canvases are too big to move to this exhibition, but there is, in room 3, at a fraction of the size, but still large and impressive, the enigmatic The Family of Darius before Alexander [1565-7]. This picture captures the moment when Darius’s mother, having expressed her deep gratitude for the way in which Alexander had treated her son, the defeated Darius, realises that she addressed Hephaestion by mistake. It is impossible to conclusively say who is who in this painting, whether Alexander is the figure in scarlet or the figure in orange and black, their gestures can be interpreted either way. It hardly matters, it is part of the appeal of the picture.Anyone wishing to exercise his neck should stand in the middle of room 5 and compare the two large canvases, The Adoration of the Kings [ around 1573-4]. Here in two similar pictures, a cortege of soldiers, servants, camels and horses, owing much to Jacapo Bassano in their fine detail and rendering, form a disorderly crowd around the infant Christ and Kings. Disorderly, not of course in the way we understand the word, but rather as the means of expressing a valid beauty and harmony, a pictorial device so often used by Veronese to animate his paintings, and here, against a set of ruined wooden buildings, reminiscent of Durer’s 1501 woodcut of the same name, with the extraordinary interplay of light and shadow, both paintings seem shot through with a sort of vulnerability, a kind of fragility. The words of Kenneth Clark come to mind when writing about the background in Leonardo’s Nativity: ‘ … the tatters of our imagination inhabits the ruins of intelligence’. In other words, all that is known, accepted and understood is turned on its head by the advent of Christ.The pictures in Room 6, known as the Four Allegories of Love are mysterious. It is unclear what they are saying and this makes them difficult, but if they are viewed without the encumbrance of meaning, as compositions of light and shade, of line and colour, they come alive as forceful and virtuosic pictures. They are full of movement. The facial expression in a figure in the picture titled ‘ Scorn’ reminded me of a photograph of Evelyn Waugh.In this room, too, is Venus and Mars. I suppose it is something of the nature of looking at pictures that people don’t expect to find humour, and therefore don’t recognise it, but in this naughty little canvas, Veronese demonstrates an impish sense of fun.In the final room there is a marked change of tone and colour. The paintings are dark and sombre. The reasons put forward for this change include the war with Turkey, the influence of Bassano and the terror of the plague. There may well be something in all of that. But I think after forty years of painting with dazzling colours, this move to darker hues must have come as something of a relief. A composer could not spend all his life writing in a major key, he would yearn for the tranquillity of the minor. The paintings are still full of life and energy, The Agony in the Garden [1583] for example, but the deeper colours give then a Tintoretto- like intensity, and the loose fluid brushwork in the Conversion of St. Pantalon is as close to Titian as is possible.  Nor should the darker tones be read as some kind of farewell. Veronese died from a short illness at the age of 60. Who knows what he might have gone on to paint.‘ Good judgement of painting could only be achieved by those who were well instructed in the art, and that ability was a gift of heaven; and that labouring at that without natural talent was like sowing in the waves’ Paulo Veronese."
"Written March 22, 2014",Beautiful,"This is a wonderful gallery with many famous works of art. And it's free! In March 2014 they had a special exhibit of Van Gogh's sunflowers, which was really great."
"Written March 9, 2014",You can spend days here,"The only negative comment I can make concerns the inconvenience of several halls being closed for re-hanging. May have just been bad timing, but it disrupted the flow significantly. Don't overlook the Portrait gallery and the cafe in the Sainsbury wing is a great place to take a break and have a pot of tea."
"Written February 28, 2014",long queues,We wanted to see the sunflowers but the queue was just too long. However we wandered around the rest of the gallery and enjoyed it.
"Written February 27, 2014",I still cannot believe it is for free!,Gigantic building with enough room for the paintings and the curious people. Greatly decorated and with the kindness of having benches in every room.I'm sure I will come back!
"Written February 26, 2014",great gallery,"Amazing paintings, Da Vinci, Monet, Renoir, Manet, T-Lautrec and many more and the portrait gallery. A must go place while in London and it is free! One of the best place in London."
"Written November 9, 2014",Don't miss the Rembrandt exhibition,"My expectations of Rembrandt's Late Works was high, and this exhibition more than exceeded them.  It is glorious!  You would be wise to book ahead and then go slightly late (or early, the attendants are flexible) as on the hour and half hour f timed tickets, there is a queue to get in, and this means that the first few rooms are crowded.  This in no way detracts from the joy of seeing paintings familiar from art books glowing with a life and vigour.  How could such vibrant works have been painted in Rembrandt's later years?Do not miss, if you appreciate art.  Worth every penny of the rather high (£18) entrance fee.Tip:  the descriptions are not alongside the paintings, but in an excellent little booklet.  If anyone you know is going before you, ask them to pick one up for you, so that you can do a little pre-reading."
"Written November 4, 2014",A must visit place,The Supper at Emmaus by Caravaggio Room 32 and of course the Magdalen Reading by Rogier van der Weyden in Room 56 are worth a visit.
"Written October 30, 2014",Excellent,"It is so amazing to see ""the masters"" work in person, and only a couple feet away.  Loved that I could also take photos, without flash of course.  Also loved that they included Rembrandt paintings that he had not completed.  So interesting to see his process in creating his masterpieces.  Spent over 4 hrs here and loved every minute."
"Written October 29, 2014",The best place to spend a little extra time,"This is every visual feast in one place.  Rather than doing it in a go, we spent about 20 minutes every morning here.  It is the only way to not get overwhelmed by the place."
"Written October 24, 2014",Great Museum,A must see on during your stay in London. The early modern wing has some of the great Renaissance artists I enjoyed very much!
"Written October 21, 2014",Very busy,The National Gallery was VERY busy when I visited. It's hard to enjoy the art when you have to battle with tourists to be able to see anything. This isn't helped by the gallery's maze-like layout. The actual collection is impressive and admittedly a 'must see' but I think I enjoyed my time more at Tate Britain. It's much more quiet and relaxed and they have a great Turner collection.
"Written October 15, 2014",Wonderful!,"Saw works of the masters and had headset giving clear, interesting descriptions and facts about each artwork."

"Written September 22, 2014",An amazing experience for art-lovers,"The National Gallery displays an amazing collection of renowned masterpieces from artists in the caliber of Van Gogh, Monet, Turner, Constable, Velazquez & many others that even people with limited art-related knowledge would recognize. The only downside in my opinion was the lighting which was insufficient in many parts of the Gallery, which seemed to rely too much on natural light."
"Written September 20, 2014",The National Gallery at Trafalgar Square,"I love this whole section of London, and the National Gallery is an important part of it. The gallery is magnificent; breathtaking. Most of the museums in London, including the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, are free. Both are adjacent to each other on the north side of Trafalgar Square, across the street from St Martin in the fields and just down Whitehall from the Palace of Westminster. Just behind the Gallery is the outlet for theater tickets and several theaters are very close. The only think that would make the gallery better would be if you could take photographs as you can in the National Portrait Gallery."
"Written January 31, 2015",A fantastic collection.,A marvellous gallery and way to pass an hour or two as you marvel at the magnificent works of art on display.Whether you are an expert or simply have the slightest interest in what are some of the most iconic artworks in the world; the works are displayed with great skill and thought whilst being accompanied with a short and interesting explanation of each painting's history/provenance etc

"Written January 19, 2015",Always a must in London,"A stunning collection, uplifting and extreamly well represented through the different periods and movements throughout history. Conveniently situated centrally in London in a beautiful Neoclassical purpose-built gallery in Trafalgar Square.There is also a good eatery downstairs for refreshments and spending the whole day at the gallery isn't a hardship. The giftshop is well stocked with worthwhile literature and keepsakes.My Fine Art studies have deepened my appreciation for this calibre of art and gallery that I put at the very top of my list of things to do whist in beautiful London. Other galleries worthwhile are Tate Britain and Tate Modern if you appreciate Modern Art. I'm absolutely star struck when I leave these galleries."
"Written January 18, 2015",Give It A Go,"Not a bad gallery some nice paintings once you experience them it's peaceful and calming and u seem to want to ""view them all"" a wonderful experience all year round."
"Written January 14, 2015",not just a rainy day excursion ... !!,A must see when you are visiting London. It is not possible to describe the amazing selection of world class art ... enough said you should visit more than once to sample the wealth of works and don't forget to make a donation to the upkeep and running of the Gallery.
"Written January 10, 2015",Within Top 10 galleries in the world,"This is one of the museums that are must see and should be on your ""bucket list"". Great collection of paintings and sculptures and all - free of charge. It was my third visit in the last 20 years and every time one may be excited finding masterpieces that you will fall in love with."
"Written January 10, 2015",Don't miss the unique 'Rembrandt - the later years' exhibition - next opportunity probably not before 2050........,"The focus of this exhibition are Rembrandts later years - for his contemporaries, he has peaked. He is yesterday's man. The exhibition shows that in these later years he is actually downright revolutionary, and introduces so much more in sophisticated and diverse techniques, as well as targeting his interest on the oh-so unfashionable real life in all its grubbiness. This sets him apart in history as one of the greatest painters ever. Timed tickets for entry, but noone rushes you through the exhibition. Expect a lot of people. It will be warm. Do hire the audio - I found it extremely insightful, especially when combined with the handout leaflet. You miss this exhibition - you probably don't have a similar opportunity in the next 20 or 30 years......."
"Written December 31, 2014","Rembrandt, movingt","The Rembrandt exhibition is stunning and moving. Good audio guide. Although I had seen quite a number of his paintings over the years in this set-up they tell a fresh new story. Loved the thematic approach. Although timed entry, a bit too crowded."
"Written December 27, 2014",Rembrandt and more...,"Wow. What an amazing museum. Although it can be difficult to navigate, you simply cannot beat their extensive collections and amazing location in Trafalgar Square.The Rembrandt exhibition was stunning––but I could have done without the hordes of pushy elderly people. They mean business!"
"Written December 18, 2014",It's free - no excuse not to go.,"I've been on school trips to the gallery multiple times, but each visit has been equally enjoyable. Great as part of a day out - there are lots of nice restaurants nearby after you've finished in the gallery. Its best feature is, of course, its price, although many of the paid exhibitions are well worth the small fee charged."
"Written July 4, 2013",Musical themes in paintings by Vermeer,"Five paintings by Vermeer, including an early painting not often seen, with musical themes.  I especially liked the explanation at the end of Vermeer's methods...very instructive."
"Written June 8, 2013",Go straight to see Impresionist!,"This is our 3 rd visit to National Gallery. Love this place better than Louvre. We have never overwhelmed here, as we were at Louvre. The facilities such as cafe and was room was much better of than Louvre.We straight to green area room 42-45  to understand impressionist!  Enjoy the 1860s Edouard Manet  and his protegee Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley and other young artists in Paris who were experimenting with bright colour and rapid, sketch-like painting as they too tried to capture aspects of contemporary life.Then we after Vincent van Gogh, but the Sun Flower was not there. It was on loan. We still could see Van Gogh’s Chair, Crab, Farms near Auvers and ""gorgeous"" A Wheatfield, with Cypresses. Then his close friend's still art art Paul Gauguin, who lived and worked with him in autumn 1888. We compare Cézanne who emphasis on structure and solidity in his art by using colour rather than light to convey forms. Enjoy the Bathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses), it is wow!  In his later years, his innovative compositions won the respect of younger artists. Camille Pissaro was also impressive. Look at The Boulevard Montmartre at Night.  That's why these art all called impressionist, to impress us."
"Written June 4, 2013",Very interesting,"It's free woo! And the art is stunning, well worth a look. Always some sort of protest going on outside if the kids get bored and want something to look at"
"Written May 7, 2013",Not just a bunch of portraits,"Ok, it is.  I was very surprised at the stories that the portraits told. I enjoy art and was expecting more of a gallery.  The layout of the museum and the portraits tell the history of London with a lot of information not only about the portrait, but what was going on at the time.  Make sure you do the audio tour."
"Written April 27, 2013",Welcome to the Treasure Dome,"If you think to see it all, think again. This museum is just too much. Too much beauty, too much legend, too much treasure, too much to see.So this is what I recommend you to do: visit the website in advance, decide which paintings you REALLY want to see, make a list and make sure you see these. I'd rather visit a few times 1hour than being numb after 2hours because I've seen too much and I can't realize anymore what extraordinary beautiful artworks I am seeing. Location near Trafalgar makes it easily accessible, so several visits shouldn't be a problem. Have fun!"
"Written March 26, 2013",One of my all-time favorites.,"I used to come here every week when I studied in London to sketch. Keep coming back every time I'm in town to show my friends. It's a wonderful gallery and, best of all, it's free.Be sure to checkout Whistlejacket by George Stubbs - one of my all-time favorite paintings, along with the impressionist rooms - filled with classic paintings by Monet, Van Gogh and Pissarro."
"Written March 15, 2013",must see - take the tour,The Nat is free (but please donate something or patronize the cafe) and also offers excellent guided tours (also free). If you can't make the tour download one of the printed guides from the National Gallery site - there is a top thirty or also themed guides available.I took the guided tour and tell you about the tour and also give you a good strategy on how to take in so much art in one visit in my blog at http://goldstarsteve.blogspot.com/
"Written March 4, 2013",No photos,Germany usually allows no-flash photography but London allows NO photos. Might as well leave your camera at home!
"Written February 28, 2013",we are so fortunate to have this,"It is hard to praise this gallery too highly: the collection is just fantastic and I don't find it difficult to enjoy it: the paintings don't crowd the walls too much and while it's always busy, it's not usually too crowded. Erika Longmuir's companion guide is wonderful."
"Written January 30, 2013",Pleasent Surprise,This Museum has surprised us with this amazing collection and they time escape that has been established. It is a great pleasure to walk around and enjoy the fantastic art work that is there. No doubt is a well worthy place to visit.
"Written September 20, 2014",Just amazing.,Could not be faulted. Great experience. Artwork is laid out in galleries in date format and as you move from room to room you meet the greats. Plenty of seating and space to move! Give yourself a treat and visit. Free entry too!
"Written September 17, 2014","Amazing collection of works, and free of charge too!","You can't possibly visit London and not visit the National Gallery. There's a plethora of beautiful paintings, the rooms seem positively endless and the next one is better than the one before! Do yourself a favour, especially if you are an art student or just plain love good art, and spend a good 3 hours in there! You won't regret it :)"

"Written September 2, 2014","One of the most impressive art collections in the world, and free!","The National Gallery has one of the best art collections in the world (along with the Met (NY), the Louvre and the Hermitage).  But unlike the others, its free, so its easy to just slip in and see a small section or spend the day.  Beautiful, well laid out galleries and non stop masterpieces - Leonardos, Rembrandts, Vangoghs, etc. will impress any art enthusiast."
"Written August 30, 2014",Priceless Artwork for free,How can you not love this art museum. it is so full of priceless work it takes your breath away....No entry fee and beautiful painting to enjoy. There is nothing to dislike about the National Gallery.
"Written August 28, 2014",Amazing Artwork on a Grand Scale!!,"My husband and I visited the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square with our English friends while we were visiting London last week (Aug 16-22). I was stunned at the magnificence, scope and SIZE of this collection of artwork (many of these paintings are ENORMOUS)! I have visited many museums in the US and have never seen such a breathtaking collection, and with FREE admission!! They house some truly spectacular works of art - especially if you enjoy the Impressionist, Renaissance and Baroque artists' works, which I do...as in Monet, Seurat, Van Gogh, Van Dyck, Rubens, Rembrandt, Raphael, Da Vinci and Michelangelo, just to name a few! If you go to the website before your visit, you can plan your trip to make the most of your experience. Then spend an hour, or a full day browsing this wonderful collection!"
"Written August 27, 2014",One of the greatest art places in the world!!,"It is one of the largest art museum in the world, with many important pieces of art, well organized, displayed and showed year around. It is always worth to consult their site for exhibitions! just saw an exhibition on ""making colours"" which is an amazing exhibition telling the history of the colors in art along the time. They put together the origin of the pigments, natural and artificial, the evolution of theory of colors, and some very well selected pieces of art as an illustration of the use of colors in art. It is done in a such simple and intelligent way you will enjoy the visit and will be smarter at the end learning that colors are all in our minds !!"
"Written August 23, 2014","See the ""hidden"" Da Vinci cartoon!","A true gem among great galleries, the building hosts a cartoon by Leonardo Da Vinci  which is placed in a small lightless chamber under heavy protection. Most people seemed to walk past it quickly not realizing what it was - do make a game plan when visiting National Gallery because you will need some sort of focus for navigating the museum. "
"Written July 24, 2014",Perfect Educational Musuem,The Museum is fully equipped with knowledge that can entertaining to kids and adults and it is also free of entry.
"Written February 20, 2015",Filled with History,"What I love most about the national gallery is its size. It isn't enormous like the Louvre so that someone like me who goes to galleries to see specific paintings can enter and exit without walking a half marathon by the time I exit. The layout of the rooms is easily navigable. I visited on a Sunday afternoon and while there were crowds, I entered with my niece (children are issued a free children's audioguide w/ purchase of an adult guide) and we saw what we came to see and were in and out in 1 hour. The biggest crowd was within the Dutch room, next to Van Gogh's paintings. We waited until the lull in the crowd appeared to re-enter the room and see his work. Don't miss the Turner paintings in room 34, as well as the Caravaggio in room 32. There are free workshops for children on Sundays at 11am and 2pm."
"Written February 19, 2015",National Treasure,"Situated on the north side of Trafalgar Square this is truly a ""national"" treasure art works by world famous artists abound in the various galleries. This should be a must see location for all travellers to London but make sure to leave enough time to truly enjoy the wonders on show."
"Written February 18, 2015",Better than anticipated,"What a way to spend the day!  And it didn't seem like enough time, at that.  Maybe we were fortunate that it was less busy than expected, but the layout of the rooms and the sheer volume of magnificent art left us feeling as if we were taking a private tour."
"Written February 13, 2015",One of the world's best.,What can I say?  These paintings are the ones featured in every art appreciation course you ever took.  And it is free!
"Written February 9, 2015",Enjoyable,"The National Gallery is a must see. if your time is limited you can take an organised tour led by gallery lecturers which take about 1 hour. These tours visit some of the art works giving an overall view of the collection. If you do have the time for a lengthy visit it is well worth it  You can do an audio tour through the gallery and they cater for a number of languages. There is lift access, toilet facilities, food venues and a shop.   "
"Written February 8, 2015",Amazing visionary experience.,"I visited National Gallery with a friend, I expected a great experience & didn't disappoint, it has over two thousand paintings & some of the most famous artwork worldwide, including Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers, Leonardo da Vinci's The Virgin of the Rocks, Caravaggio's a Boy bitten by a lizard, John Constable's The Cornfield, Claude Monet's Snow at Argenteuil, Pierre-Auguste Renoir's The Umbrellas & many many more. It's a must for all Art Lovers, it's an amazing experience. I felt honoured to see such visionary  breathtaking artwork, and a major part of history. "
"Written February 8, 2015",Bit of a letdown...,"In the interest of full disclosure, we visited the National Gallery AFTER visiting the Vatican Museum and the Borghese Gallery in Rome.  Otherwise, I may have rated this much higher.  If you are visiting London, you should definitely include this on the itinerary.  Entrance to the museum is free (a donation is requested).  The highlights for us:  part of the original frieze from the Parthenon, the Impressionist collection which includes Monet's Japanese Bridge, Pisarro's Montmartre Blvd, Van Gogh's Sunflowers is quite impressive.  Be wary of pickpockets as you approach the museum.  There are many street vendors right in front of the entrance.  It is centrally located right in Trafalgar Square and near good restaurants and the tube."
"Written February 7, 2015",Don't miss a quick trip to this gallery,"Stopped to see Sunflowers by Van Gogh and a few other famous paintings. Second trip to this Gallery. Definitely worth the time. If short of time at Trafalgar Square, ask staff for the key highlights. Coffee shop in basement nice for warming up and taking a break. Gift shop near by. "
"Written February 6, 2015",Wonderful Art,"Rooms and rooms of artwork and it doesn't cost anything; what's not to like? It is also on Trafalgar Square, which is an important landmark.  I particularly liked the 20th Century stuff."
"Written February 2, 2015",Free Monet,"Worth the trip for Monet's ""The Thames Below Westminster"" alone, the National Gallery houses hundreds of classics. The best part - admission is on a donation basis. "
"Written August 15, 2012",Superb Collection of European Art. The free talks are great too!,"I enjoy any good gallery, and this is great. Its 2,400 works are of an exceptionally high overall quality and form one of the world's greatest collections of European painting. My favourite works are the Impressionistic ones but its also fantastic to see so many classics including those by Constable, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Titan, Raphael, Caravaggio, El Greco, Poisson, Rousseau, Velazquez, Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens, Stubbs, Gainsborough, Goya, Manet, Monet, Renoir, Degas, Cezanne, van Gough and Toulouse-Lautrec!!!On an earlier visit, 30 years ago and long before it was in the public domain, the speaker at a free talk told us that Turner - the 'father of Impressionism' - could hardly see later in his life and he merely painted what he saw - that explained a lot and was quite fascinating!  (His spectacles later proved this claim!)"
"Written July 18, 2012",Best View in London,"Save the money you would have spent on the London Eye, walk through this amazing gallery and then grab a beer/tea/soft drink or whatever tickles your fancy on the top floor.  The view is stunning - try and get in around sunset, it's spectacular"
"Written July 12, 2012","Amazing building, great exhibits",We shared the Natural History museum with our 4 and 7 year old boys.  They loved the dinosaur fossils and we loved the architecture of the building.  The museum is very kid-friendly.
"Written July 5, 2012",Well worth the visit,You need many hours to stroll through the many rooms of this magnificent gallery. To see so many paintings of the world's greatest paintings is unbelievable. The gallery is huge yet maintains a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. And what is really nice is that a visit to the gallery is free...however you can give a donation at the door. A great way to spend a few hours especially when its raining.
"Written May 31, 2012",Great Gallery,Also a great location right on the square. A great place to see people and a lot of great pubs nearby.
"Written May 28, 2012",One of the most beautiful buildings in London,"The National Gallery is the very center of London.  Not only is this one of the best collections of paintings anywhere, the building is both stunning and accessible.  It's also free. The restaurant's even good.  We walked to the Strand from there to the Embankment, a beautiful park on the Thames River, looked at the gorgeous buildings of King's College (University of London), and took a taxi to Bloomsbury."
"Written March 27, 2012","Great place to visit, cafe is yummy too!","You can just sit and soak in the atmosphere in your favourite rooms, waiting for inspiration to strike (I'ma  writer not a painter, but it still works for me!) take informative tours about particular pieces, visit well thought out exhibitions such as the ongoing Turner one, or just go to the cafe for some good, imaginative, but unfussy food. (Perhaps a tad expensive but it could be worse.) Plus it's free to enter the gallery. Only downside is that you get sshh'ed a lot. Particularly Americans I've noticed! although I was once told off in 5 different languages for leaning to close to one small painting, which was an experience :D"
"Written March 3, 2012",Always Drop By,I used to live in London and would just drop in to see one or two paintings sometimes. Being free is an excellent service to the public.
"Written February 5, 2012","My favourite gallery in the world, packed with master pieces!","Loved the range of quality art on display to see for free, gets very packed which can spoil the experience a little bit."
"Written January 24, 2012",Always a winner!,It doesn't matter how long you have in London ...it's always worth paying a visit. You can run in and do a top 10 must see paintings or whatever number you have time for ...or do a guided tour or hire headphones and take your  own time. We did a bit of each during our last visit. We tagged on to an interesting  free tour ( dropping out when we were invited to now go and do our own sketches!!) and then hiring headphones so we could listen to the superb background details and information about paintings that caught our eye. There really is something for all and it can be free if you are that way inclined..... I would hope everyone feels they should make a reasonable contribution to the funds of the Gallery .... a national treasure to be proud of!
"Written January 5, 2012",Amazing and Free,Well worth a visit. We have been a number of times but on this occasion booked for the Leonardo Davinici exhibition which was outstanding (There was a charge for this). You could easily spend a few hours absorbing the amazing collections and it won't cost a penny - but expect to make a small voluntary donation as a gesture.I usually avoid the customary gift shop positioned at exits but this one is worth a visit. Its packed with unusual bits and bobs for the art lover.The building itself is quite an attraction and superbly located overlooking Trafalgar square.
"Written January 5, 2012",FREE! Such a treat every time we visit London,Overcrowded ona  wet Sunday but it didnt matter.  teh further up the floors we wnet the more people had fallen by the wayside and from the joy of the popular to the discvovery of the new we enjoyed every tiring step.  Of course we'll go again.

I always have a look at Turners ""Rain, Steam and speed"" when visiting the museum. Do look up in advance if there is an exhibition with an entrance fee and book in advance if interested."

"Written January 2, 2012",Just wish they weren't so pushy!,"My family and I arrived in London late in the afternoon and decided to rush over to the British Museum and National Gallery before they closed at 5 and 6, respectively. We got to the National Gallery 40 minutes before closing but they started kicking everyone out, even though it wasn't even 6 yet! Though my stay there was brief, the Gallery had quite a few interesting pieces, such as drafts artists such as Van Gogh went through before starting on their actual paintings."

"Written December 11, 2011","Nice gallery, but I have seen better","They have nice paintings and many famous too. It's big, but not so much that you can't see everything. I didn't like that the audio guide didn't have all the paintings explanations, but only the famous ones..."
"Written December 1, 2011",Its better than average,Its better than average but not really very good in my opinion - However that's only because I am comparing it to the Tate which I think is truly excellent  - If you like old masters then you will love the national Portrait Gallery - I would go to the Coutauld and both Tates first tho.
"Written November 28, 2011",Leonardo Da Vinci exhibition,"I was very much looking forward to visiting, had ordered the timed ticket and audio guide well in advance. Well I was wondering why there is timed entrance - the rooms of the exhibition were so full that people kept bumping into eachother, one couldn't admire the small preparatory and other delicate designs because of the amount of people.Also the exhibition is on 2 floors, one in the basement - the other at +2 which doesn't make it very convenient. I was worried seeing some elderly people trying to get to the basemunt getting down the stairs with walking sticks - the attendents should point to the available elevators.But then the paintings make up for all of this, and the audio guide is a definite plus.Oh and do leave your coat at the free deposit - it is really warm in there, I even saw some people with fans !"
"Written February 12, 2014",National Gallery - One of the top art museums in the world,"The National Gallery at Trafalgar Square is one of several outstanding art museums in London.  It houses a wide range of fine art, spanning the 13th - early 20th century, representing a 'who's who' list of Western Europe painters and artists from these periods.  The National Gallery was founded when the House of Commons who decided to procure 38 paintings and begin a national collection in 1824.  This small collection has now expanded to over 2300 paintings and is visited by over 5 million people annually, making the National Gallery the 5th most visited art museum in the world. Before you visit, it is helpful to have a look at the National Gallery Website or at least a good London guidebook so that you can have a feel for the floor plan.  If you want to visit the entire collection, we would suggest 3-4 hours, allocating approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour to each section (1. – 13th to 15th century – Medieval Early Renaissance, 2.) 16th century – High Renaissance, 3.) 17th century and 4.) 18th to 20th century.) Each of the major sections includes 15-20 separate rooms with numerous outstanding paintings.  For us, it is difficult to envisage visits to the Gallery without seeing the entire collection at the National Gallery.  However, for those with limited time, you might want to visit the National Gallery Website – Plan Your Visit section to see the Printed Trails and 30 Highlight Paintings webpages. These might help you target a specific group of paintings or plan for a shorter visit.  Regardless of how long you intend to spend at the gallery, it is highly recommendable to pick up the The foldable, red-coloured National Gallery Plan (£1).  This provides a simple floor plan with four major sections along with a few of the highlight pieces for each section. On the back is a list of the individual rooms as well as its featured artist(s) or art period/ movement.  The Plan is also quite useful for helping you navigate your way around the Gallery.  In addition to the impressive permanent collection, there are special exhibitions (usually require tickets), which take place throughout the year at the National Gallery.  Refer to the Gallery website to find information about the exhibitions and to book tickets online.  You can also purchase tickets directly at the National Gallery as well.  There are several food and drink options within the National Gallery if required.  These include the National Café, which offers a nice range of afternoon snacks, coffee and tea drinks.  You can also find the Espresso Bar on the Ground Floor and more formal dining at The National Dining Rooms on the First Floor.  The main shop is located on the Ground Floor and you can visit just before leaving the museum if you want to pick up a museum book or souvenir.  They have some nice books which include a vast majority of the works you will have seen within the National Gallery.   Overall, we highly rate the National Gallery in London and appreciate the comprehensive coverage of important Western European art movements which can be explored here.  We eagerly anticipate spending time at the Gallery when visiting London and consider it one of our personal favourite attractions in the city."

"Written December 13, 2013",Magnificent. Don't miss!,"The National Gallery like so many museums in London is free. What a treat. The building is located on Trafalgar Square, which is sort of a must stop and see spot with Lord Nelson statue towering over the plaza. The building of the gallery itself is worth a visit. Some of the treasures we found inside included Monet's famous bridge and water lilies, Van Gogh's chair and sunflowers. There were paintings from Renoir, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Van Dyck, and many more. Our favorite one was actually from a Finish painter we had never heard about. There are many treasures in this gallery. I highly recommend it. We visited on a Wednesday afternoon. The visitors in the gallery were quiet and respectful, and although there were a good number of visitors it was by no means crowded. Very enjoyable."
"Written December 5, 2013",I was reminded I have a soul,"I stopped in here for 15 minutes.    4 hours later I was still here.    It is the strangest thing staring at a paintings you have seen images of on posters and mugs and learned about at school - here it is - right in front of your face!     How can a painting be 500+ years old?   It makes you think of how short life actually is when you consider how many generations before stood and looked at these things, and people will still be stood looking at them in the generations to come.............  (so long as they are not wrecked by morons trying to sneakily take photographs that is!!)   Go to the shop if you want a reminder.  Buy a print and contibute to the purchase of the next great work that comes up for sale."
"Written August 4, 2013",Terrific,Great place to spend a couple of hours.  Even the kids loved this place ( and no we are not the art expert snobs).  Go with a list of top 25 things to see.  It is freetoo!
"Written July 29, 2013",Great if you like classical art,"I prefer modern art, so I'm not crazy about this museum, but it is a beautiful building, has magnificent collections, is free and it's all that busy.Would definitely recommend!"
"Written July 22, 2013",Disappointing,I had great expectations but there were very few interesting paintings . Too bad the audio guid was good ....
"Written July 8, 2013","Overwhelming, but fantastic","Like the Louvre, the National Gallery contains so much amazing art, one can spend entire weeks there. We chose to select the pieces we wanted to see, and will go more in-depth next time. Great audioguides, but the maps are hard to decipher, so if you want to really know where to go to see a piece instead of wandering, ask the helpful guides who are posted in most every room. Work by Caravaggio, Leonardo, Michelangelo... all the greats. A must-see for the art lover."
"Written January 6, 2013",Knowledgeable guides,Took several guided tours of the highlights of the museum of which there are many... no repeats and clearly interpreted... a wonderful art treasure.
"Written January 4, 2013",A must!,"The national Gallery is huge, we went in to take a look as we'd never been and ended up spending around 4-5 hours totally immersed in art. It has a huge range across the ages and styles and a vast collection. I skipped a large section on the museum and walked fast through many rooms, it has something for almost every taste.The audio guides are essential, without them understanding the paintings is impossible unless you're a art historian or expert. I came out feeling truly educated. The cafe is good, although as is to be expected the food cost quite a bit.Considering entrance is free (although you pay for the audio guide) this is excellent value for money and so well worth the visit. Even for an hour or so you can see so much."
"Written December 19, 2012","For Impressionists, go up main stairs and turn right into galleries","On previous visits, I walked straight up the stairs into the main gallery that everyone seems to head into. My suggestion is that you turn right on the top of the stairs into the galleries there, which takes you to the Impressionists. There are also few crowds here as most go up the main gallery before making their way around the wings to the Impressionists. Basically, you are going backwards against the flow of the crowd.  As you wind your way around, you will go back earlier in time and also cover the British artists like Turner, and Constable.Donation to the museum is £4, if you choose. Maps are £1 pound. Audio guides around £3.50.  If you have the time, break up your visit to the National Gallery in bite sized chunks. I have done mine in 2 hour windows - just enough to be totally inspired, leaving me wanting to come back for more, without becoming overwhelmed at the end of a long day. If you have kids, it's useful to do this too, as their attention span is even shorter."
"Written November 20, 2012",Wonderful works of art and a nice experience,"The National Gallery houses many famous paintings. It's easily accessible and admission is free. The cafes are very nice and relaxing. The paintings are displayed very nicely and this is a must-see attraction in London. The variety of artists is fantastic. There is limited seating in the galleries, so plan a snack in the cafes to get some rest while you tour the galleries."
"Written November 14, 2012",SEDUCED BY ART - Photography past and present,"LOCATION: National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, London (31 October 2012 – 20 January 2013)VISIT DATE: 10 November 2012Adult ticket: £12A superb arrangement of flowers are pictured exploding; petals flying through the air like shards of multi coloured glass.  It is a light jet print, mounted on aluminium called “Blow-Up: Untitled 5” (2007) by Ori Gersht.  It is hung to the right of the painting which inspired it, a still life entitled “The Rosy Wealth of June” (1886) by Ignace-Henri-Theodore Fantin-Latour; a painting in which flowers beautifully spill from a vase in oil on canvas.  Though both are hung towards the end of this exhibition, their comparison sums up what the event is about; the telling of a story of how paintings have influenced photography both at its outset and with more recent contemporary photographers.If you leave the exhibition cinema to the end, it’s story begins with the Romanticism movement oil painting “Death of Sardanapalus” (1827) by Delacroix.  Modern contemporary photography which the painting has inspired follows on which includes work by Jeff Wall, Tom Hunter and Sarah Jones.Wall’s “Destroyed Room” - a huge Cibachrome transparency in a light-box - is, at first look, a well lit studio tableaux of quite literally a destroyed room, but take one glance to your left at the Delacroix and it hits you with a kind of “ah I get it,” factor when your mind registers that they are cleverly the same.  Same in layout, colouring and style, but wholly different with the Wall image being very unromantic with no people in it.I’ve studied the work of Tom Hunter before, having been to his exhibition at Warwick Arts Centre in 2011.  He is a contemporary photographic artist who recreates the work of historical artists (including Pre-Raphaelite painters, Romanticists and playwrights) in photographs based in the modern settings in and around his adoptive home of Hackney.  His 2009 C type print, “Death of Coltelli” is a reconstruction of one of the central figures from the Delacroix painting, leaning over a bed in true Hunter style in an East London bedroom.  It is difficult to comprehend that this image was shot using film and not via digital recording techniques when you examine the amazing tonal range in this image, which sweep from the pinky whites of the woman’s skin to the darkness of the edges of nearby furniture.The exhibition moves on from room to room of the basement section of the National Gallery’s  Sainsbury Wing, covering portraiture, the human figure, tableaux, still life, landscapes and three short films.  Though I doubt he thought of it at the time, Martin Parr’s “Signs of the Times” (1991) is delightfully compared alongside Gainsborough’s “Mr and Mrs Andrews”.  Both are essentially new couples in their new homes and it is pointed out that Parr has delayed taking his photograph until they have become self conscious, thus deliberately creating rigid postures, showing discomfort.In the portrait section a loose attempt is seemed to be made to link a whole plethora of photographic portraiture to the painting of Anthony van Dyck.  Amongst some other splendid works a compare is made between a photograph called “Calliope” (1989) by Maud Sulter and the much more famous portrait of Sarah Bernhardt by the great Paris portrait photographer Nadar (only a small reference picture of the Nadar work is shown).  A clear influence can be seen here, but, of course, both works are photographs.Comparison of the human figure in painting and photography would not be complete without one of Rineke Dijkstra’s beach photographs and the obvious influence of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus”. The Dijkstra image shown is a C-type print “Kolobrzeg, Poland, July 26 1992”.  Even the National Gallery could not, however, get hold of the Botticelli and a small reference picture is shown.This exhibition positively spoils the viewer with other works by the likes of Oscar Rejlander, Roger Fenton, Gustav Le Gray, Edweard Muybridge, Karen Knorr, Richard Learoyd, Thomas Struth, Richard Billingham, Nan Goldin, Coventry’s John Blakemore (Coventry being my home city) and others.In the cinema area, I particularly enjoyed “Big Bang 2” which is another work by Gersht.  We see what appears to be a painting very similar to the oil painting “Hollyhocks and Other Flowers in a Vase” by Jan van Huysum.  The image at first appears two dimensional until it suddenly explodes!I also enjoyed the film entitled “An Ode to Hill and Adamson” (Masie Broadhead and Jack Cole 2012) where in a three minute movie, a set is built in which a living portrait is created within a frame with a woman posing in the style of a nineteenth century photograph by Hill and Adamson.Although I (unlike some critics), with open arms, welcome the National Gallery finally accepting photography on to its walls, the story this exhibition tells is, however, from a narrow viewpoint. Firstly I didn’t see a single mention or acceptance of photography being art (though the wonderful accompanying book that I purchased absolutely does), merely referring to (in the tableaux section) it as a ‘mechanical medium’. And, whist the walls show off the works of Pictorialist movement photographers such as Julia Margaret Cameron there seems to be no mention of the actual word “Pictorialism” or any criticism of the late nineteenth century movement that in fact held the development of art photography back, by keeping it associated totally with painting techniques.Modernism, Surrealism, and work from outside the edges of Europe barely get a mention; probably because they all contain some great examples which have truly developed photography as an independent art medium. There is a little Americana, but only enough to support the story being told. Also missing are examples where photography has indeed influenced painting.It would have been nice to see something like “Bal Au Moulin de la Galette” (1876) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir - a good example of a painting influenced by photography, where brushstrokes depict movement and elements around the edge of the picture only partly appear in the frame.The exhibition’s story aside, and forgetting the Luddites who still might fail to recognise photography as an art medium, this is a chance to see some amazing photographic art; my favourite being the image I began with - Gersht’s “Blow-Up: Untitled5”.  The flowers were frozen with liquid nitrogen and arranged with hidden explosive charges; the explosion captured using a high speed digital camera.  The picture’s semiotic content includes the powerful showing of red, white and blue petals, the colours of the French flag, the native country of the inspiring Latour, plus the explosion itself, Gersht’s outpouring of his feelings on terrorism and war from experiences in his native Israel.At the end of the day though, in life, everything we see influences everything that we do; whether that be consciously or subconsciously.  Art is no different, whatever the medium.  Any kind of artistic image(s) whether it be two dimensional, three dimensional, still or moving can influence another.  Welcome to the 21st century National Gallery and please don’t listen too much to those dinosaur critics, such as Brian Sewell, who have slammed you for putting on this show."
"Written November 3, 2012",Unbelievable artifacts,You will see things in London museums that you will not see anywhere else in the world.  There are over 120 museums!
"Written November 1, 2012",Great for art lovers,"I think this is one of the best art galleries in the world and I really appreciated the fact that they don't charge any entrance fee. I come from Russia and there are almost no museums or galleries that are free to visit. Moreover, they charge foreigners more than Russian citizens. That is why I think everyone should make a donation upon leaving the National Gallery and contribute as much money as one can give and wants to give. I liked everything about visiting the gallery - its location, the selection of paitnings (it was such a pleasure to see so many of my favourites!), the cozy smell of coffee and the shop. As one of the reviewers mentioned here, the map is very well laid out and I cannot agree more! Navigation there is very easy and it makes it possible to wander less and see what you really want to see more."
"Written September 30, 2012",Van Gogh's Sunflowers,"National Gallery holds one of Van Gogh's Sunflowers, apart from other masterpieces from Vermeer, Monet, Caravaggio... The collection is well-organized in aprox. 60 rooms."
"Written August 29, 2012",Fantastic,If you are in London you have to visit the National Gallery.  I usually spend about two hours there but for someone really interested in the arts they could spend days there.  If you can take one of the free tours that take you to four or five paintings and explain them in depth.
"Written August 16, 2012",A Day well Spent,The best of London is featured here. Take a few minutes to experience the best of the arts.  It will surpass your expectations.
"Written May 5, 2011",definitely save time to visit,"Don't try and do everyhting at one go if you visit this museum.  I visited late in the day after a full day of sightseeing, and was exhausted after a short visit.  You will see many famous works of art here by the masters.  If I were to do it again soon, then I'd go with a morning visit for a couple of hours and then come back another day later in the trip.  This is a must see destination in London.  (Plus it is free admission.)"
"Written March 8, 2011",Great gallery with some phenomenal pieces!,"Out of all the art museums I visited in London this one was by far my favorite.  They had some great pieces by artist I adore; including Klimt, Matisse, Titian, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and the list goes on. This is definitely worth a visit and the audio tour guide is well worth the GPB 3.50.  Go, go, go!!!"
"Written January 3, 2011",A comprehensive collection of West European art,"The National Gallery is my favorite museum in London. The entrance is free (although donations are encouraged), and the Gallery is in the heart of things, right in Trafalgar Square, so you can drop in for an hour to see one or two of your favorite artworks any time you pass the city centre. If you are new to the exhibition, do get a plan – it helps you find the highlights without wasting your time wandering around the whole building.The displays are well arranged, and there are plenty of seats in all the rooms - if you get “museum feet”, you can just take a rest in front of a painting you like and spend a few minutes (or longer) enjoying it. The Gallery definitely has one of the world’s most comprehensive collections of West European art, including some world famous masterpieces such as Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers”, Monet’s “Waterlilies”, Seurat’s “Bathers at Asnieres”, Velazques’s “Toilet of Venus”, and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Virgin of the rocks”. Even if you are an art lover and can do without guided tours, try joining a free 30-minute “lunchtime talk” on art (held at 1:00 p.m. every day except Sunday). A gallery expert will take you to see just a few paintings of their choice (different every time) and tell you the most fascinating things about them.The gallery cafe (with a good selection of cakes) is a nice place to have a cup of tea. The gift shop has a big choice of souvenirs such as calendars, diaries, pens etc. with the designs of the famous paintings, and lots of books on art.Not surprisingly, the gallery gets lots of visitors, but Friday night (it works until 9:00 p.m. on Fridays) seems to be much quieter than most other days, so come then if you are not too fond of enjoying art with a crowd of other people. If you use the tube, Charing Cross is the nearest station."
"Written February 2, 2010",National Gallery Dining Room,"After years of visiting London I only just discovered the National Gallery.  Always ended up at the V & A or the Tate.  I love it and the last three times I have been I have not missed it.  I also discovered the restaurant at the top and I swear it is a hidden gem that most people will never see.  Great service, great food and fantastic view at sunset."
"Written November 24, 2009",Fantastic and free,"amazing that this must art is viewable for free, in London this is a must visit"
"Written October 16, 2009",A pilgrimage for art lovers,"I count myself an art lover, and I've been looking forward to visiting the National Gallery for years. I surprised myself by packing so much into my London trip that I had only an hour left to do the NG on our last night. I knew, however, that it is open late on Fridays, and having taken advantage of evening museum hours at the Louvre, I expected to be able to move quickly (due to far fewer visitors) and have the works to myself. I was right. By touring the gallery from 7:30-8:30 on a Friday night, I was able to see the museum's list of 15 highlight paintings without difficulty and without anyone in my line of viewing. I just love the experience of standing squarely in front of a DaVinci or Holbein and taking as much time as I want with it. With that said, don't squeeze the NG into an hour if you don't have to! There are tons of fantastic paintings here, and the museum deserves several hours. If you do visit at night, you can look forward to live music in the corridors, which is a beautiful touch to an already heavenly experience. The building itself is also worthy of admiration. The rooms are well-arranged, not overcrowded, and very clearly numbered so that navigation through the galleries is a breeze. I look forward to returning many times and devoting the time that this world-class collection deserves."
"Written September 13, 2009","Priceless artwork at no cost, what more could we ask for?","Definitely visit the National Gallery if you are in London, even if you only choose to see the big name artists such as Van Gogh, Rapheal, DaVinci, Michelangelo, and Monet. They are all there, and if you pick up the quick tour pamphlet at the visitor's desk you can find them easier with a detailed map of the highlights; otherwise the many interconnected galleries can be daunting.I visited in the afternoon on a weekday and despite being a free attraction the place was not that crowded except around Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Everything else was quiet and peaceful, and it may have been my imagination but I believe the gallery is air conditioned because it seemed quite cool compared to the heat outside. I spent two hours there and could have easily spent more as an art buff, but felt I was able to see the big names and then some.My favorite unknown find was a lithograph series about marriage in which the artist painted a series of almost comedic painting depicting the tragic outcomes of a marriage made for ambition instead of love, including adultery, disease, and ultimately death--it was ironic and almost reminded me of a political cartoon series. If you go, spend a few minutes admiring the fountains in Trafalgar Square and St. Martin's in the Fields."
"Written July 2, 2009",National Gallery Review,"The National Gallery is pretty decent. Its free (thought they ask for a donation), as are the audiotours. I wouldn't say it is worth a whole lot of time. Maybe I'm spoiled from having been to some of the famous art museums in France and Italy, but there are a lot of other places in London that I would rather visit. If you have a lot of time its worth a look. And if you know of a couple paintings you really want to see, you can just go and find them, then leave. I've posted some photos and tips from my time in London on my travel blog [--]Enjoy!"
"Written May 20, 2009",Nothing else like it,I am here all the time. It is one of my favorite places. There is no where like it in the world.
"Written April 15, 2009",Entirely wonderful!,"The National Gallery in London is one of my favourite museums/galleries - it is well worth a visit but bring time or rather, concentrate on only parts of the collection (maybe also catch a temporary exhibition in the Sainsbury Wing, I saw ""Americans in Paris"" in 2006 and it was well worth the return one evening - though special exhibitions usually come with a charge - if a specific one is of interest to you), or else you might perhaps get a little overwhelmed and tired. Admission is free so you may come again as often as you choose - my personal favourites are the paintings from 1700 onwards (Turner, Gainsborough, Constable in particular) on the 2nd level.Take a break in between at the National Café and have a look into one of the well stocked shops, too."
"Written January 20, 2012",The Leonardo Exhibition,"Brilliant, a very rare chance to see most of Leonardo's work in one place. Too many visitors were allowed to view. I booked tickets, which is essential if you don't want to line up from 6.00am. "
"Written January 19, 2012",National Gallery - do it!!,We passed away a couple of hours in here whilst waiting for dinner time!  Very informative and amazing to see all those fabulous paintings!
"Written January 19, 2012",awesome,"Went with my 'arty' 10 year old, all i can say is amazing and a privilige to be able to see such works of art."
"Written January 19, 2012",Makes me proud to be British!,"I had forgotten how wonderful the National Gallery is. It must be one of the most fantastic of its kind in the world. The immense wealth of wonderful art takes one's breath away. Every corner turned, presents a stunner that you can't believe is hanging there 'in the flesh'! We went primarily to queue for the Leonardo Exhibition, and luckily we got in. So many had travelled, and didn't. I'm on the mailing list now, so I can be prepared for the next time."

Lots of great stuff.,"Good all-in-one gallery in London for all you art freaks out there.Recommend you do this if you only have one night in London.Can find works from all kinds of artists, including some famous works that are seemingly on permanent exhibition."
"Written January 14, 2012",how not to manage an exhibition,"We were fortunate enough to get tickets for the Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan exhibition. The trouble was that the National Gallery had packed too many people in at once, it was very hot and over-crowded. To get a good view of the paintings (which were glorious) was very difficult. People sat around on the benches fanning themselves with the programmes to try to cool off and overheated children cried. I'm sure the rest of the National Gallery must be well worth a visit, but this review focuses on the way that this exhibition was managed. Surely the NG could have planned the traffic flow and numbers better so that everyone could have an enjoyable time and a clearer view of the spectacular paintings. I hope they will manage future exhibitions better."
"Written September 11, 2011",National Gallery...a treasure in plain London's heart,"The building is amazing, the location couldn't be better and the art pieces inside are overwhelming: from Da Vinci to Boticelli, from Vermeer to Holbein, Goya, Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin...Give National Gallery one day, try next the National Portrait Gallery next to the building.Great great way to lift your soul!"
"Written September 11, 2011","Beautiful artwork, not great for everyone though ...","Although i really enjoyed my trip to the gallery, sadly my kids did not. This place is not for children, all other children i saw there were just running around, they had no interest in it what so ever, so not for kids."
"Written September 3, 2011",Spend the day and get blissfully lost!,No matter how many times I visit the National Gallery I always find an area I hadn't explored before. I could absolutely spend the whole day walking around here. Plus it's free admission how can you beat that? This is a must see for anyone traveling to London.
"Written August 25, 2011",Make a game of it,I knew that a visit to the National gallery with three children would likely be a disaster. So we did a bit of research before our trip a prepared a game for the kids.I pre-ordered a sticker book of National Gallery paintings online from Amazon (The Usborne Art Sticker Book) Then we made a game of searching for the paintings and then attaching the stickers in the book.  We managed to survive two hours before the kids got tired.
"Written August 25, 2011","Always great, a little disruption with renovations","Usually I  give the National Gallery a 5 star, which of course the works are.  Just now allow a little extra time as many works have been moved around due to renovations prior to the Olympics.  Staff are super helpful directing you to your favourite works.Why not donate a few pounds to keep it free :)"
"Written August 24, 2011",Always my first stop in London,"Having been to the National Gallery before, I decided to do the 'must see' pictures such as the Sunflowers by Vincent Van Godh, The Haywain by Contstable etc and my favourite painting by Jan Van Eyck - The Arnolfini Portrait.  Whats amazing about the gallery is that it is free so you can call in several times to see the paintings you wish to see as it is so tiring to see so many paintings in one day.  Had a wonderful visit and thoroughly enjoyed these famous paintings.  Every time I come, I get something more from the paintings which i see.  It is located in Trafalgar Aware and the station to get off at is Charring Cross."
"Written August 22, 2011","Great collection, not overwhelming",The museum is not to be missed.  It is centrally located so it is easy to pop  in.  And it is not so large as to be overwhelming.
"Written August 21, 2011",One of the best Galleries in the UK,"I had a few hours to kill in Central London and walked in after a few years on visiting the Gallery. Hours and sometimes almost a whole day can be spent at this Gallery, almost like time travelling through centuries of Paintings and Cultures.Highly recommended!!"
"Written August 4, 2011","Love the gallery, not the cafe!","As ever the National Gallery is a treasure. How wonderful to be so close to the work of many great artists. Long may the Arts in London be free! However, after alot of walking and standing that much needed coffee or tea was a definite must. What a disappointment the gallery cafe turned out to be. I can just about accept the overpriced cakes, sandwiches and pies but not coffee in a paper cup and certainly not the dirty tables, overflowing bins and general state of disorder. So please, cafe management, give it a good clean, make sure you have enough staff to keep your cafe in a pleasant and presentable state. You are letting down the National!"
"Written July 2, 2011",Magnificent,Incredible works of great beauty. Almost too much to take in. I walked from one masterpiece to the next with my mouth agape. Trafalgar Square area is filled with performers and speakers - lively and interesting.
"Written October 13, 2011","Lovely, lots of really well known pictures on display.","We really enjoyed the NG (not to be confused with the National Portrait Gallery next door)I did my research on the internet before we went to find out where the more famous pictures were located, so that if it was very crowded we would know where we needed to be. However it was very quiet, only about 6 - 12 people in each room, so it was really easy to see every painting - so much so, that we actually ended up seeing the whole gallery.We are a couple who enjoy looking at beautiful paintings, but are not very knowledgeable about them, so this gallery was perfect. And best of all  . . . it's FREE!"
"Written October 8, 2011",Outstanding Collection of European Paintings,"This is the most outstanding collection of European paintings in the world.  Admission is free and the labels explain the paintings well.  The collection was amassed primarily by non-royals and donated to the people. There is an excellent map available for one pound. If your time is limited, go to the paintings that illustrate the map. The docent tour we went on was excellent: a thorough explnation of a half dozen paintings in the space of an hour. The gallery has an excellent website. If you visit on a Sunday, try the English roast beef lunch with all the trimmings--the gastronomic highlight of a recent trip to London and Paris."
"Written September 27, 2011",The beauty of the world under one roof,"It is a wonderful experience to enter this magnificent building which houses sucn national treasures. Spend a few hours here and refresh your soul with the wonders of fine art and sculpure from the old masters to the modern day artists. For the inner man, however, pop next door to the National Portrait Gallery. The food in their upstairs restaurant is superb and the views across London are stunning."

I'm not a bug museum or art gallery person but I found myself wandering in here for hours. There is so much to do and look at it could be a full day experience for the hard core art lover. For me two hours was enough. If you are worried about taking a non-artsy person here don't worry about it. They will enjoy it too at least for a few hours.

"Written November 27, 2011",A London Jewel,The National Gallery is truly a London jewel. Do not rush through this cultural and historical landmark. Take your time to enjoy the treasures that lie within. Perhaps you might hear the voices of the past that teach you something about the present.
"Written October 27, 2011","take your time, and the audio guide","Wonderful collection, and a real indulgence this time around. I spent a very enjoyable 4 hours in the galleries on this visit. the audio guide is fantastic value at £3, and is very helpful. I chose to start with the most recent works, and followed the rooms roughly backwards - skipping through the medieval religious art which isn't really to my taste.I looked at most of the work on the recommended 1 hour tour, but also used the audio guide to explore other paintings that caught my eye. It was a wet day, and the galleries were quite busy, but I was still able to get up close to the works, and the headphones blocked out most of the annoying chatter.I also had time for sandwich and cake in the cafe - very good quality - the British Musem caterers could learn a thing or two from here!!!Excellent all round. We are very lucky to have such a gem for free. Having paid very high entry fees to galleries in Rome, Paris and Amsterdam it makes me proud that in the UK everyone can have access to fine art."

The National Gallery showcased artists from Germany to Spain, Italy to Great Britain. I spent an hour there and only saw a third of what they had...and that was even with just glancing at several artworks and moving on. If you plan on seeing everything in detail, set aside one whole day."

"Written July 19, 2023",After Impressionism is an amazing exhibition,"The ""After Impressionism"" exhibit at the National Gallery is a treasure with works by Van Gogh, Seurat, Picasso, Matisse, Gaughin, Cezanne, Mondrian, and a bevy of lesser known artists who were all groping their way towards an entirely new medium. Seeing all of the various threads of modernism emerge out of the Impressionist revolution was glorious."

I discovered trivia and information from worldwide phenomenons that k never dreamed about. Definitely worth the ticket. Cheers to Michael, my awesome tour guide"
"Written February 15, 2023",Rude and hostile security staff made us feel uncomfortable,"Rude and shouty security on entrance - no need. Queued for ages , one man in charge of getting you to move through the scanner shouting at you to “Zip bag zip bag LADY” - he meant unzip. Bellowed at to “ MOVE MOVE” out of the way . The reason I didn’t immediately move is you were confiscating my daughter’s print she had bought at the Imperial War Museum as you aren’t allowed to take art in. ( who knew ?)  That’s ok - but she is autistic and you shouting at her and me to leave her side and get out of the way because I was apparently blocking your view was unhelpful and unnecessary . Just such a stressful start.  You are security not the FBI."

"Written December 7, 2022","3pm - free tour - don’t miss it - though such is the quality, you will want to make a donation!","Wandered into the National Gallery this morning and noticed that there were free tours at 3 pm – so decided to come back then. Such a good decision! Carlo’s tour was possibly the best tour I’ve had of anything anywhere: full of detail about ‘the story’ being told by the painter, the way artists contrive to draw viewers into their works and encourage reading of them, snippets of art history and painterly technique. As well as gaining fascinating insights into the individual paintings picked by Carlo for the tour (apparently different paintings are selected for different tours), participants will have left, equipped with lots of transferable skills for enjoying future visits to galleries and exhibitions.All this with energy, drama, wit and warmth and humble kindness. National Gallery, if you have an “employee of the month” award – this is your man!"
"Written November 27, 2022",Excellent collection of paintings,"Cant believe this experience is free in the UK. Saw loads of kids being brought to the gallery for a field trip. There are cloak rooms on every level to leave your bags and jackets. You need more than a day to do justice to this gallery.  The restaurant directions need to be improved. You can reach it from Level 2 but the directions are extremely confusing. Beware of cheats masquerading as police offers in Trafalgar square waiting to take the unsuspecting tourists for a ride. We were accosted by a girl outside Canada house who asked us to take a photo. This was at 6.00 pm and it was dark. We were tired and hunting for the entry to the Charing Cross subway. After we finished the photo, she struck up a conversation asking us where we were from.  Suddenly 2 men, pretending to be police, asked us if the woman was bothering us and asked to see our papers. Thankfully I had my wits around me and asked to see identification. One of the men pulled down this jacket zipper and showed us a ID which had his photo but said ""Student..."" and the other showed us some kind of badge. We asked to see the ID again and they disappeared in the blink of an eye. "
"Written March 14, 2008",My favourite museum,"The National Gallery happens to be my favourite museum. It's a wonderful place to visit on a trip to London. However I must say, you probably won't get through all of it in one afternoon as the place is quite overwhelming. It's hard to decide which room to go to next. I am delighted to say that it will keep the visitor happy. And if you need a break there's a nice cafe downstairs. The museum also has several gift shops."

I can fully understand why you need people to book tickets even thought it’s free to get in especially during covid times, however do you really need your visitors to create an account to do so? Why is is necessary to collect so much personal data so enter? Anyway in summary a beautiful venue and spectacular art but entry process and customer service levels really needs some work."

"Written July 7, 2020",NEVER BUY NATION GALLERY MEMBERSHIP EVEN IF IT IS £1,"Wow, what shall I tell you: NEVER BUY ANY MEMBERSHIP FOR NATIONAL GALLERY! Why? Because I've purchased my membership at the end of January 2020. I have seen 2 very crowded exhibitions (paying entrances were over £20) even though I have booked my time? Restaurants even with the membership discount are sooooo overpriced! Then the COVID-19 happened in March 2020 and I have not been able to benefit from paying for my membership. I have emailed about 4 emails to them asking them if they could extend my membership for free for 3 months? They were delaying their answer and cheekily someone phoned me recently before they just opened, asking me if I would be happy next year when I renew my membership to have 3 months added? I said NO AS I AM ASKING IF MY CURRENT MEMBERSHIP COULD BE EXTENDED BY 3 MONTHS...So for that reason I will never ever renew my membership with NATIONAL GALLERY..probably it is not worth it to pay over £70 as they have no more than 3 good art exhibitions per year anyway and the rest is free to see inside the gallery.."
"Written July 6, 2020",Unique in the world at so many levels,I have been so many times and also a member for years. It is a home to everyone. It is such a welcoming gallery and you can enjoy all sorts of styles and still love the architecture of the building. A must-see.

"Written August 8, 2020",Rediscovering a treasure house ,"Returning to the National Gallery after lockdown is a microcosm of London itself: a cornucopia of cultural riches which is so easily taken for granted. It also helps that the more limited visitor numbers enable one to view comfortably each artistic masterpiece from the Italian Renaissance to French Impressionism and beyond without waiting for an opening in a crowd. Being forced to follow specific routes also allows focussing upon particular periods or artists rather than a random wander through the collection as a whole. Starting with the special exhibition of seven Titians mainly based on tales from Ovid’s Metamorphoses (Actaeon for spying the naked Diana turned into a stag; Jupiter turning himself into a white bull in order to seduce a nymph), I then moved into a room featuring other Titians and world by Veronese; then Canaletto, Hogarth and Gainsborough; perhaps the most famous paintings by Turner and Constable (The Fighting Temeraire and The Hay Wain respectively); then three rooms of French Impressionists, Gauguin and Seurat. And downstairs four rooms of a special exhibition of works by Nicolas Maes, a pupil of Rembrandt. And I almost forgot the rooms of Rembrandts and Van Dycks I had passed through earlier.   "
"Written July 29, 2020",Opportune Time to visit one of the best National Galleries where service is with a smile!,"With many Lockdown measures now having been lifted, now is an excellent time to visit London’s leading attractions and earlier today my wife and myself visited the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square.We had booked in advance on line and although there is no charge I would encourage all visitors to make a donation (we opted for £10 each and this represented good value for money).  All E-ticket holders are requested to assemble in Salisbury Street 15 minutes before their designated time slot and - with this in mind - there is nothing to be gained arriving any earlier as the queue control works well and visitors are called forward on schedule.After going through security, visitors need to go up 2 sets of stairs (there are tolets halfway up) and then should opt for a combination of the 3 routes (A, B & C) - all of which have an outstanding selection of paintings and take 30 mins approx to complete. Whichever combination is chosen, however, please do make a point of visiting the recently refurbished Room 32 as this is not to be missed!All in all, a most enjoyable visit - one enhanced by the excellent service provided by all the staff we met - and, hopefully, the Restaurant will be back in operation the next time we visit."
"Written July 26, 2020",Titian exhibition - awfully organised,"Just visited Titian exhibition - amazing paintings albeit very few of them -but the organisation is appalling which ruins the whole experience - clear example of a case when stricter rules just make it worse not safer nor more efficient. Tickets checked 3 times, everyone wears masks but the automatic door doesn’t work - so everyone touches the same handle, for some reason after presenting the tickets I was given a tiny piece of paper that I needed to handle to someone throughout the visit, no audio guide (and no app to download info) so people still crowd next to each other to read info next to each painting (so much for social distancing). To contrast - two weeks ago I was in Uffizi gallery - and that was really well organised and very safe."
"Written July 25, 2020",Go back again and again,"How lucky are we that our galleries are free? Impossible to do in a day, or even a week, but lovely to pop in regularly. Often there’s a short talk on a particular painting at lunchtimes. "

However we did visit after 2pm and found there was no soap or hand cleanser available in the toilets,  with the threat of a contagious virus and signs warning us, found the lack of basics not acceptable, and especially as the gallery was down on footfall so less people using the services."

Wasn't as busy as i was expecting but think the weather played a part in that, so was nice to be able to wander round without too many crowds. Was very impressed by the young gentleman member of staff who pointed us in the direction of Da Vinci's 'Virgin of the Rocks' as we wandered into one of the rooms, i wasnt even aware there was a Da Vinci in the gallery so i really appreciated being informed about it! The only thing that let our day down was when we asked a young lady on the membership desk if there was an area where we could eat our lunch we had brought with us, my partner was meat with a shrug of the shoulders and ""Not Really"" as answer!

"Written January 10, 2020",Perfect to visit.,Perfect day to visit and we watched a video before we went and know a little history so it was very interesting for us.
"Written January 8, 2020",Gaugin room,Amazing Gallery of wonderful paintings. I Would have planned my trip and focused on Gaugin and the dutch paintings.
"Written January 7, 2020",Terrible staff,The staff is rude! I went with my parents and my mom was not aware that the staff who entered the lift first had press the floor button that we are going to so she tries to press the button again. The staff just push her hand away harshly and said don't touch!
"Written January 7, 2020",OKAY,Given that the place was rammed and the booking system was not working there people managed to feed us well enough
"Written January 7, 2020",Definitely a Must See.,"There are so many great artists and paintings to see.  Of course, Van Gogh, Monet, and not crowded so you can move around easily.  Love the gift shop!"
"Written January 7, 2020",Good choice of a visit.,"Very interesting , and relaxing after a day walking round London. You can spend quiet along time inside the gallery, as its quite large inside."
"Written January 6, 2020",Nelson's Column,An important part of History also a busy hub and I loved being where the people are.The fountains are beautiful and the museum is FREE !
"Written January 6, 2020",Great visit,"Great place to visit, free but a donation welcome, lots to see in beautiful old rooms with seating in some."
"Written December 30, 2019",You have to know what you want to see...,"I hadn't visited the National Gallery in some time, and now I remember why. The depth of the collection lies in Old Masters, the Raphael cartoons, and some rather arcane specialty interests. I thought there were more Turners and Constables than I found (I think I was thinking of the Tate). In the Christmas holidays, when I visited, many popular pictures (Turner's Fighting Temeraire, for example) were mobbed by school groups. The shops are excellent in their diversity and bright, lively displays. The cafe in the Sainsbury Wing seemed to me over-priced and under-enthusiastic: a not-quite-grilled panini and small Coke with a straw came to about £8... If you have particular pictures in mind, or are attending a special exhibit, you'll likely have a more productive visit..."
"Written December 30, 2019",One of my favourite London haunts.,"This is the perfect place for art lovers and the merely curious to wander for hours through room after room of historical art. Just beautiful, beautiful examples of the very best every epoch of art has to offer. And the restaurant does a great afternoon tea!"
"Written December 30, 2019",Great Gaugin exhibition,"Gallery lay out well done, narrative in each room was very informative. Excellent coverage of the different phases of this artist."
"Written December 30, 2019",Great gallery with free entry,"The National Gallery will not charge you but please donate, it's a great place containing a fantastic collection."
"Written December 29, 2019",Long long walk in gallery,"Located on trafalgar square, in historical building, offers paintings from various painters for free to watch, excluding special exhibitions"
"Written December 29, 2019",So much to see,This is definitely an amazing museum. We visited the Egyptian exhibition. It was incredible and we had just done an extensive tour of Egypt. Don’t expect to see everything g in one day
"Written December 29, 2019",A Cultural Highlight of any Visit to London,"The National Gallery in Trafalgar Square is a British Cultural institution with over 2300 paintings spanning the Renaissance to the late 1800s. The collection includes works by such masters as Peter Paul Rubens, Claude Monet, Rembrandt, Jan van Eyck, Johannes Vermeer, Sandro Botticelli, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, JMW Turner, El Greco, Titian, and of course the true masters of the Renaissance, Michelangelo and Leonardo DaVinci. You’ll need 3-4 hours to do the collection some justice, though crowding can often mean waiting a few minutes to see some of the highlights without obstruction. Definitely worth a visit.  An added benefit, through 26 January, is the Leonardo DaVinci special exhibit focused on a single painting - The Virgin of the Rocks. The exhibit tries to deconstruct the painting and explore DaVinci’s mindset as he created this masterpiece. My favorite part of the exhibit was the room where the actual painting hangs on the wall of an imagined chapel—giving the viewer a chance to see what the painting might have looked like in chapel as intended by the artist."
"Written December 29, 2019",A visit,National Gallery is a great place to visit we had Vouchers for all the museums and Gallery's plus the London Eye  also the Royal Albert Hall for a Concert  we are so pleased to do what we can as I WON With  the Daily EXSPRESS

"Written December 28, 2019",Visit to the Gauguin exhibition ,"Superb exhibition. I took advantage of booking a wheelchair. It was ready and labelled with my name. The exhibition was not crowded. There was a free booklet which explained every exhibit, peasier to use than a headset.One of the best lit exhibitions when viewed from a wheelchair (or as a child). A lot of thought has been put into this, and it makes all the difference to a disabled person. "
"Written December 14, 2019",An oasis of calm in Trafalgar Square,"A place to drop into or to go to one of the special exhibitions - we saw the immersive Leonardo which was amazing, a new way to see familiar work. It is a wonderful space to see some incredible art, also a good cafe"
"Written December 13, 2019",Kind of dull tbh,I found  it  quite dull  as not all the  art appealed  to  me yes it had masterpieces but art is subjective  also the cafe is too dear 
"Written December 12, 2019",If you love art you must visit,This gallery has a superb collection that includes every famous painter you can think of. Allow yourself lots of time because you will want to see it all.
"Written December 12, 2019",Gauguin exhibition,Its good to buy your tickets on line if you can for the timed slot as you may be able to qualify for a discount. I went mid afternoon mid week and it was not busy ..great time to see  the paintings and few ceramics without the crowds that are sometimes there.The exhibiton is well curated and even in two languages which is unusual for mono linguistic England where most visitors are expected to read and speak English! Well done.There's a very good little booklet included for every work ( 55 of them) ..well done again. At the end take in the short 10 minute video which is interesting .Spoken in English with English subtitles.!!! Oh please why not French subtiltes!.

"Written December 11, 2019","National Galley, National Treasure !","Excellent way to spend the day out in London. I'm not keen on the charging to see certain exhibitions. i personally feel as though museums, so be free for all  British Residents, only tourists should pay as we do when we visit their Galleries etc, in their country."

"Written December 10, 2019",Near to the madding crowd,"An oasis (generally speaking) in the centre of London, where you can often find solace away from the mania outside and contemplate some of the greatest paintings to be found in this or any other city. Titian, Velasquez, Leonardo and Poussin are all to be found alongside any number of Dutch old masters including de Hooch, Vermeer and Rembrandt. Often beautifully lit with space enough to see them properly, this gallery is full of treasures that demand to be visited time and again."
"Written December 9, 2019",Wow,Simply one of the best art museums in the World and free. Great location and good layout so never feels too busy. A must in London even if an hour or two.
"Written December 9, 2019"," Near Covent Garden. If you like art, you mustn't miss this Gallery ","Located near Covent Garden, I first stopped by the National Portrait Gallery before going to the National Gallery. Spent less than 30mins in the former.The National Gallery had a good collection of art pieces. Place is huge. Spent about 3 hours inside before heading to Picadilly circus.

"Written December 4, 2019",Great visit,A must see. Everything here is a piece of history. Absolutely worth the visit. Lot of people in the week-end!
"Written December 2, 2019",Didn’t go outside but definitely worth a visit ,"Didn’t really manage to visit the art gallery inside due to timing constraints but looking outside of it,I’m pretty sure it’s a worth visit especially if you’re a fan of arts. For sure, you’ll enjoy it. Normally they would have some events happening outside the gallery like this time when we visited, Christmas theme. Down part of it is the Trafalgar Square.Closest stations are Charing Cross and Leicester SquareI had fun even just outside of this gallery and took many photos. So yes, worth a visit. "
"Written December 1, 2019",An Art Gallery can be cool!,Visited today in all honesty to waste some time whilst it rained and spent longer than I expected. The art is truly fascinating and it was so far removed from being pretentious! The most amazing thing is it’s totally free.
"Written December 1, 2019",Incredible!,"I went here on a Sunday afternoon during Christmas season and while the museum was busy, it wasn't overly crowded. I was delighted to find that admission is by donation. You could easily spend a day here - it is quite overwhelming and probably best to have an idea in mind of what you want to see beforehand. Some highlights include the galleries devoted to the Post-Impressionists, with greats from Seurat, van Gogh, and Cezanne on display. There is also a great section devoted to the Dutch masters, including iconic works by Rembrandt, Rubens, and others."
"Written December 1, 2019",Brilliant!,Fab place to spend some time. Staff are enthusiastic (even when first opening on a Sunday morning) and the bag check is done very efficiently and professionally. You can take a small cabin case in. The shop is well stocked with great books and original items. Really enjoy coming here.
"Written December 1, 2019",Making of a Masterpiece,"Visited the Leonardo da Vinci exhibition which gives an excellent insight into the evolution of one of his paintings.  It comprises four rooms, which examine the evolution from different perspectives.  It includes contributions from experts who analysed the painting scientifically; this is particularly enlightening."

"Written November 29, 2019",Easy to get lost here,"Lots of rooms crammed with amazing art from 1300 to 1900. I wasn't much interested in the first centuries (personal taste, every painting is related with religion, which quickly got on my nerves) but when the art is allowed to grow apart from bigotry, it gets very interesting. I loved the impressionists rooms."
"Written December 3, 2019",Quick lunch,busy when we visited last week. Food was tasty but portions not huge. Cakes looked delicious . Tables are very close together
"Written December 3, 2019",Interesting place,I don't usually go to a Gallery museum. But this one is probably the one to go if someone wants a nice first time experience in a gallery.

The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and helpful and are located throughout the gallery. The amazing part is that there is no fee for entry - but please donate on your way in!"
"Written December 2, 2019",A really good experience,"Always a good place to catch a good Exhibition of one of your favourite Artists.  Well set out, beautifully lit, usually not too crowded so you can get up close and personal with the paintings.  I was lucky enough to catch the Gaugain portrait exhibition this week and was delighted with it...  posters and prints were available as well a nice souvenir to take home.  There is a new cafe Bar  now in the Sainsbury’s Wing and was very good.  Good choice, nice prices, well worth staying for a lunch.There are of course many Rooms filled with wonderful Paintings but the special visiting Artists are always worth making a special trip to see them when they come round.  Lifts are around for different floors and usually someone to ask if you get lost, it’s a huge place."

"Written November 20, 2019",Must visit place for the art aficionados.,"My experiences of all museums & gallery in London has been top notch. It was first the National History Museum – exhibiting vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history; then I went to British Museum which has a myriad and exotic collection from 1000s of years of history. And third in the piece of this puzzle was National Gallery devoted to Paintings. And the best part of this experience was that all these were free in an otherwise very expensive city.Another wonderful aspect of all these were that the maintenance, exhibition and lighting of all artefact was top notch – the buildings were rather old but monumental and imposing with brilliant architecture. National Gallery with high carved ceilings and beautiful dome was no exception. While the collection of paintings for the uninitiated like me was not so obvious, there were kids and elders sitting in the halls and drawing sketches. Being from India, I carry all these experiences with me – hoping that we can emulate the art of creating and maintaining such wonderful museums. Must visit place for the art aficionados."
"Written November 20, 2019",Great experience,"Worth visiting - Absolutely love that entrance to these beautiful locations is still free, you do not experience this throughout the rest of Europe!"

"Written November 17, 2019",Great Impressionist exhibit!,"Needing a quick break from the London weather, I popped into the National Gallery.  The Impressionist Collection is great, which is where I spent most of my time.  Best of all, it's free!"

"Written November 17, 2019",Another wander in own solitude...,"I love visiting the art museums and just being able to wander and look and take it all in (except for the tour groups). We had a great time looking round and I was amazed at Sunglowers, never having seen it in real life before and only on prints.

We left our teens with family this day and my wife and I headed straight for the National Gallery. I was very impressed by the British painters but it truly is a world collection. My only complaint was that it was another very busy location, best to visit early on opening. Sadly we couldnt get into the tickets exhibitions which were sold out that day but plan on returning next year. Well worth a visit!!"

"Written November 24, 2019",Getting striaght into the Gauguin Portraits exhibition,Quite on spec` on Tuesday afternoon I popped into The National gallery and was delighted to discover that I could walk straight into the Gauguin exhibition. I had fully expected it to have been a sell out or else my having had to have a timed ticket. It`s an absolutely fantastic exhibition. Every exhibit was a winner. I`d never before seen his fabulous sculptures. 
"Written November 24, 2019",Fine Collection and Fine Experience,"We had a good visit - while admission is free, the special exhibits do cost admission. There are many galleries under construction, so the signage was inaccurate and we really needed to rely on the staff to direct us. After a full day, we enjoyed dusk and the Christmas Market in Trafalgar Square. "
"Written November 24, 2019",Overwhelmed by the beauty numbers and skill ,There is just so much to see that there is a risk of becoming blasé. The rooms are grouped by age and artist. I think I spent too much time in the religious 14th/15tg c areas leaving not enough time for van gough Picasso and Monet So much to see - amazing it is free - not so sure about the £20 price tag for the exhibitions of gaugin and leonardo
"Written November 24, 2019",Leonardo ,Wonderful exhibition well laid out. Interesting to study one painting in detail. Enjoyed it so much became a member. One point cloakroom needs more staff at busy times. Only one attendent is ridiculous. 
"Written November 23, 2019",Only visited for Gaughin,"Walking through the main building, I realised why I haven't been for years.  Definitely not to my taste with all those nymphs and dignitaries in endless rows and even more endless rooms.  However, I know many will consider me a philistone.I went to visit the Salisbury Wing and the Gaughin Portraits exhibition. I enjoyed it and appreciated it but there was something missing.  The curator seemed to suggest that Gaughin's amazing contribution and entry into modern art and away from Impressionism, was all about individual characterisation.  There was little about the forms and sweeping strokes he used to depict his characters.  Colour was very important and whilist this was talked about it seemed to be a bit overlooked.  I hope the RA exhibition next year addresses some of these aspects.As for the Exhibition Catalogue:  no wonder it's been reduced in price.  What a tome.  Full of all sorts of expounding to the detriment of the prints.  Such a pity."
"Written November 22, 2019",National Gallery,"Fine collection of art and centrally located near Portrait Gallery, St Martin in Fields and Trafalgar Square."
"Written November 22, 2019",Free art,Amazing access to world famous paintings. Not to crowded in October  and you can bring your art stuff and sit and copy. Security was not over bearing and was friendly.  I spent four hours freely photographing impressionist art and will defiantly go back again.

Learned an incredible amount about the man his background and how he became an artist and how his style developed. Really did not understand his fights against authority and the authorities. Still have not fathomed his mixed up attitude to religions and their teachings and how he seemed to continue to communicate with his friends often many years deceased. Loved the exhibition. "

"Written November 16, 2019",Leonardo,Yet another great exhibition with some stunning effects. If you’re a fan of Da Vinci don’t miss this whilst it’s on. Paying £4:00 to leave a jacket and bag in the cloakroom seems a bit steep but if it helps keep the Gallery going it’s a small price to pay 
"Written November 16, 2019",lunch when visiting the gallery,"Sadly, the fish cakes were only just warm and the salad sparse Not really good value . More like a ""works canteen"" Staff good and  welcoming , well trained "

There are many rooms and floors all filled with the greatest paintings from throughout history by the greatest artists ever known.  From Italian Renaissance to French Impressionist to Dutch Masters.  So much to see in this museum!
"Written November 12, 2019",Leonardo exhibition,Interesting and innovative approch to give the onlooker a greater insight in to painting. Four halls each addressing another manner of considering the Madonna on the Rocks.It was very well presented but I felt there was not enough. I spent 30 minutes in the exhibition and was left feeling somewhat short changes. There wasn't as much as I thought in the exhibition. 
"Written November 12, 2019",Incredible day,Thanks London every day that I visit London surprise me is the best city in the world...national is the best 
"Written November 11, 2019",Love the artwork.,Every time in London I visit here to see what exhibitions are on. Love most of the work of the Masters in their paintings. 
"Written November 11, 2019",Gauguin exhibition ,"A very worthwhile exhibition featuring portraits and ceramics following Gauguin’s life and the changes in style and influences in both France and Tahiti. An enigmatic painter, who became influential in the development of western art but brought features of Polynesian  art and culture; though to the modern viewer he at times leaves one feeling uneasy in the way he exploited Tahitian  women,yet he did recognise the effects of French colonialism in trying to suppress Tahitian culture and religion."

I can pend hours wandering through its galleries..."
"Written November 11, 2019",Return visit to see the sights ,"The National Gallery with its free entry (donations happily accepted) is one of the best galleries 'in the World' (I haven't been everywhere) The rooms are spacious, the guards are fonts of knowledge and you can stand in front of major works of European art without feeling like you are in a rugby scrum. The Impressionist are well represented and if you like religious art you will be spoilt for choice.They have a number of shops, café and facilities that will help you on your journey to art bliss. You can't miss it if you visit Trafalgar Square. "
"Written November 9, 2019",A wonderful place to visit!,"Each time we are in London, we visit the National Gallery. - a bonus is that it has free entry to all the permanent exhibits.  Each time we have visited, there have been groups of schoolchildren who always appear to be well-behaved and polite.  One could spend days or weeks there and still not see everything, such is the variety of exhibits.  I particularly enjoy seeing the Impressionist paintings - such a plethora or art! - as well as the paintings by Vermeer."
"Written November 8, 2019",Impressive,The national gallery is impressive and free to enter you can spend hours wandering the rooms and seeing great and historic art.

"Written November 8, 2019",Art enjoyment ,"The exhibitions, as well as the buildings are just phenomenal. As normal, it is quite busy, so I went straight to The Impressionist rooms and managed to enjoy the collection before it got over busy.I still cannot believe the entry is free to these places. Anywhere I have been abroad, there is an entrance fee."
"Written November 8, 2019",Beautiful Display,Lovely view from the outside and in the inside. Free entry and needs more than half a day if you are an art lover
"Written November 7, 2019",Just go!,"It's FREE and has amazing exhibits.  This last time I went, there was a wonderful Impressionists Exhibit.  I love being able to see works I studied in art school, up close and personal."

"Written November 6, 2019",A Solid Art Museum,"This museum sits right in Trafalgar Square, so, its location can't be beat. Their collection is very good for the years that it spans, and the rooms are organized chronologically. They don't have any paintings past the early 20th century, and there are no other forms of art (e.g., sculpture). The building itself is beautiful, with some neat mosaic tile floors. We liked it enough that we visited it twice during the week we were in London. As a side note, it was extremely crowded both times we were there."
"Written November 5, 2019",Amazing variety of historical art,"A must see in London, full of the classics and many hidden gems.  Spend a few hours seeing important works by the great masters in a beautiful old building."
"Written November 5, 2019",Just AMAZING,"I am definitely not what you can call an Art Expert by any mean, but I completely and utterly enjoyed my visit to the National GalleryI could not believe how easy it was for me (even with my super untrained art eye) to spot the difference between different School of Painting The way the paintings are displayed, the lights and everything is just perfect.The Gallery was absolutely jam packed with visitors (not surprisingly), and I got the feelings that for some of the Art Experts or someone who really knows a lot about it. it could have been quite difficoult to getting completely transported because of the shear amount of people in there,A definite MUST SEE when in London"
"Written November 5, 2019",A must for Classical Art Lovers,"I appreciate Real art, Classical art, the National Gallery is the place to find it. I am not a lover of so called Modern art.  I love a painting that tells a story or shows a person's character and is Painted with real Skill and Ability."
"Written November 4, 2019",Enjoyable sketching tour,"I went to the National Gallery to join a sketching tour for up to 25 people.  As a new adult art student, I wondered whether I’d be out of my depth but am glad I did as it was completely non judgemental. We were each offered a stool and were led by an artist to 4 paintings. After a brief talk on key aspects of the paintings to look for, we were given 15 minutes to sketch each masterpiece. It was challenging, but enlightening and enjoyable too in seeing just how much could be done in such a short space of time.After this we were free to look round the rest of the gallery. Without a map it’s a bit of a maze, so if you’re short of time or energy, it would be best to get a map from the outset. Coats and bags can be left in the staffed cloakroom for around £2 per item. Had a brief look round the Gallery shop which had the usual books, posters, scarves, etc plus some Christmas ornaments. I did not use the Gallery’s cafe, but went to the Pret A Manger next door instead whilst waiting for the rain to stop."
"Written November 4, 2019",laundramat for art,"The Salisbury wing holds a vast collection of cleaned paintings from the 1500's and 1600's.  The colours are comic book bright after centuries of grime was removed. An entire room was set aside to show case the restoration of a three panel paining - woodworms no longer invited. To tell more would spoil the shock and awe of the restoration. As an aside, the Rembrandt collection is huge and un-crowded. Amsterdam is a fun city, but to see Rembrandt paintings stay in London."
"Written November 4, 2019",Beautiful and well worth a visit ,A stunning gallery for free entry and some really surprising finds in there... feel very privileged to have seen Van Gogh and wonderful works by other famous artists! 
"Written November 4, 2019",Always good exhibitions,"We enjoyed the Paul Gaugin portrait exhibition. Very well curated, but crowded. We were disappointed that the upstairs restaurant had changed and now has the same buffet menu as the cafe downstairs. The food was ok but not as good as before."
"Written November 4, 2019",Speechless,The Art speeks for itself! I had only one hour free so i definitely need to visit it again in order to see everything
"Written November 4, 2019",Absolutely love this place,"Its a wonderful gallery, you ned a whole day to explore it and the national portrait gallery next door. Highly recommend it for anyone visiting London."
"Written November 4, 2019",A jem and a maze,"Really enjoyed an unplanned visit to the National Gallery, only a note on navigating the many many rooms: unless your intention is to see the whole collection, and that can take a few good hours, make sure you get a map, and even a pen to mark your own itinerary. May feel second millenium to do so, but it saves time and keeps the good spirits up. "
"Written November 6, 2019",Another great free “thing”,"It should be called “international treasures” - the collection is so vast it needs more than one visit so you don’t get “galleried out”. PS remember, the portrait gallery is just around the corner."
"Written November 2, 2019",It's amazing ,We went here with us two sons. They enjoy to visit this museum.

"Written November 1, 2019",A piece of our culture,You cannot miss it if you like the culture and the history of European art. Excellent exposition to visit also with family.
"Written October 31, 2019",Gorgeous museum,"Classic museum experience. I was especially pleased by the openness and lightness.  Of course, filled with people, but I never experienced the crowded feeling.  Anyone visiting London for the first time should put this on their must see list if they enjoy museums/paintings."
"Written October 30, 2019",Worth it!,Loved it!  Very serene.  Not overly crowded!  They have some very famous works and the gallery itself it easy to navigate.

"Written October 29, 2019",Go for the wallpaper alone ,I love the national gallery.It’s easy to spend the whole day inside. The artists are well signposted so it’s easy to get to Van Gogh if that’s what you are after.
"Written October 28, 2019",Disappointed with staff/ museum attitude,"Went to national gallery with family members on a holiday where we went to most of the large museums in London. When we asked on entering the national gallery London where we could eat our picnic we were told by a member of staff that she didn't think there was anywhere in the building. We were surprised by this as the natural history, science museum both have picnic rooms for public use. When wandering the galleries we came across a sign which said 'picnic rooms' so we followed and found a room with long tables in and one lady and her young child eating their picnic so we went in and started to eat ours. After about ten mins the door was opened by a member of staff who ' demanded did we have permission to be in this room?' we all told him that it said picnic rooms and the sign on the door said public use. He told us that 'we couldn't just use it'. I asked was the room needed right now for a group? He just muttered ' don't bother' and left! We ate our lunch. My family and the other lady both commented how the museums attitude to the public eating in a picnic room was unfortunate and very contrary to other museums in London and across the country. This was half term and we could not find anything for the children to ' get involved' in art within the museum. ( No hands on areas, or draw your own picture etc) We have been to many museums with all our children over many years in many countries and we are very disappointed that Britain's own national gallery has made us feel unwelcome and does not see it has a role to play in encouraging people of all ages ( from young to old) to grow a love and passion for art. We saw the paintings we went for, which were amazing but I  would not return. "
"Written October 27, 2019",Simply wonderful,"If you can choose the time of your visit wisely, this is a wonderful place. Can get very busy in peak tourist season (and when the weather is poor). I like to go very early or later in the afternoon."

"Written November 6, 2019",One of the world's finest galleries,"We were invited by friends to see the Gauguin exhibition. As always, an excellent presentation and wonderfully curated. An as on previous visits, we discovered so much more about the life of the artist and the motivation behind the work. Very impressive! The gallery visit was followed by lunch in the restaurant at the NAtional Portrait Gallery. We have dined there several times before. The view over London rooftops is magnificent and the food and wine selection of high quality. A 5 star experience for both exhibition and lunch"
"Written November 6, 2019",One of the worlds greatest collections of fine art,"As other reviewers have said, the breadth and scope of the National Gallery collection is superb. A must for the itinerary of visitors and natives alike. All schools of painting down the centuries are represented by works from the greatest masters of their time. Spend the best part of a day there, pausing for lunch in the restaurant downstairs and finish with a visit to the bookshop where you will find in-depth monographs and biographies of the artists to take away with you."

"Written November 6, 2019",Timeless genius,I try and visit the National Gallery several times a year and always leave in awe about what I have seen.  We have often visited there and then gone on to see a show in the Strand.   Whether a tourist from abroad or the UK the National Gallery should be a must see place.
"Written October 25, 2019",Perfect place to introduce kids to art.,We are very lucky to have the National Portrait gallery so easily and freely accessible. I take my two young children there every so often to look at art and especially if there is something they have learnt about at school and a visit in the gallery reinforces the experience with art.

"Written October 20, 2019",Free and open late on Friday ,"We spent about an hour walking through looking mostly at the Impressionists. There is only 1 Picasso here and it is not cubist. A quick visit worked out very well for us since we had just arrived in London and wanted something to do before dinner. As far as we could tell, most of the major sights close around 5 but the Gallery stays open late on Fridays."

"Written October 18, 2019",Brilliant!,"Whenever we visit the National Gallery, we limit ourselves to two or three rooms so as not to end up with 'art fatigue.' This time we saw the paintings by Rubens, Rembrandt and Titian, all brilliant in their own way. Beautifully set out and well lit, easy to view. Good to see that there were a lot of school groups there, some with fairly young children.The only slight quibble is that the signposting to the various rooms could be better - it is a very confusing place."
"Written October 18, 2019",At the heart of London,The National Gallery (and the Portrait Gallery next door) sit at the heart of London towering above Trafalgar Square and it is a national treasure in every respect.  Don't be overwhelmed by the size of it as you can choose an entry point or door and spend as much or as little time as you have spare.  It is a wonderfully spacious gallery and a quiet escape from the bustle of the Strand or the West End.  I will never tire of the National Gallery and never stop being pleasantly surprised.  Don't miss it!
"Written October 8, 2019",Great exhibition!,Great selection of artist represented in the National Gallery.  This is worth the stop.  There is also a great pub to the right across the street as you are facing the front of the building.  Not the one in the church but a little further back.  Try the upstairs.

The art in here ranges from Turner to Van Gough where you can see many of THE top artists in the worlds work ranging from the 1400’s (I think was the oldest picture I saw) forward! And when you leave through the front - you are treated to a elevated view of Trafalgar Square - perfect for a selfie/ picture to remember the visit! All this for free! Please be sure to leave a donation when you enter - most cities will charge £10-20 for this per person so £5-10 would be reasonable if you are able to do so! Otherwise - enjoy the art!  "
"Written October 6, 2019",Art Mountain,"It's easy to go paint blind at the National. It's a big gallery. But it's free to go in, so the best strategy is to go with what you want to see in mind, and if you discover an unexpected treasure on the way, then that's a bonus. Turn left at the top of the Sainsbury Wing for the Mediaevals (you might go gilt blind here) and the Arnolfini Marriage,almost as many people in front of it as the Leonardo (Virgin on the Rocks - Not a cocktail). Turn right for the Renaissance and later. Pretty soon you'll need a coffee. Don't go to the basement. Go back to the Sainsbury Wing and half way down you'll find the proper place with views over Trafalgar Square. When you're done go out through the main exit porch. You can't miss that view even if you don't want to hear the not very talented and over-amplified buskers in the square. This is London's antidote to the moderns, a bit old fashioned,a bit dull, but still with great content. Don't miss Gainsborough's daughters!"
"Written October 5, 2019","If anything, too much to see",The big problem with the National Gallery is that it is simply too big with too much to see. In hindsight we should have planned a couple of half days and been more selective. I suspect we would have seen more and enjoyed it better.

People are taken with the imagery and that in and of itself is wonderful to witness. Go at your own pace, see what you want, stay long or stay sort, but go!"
"Written October 9, 2019",The very best,"Van Gogh, Monet, Turner ... you name them. The works of some of the greatest artists i the history of art exhibited in the very centre of London. Dont´t miss it!"
"Written October 9, 2019",This was a highlight of our visit.,Museum was loaded with historic paintings and sculptures.  we enjoyed the restaurant and café.  All floors were handicap accessible.  Plan on allowing 2 days to really capture all items shown.
"Written October 9, 2019",beautiful paintings,"famous paintings from all diferent times in history,the entrance is free.New entrance : Sainsbury wing."
"Written October 9, 2019",Free Museum With Famous Art Work,"If you're used to shelling out big bucks to see famous works of art at the Hermitage, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, and the Museum of Fine Arts, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the cost of the admission to the National Gallery: it's free! I love going here when I'm in London because if I only have a few minutes I can always pop in to see a few rooms without having to budget an entire afternoon. It is also open late on Fridays, which is a boon in a city where many tourist spots close down by 5p.m. It is easy to find ""must see"" lists for this museum on the internet, but of special note are 4 Van Goghs (including one of his sunflower works), a couple of Rembrandts (including Belshazzar's Feast), a few by Rubens, and several Gainsboroughs. There is also a Seurat, a Degas, and a Turner work entitled ""The Fighting Temeraire"" that will be featured on the new twenty pound bank note starting in 2020. Those are just the highlights. There are hundreds of paintings in the museum and it is worth going to, if only for an hour or two."

"Written October 9, 2019",Great exhibition,"Great exhibition,  touching experience watching all the superior artists paints. Suggest coming right when the gallery opens"
"Written October 9, 2019",One of the great galleries of the world.,This is not a gallery to miss if you are the least interested in art.  The Sainsbury Wing is particularly wonderful with a selection of  Venetian painter Carlo Crivelli (c. 1430–1495) far better than you can see in the Accademia in Venice. 
"Written October 9, 2019",One of the best for family,"Superb place for the whole family to have fun. The children workshop programmes, lectures for grownups, special exibitions are also amazingly highstandard."
"Written October 17, 2019",Fabulous gallery,"This is an outstanding gallery covering a wide range of art, including many masters. It’s also well laid out for you to get round. We took a few hours and were able to take in most of the works. Great it’s free though you are encouraged to make a donation which is absolutely appropriate. Recommended."
"Written October 15, 2019","A Great location for this ""World Class"" Art Collection.","The incredible location of the National Art Gallery is ""Trafalgar Square""... and its wide/diverse collection by some of the World's most renowned artists are well curated and displayed.  Unlike most other ""national art galleries"", entrance is free.. and open for viewing 361 days a year!  The Gallery has been open for almost 200 years... and the collection covers a broad range-- from the mid 13th century to the 21st century.  It has earned TripAdvisor's highly coveted ""Traveler's Choice"" designation.  In addition to the collection, there is a wonderful (affordable) restaurant as well as a ""Gift Shoppe"".  One's enjoyment will be greatest if one carefully plans what are the ""priorities"" to see... and how to access them.I hope that this Review has been helpful."
"Written October 14, 2019","Amazing Museum, A Must See if Your Visiting London",A fantastic and inspiring collection of some of the greatest historical artifacts from around the world!
"Written October 14, 2019","Very good, but not sure I would rank it as a must see","I would say choose Natural History Museum, the V & A, and the National Portrait Museum ahead of this."
"Written October 14, 2019",Mrs,Well organized and I was very pleased to see how many families with children visited the museum. Coffee shops were effective and well organized. The only (important to me) thing I missed was that I couldn't find any list of items to see. I wanted to see the emperor pinguin egg that Captain Scott brought to Britain -and I couldn't find out if it was on display. 
"Written October 14, 2019",Great  free day out.,Great day out with trafalgar square on front of it. Fantastic  location right in the middle of everything. Will easily take the full day and a brilliant day out.
"Written October 13, 2019",Treasures to see,"A very modern museum with a lot of ""painted"" history. They accept the London Pass, but only for the visiting exhibitions, and if you want to see the rest you have to buy a ticket. A very good experience."
"Written October 13, 2019",One of the best art galleries in the world ,Visited for the Gauguin Portrait exhibition. It was fantastic but so is the permanent collection.  Always worth a visit for anyone in London.  
"Written October 13, 2019",Amazing experience,Had a great time visiting here and looking at all the amazing paintings. This is an amazing facility and totally free!
"Written October 13, 2019",Great way to spend a cold wet day,The collection in the National Gallery is very impressive and the information beside each painting is easily understood and (usually) easy to see. You can fairly easily find your way around without a guide/audio guide (there are maps on the wall near some of the staircases and they have helpful staff in most of the large rooms). The list of painters represented is outstanding with only the Van Gogh/Monet room being too crowded to see the paintings properly. The crowding in this room was due to having too many tour groups in there at once - and while we were there one of the staff members started politely dealing with the congestion. My 11 year old daughter was also easily able to find a seat if she got tired.
"Written September 22, 2019","A perfect visit, once again!","I usually visit The National Gallery when I come to London. This time we had a lovely day with many people outside hanging around and listening to the good musicians in the street. I immediately headed to the Impressionist painters' room, they are my favorite! It was full of people as usual, and I could admire once again the beauty of this wonderful art. Everything was perfect. Clean, safe, clear indications and a nice souvenir shop.Fantastic!!"
"Written September 22, 2019",Very good free gallery,"It is a beautiful building and has a very good range of art work, including some famous paintings such as 'Sunflowers' by Van Gogh. It is well set out and each section tells you the range of art to be found in it. They have a good cafe and toilets too."
"Written September 21, 2019",Fantastic Gallery and paintings,"We very much enjoyed our visit to the National Gallery, the building and painting were fantastic, well worth the visit"

"Written September 21, 2019",Amazing art ,It combines historical and modern art There's events and there's nice gift shop Be aware of bank holidays 
"Written September 21, 2019",Beautiful museum and you can easily spend a day here!,The self guide audio is well done.  It provides detailed information on the artist and background for the painting.Be sure to coordinate a meet up place and time as it is very difficult to find someone.
"Written September 20, 2019",Many Major Paintings,If you are in London to see the treasures this is one not to miss. As an Art Historian it was a delight to come up close and personal to many paintings by important artists from medieval through 19th Century. 
"Written September 20, 2019",Really beautiful!,I have been to London several times but I had never visited the National Gallery.   The museum is beautiful and was worth taking time for a visit.  I had the London Pass so this museum was one of the included attractions.  
"Written September 20, 2019",Worth a visit,Great pieces of work here! The impressionist collection is a must see. The building itself is stunning too!
"Written September 20, 2019",Great Gallery,"You would probably need a full day here to explore all of the artwork!  Beautiful surroundings, and some excellent exhibits!"
"Written October 4, 2019","A Wonderful, World-Class Collection of Many Favorites","The British National Gallery has a wealth of paintings spanning pre-Renaissance to Impressionism presented in a well organized manner.  You could spend the whole day here, but if you carefully plan which paintings you desire most seeing, you can see them over a several-hours span.  My suggestion is to hit the Renaissance Galleries at the top of the stairs in the Sainsbury Wing and head straight for Da Vinci’s magnificent Virgin on the Rocks.  You may be starting with one of the world’s greatest masterworks, but what a beginning!  Botticelli’s whimsical Venus and Mars is close by and other great paintings of that era include Van Eyck’s Arnolfini Portrait and Man in a Red Turban (both so beautiful), Della Francesca’s Baptism of Christ (great geometric mid-Renaissance work), and Paolo Ucello’s magnificent Battle of San Romano.  Crossing over into the main building, in the 16th Century rooms are several extremely rare Michelangelo paintings (the Entombment amply shows his sculptural approach to painting).  In the 17th Century rooms, be sure to see both precious Vermeers, the spectacular Caravaggio Supper at Emmaus (his exquisite talents of perspective, foreshortening, and passion at their best), Velazquez’s impossibly voluptuous The Toilet of Venus, an entire room of Rembrandts to please the austere aspects of your artistic pleasure, and in the Impressionist rooms the Bather paintings by Cezanne and Seurat, as well as Van Gogh’s Sunflowers and A Wheat Field with Cypress.  Your tastes obviously may differ from mine, but the above mentioned works are true treasure eye candy.  You can go the museum’s website online and locate each painting’s room location and preview your other can't miss works of art. And best of all, it's free to visit!"

"Written October 2, 2019",Wow !  ...............,"This is an amazingly comprehensive museum dedicated to the wonders of the natural world.   We spent about 3 hours there but it would take much longer to do full justice to the amazing collections.  However, for me the building itself was the most memorable feature - absolutely beautiful !"
"Written October 2, 2019",breathtaking,"An amazing collection of magnificent art across many periods and styles.  The architecture of the building itself is breathtaking. A suggestion is that you visit in the morning as the crowds in the afternoon can limit the enjoyment.  Plus, it's totally free!"

"Written September 27, 2019",Very pretty and so much art work,"This is a beautiful building on the inside and so much art work. If you are interested in seeing some Van Gogh, Monet, and other works of art this is a must see. Of course to see it all you could spend at least 2 to 3 hours if not more. Really worth visiting especially if you have a rainy day or not."
"Written September 15, 2019","A quick, delightful 20 minutes ","Happened to be passing by Trafalgar Square at 5.30pm on a Sunday and decided to pop into see the Van Gogh. So happy I did. Trekking to room 43, we passed many beautiful high ceiled rooms housing all manner and styles of art. Loved the leather banquettes under a beautiful glass skylight! I'm not an expert and get overwhelmed with too much but truly appreciated the chance to view with my own eyes. Love it that London makes its top museums completely free of charge to locals and visitors alike.  Gorgeous setting, lovely architecture too. "

"Written September 15, 2019","Go for sunflowers, enjoy the rest",We had not planned on visiting but when I visited some years ago sunflowers was on loan. I wanted to see it in all its glorious splendor. It was the only piece of art that had a crowd.The building is amazing and the art is well presented. I am not especially interested in art but have learned a little from watching Fake or Fortune on TV.
"Written September 15, 2019",Interesting and educational,"This museum seems to have a portrait of every Englishman of any importance,  The museum is free to enter and a good choice for a museum visit., near Trafalgar Square."

"Written September 12, 2019",National Treasure,I come here at least once a month and my appreciation for the work here only grows with each visit. A must visit location for any tourist.
"Written September 11, 2019",Canaletto heaven,"Much prefer coming here off peak, as the volumes of tourists can be daunting, especially outside. My best tip for a great visit is take your time -  don’t try to do too much.Look at a room of paintings quickly, then pick two or three to look at in detail"
"Written September 27, 2019",Must see art,"Not our first time here, but wings that were closed during a visit a few years ago were open. Spent a couple hours walking through the galleries - which themselves are works of art. We were there in the morning and it was crowded with school groups, but remarkably well behaved one. A lot of people around major paintings, but not too bad. My favorite was the Holbein ""The Ambassadors."" The distorted disk at the bottom of the painting becomes a skull when viewed from the far right and stooping to look up at it."
"Written September 26, 2019",One of the Best Museums in the World,"This is a must visit for those who love all all the way to those who only have a passing interest. The collection of art in this museum is simply stunning. From Renaissance masters, to the Dutch golden age painters, to the French impressionists, this museum has it all, and has only the best. So many of the world's most famous painting's are held here that it would be impossible to name them all. If you're in London, you must not miss this! Please note that while admission is free, you will be expected (but not required) to donate something upon entry."

"Written September 19, 2019",Can’t get enough of it!,"Whenever we have an opportunity we gorge our eyes on the wealth of exquisite art that hangs on the walls of this amazing institution. This is well worth not one, but multiple visits. It is quite surprising how close the public are allowed to get to what are effectively irreplaceable works of art, but that is what makes the experience so rewarding. "
"Written September 19, 2019",Lovely,Simply lovely. History specially in United Kingdom is something cherrished and well taken care of. Recommended
"Written September 17, 2019",good enough,I guess you don't really come here for the food and just need to sit down after viewing the pictures.Clean & fiendly although you have to queue at the self service and seating can be a bit cramped. It does the job and can't grumble considering you are in Trafalgar Sq.

This last visit my adult son and I spent two and a half hours there!!!"
"Written September 9, 2019",Truly fabulous,It's very difficult to add any value to what other contributors have said about the National Gallery. I believe this was my third visit and it was no less astounding this time around than it was when I first walked through the beautiful building that houses this collection many years ago. This place compares to your youngest childs flick paintings in the same way that Pavarotti compares to something from The Voice - I hope this helps with perspective!If at all possible it is important to take the time to view all that this wonderful gallery has to offer.
"Written September 9, 2019",Lovely,"This is a wonderful gallery for all ages. Nice day out, will come back when the kids are slightly older"
"Written September 8, 2019",Fabulous! ,"For a comprehensive history of European art, this is the museum to visit! All the art masters are represented.

"Written August 28, 2019",London visit,"Free admission to see some of the greatest artworks! Convinced friends who don’t usually like art to come in. The building is beautiful and the artworks- Monet, Van Gough , so many greats. The gift shop had some nice items as well if that’s your thing. Worth dropping in to have a look. My friends were impressed even though they hadn’t expected to be."
"Written August 28, 2019",London Trip 2019,This is by far the best art gallery in Europe.No queuing required to get in.It’s well sign posted in the building so we didn’t have to wander around.The best part for us was the Van Gogh exhibition..I would highly recommend this as a family trip.There are many activities for children to take part in.On offer are headsets with various languages so anyone can understand what each artist is conveying( some of the abstract works were puzzling to me..!!)
"Written August 28, 2019",Well worth a look,We were in Trafalgar Square so decided to pop in for a look around. Entry was free. Donations are accepted but no pressure.The building is grand and impressive. Each room/gallery has high ceilings. Lots of paintings with short descriptions. There is also an audio tour but we didn't  use that.We finished in the cafe for refreshment.
"Written August 28, 2019",Well worth a visit,I originally didn't plan on visiting but on a rainy day in London this ended up being a great option. Highly recommended.

"Written August 26, 2019",Audioguide for kids,The regular audioguide includes an Art Detectives feature which you really only know about if you ask.

All these great works of art can be viewed for free.  Special exhibits do cost but there is do much to see for free we didn't feel we needed to see the special exhibits.  If possible this is a great rainy day activity.  Or like us a way to escape the high heat of the day when it was 32 degrees. 
"Written August 25, 2019",Something for everyone ,"One of my London favorites. So beautiful, peaceful. And free! My favorite is the impressionists and post impressionists. "
"Written August 25, 2019",Definitely worth visiting!,"A beautiful and very large range of pictures, portraits and landscapes from all parts of history. Of course you should aim to see the main attractions, like Van Gogh's Sunflowers and Holbein's The Ambassadors. However, if you are able to find the stairs leading down to the basement there are many more paintings in an area which is usually very quiet and makes for a much more relaxed viewing than in the main rooms above where most people stay."
"Written August 25, 2019",Amazing,Free and fantastic. A great place to visit in the afternoon after some sightseeing. To stand so close to so many famous works and to be allowed to take photos. The cafe is also great.

We did visit only the 1600-1700 rooms since this is the part we know the less. The collection is incredible and the building is at the level of the great painters exposed there. It took us +2h to do all the rooms bar the biggest one (room 29) so we went for an Afternoon tea that the National Gallery Restaurant. If was very well served, the service is professional but a bit cold and not that expensive as you could expect in such a place.We will come back there to see the other areas for sure!"

"Written August 30, 2019",A hugh collection.,"The National Gallery is a very good gallery for what it is collection of West European paintings (including British) of the period 1250 to 1900.As far as modern art is concerned, the beginnings of Modern art in the late 19th Century are well represented. For latter stuff there seems to be little or nothing in the permanent, collection. Though occasionally there will be some truly modern  art among the temporary exhibitions.Its probably fair to say that some of the permanent collection is not that good, wall fillers perhaps. There is hoever a lot of great paintings (like Constables 'The Hay Wain') thet have entertained me on many visits.You are not obliged to pay to go in to the gallery so you can descide yourself how much the visit is worth. Which is convenient because sometimes you cannot stay long.Round the back of the National Gallery  is the National Portrait Gallery. It is mostly made of historical portraits of the the 'great and the good' of Britain.  There are some other kinds of portraits however. Each year, for a few months, the main contenders for the BP portrait award will be displayed there."
"Written August 30, 2019",Just amazing,"The building in its location and with the architectural facade it has, facing onto Trafalgar Square are all impressive, and that’s enough of a reason to visit, but the art it contains is even more breathtaking. I found time on a work visit to London to have 30 minutes here at the end of the day before closing. I had to see my favourite JMW Turner’s  The Fighting Temeraire. I also took some time over Whistlejacket, another of Turner’s masterpieces, a Seurat and a Vermeer. Time well spent in an amazing place."
"Written August 30, 2019",Embarrassed that have never been before ! ,Getting to the age of 52 and having visited London hundreds of times (and lived there for several years too!) am sad to say have never been before. A wonderful experience not to be missed. Incredible artwork in a beautiful space. The cafe was good value and a nice spot to stop and have a breather ! 
"Written August 30, 2019",Orderly,This was our second visit to the National Gallery having been 7 years ago.   The place is huge but well organised.   Plenty of seats to sit down on in each room if you don't appreciate art as much as the rest of your family does.  Located right on Trafalgar Square and a beautiful building!
"Written August 29, 2019",Moderately Enjoyable!,"So, these are the reasons why my review may be dismissed:  I come from a particular Christian background that disregards most other forms of Christianity.  While I don't ascribe to that faith now, it definitely still affects my tastes when it comes to admiring historical artwork (to give an example, my previous faith harbored on Jesus' occupation as a carpenter.  As a result, he wouldn't have been a weak-looking-man -- he would've appeared rather strong, so depictions of the Christ as lanky and un-muscular seem inauthentic to me, and I do not appreciate them).  I'm not a particular fan of Christian paintings -- they feel overwhelmingly inaccurate and redundant based off of my previous [fringe] Christian teachings.  Also, I only had a limited time to explore with my tour group, given our other plans.THAT BEING SAID, this is a wonderful museum.  I'm an American with a travel notice on my card and no UK paper currency, and they didn't harass me for a donation throughout my stay.  They did politely ask for a donation, but there's nothing wrong in doing that.  There were plenty of attraction in front of the museum itself, one of which, not to lie, seemed to be a collection of dance-gifted grifters entrancing the audience.  Their moves were okay (better than mine, absolutely, but not the sort that one would write home about), but they lacked variety.  Too many handstands and not enough choreography.The museum itself was painfully crowded.  Don't hold that against the National Gallery, though.  That's just London museums, it seems.  There are much too many people in this town on a given day.  The paintings had beautiful brushstrokes, even though they lacked in variety.  The pigmentation of the oil paintings was astounding and worth the trip.I would've liked a bit more variety in subject matter, though.  If I wanted to go to a wholly Christian collection of paintings, I would've gone to Vatican City, not London.  That being said, I can't say that I explored the entirety of the museum given my time constraints.   It's very possible (and hopefully likely) that I just happened to miss the exhibits focusing on other subjects."
"Written September 4, 2019",Always a pleasure,"I usually go early - when it opens - and go straight to the area I want to see that day.  This trip it was the Dutch and Italian painters.  Very few people were there and we had plenty of time and space to study all the great paintings, especially the Rembrandts!"
"Written September 4, 2019",Need more than one day,Stunning architecture and artwork for so many artist. Need more than one day to truly experience all this gallery has to offer
"Written September 4, 2019",The National Gallery,Throughout my childhood I frequently visited the national gallery to look at the various paintings. I used to be mesmerised by them and I can remember spending hours exploring the styles and colours of different artists. I think it was one of the most beautiful places to visit in London.
"Written September 4, 2019",Great location,"In the heart of London with a wonderful art collection, it is a tourists dream. Go in summer and watch the world go by."
"Written September 4, 2019","I love it 🥰, specifically if outside its cold","It’s very nice and interesting place to visit. I’m not one of these people that really knows about art , but I like to take a look sometimes."
"Written September 4, 2019",Lots of Amazing portrait and paintings,"We did hang around Trafalgar square then went to the National Gallery. I did not expect to spend 3 hours in there. It was easy to stay and enjoy all the paintings. They are beautiful and amazing. Lots of history, quiet and beautiful to watch. "
"Written September 3, 2019",Victoria Albert museum,Worth visiting. Very informative. It has artifacts stollen from all over the globe. Very well kept. Not fun for small kids
"Written September 3, 2019",As good as ever,"This is the 8th time we have visited the gallery and this time there was a Micheal Angelo exhibition,and all free although donations are welcome the amount of exhibits is overwhelming and is of the highest grade "
"Written September 3, 2019",Go With Van Gogh,I visited the National Gallery while vacationing in London in August 2019. Admission to the museum is free and they provide audio tour headphones which  are synched with the art. I particularly enjoyed the Van Gogh and Picasso works . I previously purchased a reproduction of Van Gogh’s “Long Grass with Butterflies.” So I was able to compare it with the original; of course there’s nothing like the real thing!  The gallery has over 2K paintings so there’s a wide variety to see; too many for me to do in one day.
"Written September 3, 2019",Annual Visit,I travel to London once each year and I always check in to see which special exhibit is being featured. Never disappointed as the gallery features some artists with whom I am not familiar as well as those whom I have studied. Lovely shop always has items connected to the featured artist as well as the the relate to the masters. 
"Written September 3, 2019",Super educational,A must for those with children - they will get a great deal out of it (even if they complain it's boring)
"Written September 3, 2019",Excellent gallery,Great place to while away at or look at some favourite great works of art. Amazing location the coffee shop is a bit expensive especially with a young family.

"Written September 2, 2019",So worth it!,This could easily take days to see in its entirety. The staff was very helpful and the art was simply amazing. I loved this place!
"Written September 2, 2019",Art projects at the museum,"I took my 8yo daughter to the National Gallery as a quick stop during our recent trip to London. Since a lot of the museums in London are free to visit, we decided to do a quick walk through after a stop in Trafalgar Square. We probably spent 90 minutes in the museum, part of which was dedicated to a project they had set up for the kids - view a special exhibit painting, and make your interpretation of the armor worn by the angel in the painting. My daughter and the other kids were having a blast being creative and making their armor. It can often be challenging to take kids to art museums, so this was a great way to keep them interested. "
"Written September 2, 2019",Sister Ya Ya Gathering in England,"Beautiful artwork nicely displayed and easy to view from all angles.  It helps to have an Artist for a Sister who lives in Horsham, West Sussex, England to give us a private tour!!  "

Go and have a look, even for 5 minutes!"
"Written August 21, 2019",Best Museum in London,Extensive gallery with loads to look at and see. Obviously v. busy as every but still worth the trip
"Written August 16, 2019",unplanned visit,gettting out of the rain. an unplanned but very enjoyable visit. the exhibitions were varied and interesting. especially liked the photography of 50's 60's 70's and 80's celebraties
"Written August 16, 2019",Great experience!,This is first time I’ve been to the National Gallery and it was a great experience.  It was easy to find and navigate round. Plenty of space and lots of staff around to ask questions. We only spend about 2.5 hours there but it was enough time. Is definitely go back again in a year or so. 😀I have 2 teenagers who only one enjoyed as she is doing art at school GCSE.  It was a bit too long the younger one 12yrs. Tip. Don’t spend too long on the older paintings which are very religious.  Start with modern ones which are probably more famous.
"Written August 20, 2019",inspirational visit,"Great place to go in the middle of London to get away and get truly inspired. Its great for families, individuals and anyone really. Fantastic building, great spaces etc."
"Written August 19, 2019",Great collection!,This museum (like most in London) is free. You can give a donation. The line moved quickly and the security/ bag inspection went quickly. It did not feel crowded inside at all and it was a wonderful collection.
"Written August 19, 2019",Must visit gallery in London ,Located in Trafalgar Square - this amazing art gallery is free. They do ask for a donation - voluntary so they can keep it free. We only had time to see a small selection of the paintings - you could easily spend a day here. Enjoyed May beautiful pictures but particularly enjoyed the famous pictures - such an honour to see them up close. Had tea in the cafe at the entrance - reasonable price for central London If you have not been then just go  
"Written August 19, 2019",Such a treat!!!,"Once again I had the opportunity to visit the amazing museum, what a treat this is!!! Such a variety of paintings all this for free. It is a bit too busy in some rooms but quite manageable. I found the security personnel in the rooms well informed about where to find a particular painting."
"Written August 19, 2019",Must See London,"The National Gallery is a must for your trip to London! They have an amazing collection of art from all over the world and the museum is easy to navigate. It was a little crowded in August, so arrive early to beat the crush. "
"Written August 19, 2019",Excellent collection,An incredible collection of art that really needs more than one visit. There are works by significant artists from the mid-thirteenth to the early twentieth century with most of the art styles of those periods. Worth a visit for the Rembrandts alone. The gallery is very central and tends to be rather busy.
"Written August 18, 2019",Amazing world-class collection. ,"On Sunday, there was an animal rebellion with some strange creatures outside the National Gallery.Inside, you forget what a stunning collection it is, though the Gallery suffers from tour-guide selectivity crowding some works, while other rooms are almost deserted.And there was a fascinating exhibition on the restoration of Giovanni's 'The Virgin and Child with Saints' from around 1475.One of the world's greatest art gslleries - and it is free!

"Written August 16, 2019",Love the National Gallery,"Lots to see, give yourself a good few hours to wander around and enjoy. We didn't give ourselves enough time and feel like we were a bit ripped off when we had to leave as our time was limited.  "

"Written August 14, 2019",Old Masters,"We came on a rainy day and the museum was packed, but still saw some of our favorite pieces from previous visits. Great gift shop."
"Written August 14, 2019",NG cafe.,"Terrible service. Took a table in the restaurant in the main building at 12.00pm ,and had to call a waiter to our table at 1.00pm so as to place our order.  We ordered drinks and a portion of chips.  40 minutes later the chips arrived ,but no drinks.  After a further 20 mins we had to call the waiter again asking where our coffes were.  We were then approached by whom I assume was the manager, who in a semi aggressive manner informed us there wes only one person serving drinks.      Over 2 hours from start to finish for a bowl of chips and a lukewarm coffee.    ."
"Written August 14, 2019",A wonderful experience,I loved this museum and would recommend it to anyone. the cafe is good and the location is amazing. I enjoyed the exhibition. 
"Written August 14, 2019",Wonderful exhibits,The Sainsbury wing shows the brilliance of artists in times gone by who painted beautiful alter pieces depicting complex religious scenes. I loved the colour and vibrancy  and they way they were displayed so that you can stand just a foot or so from then which enables a true analytical view. Loved it. Although  being accosted as you walk through the enters nice by sqauking people shouting for donations and waving plastic buckets in your face in not the initial impression one needs. 
"Written August 14, 2019",Amazing collection of paintings!,"Love this gallery, one of the best in the world. Spent almost the whole day and had lunch in the gallery cafe.👍"
"Written August 18, 2019",Hay Wain,"This visit had been a long time coming and it didn't disappoint! My sole purpose was to see the Hay Wain and it was amazing. The staff pointed me in the right direction and I found where I needed to be very quickly. Staff were very helpful and courteous, a real credit to the National Gallery. Next time I visit London I will spend longer in this fantastic place. "
"Written August 18, 2019",Amazing collection of paintings ,"Well, there is a single word - amazing. You can find an amazing collection of paintings, organized based on periods. So, I suggest to get the map guide at the entrance (1£) and the audio guide and admire for minimum 3 hours (if you go on fast forward, looking for the highlight). You could spend much more easily.Use the map and go from the early periods to present, to follow the evolution of the art. I personally like the Dutch school, but you can find most of the big names: Titian, Monet, Cezanne, van Dyck, Rubens, Rembrandt, Van Gogh (Sunflowers), da Vinci, Michelangelo and so on. The entrance is free (like most of London's  museums). "
"Written August 18, 2019",Amazing experince!!,This museum is my favourite in London. It's a place where all the art studied in the past comes to reality!! Better avoiding picking season but still fabulous experience.Very kind staff .

"Written August 17, 2019",Visiting The National Gallery in London,"August 2019. The national gallery has a beautiful collection of master pieces of art very much worth visiting, but there are thousands of people inside and we all want to see the same paintings. It is nearly impossible to enjoy the museum. Lots of organized visits of young kids ages 10 -m 18 in groups all snapping selfies of themselves with Van Gogh  behind them. Will I go again? Not in the summer unless the museum modifies their admittance policy."
"Written August 17, 2019","Great, free place for art lovers!","You can find art pieces of Claude Monet, Rafael, Vincent Van Gogh, Georges Stubbs, Edouard Manet, Paul Cezanne, etc.   You can easily spend a whole day here! Plus, it’s free! Highly recommend it!"

"Written August 13, 2019",quiet like a library,"Whole gallery 99% are portrait. Is a great place for all art lover, not suitable for family with kids."
"Written August 13, 2019",Must visit museum,"The Sorolla exhibit here was without compare.  And the permanent collection is a gem - I can stare at the paintings by Turner and Monet all day.  A reminder to tourists that all the large public museums are free of charge so there is no need to see every painting hanging on the walls in order to get your entry fee worth - I tend to go to a single room, or to see the works of a particular artist.  Use the museum's website to plan your trip if your time is limited or if you want to learn more about the collection."
"Written August 12, 2019",Must visit if you're a fan of the arts. Unmissiable,Saw the Monet exhibition here. Absolutely breathtaking. The experience is just fantastic. A little crowded to be fair but that's to be expected. Just such a great atmosphere.
"Written August 12, 2019",Lots of excellent art by British painters,"Liked the art. The Gallery is a great place to take the kids. Expect lots of people, though. In part because of its location in Trafalgar Square."
"Written August 12, 2019",Portraits say a thousand words!!!!!,Incredible experience to actually see portraits that would normally be in history books.  A total different experience seeing the real thing.  You can see old and new portraits including the Duchess of Cambridge.  Reserve a couple of hours well worth the time.

"Written July 29, 2019",Amazing gallery ,"We visited the National Gallery spontaneously because the London heat was at a record high and the Gallery was air conditioned and admission free. That being said, it was a wonderful surprise. We enjoyed touring it and seeing many interesting works of art. Besides the art, the building itself was lovely. We also ate in one of the cafes there and had great food. This is a great place to pop in and visit whenever you can since admission is free so you won’t regret going in even for an hour or two. "
"Written July 28, 2019",Amazing,What an incredible gallery. Seen artwork I've only seen in books. Mindblowing. Such a beautiful old building too. 
"Written July 28, 2019",I often go just to see a single painting or room,"Yesterday I had an hour before the film started and the National Gallery was on the way, so I stopped and looked at a few masters of the Italian Renaissance. I love that I can do this, just pop in and out real quick. The NG is an oasis in the middle of the city, even when it is quite busy. Thank you for being there."
"Written July 27, 2019",Terrific collection in a spacious setting,"The National Gallery is obviously among the worlds best. So I won’t go on about the great selections of classic artists and their work. The thing that impressed me was the fact that it seemed, even in a somewhat busy day, to have plenty of room for a person to sit on comfortable furniture and really meditate on the artist and their work. Then it was just as easy to go and really get close and observe the rich detail of the master’s brush. This is one of London’s many free museums, none of which should be missed - but out this one at the top of your list!"
"Written July 27, 2019",Gets crowded but worth it,"Free to wander about. Next year while visiting I am definitely take a tour. There is so much too see, that I feel like I wasted precious time as I was somewhat unorganized."
"Written July 27, 2019",Free admission is the best part of this attraction,"An unusually cool and rainy day in London during late May 2019 made visiting the National Gallery more enjoyable, however viewing paintings didn’t give me the same feeling as seeing London architecture, as such I spent a total of 20 minutes inside the National Gallery before leaving.  There is no cost at the National Gallery, free admission is the best part of this attraction."
"Written July 27, 2019","Wow, never thought I would enjoy it so much","What a great gallery. Loads of well known paintings and nice and cool in the heat of the summer. It was packed when we visited, so sometimes difficult to get close to some paintings but persevering prevailed "

Weekends tend to be quite busy, but still manageable. There are also tours and talks organised by the Gallery and they have always been of quite a high standard. I would highly recommend not only visiting the Gallery itself, but also trying to catch one of these tours (times and dates are usually available on the Gallery's website). "
"Written August 6, 2019",Complicated layout but amazing collection,"The National Gallery houses some really key pieces of artwork by the famous and not so famous.  Highlights for me were the collections of Monet, Ruebens, Rembrandt, van Gogh and Constable. I'm not a huge fan of iconography but loved the collection  of early works (13th to 15th century) as I marvel at how they were made and have survived.Cafe was good and reasonable prices.Gift shop okWe went on a Monday in the school holidays and it was not too busy at all."

There are not many reasons for living in London that I can see, but an easy and free access to the National Gallery would be one of them. Why do we have so much concentrated in one place? Why not take some Art to other cities - one room at a time would be quite enough! Let people appreciate what and how much we have! It was a tiring but an astonishing visit. A MUST GO PLACE."

"Written August 10, 2019",And it's still free!,"As a schoolboy, I used to spend my school holidays walking around the city of my birth, exploring all the alleyways and winding streets that have now disappeared under soul-less glass and concrete eyesores and frequenting the museums and galleries for which London is justly famous. One of my favorite haunts was the National Gallery. I'd happily spend hours on end marvelling at the many wonderful art works on display. I was so happy to see that, apart from the new wing and ultra-modern entrance, nothing much has changed. This is a marvellous collection of 2300 works which include all the greats like Leonardo, Caravaggio, Michelangelo, van Eyck, Constable, Turner, Duccio and Tiziano. In fact, if not for the Italians, there wouldn't be much here! (only joking). Unlike the Louvre, which is the Grand Bouffe of art galleries - really too much to take in, the National Gallery is a real delight. "
"Written August 9, 2019","National treasure, worth a visit","Always an enjoyable visit, an amazing collection.I always complain about the very poor information panels with each picture and other items.  The curators go to the trouble of providing information.  BUT it is too small, with far too small a print size.  AND it is located down low so that only one person can read it, blocking out other visitors.  If there were two information panels in a much larger font (so that people can stand back to read it) with one mounted high and one low.  It's as if the management are making the point that only those who are very ignorant are interested in reading the information; if they were educated the visitor would already know these details.There's also a quite reasonable cafe."
"Written August 9, 2019",A treat for the eyes,"I have turned into an admirer of artwork as my wife is an artist herself . Equipped with a DSLR camera we set out to view the paintings in this Gallery . The collection is fantastic with paintings from all over Europe displayed here . Don’t forget to take a map when you start the tour . An audio guide is available & very helpful if you are a keen follower of art . It is very simple to use , one has to key in the number displayed next to the paintings to get more info about that particular painting .The paintings were a feast to the eyes , depicting the life during those times ."
"Written August 8, 2019",Interesting visit,"The National Gallery is free, you can visit and enjoy the grain paintings in this place. Monet, Manet, among many other painters from around the world."
"Written August 8, 2019",Amazing museum!,So much to see here and you need to keep checking back because you ever know what will be on loan to the museum or in a special exhibition.  I see new things every time we go.
"Written August 8, 2019",leave the kids at home,A fun day out for me and my wife but if like us you have young children maybe make it a date day or something as it can become quiet boring for children. 
"Written August 7, 2019",Top quality venue,"For an event or just simply a day where you want to chill and dive into art and culture, I would recommend it. Excellent staff, customer service, shops. I could go over and over again because they often host new exhibition."
"Written August 7, 2019",Sorolla Exhibition,Stunning exhibition of the Sorolla Paintings beautifully displayed at the National Gallery as usual. Small fee well worth it.
"Written August 7, 2019","Superbly gallery, culture +culture +culture. A must!","It's a great place to visits, make sure that you'll have plenty of time to absorb the inumerous amounts of knowledges +culture, a must, and free! As the majority of attractions in Amazing +Uniquely London!"
"Written August 7, 2019",great experience,"Get yourself to the national art gallery, what a fantastic experience to see some of the best art ever painted. I couldn't believe you can see the incredible pictures for free. I went specifically to see the Haywain by Constable I was blown away with the pictures by among others, Gainsborough, Caneletto and the bloke who paints sunflowers all amazing if visiting London make this a must visit"
"Written August 7, 2019",Great art And Good conference rooms for London meetings,"Accessible, great art for tourists, Londoners or users of National Gallery conference rooms during their lunch break .  Look for Odilon Redon's ""Ophelia among the Flowers"" - rather unusually beautiful."
"Written August 7, 2019",One of the best of British sightseeing,"There are so many place in London to mention but this is one of my favourite pastime to come and relax by myself, wandering around each room, admiring some of the most priceless paintings in the world. Always intriguing captivating and inspiring"
"Written August 6, 2019",Fascinating stories of royals throughout British history,"Well laid out over three floors. As the entry is free, I recommend several shorter visits in order to take it all in.  The portraits are detailed and beautiful."
"Written August 6, 2019",interesting and rich visit,Entry is free. The gallery is a small mine of works of art. The collection is very rich in paintings from the Middle Ages to the last century. Illustrious names of painters who have made art history on paintings. I advise you to go on a Friday which is open until evening
"Written August 6, 2019",Sorolla exhibition: once in a lifetime!,"The National gallery is truly the place to see if you love art. Their exhibitions are always a must see.  I became a member because while I usually like to see one or two exhibitions a year, but this year I must see all of the ones which will be showing!"
"Written August 6, 2019",Wander and wonder,"So much to see you will always find something new and so many old favourites to revisit and wonder at that old friends will always be there waiting for you to rediscover them. And if you haven't tried it, go and have lunch there overlooking Trafalgar Square. Absolutely delightful."
"Written July 31, 2019",Highlight of our London visit,The number of amazing paintings is underestimated in publications about this gallery.  We were tripping over masterpieces that went unmentioned in our research.  I guess there are just too many!  I am embarassed that this was not our first stop.  A must-see!
"Written July 30, 2019",Fabulous collection,"Amazing collection, viewed the old masters and the Impressionists, but you could spend the entire week there and not run out of things to see!  "
"Written July 30, 2019",One of the best ways to spend time in London,"There are so many wonderful paintings inside the museum, this place in unbelievable... Even without the paintings, the museum looks like a palace inside! Also, the place can be quite busy on the last days of December... Still, less than the main shopping streets :)"
"Written July 30, 2019",Wonderful!,"Wonderful gallery containing the original paintings of so many famous artists, including loads of paintings you will have seen in books and on TV/online. I particularly loved the Impressionists, and Constable and Turner, though there are so many you will find something you like, whatever your taste.It can get extremely busy, so it may pay to go early or late to try to avoid the crush - it is difficult to get close to some works, e.g. Van Gogh's Sunflowers.There is a cafe and toilets, and some seating in the lobby where you can wait for friends to join you or have a rest. You may find, like me, that you cannot see it all in a day, unless you rush around."
"Written July 29, 2019",A culture overload,"The National Gallery London is a superb museum, founded in 1824, where you can admire a lot of art masterpieces – paintings and statues.This museum is situated in Trafalgar Square – the City of Westminster, and the access is free.At the souvenir shop of the museum you can buy a lot of copies from the exposed items, even you can order some reproductions from the favorite paintings – on canvas. If you are in London, this museum is a „must”."
"Written July 29, 2019",Fantastic museum!,"  My family spent the afternoon here looking through all the rooms of art, and how impressive it was!  Paintings from artists that date back to the 1200, and 1300's and on up.  Monet, Shakespeare, etc!!  We could have spent more time here, and a whole day you could use.  Absolutely worth a visit if in London!"
"Written July 29, 2019",Fabulous collection of art treasures,"The National Gallery holds one of Britain's great art collections, with particular strengths in European oil painting. The rooms of impressionist paintings always seem to be among the most popular, and some of the works there really dazzle. On this trip, we were more interested in earlier approaches to landscape painting. The Gallery has some great holdings in landscape art over the centuries, including works by Claude, Gainsborough, Turner, and Constable, as well as a strong collection of Dutch landscape painting. These bear repeated viewing, and I learn more each time I see them!"
"Written July 29, 2019",Amazing,"I was ""dragged"" here by my friends a couple of weeks ago. What a lovely afternoon we had; I thoroughly enjoyed the open spaces and the relaxed atmosphere. "
"Written July 29, 2019",A wonderful museum,You could spend days exploring the vast exhibition. The quality is amazing and the café is good too. 
"Written July 29, 2019",Always something new to see,"A brilliant museum, have been many times and there is always something new to see. The dining facilities are good too, so there are places to have a rest between galleries."
"Written August 6, 2019",Big and full of arts,"We have been lots of arts museums around the world, particularly in Europe before we visited National Gallery.  So we don’t feel way too excited.  However, the gallery itself does showcase works and artists very well.  "
"Written August 5, 2019",The best place to relax,I absolutely love the National Gallery. It is breathtaking and best place to just relax your body and mind.
"Written August 5, 2019",Very wide,"You have to prepareb 2-3 hours to see all rooms!  Sometimes, so many group tours from Asian countries.  Therefore please visit there in the morning!"
"Written August 5, 2019",Popped in as passing by ,Wandering around Trafalgar square and popped in to waste a few hours.  Worth a visit. Lots of amazing paintings 
"Written August 5, 2019",Stunning paintings!,"You hardly know where to look first , there's a wealth of fabulous art here . It would take days to look at everything properly . Well worth visiting !!"
"Written August 5, 2019",Jewel in the art crown of UK,"The breadth of the collection at the National is staggering. From medieval through to early 20th century art this gallery has it all. There are galleries with collections that are more 'focussed' and comprehensive of certain periods (the Prado in Madrid is undoubtedly the place to see El Greco or Goya for example), but no where in the world will take you on such a journey through art as the National. The building itself is a treasure, the mosaics in the halls are amazing tongue in cheek nods to the moral values of the Victorians If you haven't been. Go.If you haven't been for a while. Go again. remind yourself of this truly awe inspiring art collection.I genuinely feel that the National Gallery is the best art gallery in the Western World"
"Written August 5, 2019",One of my favourite places in London,Could spend the whole day at the gallery with the amount of art they have. Massive collection of art which I always enjoy from different periods 
"Written August 5, 2019",Great Art in a Grand Setting!,I loved visiting the National Gallery in London and plan to visit again the next chance I get.  Admission was free; a donation was requested.  The Renaissance art is phenomenal.  They have a room filed with Rembrandts.  The Impressionists are also nicely represented.
"Written August 5, 2019",Stunning and amazing experience to see art,I took an art history class in college and enjoyed it but there’s something amazing seeing it in person. You can get up close to all the pieces and really experience them. We did a quick 1 hour private tour of the key pieces which I’d highly recommend otherwise you could spend all day there. It’s a free gallery so crowds form at the key pieces but it’s manageable. 
"Written August 4, 2019",Gorgeous Masterpieces ❤️,"Great place in the heart of Trafalgar Square! Admission is free, you may enjoy roaming through all the halls and fall in love with the world’s most beautiful works of art😍"
"Written August 4, 2019",Great museum and it is free!,"We took the audio tour, it was well worth it, it took you from 1200to 1930, we went from room to room, looked for the particular painting and listened to a brief explanation. What was nice to see is that every painting was on the audio tour, so you can come back and listen to the commentaries on other painting, in other words, you can never get tired of the museum.Not to be missed, great selection of paintings"
"Written August 4, 2019",Pretty good museum,"The fact that it's free entry is a massive plus. But because of it, it attracts anyone and everyone. Loses the ""quietness"" of other museums. Decent enough artwork and collections to pass a few hours. "
"Written August 4, 2019",Great,"Amazing collection + Free entrance.Lots of amazing paitings, and it never feels crowded.It´s a no brainer, GO THERE NOW!!!"
"Written August 2, 2019",Amazing! Free,Have what you want to see in mind! We just did the impressionists and it took less than an hour! Make a small donation!

"Written August 2, 2019",Bartolomé Bermejo great!,What n outstanding collection. And free entry. Not like the New Tate that cost a fortune to see the special exhibits.
"Written August 2, 2019",Superb exhibitions - all free,"Wonderful, well known paintings ranging from the Renaissance to Impressionists. Some very famous artists. All free though a donation of £10 is recommended. You could spend hours here."
"Written August 1, 2019",Take your time,A stones throw from Trafalgar Square You need plenty of time to looked at all pictures on several floors.  Staff are very helpful and can answer most questions. Cafe has snacks and hot and cold drinks and there is also a restaurant. It is free admission but a donation is asked for.
"Written July 31, 2019",maybe I just don't like visual art,"Admittedly, I am not a big fan of visual art.  I would much rather learn about the history or significance of a piece, or how it was made than hear speculation about what the artist was thinking or what something in the painting may or may not symbolize.  I rented an audioguide hoping to glean some of the information that would be interesting to me, but all the audioguide does is give you a description of the painting you are standing in front of. "
"Written July 31, 2019",Worth the effort,"We hadn't planned on going in but stumbled upon it while looking for some time to get inside because of the heat. So we spent some time here.This was interesting and unique but not totally my cup of tea. We spent an hour there just to cool off, and it was good, but not something that I'd spend a lot more time at. More avid art fans would love it."
"Written July 18, 2019",Highly recommend,"Loved this place. So much to see - paintings and also architecture. There are many enjoyable details in the interior also. As I am a Finn, it was also nice to see a painting from a Finnish artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. Also my favorite artists and new ones too.This place is easy to find. Jus take time enough because you'll need when wondering thouht all the rooms. Lots of people and it works anyway."
"Written July 18, 2019",As always: amazing!,"Fantastic collection. The entrance is free, but I would recommend a small donation. Number of Rembrands is amazing. It is sometimes difficult to find your way, despite all efforts to indicate where you are etc. "
"Written July 17, 2019",Amazing Paintings,"The Gallery is a pretty confusing place to get around but the paintings are exquisite.  My favorites were three Rembrants – Belshazzar’s Feast (the Babylonian King looks up to the sky and sees written in the clouds the Hebrew letters that tell him that his days are numbered since he has misused a sacred cup from the old temple), Rembrandt’s self-portrait at the age of 63, two Vermeers, including one of a young woman playing the piano, the impressionists as usual, and the special exhibit of Sorola’s painting which were rich, vibrant and full of life."
"Written July 17, 2019",Classic Visit,Free and full of amazing artwork! What else could you possible want? have to recomend it as one of UK iconic places
"Written July 17, 2019",Bucket list destination,A worthwhile must see destination. The Main Galleries are free to visit. Too much to take in at one go.
"Written July 16, 2019",Grand and gorgeous,"I enjoy visiting The National Gallery, there is a quarter for Monet's, the Impressionist, paintings, and master pieces from other reputable artists.  Most importantly, it is free admission, definitely worth the visit."

"Written July 16, 2019",Impressive,"Came early Sunday morning just before it got really busy, went to several of the main displays and had a fairly quick look at each. As the place got busire and busier we semed to get shuffled along before deciding it was time to leave. We would love to come again but at a quieter time during the week."
"Written July 25, 2019",Well worth a visit,"I'll be honest and admit that - as I was with an avowed non-art lover - we only went in to get out of the searing heat on the hottest day of the year but ended up spending a really enjoyable few hours.We wandered round without an audio guide (although these seemed reasonably priced) and loved stumbling across 'the big hits' (helped by the '30 must sees' listed on the web-site).A word on the web-site...it really is excellent and I spent a couple of hours after the visit browsing, watching some of the great videos etc. A fantastic resource.We're not great at organised tours although stumbled across guides giving talks on paintings at various points and listened in for a while, finding them really entertaining and informative.Overall, well worth a visit and - of course - absolutely free!"
"Written July 24, 2019",Short and Sweet,"Time was against by the time we made it here. However, in a very short time we were able to gaze at the wonderful portraits and painting by Caravaggio, which we so badly wanted to see!!!  Highly recommended."

"Written July 24, 2019",Afternoon visit,A great museum and is it free. The interior is spacious and air conditioned. There is a restaurant on the top floor with a good view of London skyline.
"Written July 24, 2019",I love this place,"While the venue is free to visit, there is a suggested donation. I love to pop in and most of the time I will give a donation, but it's not strictly required and every few times I go for ""free"". There are some amazing pieces of art here, it is def a world class gallery and while the lay out can be a bit confusing for a first time, it's definitely worth giving your self some time to wonder around all the different areas. Personal favourites are Whistlejacket and Lake Keitele which are helpfully not far from each other. If you like art, this is a must!! "
"Written July 23, 2019",Art!!!,Art!!! If you're a art fan this is the place/ You can literally get lost in this place as I did. I went to see Flemish art and wasn't disappointed!

"Written July 11, 2019",My favorite museum in London!,The National Gallery has one of the most amazing art collections in the world and is one of the most beautiful as well.

"Written July 11, 2019",Beautiful galleries!,"Some of the most beautiful galleries! Bee lined to some Da Vinci and Rembrandt pieces! It does get a little crowded but worthwhile! If you don't have time to get through it all, their website does offer a list of the top 30 paintings to see which is what we did."
"Written July 11, 2019",Amazing!,"Easily the best collection of paintings in the Uk. The masterpieces of the Italian painters are some of the finest outside Italy. If you would like to see Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio in the same collection, the NG is a must!"
"Written July 11, 2019",Free but crowded,"We only had 30 minutes so we went straight to the Cezanne and Degas gallery. Because entry is free it gets very busy with large groups of kids, with a fascination for taking photos of every painting! All very well but some people just want to admire the picture without taking a photo of it!The shop is very well stocked with postcards of most paintings so they could buy these! "
"Written July 11, 2019",Cultural immersion,"Flying out late on Friday afternoon, I made time to check out the National Gallery having missed it on previous visits. Some stunning galleries, lots of famous artwork - all in all a wonderful way to spend an hour or two or three. Briefly visited the canteen - feel free to give it a miss unless you're in dire need of a drink  - but otherwise first class. "

"Written July 3, 2019",Stunning Sorolla Exhibition,"This Exhibition at the National Gallery is hands down my favourite art exhibition in London this year. An unexpected treat that was beautifully curated and cannot be recommended highly enough. The artist Sorolla, also known as The Master of Light painted huge canvases filled with vivid portraits of daily life in His country Spain and other parts of the Mediterranean. There is still time to see the beautiful work of this hugely underrated artist. Not to be missed!"
"Written July 3, 2019",Fabulous Sorolla Exhibition,"We came to the National Gallery for the exhibition of paintings by the Spanish artist Joaquin Sorolla. Friendly efficient bag search, good facilities in the gallery, fabulous exhibition. The paintings were well displayed with good captions, and not too many people viewing so we could really see all of the paintings well."
"Written July 3, 2019",Day is not long enough,"Fantastic place to visit, so many different rooms to wander through with some amazing art.  Well worth a visit for art lovers. "
"Written July 2, 2019",A must visit! ,We visit the National Gallery as often as we can. We just love walking around and admire the great painters and their fantastic works. Admission is free. 
"Written July 2, 2019",Almost an unfair rating,"Okay so let me put this out here. We were a group of two adult children and our mother and this was a stop for an hour or two among people who don't necessarily have a passion for art. The museum is gorgeous, the collection is extensive, and it's free. It would have been really helpful (and probably was available somewhere that we didn't find) to have had a ""highlights"" type of program or tour so that we could see some famous pieces, learn a bit about others, and then move along. Instead we kind of wandered from room to room and never really got into anything. This is probably our fault and there's no doubt this is a lovely museum but it wasn't our highlight."
"Written July 20, 2019",Wonderful,"I haven’t been for a long time but it’s still as fantastic as I remember it being.From the outside you have Trafalgar Square which is brilliant for brief entertainment of young kids.The national gallery building is beautiful. So many rooms it’s easy to get lost but thankfully in every one there is someone to ask for directions.Plenty of seating in vintage leather sofas and wooden benches that mix so fantastically with the ornate paintings and decoration. Galleries often downplay their wallpaper so not to detract from the art but here it just adds to the experience.There is a huge amount to see and as long as you like classical styles of painting rather than ultra modern, you will find something to enjoy from smokey Turners to extraordinary religious pieces, to marble like botechelli and peaceful surats.Sadly, we couldn’t linger long as our daughter was getting really bored (it’s not the most ideal place to take young children unlike the Tate modern) but I will be back when she is older!"
"Written July 20, 2019",Just amazing,Well worth a visit. Doesnt take long unless you are a big art lover and want to examine the painting. Its free to enter
"Written July 20, 2019",It’s a feast for the soul,"I have been fortunate to work in London and hardly ever missed the chance to visit the gallery. As it is almost too large - and overwhelmingly awesome - to view in one bite. The best way is to select a section ie Dutch masters, Impressionists, Turner or Constable and just sit and soak up the grandeur and exquisite displays. "
"Written July 19, 2019",a few hints,"you have to get off the undergound at Charing Cross, Leicester Square and remember that National Galery is admission free. Even if you were not interested in painting at the National Galery, you will be stunned. For me, the most interesting works of art in the Gallery are: Sunflowers Van Gogh, The Ambassadors, Hans Holbein the Younger, The Madonna of the Pinks, Raphael and The battle of San Romano. Have fun!"
"Written July 19, 2019",Superb,If you are visiting with a limited amount of time you should plan your visit to pick out the key paintings you want to see. Be prepared for it to be busy in the holidays.

"Written July 21, 2019",Fantastic place,"Amazing. I not an art expert, not even a novice. Blown away by the art. The pictures are so big. Real artists at work."
"Written July 21, 2019",Great collection but overcrowded ,"Visited on a Saturday afternoon whilst in London for the weekend to find inspiration and admire some beautiful paintings but unfortunately the gallery was overcrowded which significantly deteriorated our viewing experience.Whilst it is an honourable idea to provide ‘free’ access to art for all (ie no, I’m not going to donate because I pay tax, thanks) the result is that nobody can view the art because there are so many people crowding around the paintings. What could be an inspirational, transcendental experience is turned into a football fan mob of people pushing each other and racing to see certain paintings by famous painters. Hopefully this situation will improve as this gallery experience is surely unsustainable. "
"Written July 21, 2019",Monet's & Reniors,"Great visit to see some of the great masters originals. Free entry and great location just above Trafalgar square. After the gallery, came out and enjoyed some top busker performances. Great way to spend an afternoon or morning. Easy to get to on Tube or bus."
"Written July 21, 2019",Excellent for a morning,Spent a morning here in July. Fairly busy with lots of kids. It has a nice selection of paintings and great location.
"Written July 20, 2019",Love it!,"I've been to the National Gallery on my own a few years ago and returned twice this year with members of my family. It is amazing to see from the outside, with Trafalgar Square right in front of the gallery, and the art is amazing. If you don't have much time, make sure to find a map of the gallery, it has a list of all the must-sees and their room number. I love taking some time to eat at the café before or after my visit. They have amazing coffee and tasty desserts."
"Written July 5, 2019",First trip to London,Traveling with my elderly sister they had a wheelchair ready for us and we spent several hours browsing wonderful works of art from all schools and time periods. Lots of seating available to sit and rest the feet or just gaze at a painting. The gift shop is very good.
"Written July 4, 2019",One of the World's Top Class Museums,"It can't be missed. While gigantic, it is also ok to choose a few rooms and enjoy them.  If you are a real art lover, be sure to leave yourself plenty of time.  It is a world class museum which one could keep visiting one's whole life and still not be finished."
"Written July 4, 2019",Excellent art collection,Take your time viewing this wonderful collection of art over the centuries.  It offers a wide variety of examples of styles and methods.  A must see museum!
"Written July 4, 2019",Good stop,The National Gallery and Portrait Gallery make for a great back to back stop. The National Gallery contains many of the great masters. The Van Goghs in particular were a highlight for us.
"Written July 4, 2019",Special Experience,"Had a fabulous time here- crucial visit for art lovers and honestly for anyone else. it's free in and you're allowed to take photos of most of the artwork without the flash on, but be aware that videos are not allowed- I had to put my go-pro away. While some of the older art can feel very much the same and monotonous to the untrained eye, the later impressionist galleries can be truly appreciated by everybody and you can see that from the crowds in them. To walk around a room and see a Van Gogh, a Monet, a Renoir and a Degas- it's a very special experience. And considering it's all for free, if you're anywhere near Trafalgar Square and have a spare hour or two, considering taking a donder though here."
"Written July 4, 2019",The best art gallery ever,"To walk into Room 1 and see four of the greatest British paintings ever is the start of an emotional and spiritual journey that is almost beyond words.Every visit lifts my heart, this is a must see venue for anyone who loves life"
"Written July 3, 2019",You have to go.,"It is free.  Some of the greatest works of art are on display.  It is a mistake to miss this.  Van Gogh, Monet, Van Eck.  Plus, the courtyard is full of musicians and artists.  It is a great experience.  "
"Written July 3, 2019",A favorite place to relax,"One of my favourite galleries in London. You can just pop in for a quick visit, or spend hours viewing the galleries. Special exhibitions are also available. Some require tickets but others are free to view."
"Written July 3, 2019",Free toilet drinking water and seat!,"The National Gallery is known as an attraction in its own right. However, I'm there all the time, for work, and it's a great place to get drinking water, use the toilet for free, and sit down! There's a toilet on the first floor with drinking water just outside. It is totally free and of course this is one of the greatest things about  visiting Britain -it might be expensive but lots of stuff is free."
"Written July 3, 2019",Overdue visit,"Fascinating, wide variety of exhibits to be seen.  The Egypt rooms were fascinating.  There are plenty of places to eat and drink. "
"Written July 15, 2019",A place to visit over and over...,"I always like popping into the National Gallery, and not just to visit the shop or the toilets. I can viist the impressionist paintings again and again and see something else or have a new favourite, so I highly recommend them."
"Written July 14, 2019",Enjoyable Afternoon,"From our hotel, it was about a 20 minute walk but well worth it.  The gallery has alot of options to see for all types of art lovers. Worth the visit."
"Written July 14, 2019",Must place while visiting London,Full of beautiful paintings and the place itself is of course gorceous as well. Quite warm inside though. And the best part - free of charge
"Written July 14, 2019",Sorolla Exhibition was Exceptional,I was not familiar with Spanish Artist Sorolla's work.  What a delight to discover this lovely exhibition at the NG.    
"Written July 14, 2019",Nice place for tourist,"It's so big. Everyone will like this place. We have taken so many pictures there. In-front of national gallery there has one monument, which is also nice."
"Written July 13, 2019",Breathtaking ,"A day is not enough to see their vast collection. I have been visiting Art gallery across Europe but the London Art gallery stand out amongst all of them. The quality of their collection, the presentation, the size of the gallery itself is mind blowing. Must visit if you are in London."
"Written July 13, 2019",Sorolla,We primarily went to see the Spanish painter Sorolla’s exhibition. It did not disappoint.A truly gifted man.It’s always so thought provoking looking at people’s works of art. A thoroughly pleasant afternoon.
"Written July 12, 2019",Stunning,"The collection of masterpieces is simply stunning. Also impressive is the accessibility. A meagre brass footrail (and in some places, hordes of school children) are all that stand between you and the European masters. And it's free!"
"Written July 12, 2019",Marvel at Masterpieces,"I could have spent several days and more time at the National Gallery.  Even the teen in our group was impressed!  But for a reason I didn't even know!  As soon as we walk in to the first gallery he announces ""I know this place!""  Never having been to London I had to ask how.  The National Gallery is in a scene of the James Bond movie Skyfall.  The paintings have been rearranged but he was excited to see the room and the paintings.I was slightly disappointed to find that ""Sunflowers"" by Vincent van Gogh was not available for viewing.Definitely crowded but worth the visit to see some of the best artists in history: Michelangelo, Raphael, Diego Velázquez, Monet...so much to see, so little time.If historical art work is your passion, plan an all day visit.  And don't forget to check events for surprises including hands on experiences.The staff was very helpful as I had to ask where the ""James Bond"" paintings were.  Never did I think I would ask that question in a Gallery filled with historical greats. "
"Written July 11, 2019",Lots to see!,A well-maintained museum with an amazing collection of art and portraits!! Just how it should be!!!!
"Written July 2, 2019",Good tenke,"After a gallery visit we popped in for tea and cake.The service  was bit haphazard although there were plenty  of staff around.Tables not being cleared quickly, that sort of thing. Cakes and tea good though. Tea served in a huge pot. Excellent value."
"Written July 2, 2019",Free talks are great,The lunchtime talks and drawing sessions are marvellous.  Go the relevant gallery early as seats are limited. They are really good.
"Written July 2, 2019",It's a must to see famous art and for free in London,Art amazing and iconic central location easy to find you way around stopped off at the restaurant for a light lunch service once we had ordered poor staff slow to assist. 
"Written July 2, 2019",Guided,Whilst the free guided tour may be a bit 'slower' its free and I find that it intrigues you more than one of the paid tours.
"Written July 2, 2019",Amazing! ,"Thw National Gallery is a magical place. The art is simply exquisite, there is something for every taste. You could get lost, spend hours and hours. Always free entrance. Amazing. "
"Written July 2, 2019",Italian Renaissance,"Recently I went with a group of friends to see the Italian paintings at the National Gallery. Although I live in London and have visited the Gallery many times it doesn't stop to surprise me. Every time I go it's as if I am there for the first time and the Italian paintings have something special about them. If you have time, I recommend going. It's one of those things that has to be done, though it might be a Marmite story."
"Written July 2, 2019",A great haven in Trafalgar Square,I am a regular at the National Gallery when I am in London-- my favorite museum there. This restaurant is a great place to take a break before venturing on to more museum or out to Trafalgar Square and beyond. Service is excellent and the food is very good.
"Written July 2, 2019",amazing Place,Went to London with my Gran-daughters  and this was our favorite Place. Great to visit National Gallery  
"Written July 2, 2019",One of my favorite museums in London,"It is an excellent museum, obviously. My main advice: take one of the free guided tours. Did this once and was blown away. The tour guide had a PhD in art history, was clearly into the topic and showed us a selection of five key paintings. The tour went for around two hours and it was the best visit of a museum I ever had."
"Written July 1, 2019",wonderful views from the cafe and great place to loose a few hours,The cafe looks over the london skyline and is a hidden gem.  The galleries are full of iconic and historic painting that you can wanter through for hours on end
"Written July 1, 2019",Must Do!,"Located just by Trafalgar Square this gallery offers free admission.  We were there when it opened, so did not deal with any lines of people, just walked right in. A good variety of paintings that should suit all tastes.  Take some time in your schedule to stop by this wonderful gallery.  "
"Written July 1, 2019",Lap it up and please donate,"Such an encyclopaedia of art work. Something for every taste and so many different experiences.Put aside at least half a day to wander around this great example of free, yes free, hospitality and entertainment. To use a pun, its a feast of art and culture that only places such as this can serve up.Enough of the hairy fairy stuff, this is really one of the cultural experiences you must visit in London.  :)Enjoy and donate so everybody else can keep enjoying after you've been"
"Written June 30, 2019",Fantastic,"We hadn’t planned on visiting but we were walking by and it was an admission free day so we decided to go in. It was fantastic. We’ve been to multiple museums in the US, Greece and France. This one was as equally impressive, having works from not only the masters like Leonardo Da Vinci, Caravaggio and Rafael, but impressionista like Monet and Renoir, and several Van Gogh paintings. It was wonderful. "
"Written June 30, 2019",A Must Do!,"The collection is intense and rich. The audioguide is quite well done, though frequent volume adjustments are necessary. Works seem to be moved often making it hard to find certain works or to follow a pre-arranged plan. There appears to be only one docent-led tour a day and it covers only a few highlights, so be sure not to miss it. With the purchase of the audio guide, you can get a listing of the 40 or so most well known Masterworks in the collection. It will take half a day to find each of those, and listen to the accompanying audioguide, but I found that the most productive way to visit, even though about 15% of the works were not in the rooms identified on the guide. Most of the room security personnel were familiar enough with the plan to be able to point you to rooms where items had been moved.Guards will begin moving you out of rooms at about 20 to 15 minutes before closing time, but they do so in a fairly gentle and respectful way. ""This way, m'love"" is not such a bad way to be herded!Temperature from room to room was good and the almost-adequate number of benches throughout the galleries was appreciated. "
"Written June 30, 2019",We only had an hour but saw as much as we could.,Overwhelmingly beautiful art. Also something always going on in front of museum. Free entry made it possible to pop in when we were short on time.
"Written June 30, 2019",Vacation,I visited this place with my friends last week. This is the best gallery present in the London. It is must see place in London
"Written June 29, 2019",You can understand why it's crowded,"I'll need to return when I'm not riding herd on a bunch of students as a chaperone on a school trip (and when I'm smart enough to spend a couple euro on a map). Despite having to split my attention and not having enough time to properly experience the museum, the work and the setting it was displayed in were both impressive."
"Written June 29, 2019",Amazing Art,This is an amazing art museum with many famous paintings from the great masters.Great for any art lover
"Written June 29, 2019",Best free thing in London,So much to see but must see the impressionist rooms for the extraordinary collection there; all those calendar and card images come to reality!Great shops too.

(Since 1824, )it houses a collection of over 2,000 unique paintings dating from the mid-13th century to the year 1900. National Gallery is the most visited art museum by visitors annually ."
"Written July 9, 2019",Free entry for famous paintings,"Take time to look around paintings by historic artists. It is a place you won't miss in central London as it is next to important landmarks and places like Trafalgar Square, Soho, China town and West End theatres."
"Written July 9, 2019",Sorolla,"Fabulous, lovely groupings and lighting . Go early to avoid the crowds. Lunch in the Gallery restaurant was excellent. "
"Written July 8, 2019",Love the paintings.,"We have been to National Gallery several times in the past, but this is the first time our young adult children have been here.  They were truly impressed with the architecture and the paintings displayed.  Favorites are Turner and Constable as well as Van Gogh and Gainsborough.  It is morning or afternoon well spent looking at these treasures."
"Written July 8, 2019",Sorolla 5*,"Unforgettable, mesmerizing, those sunlights... the paintings of Spanish artist Sorolla are the unique I have ever seen."
"Written July 7, 2019",Fantastic Place,A iconic building with wonderful pieces of Art. Make sure you don't miss the massive picture of the horse. Also some wonderful pieces from Monet.
"Written July 7, 2019",Worth seeing,Some of the best paintings that I have seen in my life. Well worth the price of the tour but there is also a free tour at two o' clock.
"Written July 7, 2019",Beautiflu,"Lots of stairs, beautiful art. Very wide range of styles and artists and eras. The gallery itself is beautiful and very grand. Great option for a cheap/free trip."
"Written July 7, 2019",Great paintings,Wonderful collection of art over the centuries. We visit here as often as we can. We just love walking around and admire the great painters and their fantastic works. Had a fabulous time here.
"Written July 6, 2019",How painting progress in the last 1000 years,There is a free tour at 14.00 at the foyer just behind the reception at the sainsbury wing.  It is only one hour long but the tour provide interesting insight about a few of the different paintings.
"Written July 5, 2019",So much to see and it is for free!,"While everyone always thinks of the British Museum when it comes to London, they shouldn't forget about the National Gallery, which is without a doubt on the same level in its own genre.With free admission (though donations are encouraged), the National Gallery offers hours of enjoyment with an expansive collection of paintings. The setting is excellent, and the building really offers the right kind of context for enjoying such a fine selection that stretches through several centuries.With both great architecture and art, you can't really go wrong by choosing to spend three or four hours here."
"Written June 21, 2019",Outstanding in every way.,Very nice museum. A must-see if you are in London for more than a day or two. The paintings are right out of your old art history textbook.
"Written June 21, 2019",always visit,when I'm in London I always try to make sure that I stop here for at least a quick visit. I believe that they close late on Wednesdays
"Written June 21, 2019",Outside the National Gallery 06.07.19 14.00 Stand Up for Assange Protest,"A great place for a protest outside the National Gallery.  Stand Up for Julian Assange 6th July 2019 14.00. is another opportunity to participate. This is a wide open space and so it will offer lots of room for protesting. The last protest there on 01/06/19 looked great, however the space could accommodate loads more people!"
"Written June 21, 2019",- Our first stop in London-,-There is something for everyone at the National gallery.There are audio tours & worth going in for the lovers & students of Art.
"Written June 19, 2019",Huge Gallery,"We stopped in after shopping because it was on the way to our hotel.   I was hesitant to go because I thought it was just going to be a bunch of old paintings.  Well, while I wasn’t totally wrong, the volume and variety of paintings was pretty impressive.  In fact there is so much to see, they have computer terminals set up so you can quickly find the person or artist that interests you.  A lot of the museum is set up by dates or time periods.  Yes, its “free” to get in but like most of the museums, they ask for a $5 donation.  I think we zipped through in 1/2 hour because it wasn’t a planned stop, but I can see how someone could easily spend well over 2 hours. Especially if you had some kind of tour.  It’s certainly a one of a kind collection."
"Written June 19, 2019",Great and diverse art collection,"Large but worth some time! We particularly enjoyed the impressionists, and as is often the case with European museums, even the building is worth seeing!"
"Written June 19, 2019",Great experience,Wonderful displays. Elegant settling and not over crowded even on a Saturday. Wonderful amount of truly famous artist. Some fun hands on art work as well.
"Written June 19, 2019",Plan your visit,"There is just too much here to see in one go, so plan your visit. Check online before you go to identify which periods, rooms you want to visit and take your time there. It is free so you can always take a break in Trafalgar Square and go back in afterwards."
"Written June 18, 2019",Returned after 15 years,I love this gallery. We went two days in a row & could't get enough of it. Entrance is free & there are guides or you can use audio headsets
"Written June 18, 2019",Very interesting,"My son and I wandered around in here for z while. Neither of us knows much about art per say, but we found some of the paintings interesting, particularly some of the still lifes and the unfinished paintings. I good place to visit whether you're an art boffin or just vaguely interested.... "
"Written June 23, 2019",Wonderful Impressionist paintings,"I am not an aficionado of art but, having a couple of hours to spare, wandered in from Leicester Square to pass some time. I am so pleased I did! I was especially intrigued by the Impressionist collection. So many of the painitngs are well known, but the difference between prints and photographs and the original paintings was amazing. The collection of Monets and Renoirs in particular enchanted me. I was also very taken with Seurat's pointillism technique- up close thousands of dots, take a step back and it transforms into wonderful coherent pictures. So many other paintings I could highlight, but each to their own appreciation!I did not find the gallery easy to navigate, even with the map (£2). I look forward to returning to the gallery again- amazingly it is free to visit."
"Written June 23, 2019",Great Collection!,"I wasn't super happy with the organization (rooms sometimes run together and not in any planned way), but the collection itself was nice. Many historical portraits for British history, but there were also a decent number of modern pieces, which I loved!"
"Written June 23, 2019",Very interesting,"A lovely attraction, very interesting.  Quite hard to navigate in places but recommended nonetheless. "
"Written June 23, 2019",Always worth a visit,"I come here whenever I'm in London - it's always worth a browse and, of course, the special exhibitions are excellent."
"Written June 22, 2019",So many Monets,I am a huge fan of Monet and other Impressionists.  It was so great to see so many.  I was a bit disappointed that the Van Gough Sunflowers painting was moved to a different museum.
"Written June 22, 2019",So much better than the Louvre!!,If you are taking a European trip to see art this is a must see.  We spent a day here and could have stayed much longer.  The museum is not over crowded.  It is also quiet and has a lovely cafe inside.  The art will knock your socks off.  Security was quick and efficient.  If you are debating here or the Louvre be sure to come here.  The difference in your experience of the art is 100% better.
"Written June 22, 2019",Broad collection very well presented.,"Although entrance is free a donation of 10 £, $ or € is recommended and the visit more than justifies it. The collection is logically laid out with clear signage enabling either a focused visit or a more leisurely browse through the ages. Headphones are available for £5 although most of the signage is informative. The collection is extremely broad with an excellent representation of artists, styles and periods.A great way to pass a few hours. Highly recommended. "
"Written June 22, 2019",Stunning works you must see,Best single artist exhibition in years. His use of light is amazing and capture of movement quite astonishing. Other remarkable feature is range of compositions.
"Written June 21, 2019",Truelly magnificent masterpieces.......,"The National Gallery in London houses a vast collection of I international art from all the great masters, we particularly wanted to see John Constables The Haywagon and it did not dissapoint. From Monet, Picasso, Sisley and all the greats to an amazing collection of Byzantine religious art there is something for everyone. Located in Trafalgar square its good to get there at opening time as it gets very crowded around midday. Great gift shop too to take home a special memory. *****"

"Written June 11, 2019",Sorolla - Master Of Light,"£16 including a £2 charity contribution added to the £14 rail travel card plus a £27 lunch, made for a nice trip into Town.Fortunately Tuesday at 11am was not too busy, so room to have a seat and contemplate - also to read the large print 'manual' picture descriptions.Tip - just right if you gave an hour to spare."
"Written June 11, 2019",Must visit,The gallery exhibits many amazing and important paintings so it will take some time to see it all. If you don't have a lot of time just walk through the gallery and glance at all of its beauties. Another option is to do it in bits and pieces - see one part then come back the other day. It is free so it wouldn't be a problem to get back in.
"Written June 11, 2019",Beautiful but crowded...,Been there more than once. Bit too crowded but still a beautiful and iconic place. Mandatory for people visiting London.

"Written June 10, 2019",Fabulous Sorolla Exhibition,Went to the Sorolla Exhibition in the Sainsbury wing with a group as I'm copying one of his works.  A truly amazing exhibition from an artist who is not well enough known in the UK.  The Spanish Master of Light is a true description.
"Written June 9, 2019",Amazing Collection,"We had a fantastic time at the National Gallery.  The Sorolla exhibit is amazing and was a highlight of our entire trip.  His collection of works are unbelievably brilliant and not to be missed.  The permanent collection is of course fantastic with works by DaVinci (virgin of the rocks), Monet, Cezzanne (Bathers), and Degas (ballet dancers) to name a few. "
"Written June 9, 2019",The art blew me away!,"What a fantastic art museum. We spent a couple hours here last week and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We needed more time but had other things on our list so we saw the highlights. I’d like to go back someday. There is something here for everyone. London has many great museums, hard to pick a favorite, but this is one of mine. My kids (13 & 16) liked it too. "
"Written June 9, 2019",A must when in London,"Lots of schools of art and history throughout the rooms. Although most of the rooms are free entry, exhibitions by renowned contemporary and international artists are usually at a fee. Good for the kids, the family, the tourists and even when flying solo!"
"Written June 9, 2019",All the Classic Painters and Right on Trafalgar,First of all you get to see Trafalgar square as you approach the museum and there is always something happening. The day we went it was street painting. Second the museum is unbelievably FREE. They had works from all the old masters from Monet and DaVinci to the beautiful Turners. Loved the grand layout and the interesting mosaic tiles in the entry.
"Written June 18, 2019","Sorolla, Spanish Master of Light (National Gallery, London)",A truly magnificent exhibition by a much underrated Spanish artist. His mastery of light is unsurpassed. He also displays great humanity and an empathy with the human condition. Do not miss this opportunity to see this first major Sorolla exhibition in the UK since 1908.TV
"Written June 18, 2019",Enjoyable 45 minutes ,"Ratings for art galleries vary and for me it was less about the exhibits and more about  my need to see and understand art.I can assume someone educated in viewing art can spend hours here and rate this 5 stars.For me the challenge was the lack of clear demarcation of artists and eras. The fine prints near the paintings made it difficult .Of course if you purchase a guide book , which we didn’t, it may get easier .Like I wanted to see Vincent Van Gogh paintings and since I’m uneducated in his works just went past till I searched and retracted my steps.However the gallery seems to house the best art in UK and being free also gets a lot of footfalls.The museum shops were nice as well. Wish they had many more poster reprints ."
"Written June 18, 2019",Fantastic and Free,World class art museum.  This is a must go for art lovers.  An incredible collection with something for everyone from Byzantine to Modern with many Renaissance and Impressionist paintings.  Highly Recommended.

"Written June 13, 2019",Amazing collection if you get the audio guide,"The National Gallery deserves its reputation as an amazing, extensive art collection. One tip, however: the map, which is way overpriced, is completely adequate. It gives the lay-out of the rooms and their numbers, but it gives no information about where various works are. The audio guide, however, is excellent, and it includes a map that lists famous works and their room numbers and has a clear map of the layout of the rooms. With the audio guide, this is a wonderful art museum and is a must-see, if one is visiting London."
"Written June 13, 2019","The More I Learn of Art, the More I Appreciate the National Gallery","From Holbeins to Seurat to Da Vinci, there are works of art to be cherished.  The staff is very well versed on what is where and more than willing to help you find the artist or painting that you want to see in person."
"Written June 13, 2019",My favourite gallery,A fantastic collection of classical paintings. Plenty of places to sit a really contemplate the artworks. You get a good sense of chronology too. Had cake and tea in the restaurant. Lovely
"Written June 13, 2019",PICTURE RESTAURANT,"Take a short walk to the national portrait gallery (next door) and go to the top floor for the cafe restaurant. It has one of the best views of London looking over the dome of the gallery, nelsons column and then Big Ben in the distance. At Christmas you’ll see the Christmas tree too. Lovely day or evening. Last orders in kitchen at 8:00pm. Bon appetite."

This museum houses a collection exceeding 2,300 painting from the 13th century to the 19th century.  While admission is free, people entering this great art museum are strongly encouraged to make a donation.

Loved especially the Turner, Stubbs and an Australian artist, Stretton, I think, who I had never seen before. Lovely view of a bay and cliffs with a vivid blue sky.

"Written June 18, 2019",Interesting but,Free to go in but disappointed they were asking £19 for one exhibition and £17 for another so we saw neither. What a shame but lots of other items to see. Makes sense to plan in advance rather than just wonder around

"Written June 17, 2019",Just go!,"Great works of art to see for free! You'd be foolish to miss it. You won't like it all - but even if you only like one painting what have you to lose? And if you like art, go on one of the free (This is London - FREE!) guided tours. You will enjoy it.PS Couples/family/friends/solo. All of those."
"Written June 17, 2019",Full of fantastic works of art,Easy to get around and full of wonderful surprises as well as the most famous works.Can't do it justice in one visit as there is so much to see.
"Written June 16, 2019",Amazing collection!,"What a fabulous gallery, and how wonderful that it's free of charge. Special exhibits have a cost, and they are well worth it."
"Written June 26, 2019",Excellent gallery ,"For a major art museum the National Gallery is actually quite small. But the collection is well curated and contains incredible pieces of art. For the cost of entry ($0, but donations are encouraged) it’s hard to bit the value of this attraction. Surprisingly, even though it’s located on the busy Trafalgar Square, the gallery was not crowded and fairly quiet. Definitely recommended.."
"Written June 25, 2019",Sorolla exhibition,This small exhibition is currently on in the Sainsbury wing of the National Gallery. It's wonderful! And such good value too!
"Written June 25, 2019",National Gallery: Big but nice,"When visiting the National Gallery, I recommend choosing a few paintings to view, and leave it at that. Do some online research beforehand to single out the artists and paintings you'd like to see. Otherwise, you could spend an entire day there (fine if you plan to be in London for a few weeks, but not for 5-6 days)."
"Written June 24, 2019",Great Gallery,Dropped by here on a whim. Great Gallery in the middle of town. Nice and cool on a sunny day and fun of amazing art.
"Written June 24, 2019",World class art museum that won’t break the budget,"Where else can you see works by Leonardo, Monet, Raphael, Michelangelo, etc for free? Security was QUICK, the restroom clean and air conditioned and dry!!! It’s a world class art display that you shouldn’t miss especially on a hot (or more likely) rainy day. A+!"

"Written June 24, 2019",Must see,Hadn't been here for years but it's just as good as ever. Absolutely stunning paintings in such a beautiful building. Helpful staff when we needed directions. A bit of a maze and would definitely try to get a floor plan if visiting again. Lots of famous paintings that are easily recognised. Quite tiring as lots of walking but there are some benches to sit. Added bonus is that there's no entrance fee. Really recommend.
"Written June 23, 2019",Fantastic and Free!,It's a can't miss if you go to London. Go early to avoid the worst of the crowds bu it's always busy.Check what current paid exhibition is available and book for these.
"Written June 23, 2019",MUST GO IF YOU LIKE ART AT ALL,This museum is massive with everything for anyone's particular taste.  It's free so you might as well go.  I would choose going to this place over the more touristy things like going on the London Eye.  
"Written June 23, 2019",The Sorolla exhibition is a must,"The Gallery is so vast that you can't really take it all in during one visit, so we decided to concentrate on the Sorolla Exhibition which finishes in a few weeks. It was well worth the visit. The only problem was that to appreciate his painting, you need to stand far back and that was difficult to do as the gallery was quite crowded. "
"Written June 9, 2019",my wife love it,we loved the whole city... this is one of my wife favorite places we enjoyed our time there and would love to get back soon
"Written June 9, 2019",Sarolla exhibition,"The most wonderful paintings, but the rooms were too small, so difficult to get far enough back to view properly - luckily not too crowded when we arrived, but became crowded, and difficult to enjoy the pictures "
"Written June 9, 2019",Dutch masters,Short visit with free access to this museum in order to see an exhibition of Dutch and Flemish masters from the years between 1500-1900.  I found it very well presented and worthwhile. I have one little criticism: the layout and route through the various rooms was a trifle chaotic. But all-in-all very enjoyable.

"Written June 7, 2019",Free Gallery!,"In all of our visits, we had never gone inside the National Gallery.  It takes up the entire north side of Trafalgar Square.  The building is just stunning.  It houses one of the finest collections of Western European paintings in the world from around 1250 onwards.  Its masterpieces include artworks from arts such as Botticelli, Titian, Raphael, Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Hogarth, and Gainsborough.  The National Gallery was established for the benefit of all, not just the privileged.  It has always been committed to maintaining free admission as well as keeping a central London location with access for everyone.  Pay particular attention to the floors – the mosaics are exquisite and don’t miss the dome. We happened to be there when they had a small, but delightful exhibition by Boilly – Scenes of Parisians Life.  And, take the time to go around the corner and visit the National Portrait Gallery which is also free."
"Written June 16, 2019",Art and lunch,You can spend hours here or just a quick visit.   Ditch the friends who are not interested and enjoy yourself!  Also a great place for a quick lunch.

"Written June 14, 2019",Excellent for a treasure hunt!,"A separate company organises treasure/clue hunts using an app and it makes the experience super fun if museums aren't normally your thing! You then appreciate what you are looking at, and this museum has it all!"
"Written June 28, 2019",Very nice Gallery indeed,"Easy to find by  red bus or walkingto the heart of London, the paintings come from all over the world, and should be savoured,  we keep coming back. Many galleries have comfortable seating, so take a seat and watch others enjoying these."

"Written June 6, 2019",The best museum,"There is a lot of paintings and some rooms about oil paintings. Different rooms have different styles of oil painting, and each painting has its own characteristics. There are two paintings that interest me very much. One of the painting is a pink beach and a blue sea. When I saw it I felt very romantic.I went to the National Gallery by Bakerloo Line of Underground. I exited at Charing Cross station. If you are hungry you will find a coffee shop and you can buy some bread. And you can take some photos nearby National Gallery. Because, in front of it is a large square and a beautiful fountain and sculpture."

In this wonderful painting Mars is asleep and unarmed, while Venus is awake and alert. The meaning of the painting is that love conquers war, or love conquers all...!"
"Written June 5, 2019",Worth a gander,"The national gallery has a terrific variety of artwork, and one can spend many an hour there. The art however is very 'classical', by which I mean there are lots of portraits and landscapes, and not much in the way of current art.But, worth a gander."
"Written June 5, 2019",Great visit,Exhibitions and just the main ongoing ones are great - I recommend membership if you enjoy this sort of thing!
"Written May 26, 2019",Beautiful place,"Have not been here since I was a child. The different rooms with so many amazing pictures were incredible, with paintings that showed what people wore and did 300-500 years ago. Love that Rembrandt really was the earliest king of the selfie! So wonderful to see Picasso, Monet, Degas and many more."
"Written May 26, 2019",Excellent art gallery,"A beautiful collection of art from all over the world, in great depth.  Tastefully displayed, easy to access by tube or bus.  A terrific experience that filled our eyes and our souls."
"Written May 26, 2019",A major national treasure,"We have visited the National Gasllery on many occasions, the paintings collection is beyond compare.Our last visit early in May for theSorolla exebition, a superb display of this outstanding Spanish painters work, beautyifully annotated and explained and a delight to see.Their shop with its vast array of books is a delight."
"Written May 26, 2019",Afternoon Visit to the Gallery,"It was stunning to see art works by some of the greatest, most famous artists in the world! Museum was clean and staff was friendly. The fact that it is free was definitely a bonus!"
"Written May 26, 2019",Nothing compares to it,"The greatest museum in the world, according to my taste, having a bit of everything and every period as far as paintings go..."
"Written May 25, 2019",Big gallery,I spent 9 hours to look all pictures and status with amazing history behind. You we love it to visit.
"Written May 25, 2019",Amazing,"Every visitor to London should take the time to visit this amazing gallery. To stand one foot away from these wonderful paintings by people such as Leonardo da Vinci, Matisse,Botticelli is a once in a lifetime experience.No problem taking non flash photos and many people were."
"Written May 24, 2019",Wonderful gallery,"We saw Sorolla here.  Very nice exhibit, though very small and crowded. If you go in the morning you can stay all day but as of a certain hour they no longer allow entry until 2 pm, to monitor the number of people. Made it worse. Everyone poured in at the same 4 hour period. I found 16 pounds a bit much for the very small exhibit. But the paintings were extraordinary and much of the remaining gallery pieces are worth seeing, gratis. "
"Written May 22, 2019","Oh, the art!!","It's just mind-boggling the level of detail and deep saturated colors in art that is literally hundreds and hundreds of years old. Talent like that just isn't seen these days, and these artists didn't have technologically advanced mediums and supplies. Be sure not to miss the greats, especially the Davinci Room. (I'm not going to lie, though... I have NO idea what was so special about Van Gogh.)"
"Written May 22, 2019",The gallery to go to,I recently went with my partner and regularly return when I have a free moment. Would recommend going in the evening or during the week when it is slightly less busy as it is packed otherwise. 
"Written May 29, 2019",Always a sure bet,"Great place to visit as it holds a large number of terrific works from the likes of Cézanne, Constable, Monet, Degas, and Van Gogh. Free entry but well worth a donation."
"Written May 29, 2019",Just One More Time,"The perfect museum experience if you can visit time & time again. I’m lucky to live near London, and I come to the BM nearly every time I come into London to meet friends later in the day.My concentration, and my feet, last for about 2 hours so today it was The Parthenon and a few extra bits. If you want to get the most of your visit, it’s worth reading the plaques in each of the exhibit rooms - unless you’ve invested in the headphones.There’s far too much to see if you’re here for just one visit, so my advice would be to have a look at the list of all the rooms & periods covered; then just focus on what appeals to you the most. There’s lots of restaurants and fast food places to eat nearby, so don’t feel obliged to eat in the museum restaurant if it’s rather crowded.Today it’s cool and raining a little, so the museum was packed: it’s free to enter (donations gratefully received) so you don’t feel guilty by leaving after just a couple of hours - like me!"
"Written May 29, 2019",Extraordinary place to visit,"The first thing to note about the gallery is that it is huge. We were keen to see a Da Vinci painting and were directed to gallery 66. That gives you some idea of the scale.We found the staff friendly and knowledgeable and with a sense of humour: when we asked an attendant if we could take a photo he said “Yes, where would you like me to stand”!The other impressive aspect as that despite admission being free, and being a public holiday, access was very easy and there were only minor queues.An interesting feature of the gallery is engagement with school children. Currently there is a display about children’s responses to a particular piece of artwork. A very clever idea.We only had a spare couple of hours but you could easily spend a day here.Highly recommended."
"Written May 28, 2019",Always a great visit,Well organized. Free. Some great works of art with a diverse collection. Vermeer. Monet. Bosch. Big crowds but art was still easily viewable 
"Written May 28, 2019",Get your walking shoes ready,The building is pretty large with a variety of paintings. Be prepared to walk around quite a bit. Great experience though. 
"Written May 28, 2019",Amazing!,"Didn’t have much time in London so had to choose, and I chose well. This is an amazing gallery, one could easily spend half a day here. "
"Written May 28, 2019",I live in Central London and love the National Gallery,The every changing shows add to the amazing permanent exhibits. This is also my favourite place to buy gifts for friends at home and abroad.
"Written May 28, 2019",Excellent exhibition,"Visited yesterday for the 'Sorolla, Spanish Master of Light' exhibition. It was excellent. I was somewhat familiar with Sorolla but this exhibition was a great introduction and further analysis of his work.The exhibition was not busy at all, which was surprising given that it was a sunday, but London didn't seem very busy in the streets or in the Underground.I've already booked tickets for 2 more exhibitions at National Gallery and I look forward to them at the finest gallery in London."
"Written May 28, 2019",Good for a rainy day,Lots to see and take in so give it plenty of time or break it up over a number of visits.Good idea to invest in a guidebook to help interpret the paintings.
"Written May 27, 2019",A huge variety of art,Nice museum with a broad range of art.There as are most of London's museums is a good one. There are some exhibits that are at an extra charge.
"Written May 31, 2019",Art at its finest,"I like to,spend only 1-2 hours at a museum, see a limited amount and come again. You could spend a week here. The collection is extensive. This visit I enjoyed rooms devoted to late 19th century. The museum is arranged so wel its easily to find what you want to see. The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. The rooms are large and paintings displayed so they are easy to see and enjoy. Whatever period or genre of art you and enjoy it here."
"Written May 31, 2019",The best in the World,"There can be no doubt that this gallery is the best in the world for its contents, it’s history and the means that anyone can go in as it is free of charge as it should be "
"Written May 31, 2019",Amazing!,"Amazing place, with free entry. You could easily spend hours in here looking at all of the different exhibits. "
"Written May 31, 2019",Great repository of English art,Large collection of art through the centuries. Recommend concentrating on impressionists and 18th century. 
"Written May 31, 2019","Wonderful holdings, so much to see, so good!","My wife and I visited this fabulous gallery around 2pm on a Saturday in April 2019.  The holdings here are unbelievable and it was a delight to walk the galleries, encountering one treasure after another.  There are paintings you will recognize instantly, including huge painted altarpieces and other delights.  There is superior sculpture.  We spent just over 2 hours here, and that was not enough.  It was what our end-of-a-week-of-tourist-walking feet could handle.  More rested, we think 3-4 hours would be better.  We left a $20 donation, and, at that, this was still a great value.  We saw the Tate Britain and the Tate Modern and those two museums combined don’t equal this one.  If you are only visiting one art museum during your time in London, make this the one!"
"Written May 31, 2019",A nice indoor diversion ,We came in from the rain and marvel at the variety and quality of the collection. Plus friendly docent helped guide us. 
"Written May 31, 2019",The museum to go if you love art or want a glimpse of it,"*** Tips included here ***It's free and huge, you can spend there few hours or less, depends on how much you like to see art.The museum has wonderful paintings from all eras, famous artists, known paintings and many other treasures. If you like classic art, it's the place for you, no doubts.Entrance: pay attention that sometimes the entry is from the left side of the museum which means from Sainsbury Wing and not from Trafalgar directly.  Crowd: There are always many people, doesn't matter when you come, cause it's a great place to get your art portion. However, you can see the paintings peacefully, don't worry about that. Eating: the museum has a restaurant and a cheaper cafeteria where you can sit and eat in a nice atmosphere. Cloakroom: pay attention- each item you give them, coasts 2 pounds to keep.Photos: allowed, everybody take pictures there. Children: you can take your children, however try to look for activities related to them, it's a big museum and they might get tired after few hours unless you make few breaks for them."
"Written May 30, 2019","Sorolla, Spanish Master of Light","What a wonderful exhibition  of works by Sorolla, the amazing Spanish artist who can capture light in his pictures like no other!  Well done National Gallery for staging this exhibition of his work, the first in Britain for a century.  It should do much to promote his reputation here."
"Written May 30, 2019",One of the world's best cultural destinations,"Located at the very heart of London, looming impressively over Trafalgar Square, this is a must see attraction if visiting London. Being free, I used to pop in for 20 minutes when working near by. The building itself is extremely impressive, but the paintings on display are amongst the finest collections of art in the world. Can get bust with groups, but the gallery is large enough that you can try to navigate away from them and then reurn to the paitings you want to see."
"Written May 29, 2019",Treasures,"We spent an afternoon at the National Gallery, a museum we have visited often, but not recently.While the organization of the galleries is still a bit difficult to decipher, the paintings are beautifully displayed and well lit.Unless you are a regular visitor, I would strongly recommend you rent the audio guide."

"Written May 16, 2019",Seeing Priceless Originals,"This place is awe-inspiring to me.  Just to look at the original paintings, not copies or prints is worth the visit.  I could spend hours here.  One could do it justice with a visit of about two hours, I think."

"Written May 16, 2019","Great location, lovely paintings",Right in Trafalgar Square so great location.  Its free to enter (a donation is optional) and the paintings are great.  Lots of famous artists and a lovely art gallery.
"Written May 16, 2019",Some beautiful art and excellent tourguide,"I joined the 2 PM free public tour and the tourguide was very lively, engaging, and passionate about the artwork. The tour had about 30 adults and somehow my friend and I were quietly chatting when we were walking to the next art stop, and lost the entire group. Anyhow, not a problem as there were particular eras we really wanted to spend time with so we made our way to those spots and took our time there. Sound absorption acoustic-wise was not great so loud people, adults and children, detracted from my fuller enjoyment of this museum, but I suppose that cannot be helped. (?) Pleasant, sweet cafe staff."
"Written May 15, 2019",No entrance fee for an amazing gallery,A great gallery filled with everything in the world of art...........all the old masters as well as modern impressionists. Don't miss this national treasure.
"Written May 14, 2019",For art lovers ,If you are an art lover you will love it! The gallery exhibits many amazing and important paintings so it will take some time to see it all. If you don't have a lot of time just walk through the gallery and glance at all of its beauties. Another option is to do it in bits and pieces - see one part then come back the other day. It is free so it wouldn't be a problem to get back in.
"Written May 14, 2019",If you need to escape from the craziness,"I will always be in love with the National Gallery. It has so many fond memories for me but my most treasured is when a VIP friend was visiting from overseas, We didn't have much cash to splurge and I wanted to show him round the city but didn't want the madness of Oxford Street and the like. Because he was an art lover I decided to take him to the NG. The rain outside made it an even better choice. We spent the afternoon in awe of all the magnificent paintings and totally lost ourselves in the atmosphere of the place. When we finally came out, it felt as if we had been in a strange time warp and were totally relaxed.I highly recommend this place if you need to escape from the madness of the city. I'm so grateful that places like this exist and the most wonderful thing is that it is still free of charge to get in. What more could you ask for! I would recommend this gallery to everyone."
"Written May 13, 2019",Beautiful,Most of the collection is free so you can enjoy at bit at a time. the national gallery also organised special exhibition and those are charged for. I went to see the Corolla one and it was fantastic. the paintings were great and set up fantastic as usual

It is a great way to spend a few hours and get inspired.  Then step out and you are in Tralfargar Square in the heart of all the action.  It is a nice mix of things to experience."
"Written June 4, 2019",Best collections,Collection of pictures that make you say Whaow! in infinite numbers of times.  From ancient to modern interests you've got a surprise for you there
"Written June 4, 2019",British Museum,Amazing museum - full of brilliant antiquities. It is well laid-out and there is always something new to see.
"Written June 4, 2019",Really impressive,"Well worth the visit. Art galleries are a must if you are a tourist. Staff very helpful, toilet facilities clean and many different artists work displayed. "
"Written June 4, 2019",A blast viewing great art,I love spending long hours in this facility just absorbing the atmosphere and relishing the pure artistic talent on display.
"Written June 4, 2019",Luminous Sorolla exhibition ,"No wonder this artist was nicknamed the Spanish Master of Light. The paintings in this wonderful exhibition are so clean and so clear, they’re a joy to look at. Can’t believe I didn’t know about his work but I do now and I shall be back for a second look. It’s always a good sign when you come out of an exhibition but knowing which of many favourites is the best. I also spent some time upstairs in the Sainsbury wing looking at the permanent display of mediaeval European religious art. More artistic delights!"
"Written June 4, 2019",Unmissable,It's such a luxury to have free access to museums like this in London. I enjoyed my visit so much and recommend it to everyone.
"Written June 3, 2019",Great,Such a mesmerized it was in the national gallery one of the best gallary in the London great monuments there lovely feeling
"Written May 22, 2019",Afternoon visit,"My wife really enjoyed it and it’s free! It takes the whole afternoon to view them all. There are small rooms tucked away, so take your time to ensure you don’t miss any."
"Written May 22, 2019",Wow..,"It is a great place to visit...with the European arts, hundreds of art created by the best of best.. "
"Written May 21, 2019",Extensive art display.,We ventured through the different rooms showing the massive array of art. The staff were very attentive and helpful.
"Written May 20, 2019","Too crowded, staff not so nice","So many of the greats are here including Van Gogh's Sunflowers and his Chair as well as Constable's Haywain. Should be a limit to how many people are in the gallery, too crowded."
"Written May 19, 2019",Many Delights,"The National Gallery has a nice collection, a big collection, a developed collection.  However, it isn't huge (which makes it manageable) and no one aspect of the collection seems to dominate the others.  Just remember that the bulk of the British collection and the Modern collection have been moved to the two Tates, British and Modern respectively.  The Dutch masters and the Impressionists are most memorably represented, and the Renaissance collections will draw Monty Python fans to find ""the foot"" -- hint: it's in the lower left hand corner of the work opposite the entry to Room 8.  On the weight of this alone it is worth a trip to the museum.  While the floor plan isn't absolutely intuitive -- the building looks so balanced from the outside, but doesn't seem so inside -- the majority, if not the totality of the collection is on one floor.The espresso bar does a nice cuppa, but I might have thought that it would be more visually pleasing for an art gallery of this callibre.  Cafe lunch (self-serve) was not the absolute usual fare, but was a bit weary in quality, even by museum standards and the seating area is small (the espresso bar's seating seemed bigger) meaning that while others were lingering over brochures, the elderly members of my party were trying to balance themselves on high stools at the bar.  Overall, the cafe is not welcoming.Despite the lacking room in the cafe, the rest of the museum was not terribly busy here on a Sunday in May.  It was easy and pleasant to engage the art.  Overall, it was a good day trip, especially when combined with the National Portrait Gallery just steps away."
"Written May 19, 2019",So much to see,There is a great deal to see and very busy. It is often too crowded to appreciate the works of art as galleries are cluttered by visitors with back packs and prams taking selfies in front of the great works.It pays to plan your visit carefully and leave plenty of time. The maps and signage are not very good.Lunch in Galleries cafe was very good with good service.
"Written May 19, 2019",Great to visit even if you are short on time,It’s free to enter. Always has street performers in front to entertain. Great art on the inside. Even if you only have an hour it’s worth a visit 
"Written May 18, 2019",Wonderful experience ,"We visited The National Gallery museum and it was a fantastic experience, but the building wasn’t so big as my expectations. "
"Written May 18, 2019",Famous paintings throughout,Art is subjective. I had a look around along with many many others and saw plenty of famous art. Is it worth the huge sums of money? Does it matter though?
"Written May 17, 2019",Visit to National Gallery,An excellent visit looking at a huge selection of paintings from so many artists in history and more....also an excellent choice of places within to eat and drink and not expensive.
"Written May 13, 2019",Amazing Art Collection,"As with many museums, it is impossible to see everything even if you spend all day for several days.  There are many great pieces here so I'd suggest you check the internet for the top 10-20 ""must see"" pieces of art housed here.  With that info, you can easily plan your visit and at least not miss the most outstanding pieces.  Admission is free.  Front opens at Trafalgar Square where there are usually buskers playing and much going on. Across the small side street is St. Martins in the Field church and next to it is the National Portrait Gallery.  A nice way to spend a full day in this areas of London."
"Written May 13, 2019",Beautiful works of art-fee free to jump around ,"This museum is gorgeous. The mosaic floor alone is worth a trip. If you have a personal preference in art periods, I’d recommend just jumping around to that gallery. "
"Written May 13, 2019",love it!,"love the art gallery, free entry. some of the most amazing art pieces in the world can be found in there. enjoy thoroughly."

"Written May 12, 2019",Sorolla Exhibition ,Excellent visit to my favourite place in London. The work of the Spanish Master of Light is not to be missed.
"Written May 11, 2019",Classic,"As many places in London, this also is perhaps a must visit. Excellent place and located in London city center,."
"Written May 11, 2019",Outstanding ,I have lived in London for a long time and have never visited the gallery. I wish now that I had not waited so long. What a great resource for London. The Sorolla exhibition is outstanding. 
"Written May 11, 2019",Quick visit,Had half an hour to spare before a show so popped in to revisit my favourite Turner paintings. Always worth another look
"Written May 11, 2019",Lovely art work and helpful staff,Visited this morning with my family and we all had an amazing experience. My elderly mother found the gallery easy to access and staff were very helpful.
"Written May 11, 2019",Amazing Gallery...a MUST SEE!,Fabulous collection in delightful surroundings. Don't miss special Sorolla exhibition...simply magical.I'd advise becoming a Friend....incredible value and immediate entry to special exhibitions.
"Written May 10, 2019",Focus on a few paintings of your choice,"Right on Trafalgar Square, everything about this gallery is pleasant. As you approach through Trafalgar Square, you already hit the high note. The galleries and their curation are beyond belief. I will recommend making a shortlist of your own before the visit and focusing on the same. Khanacademy has got some nice videos of about 10 national-gallery-paintings. Touching upon those before the visit will help."
"Written May 10, 2019",great places,Love these places in London.You have to visit these amazing places in London Comming back every time we are in London 
"Written May 9, 2019",National portrait gallery,"Located on Trafalgar this is well worth the visit. Find all those people you’ve read about , seen in movies or magazines. Writers, noble , musicians, royalty, all the notables of England."
"Written May 9, 2019",Lots to see.,"Enough here for a full day at least!  With free admission,  you can always see a bit at a time & then go back later."
"Written May 9, 2019",Incredible,"The National Gallery is remarkable and a must-see for any lover of painting. We spent hours in the Sainsbury Wing. It has the best collection of Italian masters I have seen outside (and maybe inside) Italy. The Impressionist galleries were mobbed late in the day. If you really want to appreciate these many great works, I might suggest a early morning visit. I also highly recommend the excellent YouTube videos produced by the National Galley as a preview to any view. The curators do a great job of giving context to the artist and the selected work. "
"Written May 9, 2019",Beautiful,"Beautiful architecture and scale. Amazing artworks, peaceful and relaxing in a generally busy place in London is achieved due to the class of people it attracts and the grand scale of the rooms. "
"Written May 9, 2019",Afternoon Tea,"We met our friend, who stayed with us 22 years ago when as a student she stayed with us.  This time our friend came with her daughter, who we hadn't met before and it was wonderful to catch up.  As they live in Switzerland English Afternoon Tea was a completely different and enjoyable experience for both of them.  We were seated very comfortably in the National Café and were made to feel very welcome."
"Written May 9, 2019",Very nice,"A review of world artists. Interesting. Quiet, because there is no crowd. Beautiful building and square in front of it."
"Written May 9, 2019",So much fabulous art - especially if you engage with it more deeply,"The whole collection is obviously amazing - in fact overwhelming if you try to see it all in one visit.  If you're lucky enough to be able to visit multiple times I think it's much better to just do a few rooms each time so you can soak up the skill and aesthetics of a particular artist or movement. Better still go along to a 'Talk and Draw' session on Friday lunchtime and spend an hour really engaged with just one painting.  Its free and the gallery provides folding seats, drawing boards, paper and pencils.  A member of the gallery team talks for a while about the history of the chosen work for that week and then sets you a drawing challenge based upon it.  And then you draw.  Its an amazing way to make you really look at a picture - you get totally absorbed in what you are doing despite the curious tourists wandering by.  Even when the subject is not a painting that you particularly like, you end up with a greater understanding of the composition and, in my experience, a deep admiration for the work.  Highly recommended!"
"Written May 8, 2019",Amazing Place ,Only in London can you visit priceless works of art for less than a visit to a church or cathedral. National Gallery is an amazing place with wonderful works of art by nearly every great artist. The place is very big and you can spend hours in here so plan accordingly. I won’t repeat what everyone else is saying except go visit this place!!

"Written May 8, 2019",Amazing,"The National Gallery is a 'must see' when you go to London. There are so many spectacular paintings here including one of VanGogh's Sunflowers. It's a huge place and can be overwhelming so just pick a few galleries that interest you most and visit them, and then go for a tea or lunch next door in the crypt of St. Michael's of the fields. It's a great way to spend a morning!"

From Leonardo to Monet it’s a beauty trip trough centuries and it’s real, not digital. Every time you can discover a different detail of your favorite picture. And it’s free!"

"Written May 7, 2019",Art! Art! Art!,"Such an experience of the great artists of our lifetime.  So much too see and so little time.  Please map out and make time to experience everything.  And when you are done eat at the Crypt Café, something different to talk about to your friends back home."
"Written May 7, 2019",One of the best places in London,It is simply wonderful. It is amazing just to walk in and see all those master pieces in one place. They also do excellent activities for children.I am not a fan of the cafe but you can take your own picnic.The museum shops are good.
"Written May 7, 2019",Absolutely Fabulous,I’m still in awe at the memories of my visit. We will certainly be recommending the National Gallery to everyone to visit & will definitely be returning again. Thanks to the team at the National Gallery!
"Written May 7, 2019",Sorolla,Absolutely brilliant exhibition. His paintings are so beautiful. The way the sunlight falls on the subject is unique.
"Written May 7, 2019",Amazing Gallery,"I am no art expert but love to visit & have returned often to view the fantastic paintings in the collection. You really could spend hours here, but as it's free you can dip in & out. Go, enjoy & be amazed."

"Written May 7, 2019",John Dee’s mirror.,"I went to the Anglo Saxon manuscript exhibition - Domesday Book, oldest living manuscript of Beowulf. Deep in the fugue of time and heritage, I exited that gallery and went to old familiar Gallery One, where Elizabeth 1’s necromancer John Dee’s mirror lives. And I mean lives, because in the depths of its obsidian reflections Dee would scry prophesies of what would come to pass. The British Museum with the Rosetta Stone and Lindow Man contains worlds upon worlds."
"Written May 7, 2019",Time to gaze and breathe ,"A favourite haunt both for its architecture and exhibitions.  I often pick a room and simply sit and appreciate the many works on display, the range of people who visit and the privilege to go whenever I can.  "

"Written May 26, 2019",Great exhibition,"We have visited an amazing exhibition about paintings around war time. Big enough space, wasn't too busy on a weekend. Lovely time for an afternoon."
"Written May 26, 2019",Great way to spend a few hours in London,"Great Glallery to wander around with an incredible range of pictures to find and enjoy.  I particularly enjoyed the 18th and 19th century paintings (Constable's through to Impressionists) but you will find so many pictures you recognise, and so many others that just capture your eye and your imagination, that you will happily lose yourself for hours in the gallery."
"Written May 26, 2019",Amazing gallery and often less visited than it ought to be,"I was impressed, deeply.  The National Gallery is well laid out, beautiful, and full of works from all eras.  The paintings and other pieces are displayed wonderfully, and it is one of the less crowded of the major London museums.Highly recommended."
"Written May 26, 2019",National Treasures,"Apart from the beautiful paintings and artwork on display, the National Gallery itself is an absolutely beautiful building. Add it to your list of places to visit and allow two to three hours to get around the place. There are coffee shops inside and rest areas along the way. For a quicker visit, select the rooms you want to visit and plan your trip accordingly."
"Written April 18, 2019",Amazing,"I love art and I really enjoyed this gallery, especially van Gogh and other impresionists. However, this building is basically a maze and we had difficulties to walk through it. We went to some places several times and I'm sure we missed some rooms."
"Written April 18, 2019",Must See,"We visited more on a whim because we were in Trafalgar Square and admission is free, but we were surprised at the wonderful assortment of art displayed here! There are works by Monet, van Gogh, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Michelangelo, Raphael, and many, many more. The attendants in each room are very helpful and will point you in the right direction if you get turned around (which is easy to do!). "
"Written April 16, 2019",Last minute visit - would spend a day there (at least),"In London for wife's bucket list things (as an Elizabethan history fan), we decided to put this in on our last day before train home.Big mistake. This place is awesome. Needs at least a day (unless you hate any art - that's a given right?).We didn't but my advice is to get a map/broucher of some sort - when we needed to leave (for our train) we realised we'd missed 20+% of the rooms.Even if this were £20/ticket I'd rate it up the same - astounding works from such a range of artists.I actually ran across a 40' room when I thought a painting in the corner was Renoir - and it was...But the Turners, Gainsboroughs and my wife fave, a huge Stubbs (that was a surprise that she was so enamoured).Go - do it.IT'S FREE.   unlike rip-offs elsewhere in the city..."

"Written April 15, 2019",Not to be missed when visiting London,"Located in the heart of the city at Trafalgar Square, this is one of London's premier museums. .An incredible collection, we partuicularly enjoyed the 19th century rooms"
"Written April 15, 2019",Makes you want to comeback,"It was a wonderful visit, leaves you speechless with stunning pieces by Leonardo, Michelangelo, and others. It is really huge and you will get tired before you can get to the end of it, so go with a plan of what you really want to see."
"Written April 14, 2019",Awesome first visit,My first trip to the gallery which I made on my own. It was breathtaking to gaze upon the original works of the most famous artists in the world. The staff were delightful and it felt very comfortable to amble away the afternoon. It was very expensive to eat and drink.
"Written April 14, 2019",World class.... and free!!,"As a Uk resident and regular London visitor I have visited the national gallery several times over the years and it’s only more recently, (after traveling to several other cities around the world and paying small fortunes for entry to galleries etc) , I’ve realised what an absolute gem we have in the capital. Some of the worlds best and most famous artists, a huge variation I style and what’s more it’s absolutely free!!"
"Written April 14, 2019",Always worth a visit,"This is a place I just have to go to whenever I'm in London. There's so much to see, so it is best to view one room at a time. "
"Written April 13, 2019",Free and interesting,It's an good place to take a leisurely visit and I enjoy short visits when in town. I found the cafe rather disappointing and the staff not really interested in serving customers. Not so easy the last time I visited for a disabled person to get around as lifts not all working. .
"Written May 5, 2019",So impressive,"An extremely large and well planned gallery. You could easily spend a whole day (or more) here but it is also the kind if place you can come to for a couple of hours and still see some brilliant and really iconic works. Due to a busy schedule we opted to spend 2 hours here. There was no que at 10:15am when we entered. We decided to see the early medieval galleries, Da Vinci and then moved through the 1600-1700 galleries (absolutely amazing) to see Rembrandt before descending the stairs to exit. The fact they don't charge for entry is quite astounding given the thoughtful and beautiful way the art is laid out and the grandeur of the building. The staff were all helpful and seemed friendly. If we have the chance to return to London we'll be back!"
"Written May 5, 2019",Fascinating - and free!,Great collection of marvellous works - and it is available for free. The range (time and style) is impressive. Makes for a good morning or a good afternoon in a London.
"Written May 5, 2019",Sean Scully's 'Sea Star' abstract landscapes are terrific!,"This iconic British gallery has a huge amount of fantastic work, covering centuries, in addition to the very modern current exhibition of Sean Scully works, so go anyway as its free! See my pics below"
"Written May 4, 2019","Coffee at National Gallery Cafe, London ",I visited the cafe at the National Gallery for a quick coffee on Thursday 2nd May 2019 as I walked back to Kings Cross following a business meeting. I was greeted warmly and shown to a table by the male head waiter.  30 mins later I was still waiting for someone to take my order. Although busy it was not as busy as sometimes. I attracted the attention of a waitress who came over and took my order. Eventually I got my coffee. Staff were rushing about looking hassled and the head waiter was joking and chatting to another waiter but not serving the tables.  I finished my coffee and then waited a further 30 minutes before someone was available to bring my bill. I left feeling frustrated at the quality of service and will not go back.  I thought it would be a treat going to the fantastic National Gallery for a coffee but the staff were inattentive and slow and didn't seem able to cope with the numbers of people. Disappointing! 
"Written May 4, 2019",My Favorite London Museum,I always visit here when in London.  The paintings of all the notables throughout Britain's history provide faces to go with the names you learned in history classes or read about as well as current celebrities.
"Written May 3, 2019",Day in London,We visited the national gallery on a vacation in England. So much to see here. If you’re into art then this gallery is a must see. 
"Written May 2, 2019","Great museum, extremely slow restaurant","The museum itself is fabulous and deserves an excellent. However, the restaurant was disappointing. Our order did not come for over 20 minutes. Our waiter took our order and never reappeared. We had to summon another person to retrieve our oder. It was a terrible waste of time when we could have been in the gallery."

"Written April 22, 2019",Sorolla Exhibition at the Sainsbury Wing is excellent,The Sorolla exhibition is a MUST SEE. The incredible canvases filled with so much sunlight and movement. The brush strokes are mesmerising.The children on the beach. The colours of the water on their skin. He certainly was the Spanish Master of Light. 
"Written April 22, 2019",Great variety of paintings,"We spent a couple of hours here, and will definitely return on a future trip, given the chance. There were many styles of painting to choose from, and we were glad to see some familiar ones. Having just come from Amsterdam, we were particularly drawn to the large galleries of Dutch artists. Barely scratched the surface, and could probably spend a couple days seeing this place at a leisurely pace."
"Written April 21, 2019","Many, many, Lord/Lady pics.","Art is always in the beholder's eye, so if you like a lot of allegorical paintings from the 1500-1700s this might be the place for you.  Very little Impressionism, hundreds of Lord and Lady pics, and only a smattering of the Still Life paintings that seem to be the province of British Art.  A good collection in a good space, but it all depends on what you like."
"Written April 21, 2019",Enjoy the Sorolla Exhibition in the Sainsbury Wing,A unique Museum...don't miss it! You will experience art at its finest and very best. Everything is perfectly organised and displayed.
"Written April 21, 2019",It's a must,"I strongly recommend visiting it even if it is just for a while, as it is free you can just pop in an quickly go to the rooms you are interested in. I hate when there is a painting I like on loan though.."

"Written April 20, 2019",Fantastic Sorolla Exhibit,"My wife really wanted to see this exhibition of Sorolla's works.  In fact it’s one of the main reasons we came to London to see his works.  This is one of the largest displays of his work outside of Spain.  I did not know much about him.  But I have to say I was really impressed by his art.  First of all his depiction of light in his paintings is incredible.  It evokes real emotions in his paintings.  Second was the scale of his work.  Many of his paintings are huge!  Not very practical for the average household, but terrific in a museum setting.  Third were the sheer number of paintings.  I didn't count, but there must be close to 100 displayed.Everyone viewing his works were very impressed.  It was obvious from their demeanor while viewing the art.  This was a wonderful exhibit and I am thrilled that I could share the experience with my wife.  She loved it!"
"Written April 20, 2019",Wonderful place to just wander,So lovely to be back here after a while. Incredible art and lovely just to wander around and take my own time. Beautifully environmental and very enjoyable couple of hours. Loved the shop too!

"Written May 7, 2019",Awesome Visit at National Gallery,"Our visit to the National Gallery was wonderful. We did the ""touristy"" thing outside taking plenty of pictures in Trafalgar square, and then headed into the N G. Beautiful layout and the paintings are magnificent. How fortunate Londoners are to have such a grand place. We saw Monet's, Cezanne's, Van Gogh, etc. You could spend a lifetime in here and not see it all. We were fortunate to be there on a Friday and across the street at St Martins in the Fields was a free lunchtime concert! This is a busy, busy part of London, but easy to get to from Charring Cross station. We had a wonderful time."
"Written May 7, 2019",The Art of Appreciation and Learning,A collection of art that is timeless and cannot be appreciated or loved enough.Walking through the various art displayed in the many sections and hallways is an unforgettable experience that brings out the aesthetic of European art in particular.You can get a hearing aid and a map to guide you through certain sections.It’s a place for appreciation and learning that must be experienced. It’s a joy to see the masters of the past who are appreciated today and the works that are displayed show humankind’s aesthetic potential.5/5
