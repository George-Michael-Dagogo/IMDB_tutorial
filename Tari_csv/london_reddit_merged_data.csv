"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 12:57:36 PM GMT+1",You could try the RAF museum. Free to get in too https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 12:59:37 PM GMT+1","If he is ex-Airforce I can recommend two or three things - 1. The air force museum in Hendon however if you can get to Duxford there are 4 hangers there as well as out door exhibits (the American hanger is especially interesting). Of course the IWM and the Science museum also have some aviation stuff.

Alternatively if he has never seen it, the Battle of Britain memorial on the Embankment is interesting and only a quick trip."
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 1:46:58 PM GMT+1",Iwm at Lambeth is pretty good for it's size
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 3:33:35 PM GMT+1","If there are tickets available when he is visiting, Operation Mincemeat is a very funny musical about World War 2 that I imagine someone who is ex-air force might enjoy."
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 10:18:57 PM GMT+1","I second the recommendation of Operation Mincemeat, it's absolutely brilliant."
"Friday, August 18, 2023 at 4:59:01 PM GMT+1",Someone had recommended this to me ages ago I had totally forgotten about it. Good tip thanks!
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 3:32:44 PM GMT+1","You could go to Greenwich on the U(ber)-boat and then go to the Observatory or the Maritime Museum and eat at Goddards Pie and Mash for some unfussy, very traditional, very affordable British food.

There's some good pubs by the Thames too."
"Friday, August 18, 2023 at 4:59:22 PM GMT+1",I think he'd love this
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 4:15:58 PM GMT+1","If you can find a Daniel Jeanrenaud gig, take him.

He's a guitarist and he plays the old rock and roll numbers, and he is an electric performer. I once saw him play a kebab shop in Camden at 1am (they were licenced) - no-one was there to see music, but he grabbed your attention, commanded the room, absolutely smashed the granny out of the set, and had the crowd screaming for more. Never seen anything like it. Pure rock and roll."

"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 7:57:45 PM GMT+1",I second the imperial war museum
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 2:36:57 PM GMT+1",Go to Ain't Nothin But blues bar for live music if he's getting on and can't stand for long periods then be sure to get there early (before 7) as it's a small venue and seats are limited. If he's a history buff he might enjoy seeing Operation Mincemeat - it's a brilliant musical and (almost unbelievably) based on a true story.
"Friday, August 18, 2023 at 5:00:29 PM GMT+1","That's 3 for operation mincemeat so definitely a winner! Blues bar sounds great, he's not going to be able to stand long so I'll see if we can get in early."

A dude called Lee drives you around in a minivan for half a day taking you to places you've mostly been past before, but he has so much music knowledge to impart and is so utterly amazed by it all you can't help but enjoy it.

We went to Abbey Road, where Get Back was filmed, overlooking Battersea talking about Pink Floyd and more. I believe you can also send him specific bands you're interested in to get it more tailored."
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 1:10:54 PM GMT+1","Take him to Abbey Road Studios and let him see the famous pedestrian crossing. He'll be thrilled. He'll enjoy watching the dozens of other people photographing one another as they cross, nearly getting killed (by me) in the process."
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 6:52:59 PM GMT+1",Check out The Hundred cricket games at The Oval - perfect for casual sport watching when you don't need to know much about what's going on to have a nice time. Tickets are cheap and normally cover a women's match and a men's match
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 10:45:56 PM GMT+1","The National Portrait Gallery has an exhibition of photos by Paul McCartney - there are lots of behind-the-scenes images from the mid-60s music scene, if that might be interesting to your dad?

How about an escape room to do together? Or one of the board game cafes that have popped up - there's one in Dalston that also serves craft beers etc, so could fulfill the pub vibe too?

I second all the recommendations that have been made for the Imperial War Museum (IWM), the Air Force Museum in Hendon, and Duxford, and would add HMS Belfast and the Cabinet War Rooms - I found them all fascinating, and I'd imagine that with an RAF background, they would be even more so.

And definitely try and get tickets for Operation Mincemeat - I took my mum, who is the same age as your dad, and she adored it."
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 1:20:08 PM GMT+1",Blues bar for live music every night in a very casual setting.
"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 2:11:10 PM GMT+1",Have a look on ents24 for live music and comedy listings. You can search by date range.

"Tuesday, August 15, 2023 at 9:08:02 PM GMT+1","Lots of good suggestions here so not much more I can add. But as a heads up Oppenheimer has some pretty raunchy full frontal sex scenes, just in case that influences your decision to see it with your dad! It is a very good film though. If movies are his thing you could see what's on at the prince Charles cinema and see if they've got any good old films on"
"Wednesday, August 16, 2023 at 5:06:29 AM GMT+1","My favorite pub is the Calthorpe Arms off of Grays Inn Road. Its really lowkey, the play good old timer music, have pub quiz on wednesday and people of all ages go :P And right down the road from that is the Charles Dickens museum if he is into that too. Oh and right there is also where George Orewell lived, too."
"Wednesday, August 16, 2023 at 11:51:24 AM GMT+1","There are loads of walking tours of London that are cheap and really informative. Even as someone who has lived here for years I’ve been placed and learnt things I had no idea of.

There are lots of general operators who are good, but there are also specialist pub tours (for older people!), music tours your dad would probably love and meet like minded people at. There may even be ones that are focused on military history too, I just don’t know about them.

https://londonmusictours.org/alltours/ is a good example of many."

"Wednesday, August 16, 2023 at 2:07:49 AM GMT+1",Could visiting the houses of parliament work? We did it once and it was great fun! Free for Londoners if I remember correctly!

"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 10:42:57 AM GMT+1",full of those poshy kids in like year 7 who act like roadmen
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 12:43:42 PM GMT+1","Nah, those are harmless. It's more the families going to visit the museums who act like nobody actually uses the tube to commute."
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 12:05:22 AM GMT+1",Yh because you’d love to be in Tower Hamlets surrounded by the sort of primitive scum who will pull out a knife and chef you up
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 7:21:07 AM GMT+1","I work in a school and I hate going to South Kensington, when I’m on a school trip you always have one child who cannot follow other pupils and wanders off!"
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 11:36:15 AM GMT+1",I used to work there and trying to get in and out of the station during the summer holidays was absolute hell. Do not plan your visits to/from the museums around commuting times you absolute morons.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 1:16:31 PM GMT+1",I’ve worked around there for the last 30 years. COVID has made it marginally less awful during holiday rush hour.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 7:07:35 PM GMT+1","I used to work at one of the Museums and I agree, it was hell! The trick, I found, was to walk to Gloucester Road Station which was less than 10 minutes away and it was much quieter and you were straight on the tube."
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 10:17:45 AM GMT+1","The bit of Camden between (& including) the tube station exit and the market.

"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 11:33:03 PM GMT+1",I still like the worlds end for an occasional nostalgic pint.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 4:26:27 PM GMT+1","I work in Camden and I fucking hate it. These days I get the overground to Camden Road so I can avoid the worst parts but the area around the tube and the markets are a nightmare, especially on weekends and the entire summer holidays."
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 7:42:28 PM GMT+1","The whole of Camden high street leading to the tube, nutters, alkies, pissheads, homeless, and more nutters shouting at people and no one in particular. It’s the smell mr organomegaly, I can’t stand the fucking smell."
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 11:12:01 PM GMT+1","Yesss I came here to say this. All of Camden. I had an ex who lived there and I hated walking from the station to his in the dark, always working past at least 3 junkies vomiting in the pavement, it’s so dimly lit, the housing is all listed so they’re mostly in various states of disrepair, and the whole place reeks of weed."
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 2:13:32 AM GMT+1","Ok… I live in Camden now, and I totally grant the area around the Tube is nasty. But I live a 5 min walk from Regents Park and there are amazing restaurants up and down Parkway. Yeah, some parts are trashy. But explore a bit and there’s great stuff here."
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 2:26:00 AM GMT+1","I went to Camden today to show my kids (8 and 6 yo) the area and market and I was like, yep, still as shit as ever.

The warehouse buildings in the market have been nicely regenerated and it’s a lovely space to walk round but fuck me the retail offer is so poor. Literally every unit is selling either the same t-shirts or bad art prints, that’s it. It could badly do with a bit of variety. But then again what do I know, I’m not the target audience."
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 2:29:17 AM GMT+1",Notting Hill the morning after the carnival.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 8:43:13 AM GMT+1",Used to travel to from NHG to Kensal rise to get to work and that tuesday after carnival was always an absolute experience.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 11:11:04 AM GMT+1","I've cycled through it once and learned my lesson.

I know people always say that residents there should know what they're in for and not complain about a festival on their doorstep, but the amount of vomit, piss and shit and broken bottles everywhere is something else."
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 11:14:38 AM GMT+1","I've just moved into a flat within viewing/spitting distance of the top of portobello, where the food market is. I have also never been to carnival, so this is going to be an experience..."

"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 11:48:54 AM GMT+1",It’s a lot better these days. As a kid I’d be going to school and see rats running around in the rubbish days/ weeks after carnival. Nowadays it’s almost like it never happened by Tuesday.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 1:59:18 PM GMT+1",I did the carnival first time a few years back. Was actually surprised how many people boarded up their properties. Police were arresting people all the time. I don't feel the need to do it again any time soon. Had a good time but just seemed a bit of a mess.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 12:00:52 PM GMT+1",Or during really.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 12:56:42 PM GMT+1",Shoreditch at the weekends resembles the ninth circle of hell nowadays.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 9:08:34 AM GMT+1",Used to enjoy Shoreditch c. 2010 now it’s full of coked up Essex people wanting fisticuffs.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 9:23:53 AM GMT+1","My friend came down to London and wanted to go to Shoreditch with me for ""the real hipster experience"".

I pleaded with him, telling him it's just coked up chavs looking for a fight these days. I suggested Dalston Junction, Hoxton, Clerkenwell, Brixton and Bermondsey, but he was undeterred.

We spent the day finding bars containing the lowest amount of fake tan."

"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 6:05:52 PM GMT+1","Born and bred Londoner here, have been in dodgy situations and neighbourhoods occasionally but Harlesden scared me. Also, seeing all the old branded shop fronts was like stepping into a time machine. A very aggressive time machine."
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 1:05:32 AM GMT+1","A friend of mine lived near there, when me and my friends would go and visit him, we used to joke about the KFC there having bulletproof windows."
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 7:32:55 AM GMT+1","I went to Harlseden once, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a place just as gritty as my own much maligned hometown. Nice and real - none of that whipped cream Regent Street bullshit.

It helped that I was at a children's bakesale though and met some good local folks."

"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 6:43:58 PM GMT+1",Pretty much sums up the miserable Londoners living in it. Never happy lol
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 8:26:15 PM GMT+1","Seems there are plenty of nice places in London being spared here. Nobody is saying never will I ever go to Hampstead, Marylebone, or Chelsea. (Though I'm sure there are Redditors who find reasons to hate those places too)"
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 12:17:49 AM GMT+1",no normal person can afford to live in those areas
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 7:26:38 PM GMT+1","I'm not sure there's anywhere I actively avoid. I don't often go to Woolwich but I wouldn't say that requires much effort - it's more just there's little to no reason to go there.

I don't really get why you'd actively avoid South Kensington, Kings Cross or the touristy places as other people have said. They're great places to walk through for the most part. I might find the idea of bowing to royalty offensive but it's not like I feel unsafe when I walk past Buckingham Palace. Similarly, Oxford Street is somewhat soulless but I don't recall ever having an issue walking down it."

"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 3:12:27 PM GMT+1",I got massively voted down on a thread the other day for saying that Woolwich is absolutely fine and will get really expensive when Crossrail opens. But it’s true. That army barracks museum place is interesting.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 9:10:24 PM GMT+1",Lived in Woolwich for a couple of years and it’s fine except the annual firework skirmish in the square
"Wednesday, January 5, 2022 at 12:02:36 AM GMT+1",I live there as well! It's improved a lot recently.
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 11:45:11 PM GMT+1","Moving to the area near Tesco, Reddit really scares me with how scary they make the area."

"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 7:33:26 PM GMT+1","Woolwich isn't so bad these days, the arsenal side by the river is actually rather pleasant. Even the town itself has a couple of interesting places to check out (the Blue Nile restaurant is great). When the Elizabeth line gets going it will be a good candidate for a lesser-known London destination!"
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 10:15:24 PM GMT+1","Sadly, the Blue Nile (once voted #1 Restaurant in London on Trip Advisor) is closed indefinitely and has been sold :("
"Tuesday, January 4, 2022 at 7:27:35 PM GMT+1","I lived in Woolwich for six years and never had an issue. That said, I moved away about a year ago and by then it was quite gentrified so that probably helped."

"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 11:15:23 AM GMT+1","This is a valid question, even pre-Covid. If you're ""socially solitary"" (meaning single and some combination of new to London, a natural introvert, or in a period of enforced social distancing), London can be a surprisingly hard city in which to find interesting things to do that don't involve eating or drinking, especially if you're on a budget. Yes, there are a lot of cool free/cheap museums and cemeteries, but I find these to be more of a once-per-month activity. It's hard to be excited about your n+1st museum that you've seen this month alone, especially if you've got no one with whom to discuss the interesting things you saw.

In the end, the answer always seems to come back to walking around London, going somewhere else (even more expensive and difficult now!), or trying to synthesize yourself into some social group, but I can say I have lived in a lot of cities on a lot of continents and London is the most cliquish city I have ever experienced. So, it's hard.

When I first arrived in London, I walked hundreds of miles to explore and entertain myself, but, like you, I hit a point where I just didn't want to walk anymore. I had walked all the streets within a three-mile radius of my flat so many times that to walk to somewhere new I almost needed to take the Tube, which sort of defeats the point. I started looking for tasks to take me to some more distant place in Zone 5 or 6 and I would walk back to my flat in Zone 1 from there. Those were good, memorable days that had a nice combination of accomplishment and exploration, but there's only so many tasks you can find to give you reason to travel from Zone 1 to more remotes parts of London.

I joined the Tate as a member for a couple of years which wasn't cheap but I found very rewarding. I never get tired of taking the boat between the two Tates and I also value spontaneity--being able to see special exhibits any time I wanted was worth a lot to me. Unfortunately, I think Covid has killed what's left of the non-booking-and-queueing part of London life. Boats are still fun though.

In the summers, I started doing things outdoors that you normally associate with mundane indoor tasks. I would take my laptop to the park and use my phone as a hotspot and answer boring emails but do so in nice weather. Or just read a book. Sometimes I fed the ducks at parks which I found surprisingly soul-restorative.

One summer, I moved all my stuff into storage and stayed week-to-week in different parts London. That was exhausting but fascinating! London, being the amalgamation of little villages, is perfectly suited for that--every part of the metro area has a unique history and nature. I really enjoyed getting a (figurative) taste of each. I think this might be logistically impossible now in the Covid era though.

Anyway, I'm empathetic to your issue. My best advice is to find a curiosity that gets you out of the flat, maybe taking a language class, researching family records, taking a skills course (like a sport or CPR/First Aid), learning about the architecture of the city, just anything where you're curious, you will be in for mentally stimulating, low-calorie entertainment and not the usual ""dressed up pirates mix you cocktails"" fare."
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 11:55:58 AM GMT+1","Do you have some examples of these tasks set in the outer zones you’d do?

Seems like you figured out London though I’m impressed, I had the same feelings as you at times."
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 2:48:55 PM GMT+1",Sometimes it was a one-off cultural event (Thai New Year celebration in Wimbledon) but mostly it was just buying something at a marginally better/cheaper location (like the O2 mall). I’m lazy enough that it wasn’t always easy to convince myself I needed to go that far for something I could probably just order online.
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 12:33:56 PM GMT+1","yes the enjoyment from walking around the city greatly depends on where you live

From where I live I can walk to Hampstead Heath, Primrose Hill, Regent's Park, Hyde Park, Marylebone, Camden town, Portobello Market, the canal all within an hour. And I can even borden my destination by taking a short ride on the overground (live near the overground station)

So I'm pretty satisfied with my life so far even I moved to London a year ago during lockdown!

But I totally understand this is because I've chosen a great location to live, plus I just love walking around the city, even before I moved to London!"
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 5:10:53 PM GMT+1","New to London and absolutely love walking. Your description of walking hundred of miles to explore and entertain yourself is right up my alley - but if you don’t mind answering, are you male or female? As a female myself I’ve been trying to assess the potential risk factors of wandering around/getting lost in London by myself. Coming from NYC I understand needing to be aware of my surroundings and everything that entails but this is a new city to me and is definitely full of more nooks and crannies than the mostly grid like setup of Manhattan and I definitely would not be super aware of my surroundings by virtue of everything being so new. So as a female would a newcomer not super familiar with the different neighborhoods feel comfortable wandering around alone with the mission of simply discovering the city?"
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 11:37:04 AM GMT+1","Male but I also lived in NYC (Chinatown and Harlem) before moving to London and London has always seemed much safer to me. If you have NYC awareness skills, I think you should be fine most places in London, especially during the daytime."

It’s the authority on what’s going in, and it lists all of these different things; theatre, gigs, exhibitions, little random events, in one place. You just put in your day and can go through them all, no need to search multiple places.

In the old days it used to be a magazine so you’d go through and see what you fancied doing, nowadays it’s all online."

"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 12:02:09 PM GMT+1","I use all sorts of apps, Dice is a great one as you can buy tickets directly on the app, they have big and small gigs and if you can't make it you can return your ticket for someone else to buy. Songkick is another good one that will sync to your Spotify and notify you when bands you listen to are playing. Spotify also tells you when bands are touring and you can view their dates from the app."

Then there are sites like obby & eventbrite where lots of individuals and smaller organisations list classes.

Finally search for places that do stuff you're interested in and sign up to their mailing lists to find out whats on. For example if you like folk music then you need Cecil Sharp House, or science then follow some of the many larger and smaller science and medical museums. Or language/culture try Japan House or Institute Francais.

Tell me what your interests are and I can try and suggest some places to look!"
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 2:49:17 PM GMT+1","I did a few Citylit courses when I first moved to London and didn’t know many people, a creative textiles class and a printmaking one (for context - I was early 20s, female). There were several other people in each class around the same age. I didn’t end up staying in touch with anyone longterm but I definitely enjoyed the classes (and a more extroverted person might have better mileage making outside-of-class connections). Other things I did at that time that we’re non-eating/drinking focused and did result in longer term friendships - joined a monthly book group, volunteering, going to ‘stitch and bitch’ type knitting/crochet meet-ups, going to WI meetings (in London the WIs tend to be pretty young/modern). All of these were cheap or free. You could also go to the public lectures that every university runs (almost always free). For an active thing, bouldering is fun and tends to be very friendly; The Arch used to run meet-ups for different levels of experience."

I enjoy living in a city where I can constantly be a tourist.

I go on walks A LOT. Looking and finding secret crevices is super cool. Walking tours are great, and you learn a lot. I go to free museums a lot. I follow arts organisations to find cheap tickets. Biking on boris bikes can be good or rollerblading!

I do eat out, and the popular cool places can be great. But don’t neglect the old school shitty looking places, they’ve lasted so long - they must be good, right?

I follow individual theatres newsletters - royal court, barbican, national theatre, almeida (all have good schemes) - just off top of my head. Look up any arts org's in your area and they'll give away cheaper tickets at some point. Fringes like vault festival can be great for super cheap ticket.

Get into theatre, theatrecraft, masterclass (https://masterclass.org.uk/), showfilmfirst, https://www.mousetrap.org.uk are all great resources espppp if you’re on young side (18 - 30)

It’s currently London theatre week until sept 3, which mean you can book west end tickets for £15 until then. Shows will be from now till feb / March Time.

Also forgot to say - but the book Time Out London for under £10 is a great resource too"
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 2:48:51 PM GMT+1","Cinema in London has a much greater choice than many cities. As for art, the permanent collections in the National Gallery or the V+A are free and whilst a ticket is required, usually not too far into the future. The auction houses such as Christies, Sotheby and Bonhams have viewing days, which are free."

Or any of the activities, such as climbing the O2, various types of boat rides of varying speeds, bowling, axe throwing, craft classes, quizzes, treasure hunts, cinemas, theatre. Like, if you're struggling to find something to do in London, that's entirely on you and either your lack of imagination, lack of funds (which, fair enough), or limited interests."

Some physical activities tend be very affordable - might require some upfront equipment, however. Playing RPG (role playing games) for the less inclined towards physical activities. There is a big West London group. If you’re looking to find friends, you’ll invariably will have an easier time finding activities that people are already gathering to do."

"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 12:23:34 PM GMT+1","A friend of mine was telling me about park runs. It's way more organised than I first thought, and it sounds like it's not about being the fastest or anything - people of all ages and fitness levels do it, so it sounds like a good, healthy activity. I'm not a runner and am not sure if I'll go for it, but I'm beginning to come around to the idea of it. If it sounds like something you'd want to do, there's quite a few around London, so no matter where you are, there's probably one near you."
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 12:30:23 PM GMT+1","Just to say you don't have to run to do parkrun! I know quite a few people who run/walk it, or even walk the whole thing (and there is always a tail walker so you won't be the last person). Would definitely recommend going if it's something you're interested in, especially as the community is very welcoming and supportive of everyone in my experience."

"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 3:41:14 PM GMT+1","I'd suggest Good Gym as well, which is a running club that also does good deeds for the local community - you run to the task, do the task, then back to the meeting point. I've done stuff like clearing Christmas trees and delivering leaflets for local community centres before as examples of the type of stuff you do."
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 3:23:48 PM GMT+1","Museums. There are just so many of them, free, and you can go to temporary exhibitions if you are okay with leaving a few quids. Also, art galleries. After finding out there was one right next to my place, I would just pop there all the time when I had some time to kill (Whitechapel Gallery for those who care). Oh and strolls. A walk by the regent canal from Stratford’s Olympic stadium to Warwick Avenue makes for a great Sunday afternoon!

edit: you can also do photography with a group of people, either to learn or practice. It can be a way to see the city with a different eye even if you are not into it especially. Practice sport too. Find a community garden and grow veggies and fruits. Learn coffee brewing."

I know the Tate does random interesting events so keep tabs on that.

I recommend r/LondonSocialClub as a way of finding these people - I've attended board game clubs, dance classes, film viewings etc etc."
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 2:13:41 PM GMT+1","MUSEUMS!! I have been going to museums in London by myself since I was in my mid teens. If you are artistic, take a sketchbook and draw from the art and artefacts, or just absorb the culture. My favourites are the V&A and the British Museum, but other smaller places like Sir John Soane’s are also lovely. As for art galleries, exhibitions are often expensive or sold out, yes, but the permanent collections of places like Tate, National Gallery etc are free and available (though if you can, see the Sophie Taeuber-Arp at Tate Modern, it’s great).

Go on walks. London has beautiful parks - visit as many as you can, in weather good or bad! Hire pedalos and go to the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park, walk past Buckingham palace through to Green Park and St James’ park, peek in at the giraffes in Regent’s Park. There are so many gorgeous areas to explore that differ greatly from each other - from the brutalist Barbican to prim and pretty Primrose Hill. So many interesting people have lived in London through the years, have a look for their blue plaques! If you Google you can also find articles on historic places that can only be found when looked for. Today I walked around Holland Park and Notting Hill, the other day I went out to see Richmond. Both trips (minus travel costs, but the underground is v cheap) completely free. On the subject of Richmond, Kew Gardens and Richmond park are great, and I’m a big Ted Lasso fan so I found the different filming locations there. Maybe that’s something else you could do?

I’ve lived in London my entire life, and I go into the city all the time. I don’t drink and I am a vegetarian with food allergies so I never do anything centred on food. I take packed lunches or pick something up in M&S. This has never held me back from fully experiencing the wonders of this magnificent and historic city. You just need to look past the boozers and the foodies to see what London is really about!"
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 4:00:57 PM GMT+1","Museums! We've got so many incredible ones. Science, natural history, British, imperial war, navy, RAF, HMS Belfast, The Globe Theatre (museum and more) Horniman *snigger* museum. There's a cool museum of medicine near Holborn which was very interesting! I won't go into detail on each but plenty of info available online. Most of these if not all have free entry as an added bonus.

There are various gardens, Kew, Kensington, Sky Garden, Kyoto Japanese garden.

More touristy bits like London Dungeons, London Eye, different bus/walking tours. The Jack the Ripper tour around Spitalfields/Whitechapel is great if you like that sort of thing.

Multiple art galleries - National gallery, Tate Gallery for classic, Whitechapel, Saatchi gallery. If modern art is more your thing you've got the Tate modern and Serpentine.

When the weathers nicer the parks are great - Regents, St James, Hyde Park, Alexandra Park, Victoria Park, Hampstead Heath, Primrose Hill.

In Regents Park there's London zoo. We have Sea Life aquarium to explore.

On top of all of that just general exploring places you wouldn't normally visit can be a great day out. Walking round places like Camden Lock, along the Southbank and around Westminster. Everywhere you go will have places of interest if you look closely and research where you are.

Hope that gives you some inspiration!

Honestly there's so much culture and amazing things to do in London!"

I volunteer to clean litter from the canal banks so once a month I get to go canoeing for free as long as I’m clearing crap out the canal as I go. I’ve also volunteered for St John’s Ambulance which can get you into football matches and big events in London. There’s lots of places looking for volunteers and it’s a great way to meet people too.

"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 2:09:50 PM GMT+1","Hi Shmel39,

For me, one of the best things about London is our museum culture! If you go looking for something that interests you, chances are they’ll be some free-to-enter museum staffed by people who are very helpful And know their stuff.

Alternatively, London has a larger proportions of green space than any other metropolis in the world, and they vary greatly between them, from the cultivated splendour of St. James’, to the wildlife in Richmond Park (Bambi!) or the wilds of Hampstead Heath - there’s something for everyone.

Also you could try some theatre in the west end or just go on a joy ride on the DLR - you can sit right at the front :)

If this doesn’t cut your mustard, then I strongly recommend checking out stuff in Time Out magazine it has everything going on everywhere for everyone normally

Either way there’s lots to do, so get stuck in!

Hope you have a lovely day"

You can do them as a group or on your own, they're a great way to discover different places when you don't know where to look or routes to take. There's tons like them that are more competitive but these are cheap and taken at your own pace.

I know you’re a little sick of long walks, but maybe challenge yourself to really learn London.

The Greenwich & Docklands International Festival is an awesome outdoor theatre and performing arts festival that started this weekend and continues for the next couple of weeks at various locations including Greenwich, Canary Wharf, Woolwich and Thamesmead. I've been to going to this for a few years and it's always really fun.

There used to be a downhill soapbox race in Telegraph Park (like a free local version of the Red Bull race at Ally Pally) every year which was fun when I went, though it hasn't been on the last two years because of the pandemic. It should return next year.

I discovered all of these by chance, normally by seeing a poster in the box or on a noticeboard. If anyone knows of a website that lists local events like this, let me know."

You get a set of clues that take you around a part of the city. Clues are hidden in the architecture, public artworks, signs or pub names, stuff like that. Can be done in a group, or alone. I've done two from a site called treasure trails .Co.uk. They're about a 10er I think, but a really great way to find out hidden gems or take you to areas of london you don't know so well."

The CityMapper app is AMAZING. It shows you the tube transport, busses, the uber boat, and the trains.

If you're anywhere near the Tower, the Crutched Friars has an amazing chicken pot pie. So delicious.

Afternoon tea is a must, but reservations are needed for the most popular.

Don't take the bus tour to Windsor, Bath and Stonehenge. You'll spend more time on the bus than you will viewing anything.

The oyster card needs to be tapped in and out on the uber boat and the tube. Busses you only tap once. The tube stations all have portals to top up your card.

The London eye isn't great. Don't get pulled in to any games on the bridges, they're all scams. If you're going to get souvenirs, leave room in your carryon. Taxis and ubers are great, but the tube stations are more efficient. So you don't need to stay in central London. London is not a breakfast place. Starbucks aren't huge there, but Pret a Manger is, and their food and coffee is simple and cheap.

Borough market is nice, but unless you're staying somewhere with a kitchen, there's not too much to do. But you do you have to go to the Ginger Pig for sausage rolls and Kappacasein Dairy for the raclette. Go early. Maria's Market Cafe has a cheap English breakfast. The bread and butter were delicious.

Pre-order tickets to any of the museums or attractions, because often that line for prepaid tickets are much shorter.

Westminster Abbey is not made for big people in their enclaves, especially where Queen Elizabeth the First is entombed. You WILL have to push to get out, and squeeze by often.

Do several things in one area. We did Buckingham Palace, the war rooms, Westminster Abbey, and the Houses of Parliament in one day.

For God's sake, BRING COMFORTABLE SHOES."
"Monday, August 30, 2021 at 4:40:31 PM GMT+1",I'm from London and everything in this answer is fantastic.
"Monday, August 30, 2021 at 6:44:24 PM GMT+1","I would just add a couple of things!

St. Martin in the Fields church (in Trafalgar Square) has an AWESOME crypt. You can do brass rubbings, which is a ton of fun, and they have an even more awesome English-school-type cafeteria with real old-school type food like Shepherd's pie, and most importantly, apple crumble with Bird's custard. Really a fun afternoon, and especially if it's hot out, it's nice and cool down there.

If you hit hot weather (not sure when you're going), any American business will have proper a/c (the one time you actually do want to stop in at a McDonald's)

Portobello Road is kinda fun, but not necessarily worth the trip

If you like that sort of thing, treat yourself to a nice English tea somewhere. Don't call it ""high tea"" -- that's the farmer's term for a meal closer to supper. You want what's called a ""cream tea."" They'll have them in all sorts of tea rooms. If you want fancy, try Fortnum & Mason's tea room--it's not QUITE as snooty as, say, the Savoy or the Ritz, and it's better than Harrod's, and quite nice. Fortnum's by the way has some amazing tea, honeys, jams, marmalades. If you like real English marmalade, Sir Nigel's is really fantastic--BUT, it's very hard to transport. You can usually find some at the airport on the way out so don't bother lugging it around! Teabags on the other hand are super light and easy to stuff in your suitcase.

I heartily second Citymapper--it's a fantastic app.

I also second the War Rooms. They're like time travel--really incredible. The War Museum is pretty darn good too.

Definitely try to get a nice Cornish pasty while you're there. There are shops that specialize, and you can also find stands at Covent Garden that have them.

ETA: OH! I forgot! Go to a genuinely old pub--this is a legendary one: https://ye-olde-cheshire-cheese.co.uk/about/---amazing experience. Get a basic pub lunch, sausages & mashed potatoes, and a dark, dark Guinness. OMG unforgettable experience!"
"Monday, August 30, 2021 at 9:01:45 PM GMT+1",We were so upset we never had time to go back to the Cheshire Cheese place near Tower Hill.
"Monday, August 30, 2021 at 9:56:29 PM GMT+1","Thanks for the great response. Question though - I was under the impression I didn't need an oyster card anymore, I could just tap my credit card like NYC. Is that not true?

Going back next month!"
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 1:59:42 PM GMT+1","As far as I'm aware, as long as you have the tap feature on your card, you can use it. My concern when we went was possible thievery when you have your credit card out."
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 2:04:54 PM GMT+1",Yes. I went last June and used my visa instead of an Oyster
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 3:16:39 PM GMT+1","Yes, you can tap your credit card - I found that was really practical, don't be afraid of robberies but do be aware that's as you have to tap it in your way and in your way out, you'll be tempted to leave in a reachable place like a back pocket, we're its more possible it could fall/get lost/get stolen, so just be sure to put it in a safe place"
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 4:10:18 PM GMT+1","Tate Modern art gallery, across the Thames from St Paul's Cathedral is free with some exhibits that you need to pay to see. British Museum, also free with a lot of marvelous but controversial global/stolen artifacts. Natural History Museum and the Science Museum are next to each other and across the road from the V&A museum in South Kensington. Again, all free to enter (although there's usually at least one pay to view exhibit at the V&A). There's also a bunch of smaller galleries and museums around London. It really depends on which part of town you're staying in."
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 5:32:28 PM GMT+1","The “free to enter” thing can’t be overstated. It’s not like, say, the Met, where it’s technically pay what you want, but you have to tell a real person, “yes hello I’d like to pay nothing.” It’s just a nice unobtrusive donation box you can put money in or not.

For me, I’ll pay full price the first time I go. But I get museum fatigue after a few hours and have to leave, so I don’t feel like I should have to pay full price to come back the next day.

Most of them also make you pay like £2 for map/guide, too, so that’s another way to contribute if you want to."
"Sunday, August 29, 2021 at 5:54:31 PM GMT+1",The Science Museum is now a desk you have to walk up to and they talk you into donating and doing all sorts of charity stuff. As a Brit who has visited every year since childhood I was annoyed it was now so obtrusive.
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 12:02:10 AM GMT+1","As far as getting around, walk as much as possible! It is an incredible city to see on foot! There are interesting things everywhere you turn! A smart map on your phone can always help you find your way! I always walk as much as possible because you just see so much! If you get tired you can always grab a cab to take you the rest of the way! Best city on earth to see by foot in my opinion! If I wake up in the middle of the night due to jet lag I just go out and start walking in any direction. Also it’s a great way to watch the city come alive at around 5AM, there is no one around all the monuments and it is such a great way to see them without hoards of tourists in the way! (They are not open at that hour of course but they are still there) Standing on a deserted bridge watching and listening to Big Ben strike at 5 or 6AM is something you will never forget! Go there in the middle of the day and it’s elbow to elbow! Have fun! I’m envious!"

And I will be remembering UHF1211."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 2:45:46 AM GMT+1",The museums listed are cool but if the weather isn’t terrible I enjoyed just walking around some of the areas I’d read about or seen in movies. I’ve avoided a lot of touristy spots but the Tower of London is worth it - go early and go directly to the Crown Jewels and take your time through the rest of it. You can see some of the old gates and part of the old wall. So much is modern but there are old bits.there are some downloads of walking tours.
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 8:43:44 AM GMT+1","The center of London is very walkable. There's not as much traffic as somewhere like say New York or San Francisco. Because there is a fee to drive there

https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge

And because the Tube is so well, a car would be more trouble than it's worth. Find a place to stay near a subway entrance, and Google maps works great for telling you which lines to take, where to transfer, and when. As long as you have data on your phone."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 8:52:49 AM GMT+1",Or use Citymapper app. It works so great on London!

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 3:10:48 AM GMT+1","Getting an oyster card for the tube is not necessary because you can tap and go (Apple pay, Google pay) at the turnstile (unless you want a useless souvenir). We had to sleep near the airport the night before our flight and had to take the train and wait for a bus to get to hotel and they were on time. Of course, we only had carry-on. It makes riding the train easier - it can get crowded depending on time of day."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 12:23:44 AM GMT+1","Dated a man over there for over a year and was there often. Soho, South Bank, Hyde Park, Greenwich, Covent Gardens, walking the bridges. I made the mistake of taking ride share when the Tube is so much faster. Still a joke with my friends. Hop On/Hop Off busses are a good way to get around. I did one I just didn't get off and saw the city that way. It can be nice to take one all the way around and then decide, okay I want to get off here and see more.

I really like Brighton for the day too, it's unique. Maybe see if there are day tours to the countryside, it's worth going outside the city. I love Hamleys toy store, it's multi-storied! Harrods and Selfridges are neat stores too, we don't have anything like that here.

Fast casual sushi called Itsu is fantastic and cheap. Tesco grocery has great, cheap food to take away. Saves a lot of money to grab food there. You can get cheap sausage rolls, breakfast and pastries at Gregg's. Tons of kebob and take away shops all over. I honestly found food cheaper there than in the States, casual food, prepared food especially.

Damn I miss London."

Depending on your interests and how detail oriented you are, you can do the “primary London touristy stuff” in 2-3 days. By this I mean: see Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Horse Guard Parade, Trafalgar Square. Etc. most of that stuff is so close together you can do it in one day if you hustle, have good weather, and summer daylight hours.

The museums are amazing. British Museum, Tate Modern, and Tower of London will get a lot of mentions. But don’t forgot the Victoria and Albert Museum.

My favorite thing to do in London, although it can be hard on a seven day trip, is to simply enjoy one of the neighborhoods. Pub crawl in Soho (responsibly, because there are 2-3 pubs on each dang corner), or sit on the patio of a restaurant near Notting Hill and just watch the city go by. Walk to all the different squares in Bloomsbury. Have a picnic in Hyde Park"

If sitting through a service is something you are interested in, try to catch the Evensong service. The services are free to attend, open to all. The choir sings some of the service during Evensong and it is beautiful. Get in line as early as you can so you can sit in the stalls (pews to us) as opposed to just folding chairs. The choir uses the first two rows of the stalls. I was lucky enough to sit behind the choir, hearing them sing brought tears to my eyes and I am not religious at all. It was amazing and by far one of my favorite memories from my trip last year."

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 3:27:08 AM GMT+1","As someone who has been to London six times and just got back in February, the biggest advice I can give you is to prioritize. What really interests you? Do you want history? Art? Are you a foodie? Shopping? Then go from there.

For history: Westminster Abbey Tower of London The Cutty Sark Tower Bridge Mueseum Churchhill War Rooms Whitehall Banqueting House

Art: Tate Modern National Portrait Gallery Victoria and Albert Museum British Mueseum

Food: There are tons of lists online depending on your tastes and budgets, so I'll defer to those. But my stand outs are:

St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square.

The White Lion in Covent Garden.

Shopping: Convent Garden/Jubilee Market Greenwich Market (especially if someone in your group loves jewelry and antiques).

My must do list for first timers:

Covent Garden/Jubilee Market

Take the hop on/hop off bus and explore.

Take the Thames Uber Boat to Greenwich for the Cutty Sark (a real 17th century tea ship and incredible museum) and Greenwich Market. Have tea at The Orangery, located in the Fan Museum (as in hand held fans, not ceiling fans). Also the Navel Academy, Maritime Mueseum, and the Queen's House.

Westminster Abbey, Tower of London, Tower Bridge Mueseum (seriously, check it out). Possibly the London Eye, if you have time.

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 3:43:39 AM GMT+1","I have an iPhone and a credit card with no international transaction fees in ApplePay. When I’m in London, I click on the card in my wallet and turn on “Express Transit”. That lets me use the phone on the tube and the bus. Just hold the phone near the yellow plastic circle. You get a single TfL credit charge for your transportation usage every night. It’s way better than messing around with Oyster cards.

I have an Ally Bank high interest account for my emergency fund. Their ATM card is part of the AllPoint ATM network which is all over the UK. You get market rate exchange rate and no transaction fees. I have an AllPoint application on my phone for locating ATM machines. In London, there are tons of them.

I use Heathrow as my gateway airport to Europe and always take the Boston-LHR morning flight so I don’t have to overnight on an airplane. I crash at an airport hotel and continue on my way the next day after a leisurely full English breakfast. Off peak, the hotels are inexpensive by London standards so I’ll do my first night at the airport even if I’m in London for a few days. Google Maps tells you what bus to take and it’s £1.65 for the bus ride. Dinner in a pub or an Indian restaurant, in bed by midnight, and I’m in the right time zone the next morning."

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 4:22:06 AM GMT+1","I got the 7 day London Pass and it was perfect for my trip! There’s sooooo many things you can do that having it really helped me narrow down my itinerary. Plus since you get into nearly all of the big ticket sites with it, chances are you’ll be saving way more money with it. Since historical sites and museums tend to close around 5 or 6 depending when you’ll be there, I was able to see about 2 or 3 things a day. At night I would check what else the pass had on offer outside those hours, and actually ended up doing some things I wouldn’t typically go for and ended up enjoying them. A couple examples are a ticket to any movie at the Curzon in Covent Garden and a ticket to the viewing deck at The Shard. There’s also a ton of free museums, just know that if you’re going during tourist season the lines will be extremely long, especially at the British museum of history. But if you’re looking at historical sites like the abbey, observatory, Kew gardens, Tower of London, Hampton court or Windsor castle (just to name a few) the pass is perfect! Also, if you do end up making the trek out to Greenwich, def check out the painted hall in the old royal naval college! It’s absolutely stunning and I could spend hours just taking it all in. The market there also has tons of street food, and there’s a bakery called Gail’s on the corner across the Greenwich market area that makes a hand pie that’s to die for!"
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 5:05:59 AM GMT+1","If you want to watch it as a video: https://youtu.be/SbiCRowuawE
These are the top 5 free things to do in London.

Visit the museums:
London is home to some of the world's most excellent museums, many offering free admission. The British Museum is home to a vast collection of artifacts and artworks from all over the world, representing a variety of civilizations and historical eras. It houses well-known displays like The Rosetta Stone, the Parthenon sculptures, and the Egyptian mummies.
The Natural History Museum has the giant blue whale skeleton in place of the famous whole-body dinosaur in the main hall. They also have an animatronic T-rex in the Dinosaurs gallery and the Earthquake simulator. If you have kids, it's the perfect place to go.
Many other museums like the Imperial War Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Modern, and the National Gallery are some of the most famous museums you can visit for free. They can usually accommodate walk-ins, but they may not be able to do it during busy periods. So book a timed entry early on through their website, and all of them are entirely free.

View London city from above.
As good as it is to just wander around the city, experiencing the stunning views from its above is also fantastic. Places like Sky Garden and Tate Modern Viewing Platform provide excellent city views.
Sky Garden is an indoor public garden and observation deck located on the 43rd floor of the ""Walkie Talkie"" building, that weird-shaped building you see on the London Skyline. It offers panoramic views of the city. It is free, but you must book in advance, and there may be queues to enter during peak hours. It also has a restaurant. So you can enjoy your meal, looking at the city's view. It is open from 10 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday, and from 11 am to 9 pm on Saturdays and Sundays. This is probably the best view of the city that you can get from a high-rise building.
The Tate Modern Viewing Platform is located on the 10th floor of the Tate Modern art museum. It provides 360-degree views of the city, including the River Thames, St Paul's Cathedral, and the Shard, and yes, it's always free to enter. No advanced booking is required. It's a museum, so you get two free things to do at the same place.

Roam around the royal parks:
You know you can visit the same Park as the Royal Family does for absolutely nothing. You might bump into the princess there, God knows. Jokes apart! Royal Parks are some of the city's most beautiful and peaceful green spaces. There are eight Royal Parks; Hyde Park, Regent's Park, Greenwich Park, St. James's Park, Richmond Park, Kensington Gardens, Bushy Park, and The Green Park.
They are a great place to relax and unwind, go for a walk, exercise and clear your mind. They have hundreds of buildings, statues and memorials that reflect London's heritage. Grab a picnic basket, and you get yourself a fantastic day out at the Royal parks in London.
The parks also have special activities which you can pay to enjoy. For instance, Hyde park offers horse riding. It has two designated routes for horse riding. Regent's Park is home to the London Zoo, Greenwich Park has the Royal Observatory and so on. You can visit their website for other activities.

Eat at The Churchill Arms:
While this choice doesn't sound like a to-do thing, trust me, it's a must-go place while you're in London, especially if you're photogenic and love flowers. They spend almost 50,000 pounds a year just on the plants and lights. So you know it's something to look at.
It's a restaurant located at 119 Kensington Church Street. They say Winston Churchill's grandparents were regular visitors, so they named it that way, but who knows? It's a Thai restaurant, that's a surprise!! It's covered with flowers all year round except during Christmas when pine trees are all over the building. It's a joy to watch the Christmas lights at night.
You're gonna have to eat. So why not eat tasty food, and enjoy this iconic place at the same time?

Visit The National Gallery:
National Gallery is an impressive collection of over 2,300 paintings from the 13th to the 20th century. You can see paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, Van Gogh, and Rembrandt without spending a single penny. The museum also offers free guided tours, audio guides, and family activities to enhance your experience and help you learn more about the paintings and their history.
Check the museum's website to see which exhibits are currently on display and plan your visit accordingly. It is a large gallery, and it can take several hours to see all the shows. Plan to spend at least a few hours, and consider taking a break at the cafe or restaurant. With so many paintings, it can be overwhelming to try to see everything. Focus on your favorite artists or styles, and use the map to plan your route.
It is located at Trafalgar Square. You can easily spend a whole day exploring the gallery and nearby attractions like the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Houses of Parliament. Zero dollars spent on the day!"

"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 3:25:38 AM GMT+1","If your transport usage during the week you are there aligns with Monday to Sunday then I would definitely avoid a week pass. Use tap to pay (ensuring it’s always the same card/device) and your travel will be capped at day/week pass rates. So you’ll pay the week pass rate at maximum, but less if your usage is below the cap."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 12:40:11 PM GMT+1","Don’t expect ice in your drinks. In fact expect all your beverages to be room temperature.

Don’t ever cut in line. Respect the que!

Take time to familiarize yourself with the Underground (the subway affectionately known as The Tube) before you leave. However, Uber is fun to use because you can chat up the driver and learn a lot about the city and London culture.

London is a big, exciting, old and crowded city. Your biggest challenge will be deciding what you have time to do.

You never tip 20% as standard in the UK unless you are showing off or really want them to remember you on your next visit.

You don't need to tip at all, especially if it isn't table service. Even then it might well be included in the bill for many restaurants anyway. It will be appreciated but isn't essential."

"Friday, March 3, 2023 at 11:13:14 PM GMT+1","I just wanted to add for emphasis, because there were several conflicting recommendations in the comments so far: You do NOT need an Oyster card if you have Google Pay or Apple Pay on your phone. I loved being able to tap in and out of the Tube stations with my phone only. It is very convenient and works like a charm. I pretty much went everywhere using the Tube.

Other suggestions:

Definitely use the reservation/electronic-ticket thing for museums. Most are free, but you save a lot of time by doing the reservation ahead.

At the British Museum, there are two entrance, front and back. Use the back one; it is rarely crowded, while the one in front usually has really long queues. Also, unless you plan on multiple visits (which I did), the British Museum is HUGE, like the Met in NYC, so best to choose a few areas to focus on. Also, if it is crowded, go to the top floor first and work your way down. Most people start at the first floor and work up.

If you are staying in central London and decide to go to the Tower of London (which I thought was WAY over-priced and sort of disappointing), take the Thames Uber-Boat instead of the Tube. It is way faster, and you get a ""cruise"" on the Thames.

I did afternoon Tea and it was not my cup of tea. Expensive and boring. But be sure to go to a good pub and get ""Sunday roast"" with Yorkshire pudding. It's awesome.

If you get fish and chips in a pub, the piece of fish you get is HUGE, so be hungry.

If you are a fan of IPA beer, prepare to be disappointed."
"Friday, March 3, 2023 at 11:24:07 PM GMT+1","I agree with all of the above except the last point. It would very much depend on what type of “IPA Fan” you are.

If all you like is a very specific style (perhaps brewed close to where toe from), then you may indeed be disappointed.

If all you like is higher ABV (Impeerial, double, triple, etc) or very distinctly hopped IPAs, then do your homework. It’s definitely here, but you need to know where to find it. This includes beer brewed in London, in the UK more generally, and from around the world.

If you only like modern IPAs, then any place that advertises as selling craft beer (they’re everywhere) will probably suit your fancy.

If you don’t do your homework and just ask for what’s available in the closest old-looking pub then chances are high you might be served a “real ale IPA on cask.” If you don’t know what this is, aren’t aware of IPA or general UK beer history and have only drank modern IPAs then you may be very confused and disappointed.

On the other hand, if you like knowing about history, brewing, serving, and transport in addition to the taste and aroma then there’s a lot to take away from this experience! While very different in taste, aroma and texture to a modern IPA, these beers are as close to a historic IPA as you will get. Read up on the history and enjoy!

For anyone else reading this that would be interested and that has more than a week available then visit Button-upon-Trent. It was where the most popular original IPAs were brewed. It’s said it was because of the mineral content of the local water. Some places will “Burtonize” their water by adjusting the content to try and mimic it. If you really have the time you could also rent a narrow boat and toddle through parts of the canal route that the IPA would have made on its way down to London, stopping for pints at pubs along the route."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 1:27:10 AM GMT+1","I feel like this is an obvious one but don't give money to beggars etc.

Also if you're using the underground be prepared for there to be delays or last minute changes, it happens often.

I'd also advise you to visit different parts of the UK besides London if you're able to as everywhere is different

I don't mean to offend, don't be really loud when in a supermarket or something if you're confused. I don't know why but I've experienced this ALOT with Americans. Just ask people if you're confused or lost, most people are happy to help.

Good luck and have a brilliant time!"
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 2:01:52 AM GMT+1","Citymapper is better than Google maps for transit.

You will almost never need cash as everyone takes (contactless) cards or Apple Pay for most transactions. This includes public transport.

Tube stations are very close together in zone 1 so walk instead.

Don’t walk around staring at your phone as you’ll be putting yourself at risk of having it snatched (usually by a couple of kids on a bike).

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 12:56:52 PM GMT+1",Lots of great advice here. I would add use the buses as they are easy to figure out and they all seem to return to Trafalgar Square so you won’t get lost.

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 8:47:44 AM GMT+1","You do not need cash! Everything is tap as you go, people were more annoyed with us paying in pounds because we slowed up lines. Everywhere felt way more ahead with everyone tapping cards or phones to pay."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 8:55:03 AM GMT+1","Poppies fish and chips (splurge for the wild caught halibut), Gregg’s Sausage rolls, Sunday roast at Blacklock, E. Pellicci’s for a full English or lasagna, Houses of Parliament (if Andy or Sarah are your guides you are very lucky. Give them a hug from me), Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, Steak and Ale pie at the Red Lion by Westminster Abbey, take the Uber boats at least once, dive headfirst into pub culture, Bricklane market, salt beef bagel… I could go on and on. Have fun!!!"

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 9:14:18 AM GMT+1","Firstly, make sure to familiarize yourself with the local currency, the British Pound. Also, be aware of the differences in culture and customs. For example, Londoners tend to be more reserved and take politeness seriously, so it is important to be respectful and courteous. Additionally, be mindful of the different time zone, as the United Kingdom is five hours ahead of the United States. Finally, it is advisable to purchase a London Travelcard, as it allows for unlimited travel within London on public transport. With this in mind, be sure to take advantage of all the wonderful sights and attractions while in London!"
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 9:17:12 AM GMT+1","Seeing the Royal sites are not overrated for your first trip. Enjoy and take all the pics! Even if you don’t drink, embrace the pub life. It’s such an important part of English culture. Also ride the tube enough that you get comfortable with it and book a high tea somewhere nice."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 11:25:41 AM GMT+1","Sky Gardens is a free entry! You go all the way to the top and see basically all of London! But note, the food and drinks is a cost and they don’t take cash! I got amazing pics from the view there :)"
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 12:34:00 PM GMT+1","The Tower of London tour is also amazing! And best if you go when the guide is doing it.

Get yourself an OYSTER card as well, you can get a week pass for zones 1-5 but zone 6 is a pay per trip."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 1:01:30 PM GMT+1","It depends on what your interests are and how you like to see/tour/vacation. If you enjoy walking and don't have an ambitious list of trying to hit all the major touristy things in your short week, start in the neighborhood where you will be staying and, by foot, explore/visit/see the things surrounding your hotel and then work your way further out in perimeter. You miss a lot whizzing from museum to museum to museum by tube or bus. Some places I'd say are ""must see/tour"" include the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey (so much history in both and incredible architecture) and for fun British royal tradition, get to the palace early to get a good standing location for the changing of the guard.

Edit to add: LOOK RIGHT WHEN CROSSING AND THE BIKES WILL KILL YOU BEFORE THE CARS WILL"

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 2:45:25 PM GMT+1",Echo the London pass. Cost around $120 when I went for a week in 2009 got in to a lot of places I wanted to see. Also agree that when I used the tube I missed out of a lot of the “scenery” or history shall I say.

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 3:14:26 PM GMT+1","Getting around: London has an extensive public transportation system that includes the tube (subway), buses, and trains. The easiest way to get around is to purchase an Oyster card, which is a rechargeable smart card that can be used on all forms of public transportation. You can purchase an Oyster card at most tube stations, and it will save you money on fares compared to buying individual tickets."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 3:18:39 PM GMT+1",London a kinda sucks. Manchester is super tigght - highly recommend
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 3:41:44 PM GMT+1",Did you enjoy our phone boxes? They come with such beautiful scents.
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 4:38:10 PM GMT+1",Lmao. I didn’t dare to go in.
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 4:41:43 PM GMT+1",London was one of the coolest cities I’ve ever visited. Even a week wasn’t enough to explore all the tourist attractions and hidden gems! Lovely pics.
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 4:45:45 PM GMT+1","Even a week wasn’t enough to explore all the tourist attractions

You could visit a new museum every week in London for three years. It's genuinely hard to overstate just how many fantastic historical places there are there."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 4:58:20 PM GMT+1",What are some examples? I’m sorta interested but not totally sold yet.
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 5:09:25 PM GMT+1","London dungeons, Big Ben and the houses of Parliament, all the museums, London eye, Tower of London, lots and lots of live shows and sports events all the time, Buckingham Palace, the Shard, Shakespeare's globe, Tate modern. London's one of the best cities in the world, a million things to do."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 6:14:47 PM GMT+1","London is absolutely full of things worth visiting as a tourist. I’m not from London, but am British so have been around 100 times or so to London. I’m also quite well travelled and can say the only cities that can compete with it for sheer number of attractions are New York, Paris, Rome, Luxor/Cairo.

In terms of stuff to do, here’s a list. Will try to avoid writing detail about everything:

MUST SEE

Palace of Westminster/Big Ben, London Eye and Westminster Abbey

Tower Bridge and Tower of London

The walking route of Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Regent Street and Oxford Street. This is the most iconic set of London walkways

British Museum - for ancient/classical period, this is hands down the best museum in the world, better than Louvre still.

Greenwich - the view from the hill of Canary Wharf is beautiful; the observatory and meridian are amazing too; naval museum nice too

City of London/the Shard,Tate Modern, St Paul’s Cathedral, London Bridge/Southbank, Borough Market. These are all so close to each other, definitely a must to visit this region as each individual thing is very good.

personally think though Globe Theatre is a bit overrated, it’s just a reconstruction.

WORTH SEEING IF HAVE TIME

Various sporting venues, these are some of the most famous in the world: Wembley, Lord’s, Twickenham, Wimbledon, Olympic Park

Museum Quarter Kensington - Natural History, V+A, Science

Churchill War Rooms

Buckingham Palace - very controversial but this is overrated for me, probably because the aesthetic is done to death on our News channels. For international tourists, it’s probably much more interesting

Kew Gardens

Harrod’s - this is pretty awesome if you like shopping, though mostly unaffordable.

Soho, Shoreditch for the younger person/bar/club scene. Clapham if that’s youre thing too..

ESSENTIAL DAY TRIPS

Oxford and/or Cambridge. I am biased being an alumnus, but there are no cities in England as unique, medieval and pretty as these (except the small Cotswold towns but they are far). These are England’s equivalent to Europe’s preserved medieval gems - ie. Prague, Lisbon , Edinburgh. The punt down the river Cam is breathtaking.

Stonehenge

(only if you want to desperately see a castle) Windsor Castle, Warwick Castle, Dover Castle

SEMI-ESSENTIAL DAY TRIPS

Chalk coasts of Southern England - Dover, Seven Sisters

(if have time to stay over 1 night) EDINBURGH - this is the prettiest city in the U.K. and one of the best in Europe

Bath"

"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 7:51:52 PM GMT+1",M8 if london doesn’t have enough tourist attractions for you then you aren’t leaving your front room…
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 9:08:51 PM GMT+1","We just start walking and let ourselves get lost, eating at random places that look nice etc.

I never did any of the “tourist” stuff, and still it’s one of my favorite cities ever.

It has this charm you can’t find anywhere else."
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 9:11:10 PM GMT+1",What hidden gems did you find?
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 9:47:22 PM GMT+1",WHAT I live right next to London and when I have to go there for the day I can't find anything to do
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 9:56:09 PM GMT+1","London is considered 'basic' by some I guess, but damn. I've been to 60 countries and London is one of my favorite cities..."
"Sunday, March 5, 2023 at 12:08:54 AM GMT+1","It’s just effortlessly fun. You can spend days just enjoying life across museums, parks, beautiful walks, pubs etc"
"Sunday, March 5, 2023 at 12:51:34 AM GMT+1","Effortlessly fun is a stretch, it’s still a concrete jungle"
"Sunday, March 5, 2023 at 2:56:14 AM GMT+1","Same, I loved London. Even my wife who doesn't care for cities had a great time. A very welcoming place to be, very fun too."
"Sunday, March 5, 2023 at 4:13:57 PM GMT+1",These so called basic cities are my favourite places to visit.
"Tuesday, March 7, 2023 at 1:16:33 PM GMT+1",Same!
"Saturday, March 4, 2023 at 7:52:44 AM GMT+1","Do you have some favorite restaurants or pubs or ""must dos""?"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:36:23 PM GMT+1",I've been for the second time in my life in may. I normally don't like being in a city too much but London is just so cool. I love it.

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:20:09 PM GMT+1",Always happy someone enjoyed our city. Hurry back!
"Saturday, July 8, 2023 at 4:30:48 PM GMT+1","Definitely will. Love it here! Also, you guys are the nicest & sweetest people I have ever encountered while traveling & I’ve been to many countries. It was a great time."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:08:41 PM GMT+1",Agreed. Nice to hear some positivity about our city. Usually all I get is I do not get why you live here etc. I think also people need to understand London is not just Westminster/Piccadilly etc. Lots of boroughs will different characters.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:28:45 PM GMT+1",Never a bad time in London Town
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:23:16 PM GMT+1","London is my home and many people who live here like to hate on it or don't appreciate it. But as someone who has travelled to many different cities around the world I know how amazing this city is.

It has so much history, impressive architecture, lots of landmarks, many attractions, world class museums (that are free to enter), great theatre shows, beautiful parks, excellent public transport, a large variety of food options...I could go on.

Yes it's expensive and the weather can be gloomy at times but not many cities can offer as much as London can."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:49:27 PM GMT+1","I think people don’t like it for other reasons, like roadmen, stabbings, crime, weather, traffic etc"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 10:36:05 AM GMT+1",Yay I’m going in a couple weeks to London! Can’t wait

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:00:10 PM GMT+1",I moved to london 7 years ago and the one thing I didn’t foresee is that it’s ruined traveling to other Western cities for me. This last year I was in Madrid and NYC and both times I missed London after a day and just wanted to go home lol

"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 7:25:24 PM GMT+1","As a Londoner, here’s a few of my favourites to take non-London visitors: Dishoom for Iranian Indian, Goodman for a fantastic steak, Gloria for Italian, El Pastor for Mexican, Brat for Spanish, Ippudo for ramen, Kulu Kulu for cheap but amazing, no frills sushi, Yalla Yalla for Lebanese. Mum Likes Thai Food in Bethnal Green for the best pad Thai ever. Cha cha roll for sushi burritos."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:14:03 PM GMT+1","Definitely visit Camden Town Market. Huge indoor market with shopping and all the ethnic street food you can imagine. All of Camden Town was cool and covered in art and graffiti. I also enjoyed walking around Covent Garden, the uppity area in West End. There’s opera singers, live music, lots of cafés, and super pretty. Have fun."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:20:04 PM GMT+1","There are just too many options to recommend anything, go to the areas recommended on this thread and you’ll find loads also try Borough market."

"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:59:01 AM GMT+1","Lina Stores for some of the best pasta I've ever tasted! Bancone is another one. They make fresh pasta daily. Ah, there's always a highly rated restaurant in every block - trust the Google ratings!"

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:39:58 PM GMT+1","Have a look at Fergus Henderson’s restaurants to see if you like the look of them. My personal favourite is Bread & Wine, ymmv but I’ve had some of the best restaurant meals of my life there."

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:21:44 PM GMT+1","I’m going at the end of August, im so excited!! Any recs?"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:25:52 PM GMT+1","Lots of my friends live in London so I visit often, we once did this text ""treasure hunt"" that was so much fun and takes you walking through some iconic places and cozy side streets. You start in a location and you are texted your first clue, you have to look around you to figure it out then text the answer back to get the next clue. Sometimes you even had to interact with bar staff /others to get clues!

I can't remember the exact company but it was something like this www.inthehiddencity.com/london-treasure-hunt

If you are able bodied and up for a lot of walking I'd absolutely recommend it!

Also I think it's worth having a drink in the shard to take in the views, you don't have to book and can just queue for a table. There were 3 of us last time we did this and we shared a bottle of wine, it was £40 so pricey, but between 3 it wasn't too bad and the views are breathtaking, especially the view from the toilets!"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:51:23 PM GMT+1",same! i had very high expectations and still exceeded them! loved london
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:30:02 PM GMT+1",How's London in late December? Still a good time to visit and explore?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:28:45 AM GMT+1","It’s dark and cold, but with the run up to Christmas there’s loads of things happening and everyone is in good spirits."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:39:55 PM GMT+1","I live in London sand sadly, December is not the best time. The sun goes down at around 4pm and the weather is quite miserable. Fortunately there are lots of free museums and pubs you can visit to stay warm and still have a great time! Also if you like Xmas there’s all the lights in regents street and winter wonderland. Enjoy the big smoke!"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:53:36 PM GMT+1","Yup, definitely.

September is your purgatory,

Christmas is your heaven,

When the stinking streets of summer,

Are washed away by rain,

At the dark end of a lonely street,

That's where you lose your pain,

'Tis then your eyes light up my love,

And sparkle once again

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 5:46:05 PM GMT+1","It’s actually ‘thrice’ although not used much in the U.K. any more. Trice comes from the phrase ‘in a trice’, which means ‘an instant’. The US uses ‘thrice’ more than we do. I think that’s what you mean. Pedantic speech over."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:13:47 PM GMT+1","Mine too. I never had any particular interest in London but was transiting through it, twice, so decided I really should spend some time there. I absolutely loved it and actually went back a few years later."

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:17:50 PM GMT+1","London is my favorite city in the world. I did an internship there a decade back, and I truly wish I had had my wits about me to turn it into a full time job.

I'm taking my husband in a couple months, and I cannot wait to show him everything."

I'll approve that"

"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:01:41 AM GMT+1","Thanks! That is Gordon Ramsay’s’ famous Beef Wellington, the one dish that causes so much drama in Hell’s Kitchen. The service at his restaurant is snooty but kids eat free & the food is great."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 2:29:33 AM GMT+1",Going in August can’t wait
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:05:47 AM GMT+1",One of my favorite cities!
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 2:42:19 AM GMT+1","Same. My first time there last April and I wasn't expecting to enjoy the food so much. I thought I'd be eating fish and chips all day, which I don't mind, but London is a melting pot of different cultures and the variety of food choices is overwhelming."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:46:48 AM GMT+1","In my opinion, London's royal heritage, stylish appeal, distinctiveness, rich history, and seamless blend of tradition and modernity make it the most beautiful city in the world, particularly as a megapolis. It is a place where the past seamlessly intertwines with the present, creating a cityscape that is both awe-inspiring and enchanting."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:16:24 AM GMT+1",I've been to London more than 6 times i think. On my this year's visit i absolutely wanted to see The phantom of the opera. And so i did!
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:22:40 AM GMT+1",How?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 9:10:27 AM GMT+1",great photos. Thanks.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 4:08:21 PM GMT+1",London is incredible. It's the biggest city in Europe and you could spend a month there and hardly scratch the surface.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:31:36 PM GMT+1","As someone who lives in London, can I ask what particularly u liked? All the pictures just look so normal to me since walk around it all day. It's so weird to hear u describe the place I live the same way I would describe probably somewhere close to where u live. I'm glad u enjoyed my city tho"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:23:09 PM GMT+1",You just reminded me I didn’t even get a beef Wellington when in UK ffs
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:24:33 PM GMT+1",Looks pretty gay
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 8:20:33 PM GMT+1",The Mrs and I went for 6 days just a month ago. We both loved London. Will definitely be going back.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:12:26 PM GMT+1","I've lived here twice in my life, and both times I dreaded leaving. Miss just having the freedom to take public transport, walk and enter a random museum.

Maybe, sometime in the future, I will be fortunate enough to enter another museum."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:34:49 PM GMT+1","my hubby and I went there a month ago, it was his first time in London, and my 4th time as I just love it. Now he fell in love with it too, and we are both open to move there eventually if possible at some point. :)"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:49:38 PM GMT+1","I’m visiting next week. Your pics got me excited, thanks for sharing! How’s the weather right now?"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:39:13 AM GMT+1","Central London is definitely a must see, although like every major city the further you go from central the worse it gets. Richmond and Twickenham are beautiful places, but Hounslow not so much."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:03:30 PM GMT+1",Good pictures.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:16:16 AM GMT+1","Can I ask what your favorite parts were? The uk has always been at the bottom of my list for travel destinations but I’m trying to convince myself it’s worth going to

Edit to add, I like traveling to experience wildly different cultures than what I’m used to (I want extreme culture shock), being American, and England just doesn’t seem like the kind of place that would give me any sort of culture shock. Like the top of my list right now, even though it’ll never happen sadly, would be to visit Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia, etc."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:04:51 PM GMT+1","I'm not the OP but London is along with NYC the top city in the world. The sheer amount of things to see, do, eat and experience is staggering. I'd say it has a slight edge over NYC due to its 2000 year history. Most of its museums are even free, which is remarkable."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:15:55 PM GMT+1","Where were you from, how low were your expectations! That’s not even the nice parts, that’s my old commute where we keep the tourists restricted to! Seriously though, London is a gem if you know where to look and most of the highlights are only 100m from the touristy areas TBH."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:15:23 AM GMT+1",I’m from all over & my expectations were super low. I guess I just envisioned it much differently. I was proven 100% wrong & hope to see more next time.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:06:15 AM GMT+1",Would anyone mind sharing what they enjoyed most about London? Things to do or see?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:38:14 AM GMT+1",The most x thing I ever saw
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:40:04 AM GMT+1",Bucket list trip for me!!
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 2:03:27 AM GMT+1",Did you eat at Sheekeys?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:08:52 AM GMT+1",what are buildings 9&10?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:26:11 AM GMT+1",cheap bags too
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:53:59 AM GMT+1","For anyone planning a trip to London and wants a fun, educational and scary experience - do the London Bridge Experience and Tombs."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 7:10:55 AM GMT+1",Did you plan your own trip or did you have help? Planning a family trip next summer and I don't know where to start.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:26:47 AM GMT+1","Lunch at St Katharine's docks, wander past Tower Bridge, and tower of London - get Thames Tour boat (£7) from tower of London dock, you can sit open air on top, hear the guide tell you what you are passing and get a beer from the bar. Get off at Westminster, walk over the bridge past parliament, Westminster Abbey, up past the horse guards Palace and throgub trafalgar square and grab some dinner in China Town and hang out in Soho for the night 👌🏼"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 10:45:52 AM GMT+1",I like how you planned it out step by step. 😊
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 11:42:25 AM GMT+1","Not cheap, but we hired a guy to take us to the oldest bars in town. So much fun. Think he was drunker than us. Lol"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:07:33 PM GMT+1","Adding on... Go visit the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese bar (: one of these locations is older and had an author visit there I think Charles Dickens? It's a cool older bar and I remember it served Samuel Smith beer which is delicious 😋 enjoy your trip! When I went back in 2019 there were 2 locations, it might just be one now."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:10:40 PM GMT+1",Some museums are free. Harrods is nice for some window shopping.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:29:06 PM GMT+1",London is a great walking city. The South Bank by the Thames is a great place to go. If you're a beer drinker then London has many many pubs. I also recommend doing the City River tour that takes you to Greenwich. Then you can stand on 2 different time zones...
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:55:27 PM GMT+1","Most galleries museums are free or if there's a cost it's pretty cheap. My personal faves the National Art Gallery by trafalgar square, the Magic Circle Museum, the National History Museum (it's also right by the Science Museum in South Kensinton) and the Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities.

Another fav things of mine to do is walk along the canals and sit by a spot around the canals on King'sCross or Islington with some wine/cheese.

There's also cematary visits/walks ...Highgate Cematary is great .

Also Parkland walk is one of my favs....it stretches through to Finsbury Park and is basically an abandoned train route turned overgrown path filled with graffiti, street art, and random public art."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 6:43:22 PM GMT+1",Try to get tickets to the Sky Garden. Free Tickets release Mondays for the next month. Also the Rooftop at 120 Fenchurch is free!
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 7:25:30 PM GMT+1",Eat at Dishoom
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 9:40:11 PM GMT+1","I liked the markets like Camden and spitalfields, walking all over, Indian food and the British library"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 11:03:17 PM GMT+1","I totally second the British Library! Handwritten Beatles lyrics, Don Quixote manuscript, DaVinci notebooks, Jane Austen's desk, the Magna Carta, and on and on and on. Went there on a lark, ended up balling like a baby because I was so totally overwhelmed by the magnitude and importance of the artifacts they have on display. (I think it was ""Don Quixote"" that ultimately brought me to tears (is my favorite book of all time)). It's one of my favorite museums in London, and that's saying something. Really, can't recommend it enough if you like that kind of thing. Have a blast, London is totally fabulous!"
"Saturday, July 8, 2023 at 4:21:06 AM GMT+1",Go to Borough Market ( I sample all the foods I can 😛) visit the Sherlock Holmes Museum and take a walk across the Millennium Bridge. If your really into spooky and gothic things you should visit Highgate Cemetery.
"Sunday, July 16, 2023 at 8:41:41 AM GMT+1","As someone who has been to London six times and just got back in February, the biggest advice I can give you is to prioritize. What really interests you? Do you want history? Art? Are you a foodie? Shopping? Then go from there.

For history: Westminster Abbey Tower of London The Cutty Sark Tower Bridge Mueseum Churchhill War Rooms Whitehall Banqueting House

Art: Tate Modern National Portrait Gallery Victoria and Albert Museum British Mueseum

Food: There are tons of lists online depending on your tastes and budgets, so I'll defer to those. But my stand outs are:

St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square.

The White Lion in Covent Garden.

Shopping: Convent Garden/Jubilee Market Greenwich Market (especially if someone in your group loves jewelry and antiques).

My must do list for first timers:

Covent Garden/Jubilee Market

Take the hop on/hop off bus and explore.

Take the Thames Uber Boat to Greenwich for the Cutty Sark (a real 17th century tea ship and incredible museum) and Greenwich Market. Have tea at The Orangery, located in the Fan Museum (as in hand held fans, not ceiling fans). Also the Navel Academy, Maritime Mueseum, and the Queen's House.

Westminster Abbey, Tower of London, Tower Bridge Mueseum (seriously, check it out). Possibly the London Eye, if you have time.

V&A and British Mueseum"
"Saturday, November 4, 2023 at 4:39:31 PM GMT+1","The queens mile ( tower of London down to houses of Parliament) then up to Trafalgar square. Then go up and over to Piccadilly circus. Follow along regent street and oxford streets to bond street. There's a ton of free and interesting things to see along that path.

I think south Kensington and Kensington gardens is a nice area to walk as well."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 8:47:12 PM GMT+1",One of the exits from Paddington station is Little Venice. It’s a nice walk along the canal.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:15:06 PM GMT+1","Fish and chips shop

Churchill's War Rooms. This was an awesome museum.

I know a lot of people didn't like Stonehenge, but we took a private tour that allowed you to go into the rocks, and it was surreal.

Jack the Ripper tour. Make sure you research this one. I saw a lot of theatrical tour guides that were all show and no substance. Our tour guide had written a book and knew his stuff."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:36:56 PM GMT+1",The Prime Meridian at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was the highlight of my last London trip.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:52:43 PM GMT+1",Highgate Cemetery and Hampstead Heath/Parliament Hill is a nice walk
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:19:21 AM GMT+1","I was just in London 3 weeks ago! Although we didn’t do many “free” things, I will post my adventures. • The London Eye • Westminster Abbey • Tower Bridge • Piccadilly Circus

London is a very walkable city. I would also suggest getting a pass for the Tube. It’s very convenient and easy to navigate. The hop on hop off bus is a great way to see the city. I always do this on day one to get a feel for the city.

Also, the Eurostar train can take you to Paris in 2.5 hours. I would highly recommend seeing both cities if you have time. It’s a great day trip."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 8:18:15 PM GMT+1","Tower of London, The Shard. Hop on/hop off buses"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:36:38 PM GMT+1",You're a prat
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:51:46 PM GMT+1","I have some frugal tips. The national rail is running a two for one deal right now for some popular London attractions (Tower of London, London eye, Tower bridge, etc). If you download the Rick Steves app you can listen to a guided walking tour of the city for free. Also, you can get very discounted theater tickets the day of at the TKTS booth in Leicestershire square."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:06:28 PM GMT+1",Where do you see that promo? Is that for london subway as well?
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:54:50 PM GMT+1","You can also check out the Today Tix app if you won’t be able to get to the TKTS booth—if you’re willing to sit in the back, you can see excellent West End shows for £20-30."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:14:31 AM GMT+1","Make a reservation at Lounge Bohemia bar in Shoreditch. Pizza East is a great place to have dinner before. Seriously, you will never go to a bar like Lounge Bohemia ever. Anywhere. Very unique drinks. Worth going to. Order anything."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 2:03:46 AM GMT+1","British Museum has everything you've ever heard of.

I found Churchill's war room absolutely fascinating.

Boat ride on the Thames - not a fancy boat, just take the water taxi thing down to Greenwich and ride the train back."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:05:21 AM GMT+1",I do like boat rides.
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 12:51:43 AM GMT+1",Indian food and dim sum in London are some of the best in the world outside of their native countries
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 12:58:46 AM GMT+1","You can observe a session of Parliament. They really do hiss, grumble and occasionally shout out at the other side. A little on the nerdy side but was really interesting to us."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 2:51:36 AM GMT+1",How long could I observe a session of parliament?
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 5:35:18 AM GMT+1","Lunch at St Katharine’s as someone mentioned, and I quite enjoyed going to Sky Garden. You can also do a boat tour down the Thames and it’s a great time!"

I took an online class and it was still good, I live across the pond, I'm hoping to go to one in person eventually."
"Thursday, June 15, 2023 at 11:33:07 PM GMT+1","Take a boat tour down the Thames, take a bus tour around the city for orientation, go to the Tower of London, take a train to Bath for the day.

It's the typical stuff but none of it is very expensive."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 3:25:50 AM GMT+1","The British Museum is free, can spend hours there. I also enjoy walking around in Chelsea looking at all the posh houses. If your a Harry Potter fan you can also go to Platform 9 3/4 at Kings Cross Station and get a photo with the shopping cart."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 12:27:09 AM GMT+1","Depends on your interests a little many museums are free British museum, Natural history museum, science museum, national gallery (I believe) and more . I think the tower of London is cool(not free) if you do the tower get the beefeater(the guards) tour they come regularly it's some history and fun stories relatively short and included in the price, go have a picnic (pick up cheap sandwich crisp(potato chips) combo 3-5 pounds many grocery places go to a park enjoy the park and eat. Others mentioned seeing tower bridge, big Ben, horse guard, Trafalgar square etc. I could suggest more with some interests and knowing if you have kids etc. Sis lives near London been a few times can suggest day trips as well."

"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 6:12:38 PM GMT+1","Not free but a standing ticket at Shakespeares Globe Theater is super cheap!! Like £5? Even though you have to stand the entire show, the actors are interactive and go through the audience throughout the play so it’s more fun than the seats IMO."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 2:35:11 AM GMT+1",You get that for only 5 pounds? Sold!
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 4:05:24 AM GMT+1",This walk is fantastic. It starts along a disused railway track and ends up at Alexander palace. Lots to see along the walk. And a map to follow in link. https://parkland-walk.org.uk/
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 4:31:36 AM GMT+1","The Rittscher Museum is great. For something unusual try Jeremy Soames house (spelling?). Walking around near Leicester Square at night is fun, and the National Gallery is amazing. Sometimes academy of St Martin the Field is rehearsing next door and you can watch for free. River walk near the reproduction of Shakespeare theater is nice too."
"Sunday, November 19, 2023 at 3:50:40 PM GMT+1",Harrod's food floor is amazing and also enjoyed Churchill's war rooms which just opened for tours
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 5:46:54 AM GMT+1","Greenwich Park is free, gigantic and beautiful. It has so many spaces that you could spend an entire day exploring it. The meridian is at the top of a hill with an observatory and a great view. Outstanding children’s park too. The Docklands museum is free and a brief tube ride from Greenwich Park. London has some of the best Indian food in the world and I also always get Thai food and Lebanese food when I’m there and skip most of the typical English foods."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 12:51:30 PM GMT+1",Jack the Ripper walking tour!
"Saturday, June 17, 2023 at 11:19:35 AM GMT+1","Go to the

Without a shadow of doubt the most Amazing Museum in London, every time I go to London I spend a few hours there, I've been 5 times and still see thing I've never seen its mostly free but they have exhibits that change, They charge a minimal fee and are always worth a look.

If you walk out within 4 hours of your first visit id be surprised."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 9:00:38 AM GMT+1","Picnic on Primrose Hill, and walk around Camden Market to grab some delicious food!"
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 2:24:53 PM GMT+1","Download VoiceMap. They are audio walking tours. Not very expensive individually. But often viator and groupon will offer deals on a bundle.

You also don't need to buy an Oyster Card if you have Apple or Google Pay. The turnstiles will let you pay directly from your phone."

"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 5:07:46 PM GMT+1","I’m always on the lookout for lovely gardens, food, and museums. Strolling around Kensington was beautiful. We went to Stratford-on-Avon and loved Anne Hathaway’s cottage and garden. I was also so impressed with the general feel around anywhere I went in England that their outside space was revered and so neat & planted with lovely flowers. I’m going back next year & plan on Kew Gardens, Chelsea Physic Garden and several more around London. I love to look at gorgeous food and Harrod’s food court was mind blowing. I just stared and salivated for hours. British Museum & Victoria & Albert Museum are not to be missed. Try to just chill out some. I used to wear myself out on vacation but I take a breather now & then and remember that I can’t get it all in. So….enjoy!"
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 5:34:59 PM GMT+1","Walking tours. London has TONS of them and they are, in my book, the best way to see the city. They all have different themes and purposes including for specific historical periods like the Blitz or Victorian, there's pub crawls through historic pubs, there's also ones for famous figures like Charles Dickens, Shakespeare, and Jack the Ripper. My family has done many of these and some more than once, even on ones we've done before we always see and learn something new."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 9:10:39 PM GMT+1","The best money I spent there was for the Big Red Bus pass. You can ride different routes to all the sites, get off, walk around, get back on, all the major attractions are accessible and it's a cost saver on transportation! I have to make a trip back...loved that city, didn't have enough time there!"
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:34:38 AM GMT+1",Great tip! What is the cost of the big red bus pass?

"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:35:12 AM GMT+1","Borough market is super yummy. I often get a picnic there when I’m in town. I can vouch for the empanada stand, the mushroom pate, and the custard tarts, gosh yum!

Prince Albert’s museums are free, they include the Victoria and Albert as well as the Natural History one, it looks like a cathedral but every detail is made to honor nature. I love Prince Albert for his patronage and legacy of educational palaces for us.

It’s also free to wander Covent Garden, if you’re there on a good weather day it’s also a musical treat with many buskers.

Restaurants - Masgouf (incredible Iraqi food), Le Comptoire (try the pomegranate chicken), Clarence pub at Trafalgar Square :)"
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 12:46:15 PM GMT+1","We did a Jack the Ripper tour — which was fun— as ya got a walking tour with it as well.

My fav part of the trip was wandering around the different SOHO pubs late at night — catching live bands— and mingling with locals."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 3:28:51 AM GMT+1","Sky Garden is a beautiful observation deck that is free but you do need to have a ticket.

"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 4:46:28 AM GMT+1",We did a red bus tour to see all the things we might want to visit on our own. A nice way to see a lot of London quickly and choose what you want to do on your own.
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 5:38:37 AM GMT+1",I like the idea of seeing a lot of London in a short amount of time.
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 7:22:06 AM GMT+1","Go to the theater! The theater is partially funded by the state and ticket prices are reasonable compared to Broadway. You can see big time English actors doing live theater. I've seen Ralph Fiennes and Judy Dench on stage in London. (They both played M in the recent Daniel Craig James Bond movies if you don't recognize those names.)

https://www.walks.com/ are walking tours of London scheduled in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Some really fascinating subjects including Jack the Ripper, Shakespeare & Dickens, the Beatles, etc.

Finally, take a tour of the Tower. Fascinating history and the Crown Jewels are on display."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 8:46:44 AM GMT+1","The Sir John Soan museum in Holborn is an incredible small museum stuffed with the great man’s collection and is a brilliant window into the 18th and early 19th century upper class mind (although he came from humble beginnings). It has wonderful art as well, especially an incredible Canaletto. It’s also around the corner from Lincoln’s Inn, one of the four Inns of Court and is so worth a walk around, it’s full of beautiful architecture and is still a hive of activity for barristers, you can get a guided tour."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 10:08:42 AM GMT+1","I could happily spend all day in any of the many free museums. Once I’m done with the museum, I like wallowing the neighborhood. There are lots of I interesting shops and parks around. Some of the small old streets are cool to explore as well."

"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 9:00:48 PM GMT+1","You’ve had quite a lot of comments. I’m sure it will have been mentioned, but the Natural History Museum is a must. Get there when it opens and get the dinosaurs done first then do what you can of the rest of this incredible place. I’d recommend a wander around Camden Market too."

"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 12:25:38 PM GMT+1","Those are some of my favourite free spots in London and places where I took friends/relatives coming to visit me:

Greenwich - the Maritime Museum is free and if you walk up to the observatory you have a breathtaking view. You can go there with the boat from London city centre. I think one of the spots to get the boat for Greenwich is London Bridge station and another Embankment but you have certainly more options.

Richmond park (you see deers just hanging around) and you can walk on the Thames

Camden Town is worth to see

Tate modern (free + nice walk on the Thames bank).

St. Paul cathedral (I saw it for free, not sure if this is a rule or I was just lucky)

Bucking Palace, you can see the change of the guard for free from the gate

Hyde Park is worth visiting

Bear in mind that most museums in London are free: national history, science museum, naval museum, Victoria and Albert museum, National Gallery, British museum and so on.

The only attraction I paid a ticket for and I thought it was well worth a visit was Hampton Court. My favourite thing were the gardens and the park, so if it is a raining day might not be a good idea to go there.

South bank is a nice walk too, and there is always something going on, often for free.

You can find free event on Time Out London."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:18:34 PM GMT+1",Thank you so much for your input and telling me about Time Out London. I will check it out for more free things to do. Cheers!
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:19:53 PM GMT+1",Borough Market. And just near there is George Inn Gallery Pub which was founded in 1542 and Shakespeare used to drink there!
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 1:32:44 PM GMT+1","and Shakespeare used to drink there!

It is possible but there doesn't seem to be any evidence for that, and the current building was built after he died You can have Charles Dickens at least."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 2:01:23 PM GMT+1","I thought no one knows if Shakespeare ever existed. Did he? Also, thanks for your suggestions. ☺️"
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 2:30:42 PM GMT+1",Not free but £15 or cheaper if you’re a student. London Walks is amazing. All of their guides are excellent and they cover so many interesting topics on their walks.
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 3:27:30 PM GMT+1","I am not a student, sadly 😔"
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 3:39:10 PM GMT+1","When you get there, take a look at air bnb in the ""experiences"" category! It has tons of activities that locals host that you can pay to do, like pub crawls, different classes (cooking and art), or really great in depth walking tours. My friend and I went last October and went on a really excellent walking tour with a local archeologist who showed us a bunch of really cool historical sites throughout the city."
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 5:10:52 PM GMT+1",Great tip! Do I need to book an air bnb?

The latter shop once attracted ASAP Rocky, who got into a fight... likely over which bagel shop is better. There's an interesting article about them both here: Beigel Bake vs Beigal Shop"
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 8:25:25 PM GMT+1","If you want to save cash, get the London pass and you can hit most of the popular attractions for a steep discount (once you have the pass, the entrances are included.)"
"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 8:30:57 PM GMT+1",I didn’t know there is a London pass. I will shell out money for something that is included in the price.

"Friday, June 16, 2023 at 10:02:47 PM GMT+1","Went to London in 2012 for Olympics, I did the following:

London Bridge Tour -it was ""ehh"" --like 30 pounds or something

Torchure Museum - it was ""cool, and woah"" - like 30 pounds or something

Downtown London for food and sites - it was ""meh, it's a city"" - 20 pounds at most

Big Ben - it's a clock tower.. take a pic and move on - FREE

Harry Potter Studios - it was ""cool, i'd do it again"" - 40-50 pounds i think

Olympic Soccer Match for bronze - ""almost fell asleep, but beer was good"" - I can't remember Pounds or something.

Saw a Fox or something at 2am roaming the streets of London while we figured out how to get to a night bus route because the trains all stopped at 1am or something like that and just stopped and we had to get off miles before our exit. - it was ""pretty awsome and adventurous!"" - FREE!"

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:44:49 PM GMT+1",Lmao. I didn’t dare to go in.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:20:09 PM GMT+1",London was one of the coolest cities I’ve ever visited. Even a week wasn’t enough to explore all the tourist attractions and hidden gems! Lovely pics.
"Saturday, July 8, 2023 at 4:30:48 PM GMT+1","Even a week wasn’t enough to explore all the tourist attractions

You could visit a new museum every week in London for three years. It's genuinely hard to overstate just how many fantastic historical places there are there."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:08:41 PM GMT+1",What are some examples? I’m sorta interested but not totally sold yet.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:28:45 PM GMT+1","London dungeons, Big Ben and the houses of Parliament, all the museums, London eye, Tower of London, lots and lots of live shows and sports events all the time, Buckingham Palace, the Shard, Shakespeare's globe, Tate modern. London's one of the best cities in the world, a million things to do."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:23:16 PM GMT+1","London is absolutely full of things worth visiting as a tourist. I’m not from London, but am British so have been around 100 times or so to London. I’m also quite well travelled and can say the only cities that can compete with it for sheer number of attractions are New York, Paris, Rome, Luxor/Cairo.

In terms of stuff to do, here’s a list. Will try to avoid writing detail about everything:

MUST SEE

Palace of Westminster/Big Ben, London Eye and Westminster Abbey

Tower Bridge and Tower of London

The walking route of Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Regent Street and Oxford Street. This is the most iconic set of London walkways

British Museum - for ancient/classical period, this is hands down the best museum in the world, better than Louvre still.

Greenwich - the view from the hill of Canary Wharf is beautiful; the observatory and meridian are amazing too; naval museum nice too

City of London/the Shard,Tate Modern, St Paul’s Cathedral, London Bridge/Southbank, Borough Market. These are all so close to each other, definitely a must to visit this region as each individual thing is very good.

personally think though Globe Theatre is a bit overrated, it’s just a reconstruction.

WORTH SEEING IF HAVE TIME

Various sporting venues, these are some of the most famous in the world: Wembley, Lord’s, Twickenham, Wimbledon, Olympic Park

Museum Quarter Kensington - Natural History, V+A, Science

Churchill War Rooms

Buckingham Palace - very controversial but this is overrated for me, probably because the aesthetic is done to death on our News channels. For international tourists, it’s probably much more interesting

Kew Gardens

Harrod’s - this is pretty awesome if you like shopping, though mostly unaffordable.

Soho, Shoreditch for the younger person/bar/club scene. Clapham if that’s youre thing too..

ESSENTIAL DAY TRIPS

Oxford and/or Cambridge. I am biased being an alumnus, but there are no cities in England as unique, medieval and pretty as these (except the small Cotswold towns but they are far). These are England’s equivalent to Europe’s preserved medieval gems - ie. Prague, Lisbon , Edinburgh. The punt down the river Cam is breathtaking.

Stonehenge

(only if you want to desperately see a castle) Windsor Castle, Warwick Castle, Dover Castle

SEMI-ESSENTIAL DAY TRIPS

Chalk coasts of Southern England - Dover, Seven Sisters

(if have time to stay over 1 night) EDINBURGH - this is the prettiest city in the U.K. and one of the best in Europe

Bath"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:49:27 PM GMT+1",Borough market for a bite on the go
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 10:36:05 AM GMT+1",M8 if london doesn’t have enough tourist attractions for you then you aren’t leaving your front room…
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:44:57 AM GMT+1","We just start walking and let ourselves get lost, eating at random places that look nice etc.

I never did any of the “tourist” stuff, and still it’s one of my favorite cities ever.

It has this charm you can’t find anywhere else."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 11:35:43 AM GMT+1",What hidden gems did you find?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 11:42:49 AM GMT+1",WHAT I live right next to London and when I have to go there for the day I can't find anything to do
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 10:25:06 PM GMT+1","London is considered 'basic' by some I guess, but damn. I've been to 60 countries and London is one of my favorite cities..."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:57:38 PM GMT+1","It’s just effortlessly fun. You can spend days just enjoying life across museums, parks, beautiful walks, pubs etc"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:16:46 AM GMT+1","Effortlessly fun is a stretch, it’s still a concrete jungle"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:56:18 PM GMT+1","Same, I loved London. Even my wife who doesn't care for cities had a great time. A very welcoming place to be, very fun too."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:48:02 AM GMT+1",These so called basic cities are my favourite places to visit.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 7:51:35 AM GMT+1",Same!
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 8:00:01 PM GMT+1","Do you have some favorite restaurants or pubs or ""must dos""?"
"Wednesday, July 12, 2023 at 11:25:58 PM GMT+1",I've been for the second time in my life in may. I normally don't like being in a city too much but London is just so cool. I love it.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:57:35 PM GMT+1",Same!
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:21:04 PM GMT+1",Always happy someone enjoyed our city. Hurry back!
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:00:10 PM GMT+1","Definitely will. Love it here! Also, you guys are the nicest & sweetest people I have ever encountered while traveling & I’ve been to many countries. It was a great time."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:15:09 PM GMT+1",Agreed. Nice to hear some positivity about our city. Usually all I get is I do not get why you live here etc. I think also people need to understand London is not just Westminster/Piccadilly etc. Lots of boroughs will different characters.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:25:53 PM GMT+1",Never a bad time in London Town
"Tuesday, October 10, 2023 at 7:33:34 AM GMT+1","London is my home and many people who live here like to hate on it or don't appreciate it. But as someone who has travelled to many different cities around the world I know how amazing this city is.

It has so much history, impressive architecture, lots of landmarks, many attractions, world class museums (that are free to enter), great theatre shows, beautiful parks, excellent public transport, a large variety of food options...I could go on.

Yes it's expensive and the weather can be gloomy at times but not many cities can offer as much as London can."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 5:36:44 PM GMT+1","I think people don’t like it for other reasons, like roadmen, stabbings, crime, weather, traffic etc"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:12:43 AM GMT+1",Yay I’m going in a couple weeks to London! Can’t wait
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 7:25:24 PM GMT+1",Enjoy!

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:20:04 PM GMT+1",
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 4:23:51 AM GMT+1",I love London. I think London >>> NYC every day. Even on a rainy soggy day.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:59:01 AM GMT+1",As an Aussie who has the biggest hard on for travelling America I agree with you. I’d pick London every single time over NYC
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 6:00:48 AM GMT+1","I'm from London, it's great! But NYC is next level. My favourite city for sure"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:39:58 PM GMT+1",Honestly there aren't any metropolitan US cities that even compare to London. It's awesome
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:54:27 AM GMT+1","That’s not a fair city to compare IMO. Tokyo and NYC maybe, but not London. Both are amazing"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:07:16 PM GMT+1",That’s insane. I went there and it did nothing for me :(
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:29:14 AM GMT+1",I think that says more about you than about London.

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:15:14 PM GMT+1",
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:33:24 PM GMT+1",London is definitely my favorite city.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:13:48 PM GMT+1",Same. I’d take it over Paris any day.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:42:27 PM GMT+1",Greatest city in the world
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:30:28 PM GMT+1",Best city you visited? I love London. Concrete playground and never got bored.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:39:47 PM GMT+1","One of the best, definitely in the top 3."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:21:44 PM GMT+1",What's your other 2 favourite cities?
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:25:52 PM GMT+1","Concrete playground

Just to point out 40% of London is green space. It has 3000 or so parks."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:51:23 PM GMT+1","As a native New Yorker, I can attest that London is the tits!!"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:26:58 PM GMT+1","I absolutely love London. It is the perfect city. Tons of different food, green spaces, god-tier public transit. I would immigrate to England in a heartbeat."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:38:13 PM GMT+1",I moved to london 7 years ago and the one thing I didn’t foresee is that it’s ruined traveling to other Western cities for me. This last year I was in Madrid and NYC and both times I missed London after a day and just wanted to go home lol
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:27:12 AM GMT+1",Enjoyed it last month while I was there. Wish the weather would have looked like yours
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:30:02 PM GMT+1",We've had great weather in the last month...
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:28:45 AM GMT+1","Been quite some time since my last trip to London but damn, I should check it out again in the near future. Truly got its own vibe"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:39:55 PM GMT+1",Oh to be in London one day! The dream 💗
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:53:36 PM GMT+1",My sister and I will be there in a couple of weeks! Any restaurant recommendations? Anything goes!
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:33:36 PM GMT+1","As a Londoner, here’s a few of my favourites to take non-London visitors: Dishoom for Iranian Indian, Goodman for a fantastic steak, Gloria for Italian, El Pastor for Mexican, Brat for Spanish, Ippudo for ramen, Kulu Kulu for cheap but amazing, no frills sushi, Yalla Yalla for Lebanese. Mum Likes Thai Food in Bethnal Green for the best pad Thai ever. Cha cha roll for sushi burritos."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 5:46:05 PM GMT+1","Definitely visit Camden Town Market. Huge indoor market with shopping and all the ethnic street food you can imagine. All of Camden Town was cool and covered in art and graffiti. I also enjoyed walking around Covent Garden, the uppity area in West End. There’s opera singers, live music, lots of cafés, and super pretty. Have fun."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:13:47 PM GMT+1","There are just too many options to recommend anything, go to the areas recommended on this thread and you’ll find loads also try Borough market."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:07:21 PM GMT+1","Borough Market is brilliant and right next to the Thames. A wonderful choice of places to eat and food to buy. You can walk all along the river there, seeing so many wonderful sights: Golden Hind replica, the Globe Theatre, Tate Modern, St Pauls, Houses of Parliament, Tower of London, etc, etc...."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:00:44 PM GMT+1",When are you and your sister going. Can we go together? i want to find a partner
"Saturday, July 8, 2023 at 1:41:05 AM GMT+1",You should know London better
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:19:51 PM GMT+1","I live there, I could give dozens of recommendations but it depends what you like, the most fun is finding them for yourself. Only recommendation is to avoid chains."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 8:12:22 PM GMT+1",Cheeky spoons
"Saturday, July 22, 2023 at 8:58:18 AM GMT+1","Lina Stores for some of the best pasta I've ever tasted! Bancone is another one. They make fresh pasta daily. Ah, there's always a highly rated restaurant in every block - trust the Google ratings!"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:13:28 AM GMT+1","I got a great burger on the Strand right by the Charing Cross tube exit a few years ago, and it was only 99p!

Seriously though, my favorite might've been Franco Manca pizza near Russell Square. Or maybe the fish and chips at North Sea Fish near the same area."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:00:44 AM GMT+1","Have a look at Fergus Henderson’s restaurants to see if you like the look of them. My personal favourite is Bread & Wine, ymmv but I’ve had some of the best restaurant meals of my life there."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:11:22 AM GMT+1",God I adore that city.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:09:19 PM GMT+1",Same.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:23:57 PM GMT+1","Just got back from London. Loved it. Was sad to leave! I live on the other side of the world, so it'll be hard to get back there."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:29:33 PM GMT+1",The absolute funniest part of London to me was turning around from that lovely view of Big Ben and the Eye to see… Shrek’s London Adventure
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:36:54 PM GMT+1",London is awesome. I think I might retire there
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:22:24 PM GMT+1","I’m going at the end of August, im so excited!! Any recs?"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:08:05 PM GMT+1","Lots of my friends live in London so I visit often, we once did this text ""treasure hunt"" that was so much fun and takes you walking through some iconic places and cozy side streets. You start in a location and you are texted your first clue, you have to look around you to figure it out then text the answer back to get the next clue. Sometimes you even had to interact with bar staff /others to get clues!

I can't remember the exact company but it was something like this www.inthehiddencity.com/london-treasure-hunt

If you are able bodied and up for a lot of walking I'd absolutely recommend it!

Also I think it's worth having a drink in the shard to take in the views, you don't have to book and can just queue for a table. There were 3 of us last time we did this and we shared a bottle of wine, it was £40 so pricey, but between 3 it wasn't too bad and the views are breathtaking, especially the view from the toilets!"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:21:15 AM GMT+1",same! i had very high expectations and still exceeded them! loved london
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:17:42 AM GMT+1",How's London in late December? Still a good time to visit and explore?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:32:33 AM GMT+1","It’s dark and cold, but with the run up to Christmas there’s loads of things happening and everyone is in good spirits."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:46:34 PM GMT+1","I live in London sand sadly, December is not the best time. The sun goes down at around 4pm and the weather is quite miserable. Fortunately there are lots of free museums and pubs you can visit to stay warm and still have a great time! Also if you like Xmas there’s all the lights in regents street and winter wonderland. Enjoy the big smoke!"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:06:04 PM GMT+1","Yup, definitely.

September is your purgatory,

Christmas is your heaven,

When the stinking streets of summer,

Are washed away by rain,

At the dark end of a lonely street,

That's where you lose your pain,

'Tis then your eyes light up my love,

And sparkle once again

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:16:36 PM GMT+1","It’s actually ‘thrice’ although not used much in the U.K. any more. Trice comes from the phrase ‘in a trice’, which means ‘an instant’. The US uses ‘thrice’ more than we do. I think that’s what you mean. Pedantic speech over."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:36:17 PM GMT+1","Mine too. I never had any particular interest in London but was transiting through it, twice, so decided I really should spend some time there. I absolutely loved it and actually went back a few years later."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:17:50 PM GMT+1",England was fantastic
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:39:16 PM GMT+1",I was born and grew up in London. Still my fave big city in the world! So much to see and do and so many green spaces and nice food to be enjoyed
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:29:32 PM GMT+1","London is amazing. I’d move there in a heartbeat if I had a chance, a good job offer, and a good salary"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:44:10 PM GMT+1",Did you have Indian food while you were there?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:38:33 AM GMT+1",Most definitely. It was amazing. I love how much veg and vegan places they have here.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:51:53 AM GMT+1",I was there recently and I loved it! I would move there in a second if I could.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:12:01 PM GMT+1",might be going in winter can’t wait!!!
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:24:42 PM GMT+1",I think we can travel together from September to November
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:51:25 PM GMT+1","Yep. Love London, my future home.

Top 3 best cities imo together with Dublin and Rome."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:03:53 AM GMT+1","I loved it, but I could only do one day of the touristy stuff. It was insanely busy. Wandering around Shoreditch was more my speed."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:04:19 AM GMT+1",Sticky toffee pudding was the highlight no doubt
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:28:44 PM GMT+1",Simply beatiful. My dream is to visit England one day.

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 7:58:57 PM GMT+1","We went to Heddon Street Kitchen, it’s a Gordon Ramsay restaurant which was a super cool experience."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:11:29 PM GMT+1",I was just there last week :)
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:30:30 PM GMT+1","As cool as the city is, please for the love of god, explore the Heath! And Richmond Park is fantastic as well. Doesn't matter what time of year."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:33:36 PM GMT+1",Thanks for the tip. Will most definitely go there the next time around.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:50:37 PM GMT+1","Beautiful pics, I definitely want to go back"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:21:09 PM GMT+1","London is my favorite city in the world. I did an internship there a decade back, and I truly wish I had had my wits about me to turn it into a full time job.

I'm taking my husband in a couple months, and I cannot wait to show him everything."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:15:08 AM GMT+1","London is a truly amazing city. I've been to lots of cities, none have matched London yet for me and I don't see how any will."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:01:41 AM GMT+1","Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee Pudding

I'll approve that"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 2:29:33 AM GMT+1",Westminster Abbey is one of the most interesting places I’ve ever been! Walked around in awe for about 2 hours. That and the pubs were my favorite part of my time there!
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:05:47 AM GMT+1","Was Bing Ben ringing? We were there last year and it still wasn't :(

Great shots btw"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 2:42:19 AM GMT+1","It wasn’t :( Thanks, the city is beyond picturesque & easy to photograph. The pics don’t do it justice though."

Wasn't that the strip club on The Sopranos?"

"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:22:40 AM GMT+1",London is always a good choice!
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 9:10:27 AM GMT+1",London is the best
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 4:08:21 PM GMT+1","Parts of London reminded me so much of Boston. Which tracks, of course, but it was cool to see it in person. I wasn’t there nearly long enough."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 6:31:36 PM GMT+1","Boston was definitely the most « European city » I visited in the US, it reminded of Dublin a bit."

"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:39:13 AM GMT+1",Went last summer and miss it so much
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:03:30 PM GMT+1",Probably my favorite big city. The museums there are a treasure.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:16:16 AM GMT+1",So many beautiful pictures but I'm salivating over the look of that beef wellington
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:04:51 PM GMT+1","Thanks! That is Gordon Ramsay’s’ famous Beef Wellington, the one dish that causes so much drama in Hell’s Kitchen. The service at his restaurant is snooty but kids eat free & the food is great."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:15:55 PM GMT+1",Going in August can’t wait
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:15:23 AM GMT+1",One of my favorite cities!
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:06:15 AM GMT+1","Same. My first time there last April and I wasn't expecting to enjoy the food so much. I thought I'd be eating fish and chips all day, which I don't mind, but London is a melting pot of different cultures and the variety of food choices is overwhelming."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:38:14 AM GMT+1","In my opinion, London's royal heritage, stylish appeal, distinctiveness, rich history, and seamless blend of tradition and modernity make it the most beautiful city in the world, particularly as a megapolis. It is a place where the past seamlessly intertwines with the present, creating a cityscape that is both awe-inspiring and enchanting."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:40:04 AM GMT+1",I've been to London more than 6 times i think. On my this year's visit i absolutely wanted to see The phantom of the opera. And so i did!
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 2:03:27 AM GMT+1",How?
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:08:52 AM GMT+1",great photos. Thanks.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:26:11 AM GMT+1",London is incredible. It's the biggest city in Europe and you could spend a month there and hardly scratch the surface.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:53:59 AM GMT+1","As someone who lives in London, can I ask what particularly u liked? All the pictures just look so normal to me since walk around it all day. It's so weird to hear u describe the place I live the same way I would describe probably somewhere close to where u live. I'm glad u enjoyed my city tho"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 7:10:55 AM GMT+1",You just reminded me I didn’t even get a beef Wellington when in UK ffs
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:26:47 AM GMT+1",Looks pretty gay
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 10:45:52 AM GMT+1",The Mrs and I went for 6 days just a month ago. We both loved London. Will definitely be going back.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 11:42:25 AM GMT+1","I've lived here twice in my life, and both times I dreaded leaving. Miss just having the freedom to take public transport, walk and enter a random museum.

Maybe, sometime in the future, I will be fortunate enough to enter another museum."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:07:33 PM GMT+1","my hubby and I went there a month ago, it was his first time in London, and my 4th time as I just love it. Now he fell in love with it too, and we are both open to move there eventually if possible at some point. :)"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 12:10:40 PM GMT+1","I’m visiting next week. Your pics got me excited, thanks for sharing! How’s the weather right now?"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:29:06 PM GMT+1","Central London is definitely a must see, although like every major city the further you go from central the worse it gets. Richmond and Twickenham are beautiful places, but Hounslow not so much."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:55:27 PM GMT+1",Good pictures.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 6:43:22 PM GMT+1","Can I ask what your favorite parts were? The uk has always been at the bottom of my list for travel destinations but I’m trying to convince myself it’s worth going to

Edit to add, I like traveling to experience wildly different cultures than what I’m used to (I want extreme culture shock), being American, and England just doesn’t seem like the kind of place that would give me any sort of culture shock. Like the top of my list right now, even though it’ll never happen sadly, would be to visit Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia, etc."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 7:25:30 PM GMT+1","I'm not the OP but London is along with NYC the top city in the world. The sheer amount of things to see, do, eat and experience is staggering. I'd say it has a slight edge over NYC due to its 2000 year history. Most of its museums are even free, which is remarkable."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 9:40:11 PM GMT+1","Where were you from, how low were your expectations! That’s not even the nice parts, that’s my old commute where we keep the tourists restricted to! Seriously though, London is a gem if you know where to look and most of the highlights are only 100m from the touristy areas TBH."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 11:03:17 PM GMT+1",I’m from all over & my expectations were super low. I guess I just envisioned it much differently. I was proven 100% wrong & hope to see more next time.
"Saturday, July 8, 2023 at 4:21:06 AM GMT+1",Would anyone mind sharing what they enjoyed most about London? Things to do or see?
"Sunday, July 16, 2023 at 8:41:41 AM GMT+1",The most x thing I ever saw

"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 10:52:43 PM GMT+1","For anyone planning a trip to London and wants a fun, educational and scary experience - do the London Bridge Experience and Tombs."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 5:19:21 AM GMT+1",Did you plan your own trip or did you have help? Planning a family trip next summer and I don't know where to start.
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 8:18:15 PM GMT+1","Awww it’s J. Sheekey! Very good, old school seafood place."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:36:38 PM GMT+1","I think this is the first picture I’ve seen of parliament and the clock tower all cleaned up.

Did they only complete the restoration and cleaning of one side? The second picture of the other side of the parliament building looks much darker."
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 9:51:46 PM GMT+1",How the hell did you get that photo from INSIDE the gate at Buckingham?
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:06:28 PM GMT+1","Lovely looking Wellington, where did you eat that ?"
"Thursday, July 6, 2023 at 11:54:50 PM GMT+1","First pic: turn the grey up to 11

It's like the dementors have been at it"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 1:14:31 AM GMT+1",The second visit is even more fun because you know some common places so you can skip them and focus on the other beautiful places.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 2:03:46 AM GMT+1","I love London. I'm Scottish so not down there much. For many summers I've found myself leading 150 English language kids around Westminster at noon in 25C heat. It's nuts, and I'm sure people hate that, but my point is, even in that insane circumstance, I still loved London. I do all the touristy stuff every time, but all the different villages and vibes are my favourite. From Camden to SoHo, Shoreditch. I lived in Tooting for 2 months and even that was great to me. It's all so varied."
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 3:05:21 AM GMT+1",I would love to visit
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 4:04:13 AM GMT+1","Any recd for hotels, neighborhoods you liked staying in?"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 4:27:36 AM GMT+1","I'm from Canada. Grew up in Montreal, lived couple of years in Toronto and many years in Vancouver where my family lives. I also lived in Spain and spent lots of time in the US as well. I'm saying all this because the first time I visited London, I was in awe. The vibe, the history.....I was mesmerized by it.

Have visited the city several times and just love it. The way I see it, London is the only European city that rivals New York. I love it!"
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 7:18:20 AM GMT+1",Ah. The beauty that centuries of colonial money can buy.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 8:21:37 AM GMT+1",Yes indeed. I have walked many lonodn attractions: If you want to see the beauty of london? https://www.youtube.com/@walkaroundtheworld7851/featured
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 9:05:39 AM GMT+1",I'm so happy you had a great time! I'm not exactly from London but I'm from the south east and I feel quite protective of it when everyone says it's awful :((.
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 10:13:22 AM GMT+1",So many cities around the world just look and feel the same
"Friday, July 7, 2023 at 10:46:26 AM GMT+1","we londoners deffo take it for granted. Walk past so many London landmarks without batting an eyelid as they're just so 'normal' to me now. Who can relate?

I actually hate going into central london now - way too many people around."

"Sunday, July 16, 2023 at 8:06:58 PM GMT+1","I completely resonate with your sentiments. When I visited London, it also greatly exceeded my expectations. The rich history, diverse culture, and the bustling energy of the streets create an atmosphere that's truly unparalleled. Every corner of the city seems to have a story to tell, and it certainly left an indelible mark on my memories."
"Sunday, July 16, 2023 at 9:20:06 PM GMT+1",Can’t wait to be there next year 🤩😻

The Thames is beautiful to walk along especially at the forks.

Downtown dundas/Richmond area has three great used bookstores. And one of the biggest comic book stores in Canada!

There’s about 5-6 tvs where you can play Nintendo games from different eras, so on busy nights those get taken fast.. some people stay long, some just play a level and move on. There’s retro pinball by tile door, a lot of retro arcade cabinets, modern pinball and bar games at the back and a few multi-game tables up by the bar where it’s easy to have a two player game. It’s very busy, if not one of the busier bars when bars are usually busy."

"Thursday, August 11, 2022 at 10:04:08 PM GMT+1","When my husband and I visited my sister who lives there she took us to Banting House, which my husband loved as a doctor and a Type 1 Diabetic, it was one of those ""must see"" for him. I also quite loved it and would recommend it to almost anyone

We also went to this free museum near/at the airport Jet Aircraft or something. You need to book a private tour but it runs by donation and was so fascinating and really, really cool.

We also went to the Covent Market and another market- Western something or other, which I love because I love that sort of stuff

She also took us to some entertainment building place- I think thats where we did a medical hall of fame for my dork doctor husband, and we did an escape room (I think both were in the same place). I can't remember but it's like cereral lane or some street like that... I may also be misremembering part of this but the Medical museum was really fun and so was the escape room.

We also did a Bingo Game of all the places in London that are references to real London, which was a fun way to throughout the city."

Walk through the trails at Cavendish. You might get lucky and see an Eagle or Spiny Softshell Turtle!

Visit Urban Roots Farm market right off Highbury and Hamilton Road. Mmm veggies

Storm Stayed Brewery after visiting the Coves.

Picnic under the old trees in Gibbons Park.

Depending on the length of stay, may be worth the drive making a day trip out to Grand Bend or Port Stanley for the play at the beach, shop souvenirs and try out local eats/treats.

East Park is a decent water park, has a wave pool and a few water slides, a splash pad for the kids… also has go-carting, batting cages, mini-golf, arcade.. etc.

There’s also a few more public pools in London that may be worth checking out."

tilt arcade bar is fun if you’re a fan of video games, especially some more retro arcade games.

If they’re a fan of art then you can check out museum london or some of the art galleries around town — personally I’m a fan of mcintosh gallery, mostly because of convenience (it’s in the middle of Western’s campus), and I liked the westland gallery on wortley. I haven’t checked out other ones yet though.

And if you’re already at museum london then you can take a walk by the river as well.

there are some other museums you can check out depending on interests, you could check out what they have here and see if there’s anything or interest

if they like books then I really like wandering around the bookstores in downtown.

You can also check if any events are happening downtown

you can also check out 100 kellogg lane, there’s a fair amount of things you could do there."

"Sunday, June 4, 2023 at 3:54:31 PM GMT+1","Tried Ikoyi in March 2022 (pre-hike) and really loved it. Akoko in November at £55 offered an exceptional value lunch tasting for similar west African (not quite as good as Ikoyi but far superior value given the Ikoyi hike).

Loved Bao too!"
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 3:55:29 PM GMT+1","Personal favourites (fine dining and not) include:

Nest (Hackney) - monthly tasting menu themed around one ingredient

SoLa (Soho) - American-inspired fine dining

Hunan (Pimlico) - Chinese, no-menu small plates, and lots of them

Shack-Fuyu (Soho) - fun and tasty pan-Asian (but mostly Japanese-inspired). Go to their bottomless brunch

Padella - tasty fresh pasta, no frills

Officina 00 - fresh pasta, slightly more frills, try the fried ravioli

Lina Stores - more fresh pasta, I particularly like their 32 egg yolk tagliolini"
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 4:46:23 PM GMT+1","Dinner - Mandarin Oriental
Hawksmoor or Goodman for steaks"
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 8:21:35 PM GMT+1","Some amazing reccos on this thread - I’d also throw into the mix Leroy, Orasay, Maene, Café Cecilia, Perilla, Lisboeta, Luca, Black Axe Mangal, Straker’s."

"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 2:22:37 PM GMT+1",Incredible meal at Akoko recently!
"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 11:28:03 PM GMT+1",loved our meal at the clove club late last year. dinner by HB was a snoozefest but super cheap and can be done very quickly which is nice
"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 11:30:50 PM GMT+1",But did u get filled up at clove club? Theres availability for me there but judging by the reviews it looks good and is “fine dining” but are u stuffed? The plates look minimal
"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 11:37:49 PM GMT+1","yes it was enough food. I believe 3 canapés followed by 6-7 savories, palate cleanser, dessert and petit fours. I wanna say they refilled the bread so that helped but not positive. I have the meal saved as a highlight on my IG if interested

in a week with 14 stars it was my second or third favorite meal (7 tasting menus)"
"Sunday, June 4, 2023 at 11:28:33 PM GMT+1","Wouldn’t have wanted any more food, yes. And it’s up there with the very best."
"Sunday, September 17, 2023 at 4:25:06 PM GMT+1","I left London a few years ago but there was one year when I tried 52 different cuisines in one year. Most places are still open. Get some inspiration

"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 6:41:43 PM GMT+1","Goodman for steaks, Nest for low priced tasting menu and Da terra for the high end option, best tasting menu imo"
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 7:09:36 PM GMT+1","A few to add to the mix (all sorts):

Speedboat Bar Thai

Smoking Goat

Tom’s Pasta

Cornerstone

The Frog

Dumplings Legend"
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 7:45:57 PM GMT+1",Loved Bao. Went to the Soho one a few weeks back and it's definitely one I'd visit again. Great quick lunch option if you work in the area I imagine.
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 9:38:42 PM GMT+1",Speedboat bar is quite possibly the most egregious ripoff in London. You'll feel right in Thailand as a Western tourist if you go there because they are going to charge you 15 pounds for a literal Iceland microwave curry and 11 pounds for a bowl of microwaved rice. They have mega expensive but low quality cocktails and half pint beers for 5 pounds. Then they'll try and give you another table's bill that's twice as much as your table's. It's the most insidious tourist trap shit in Soho. How can anyone think it's a good place when literally everything about it is garbage..
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 10:17:03 PM GMT+1","Someone had a bad experience….😂. I thought it was great, super authentic to Bangkok Chinatown and it’s had some great reviews too. Obviously you pay considerably more than you would in Bangkok, but food was fantastic and having an ice cold Singha beer with some fiery Thai food is hard to beat!"
"Saturday, June 3, 2023 at 11:35:35 AM GMT+1","Yeah, I was there about a month ago and genuinely one of the worst bar experiences in London. I obviously don't expect Bangkok prices but they seriously charge 11 pounds for a bowl of microwave rice, and the curries are exactly the same as those cheap Iceland curries that used to cost 1.5 pounds when I was a student.

Then they tried to give us another table's bill for like 150 pounds when ours was supposed to be around 50 then the waiter tried to aggressively upsell us on dessert. He was so hostile we had to call the manager, which is probably the first time I had to do it at any bar or restaurant this decade.."
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 8:13:50 PM GMT+1","Hām in West Hampstead has been my favourite London restaurant that's slightly off the beaten path lately. Here's some pictures from when I went there a few months back. It's in the guide but not starred, I reckon if they added a tasting menu and one or two flourishes they would get one soon.

A shame you have your curry sorted as I was going to suggest Paradise in Soho. It's an incredible Sri Lankan spot if you do fancy a slight deviation."
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 8:25:15 PM GMT+1",I want to go to paradise! Its highly likely ill go anyway forat lunch at least
"Friday, June 2, 2023 at 8:46:53 PM GMT+1","For Indian, we really enjoyed Trishna."
"Monday, June 5, 2023 at 9:58:54 AM GMT+1","I'd pick Bibi over Gymkhana, but both are sensational. Bibi is just that bit more exciting and innovative.

Brutto is excellent. As are any of the Noble Rots (which I'd pick over St John).

One more great option, also from the JKS folks is Berekjak. Both the food and the vibe at the original Soho branch are brilliant."
"Thursday, June 22, 2023 at 10:28:41 PM GMT+1","Barrafina hasn't been mentioned, so I'll add that. Bocca di Lupo, too."
